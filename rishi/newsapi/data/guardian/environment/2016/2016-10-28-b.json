  "<p>Few social situations can be more fraught than a costume party. What if you\u2019re the only person who dresses up? What if you\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t?

My school was almost breathtakingly monocultural and white: I was one of three Asian kids in the entire year level, and there were no black students whatsoever. </p> <p>This made it a problem when my teachers decided we were going to perform as Aboriginal people for the school\u2019s talent showcase. Every year level had a different act, and my grade\u2019s involved slathering on jars of school-issued black body paint over our semi-naked forms and singing Carra Barra Winna Canna, a song we assumed was Indigenous, written by a man named Rolf Harris, who we assumed was Aboriginal.</p> <p>We were wrong about Rolf Harris \u2013 on this, and on so many other things. </p> <p>As an adult who now knows better, I unreservedly apologise, especially to Indigenous Australians. And to anyone who asks me what are the dangers in not having cultural diversity in workplaces, schools and on media, all I need to do is show them the photo. <em>Benjamin Law</em></p> <h2>James Hennessy: Everyone had dressed as me</h2> <p>Last year, I made the crucial error of changing my Twitter avatar to a photo of myself throwing a quasi-ironic shaka on a beach in California while wearing sunglasses and a breezy grey singlet.</p> <p>After being mercilessly and deservedly ribbed for my blunder, I thought I was out of the woods. Lo and behold, my friends had decided to stage a Halloween party where everyone dressed as said photo \u2013 grey singlet, sunglasses, shorts and tattoos included. It promptly went viral online, and I\u2019m still copping it a year later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29a3667858ecb02880e606a642f7bf3397b0e5cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29a3667858ecb02880e606a642f7bf3397b0e5cd/0_0_576_623/462.png\" alt=\"James Hennessy's worst Halloween yet\" width=\"462\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s absolutely a moral here: trust no one \u2013 especially not your friends.

I figured he must have been en route to the same party as I was. So I asked him, \u201cHey mate, you going to the Henno party? Where is it?\u201d Turns out he had no idea who Henno was; that was just his regular <a>Saturday night</a> attire.</p> <p>My failure to dress up appropriately meant that the now infamous, viral Hennoween pic is whiter than the set of Sunrise. But the thing I\u2019m most bitter about? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oz_f/status/660400073973436416\">The pic I took</a> was way better than the one that rocketed around the world.

We had been living in Sao Paulo for a few months, and life was pretty good, but we were young and didn\u2019t have much money so I always felt a little like a fraud among the fashion/art scene people of Brazil. This was highlighted most spectacularly at a party Vogue hosted.</p> <p>The invitations were of course in Portuguese, but we understood them to a point. The dress code said \u201cBlack Tie or Fancy Dress\u201d. I didn\u2019t have a tuxedo so was reluctant to go, but my wife was keen to make a good impression and encouraged me to go for the fancy dress option. I figured it would be fun and to be honest we didn\u2019t give it that much thought \u2013 we were from London, we went to loads of parties, we were used to this sort of thing.</p> <p>I opted for a pirate outfit: cut-off jeans, flip flops, and a hook hand and sword I had purchased from a local toy store a few hours before the party. Eye liner, eye patch, bandana. My wife wore a beautiful vintage ball gown. Ready to go.</p> <p>The party was held at Hotel Unique, a huge modernist luxury hotel and it was hosted by Naomi Campbell. Gilberto Gil was performing. We turned up on the red carpet, and not being celebrities we were of little interest to the paparazzi, but I did feel we had a certain presence and caught the eye. We entered.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying all 600 people turned and looked at me, but it did feel like that. The editor of Vogue rushed towards us. \u201cWhat are you doing ? Why are you dressed as a pirate? And why are you wearing flip flops to this party?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in fancy dress. On the invitation it said Black Tie or Fancy Dress \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? No, no, no. Black Tie or Dress Fancy \u2013 wear your finest clothes, or expensive robes. Not \u2018Fancy Dress\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I pointed at guy dressed as a Sheikh. \u201cWhat about that guy, he\u2019s dressed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s an actual Sheikh.\u201d</p> <p>On closer inspection, his robes were made of fine golds and luxury materials. We exchanged a nod of mutual respect (that\u2019s how I saw it).</p> <p>It actually worked out well; I brought a smile to faces, and got talking to lots of different people. We even met Naomi Campbell, who thought it was hilarious.</p> <h2>Lauren Hogan Ross: I pretended I genuinely misunderstood the invitation</h2> <p>A girl I knew in Year 12 threw a themed 18th birthday party: \u201cBritney Spears meets 1920s\u201d. Since I am a human in this world, I was sure this was the worst <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/now-theres-sexy-ken-bone-its-really-time-we-ditched-the-sexy-halloween-costume\">sexy kitten syndrome</a> theme ever, so instead arrived in an elaborate homemade dinosaur costume which took days to plan and construct: an elegant combination of green felt, faux fur and cardboard, with large spines attached to suspender braces and a sewn-together green bonnet.</p> <p>I pretended I genuinely misunderstood the invitation and was asked to leave. I then pretended I misunderstood the instruction and stayed. </p> <p>I regret nothing. <em>Lauren Hogan Ross</em></p> <h2>Rob Hinds: I just went full corpse paint</h2> <p>I was supposed to help a friend out for a photo shoot of heavy metal fans. I think she figured I\u2019d just show up wearing one of my Metallica T-shirts and a jacket, but I just went full corpse paint.

This required, amongst other things, purple face paint. While I swear to you I bought the brightest shade that that accursed store had, the paint still looked darker than I\u2019d thought possible; it also didn\u2019t help that the party was very dimly lit.<br></p> <p>So yes, I turned up, late to a party I was co-hosting, apparently in blackface.

I thought about what really scared me, and landed on the people involved in the infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2015/dec/11/cronullas-day-of-infamy-the-2005-race-riots-in-pictures\">2005 Cronulla race riots</a>.</p> <p>It was ease of assembly that sealed the deal: Australian flags, fake tattoos and green and gold zinc are pretty easy to come by on short notice. It was six or seven years after the riots, and I\u2019m a quick-to-laugh, gregarious kind of person, so the idea that anyone would confuse me with an actual bloodthirsty hooligan honestly didn\u2019t cross my mind. If anything, I thought I might get the odd high-five in solidarity against racism!</p> <p>The party was bigger than I expected and drew a wide cross-section of Sydney folk. \u201cPatriotic Australian,\u201d people would guess, only to quickly move on when they saw \u201cfuck off, we\u2019re full\u201d scrawled along my arm.</p> <p>On one side of the spectrum I was upsetting people who were rightly disheartened by the riots; on the other, I was pissing off rioter-sympathisers. Everyone in between just wanted to cut loose with reckless abandon, and my downer costume wasn\u2019t helping. </p> <p>In the wee hours of the morning, a guy tapped me on the shoulder. \u201cThat is a really, really good costume.\u201d He didn\u2019t high five me though, so I\u2019m still chalking this one up as a fail. <em>Niki Aken</em></p> <h2><strong>Adam Tingay: I crumbed myself</strong></h2> <p>The theme was nice and broad: \u201c\u2019Tis a silly place\u201d.

At the time, my friends and I were engaged in a constant battle of oneupmanship \u2013 who could go to the most extreme lengths? </p> <p>I realised my costume may not have hit the sardonic mark I was going for when I saw the other partygoers dressed in pyjamas, ugly wigs, garbage bags, bad \u201880s powersuits and ill-fitting bikinis. Two of the parents at the party pointed, scowled and shook their heads at my from across the room. </p> <p>I apologise unreservedly, and if you happen to be reading this and have any photos of me from that night, please, for the love of god, delete them.</p>",

Within a few minutes, the bird will mingle with the other geese. Davy\u2019s only worry was that they may not find their parents again.</p> <p>Snow geese migrate about a few thousand miles to reach the sanctuary, the Coast Reporter wrote.

  "<p>The Australian newspaper has run a curious item in recent times headlined \u201cMeanwhile, in Victoria\u201d. It contains stories about everyday state issues, but it also runs quirky items the paper thinks sets Victoria apart as somewhat of an oddity.<br></p> <p>In many ways, Victoria <em>is </em>an oddity. Daniel Andrews\u2019 government is unashamedly leftwing at a time when Australians are more familiar with Labor governments run by the party\u2019s right. We are used to a virtual Labor unity ticket with conservative governments about what economic responsibility means. And we have come to expect Labor to take modest steps on social issues that don\u2019t push the boundaries too far \u2013 it would have been courageous for Labor to support same-sex marriage a decade ago; it is not now. </p> <p>The Andrews government is in trouble over its poor handling of the never-ending Country Fire Authority dispute, and there are constant challenges over infrastructure priorities and growing worries about crime. But on social issues, its progress has been spectacular, and so far it appears not in the least wobbly in the face of a predictable backlash. </p> <p>Interest groups that have lobbied for years on gender and LGBTI issues in particular are finding a receptive government determined to make big leaps, to change the culture in fundamental ways.</p> <p>Will it succeed? Perhaps to an extent, but you can\u2019t accuse it of not trying. Is the government ahead of public opinion? Most certainly in some areas, particularly for people living outside the inner city for whom heteronormativity is not discussed routinely around the dinner table. No doubt there will be missteps and over-reaches \u2013 and too much trendy jargon \u2013 but you can\u2019t accuse it of complacency. </p> <p>The government\u2019s latest initiative is the <a href=\"http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/health/Pages/respectrel.aspprogram\">Resilience, Rights and Respectful Relationships</a> program that will be mandatory for all school levels in government and Catholic schools from next year. Independent schools can use it if they wish. </p> <p>That the government scrapped religious instruction in state schools in favour of a respectful relationship curriculum took some chutzpah. The program was recommended by Victoria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/royal-commission-into-family-violence\">royal commission into family violence</a>, which itself was a bold inquiry, followed up by considerable government funding. </p> <p>Respectful relationship classes in schools are having a moment. At the Coag family violence summit on Friday, the premiers of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania all spoke about programs under way or being implemented. Yet they come nowhere close to Victoria\u2019s almost $22m commitment over two years. In Victoria, the program is mandatory, comprehensive and firmly feminist in approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/31/i-hadnt-realised-how-absolutely-pervasive-family-violence-is-royal-commissioner\">'I hadn't realised how absolutely pervasive family violence is': royal commissioner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government says Respectful Relationships \u201cis about tackling family violence\u201d \u2013 it is stated as its primary purpose. That is a shame because, while there is lots of evidence that attitudes towards women are linked to intimate-partner violence, there is lots of evidence, too, indicating that other factors are also crucial, especially in advanced countries such as Australia. And perhaps it might have been useful to focus on preventing violence generally instead of violence against women. But those debates can be had again and again, and don\u2019t diminish the program\u2019s strengths.</p> <p>The family violence prevention group, <a href=\"http://www.ourwatch.org.au/\">Our Watch</a>, is an advocate for respectful relationship programs in schools as one way to reduce domestic violence and it has found its champion in the Victorian government. Our Watch has acknowledged that this approach is an experiment. Few countries have taken such a generational approach, to put together a program to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/19/australians-are-being-told-that-gender-inequality-is-the-root-cause-of-domestic-violence-but-is-it\">transform cultural attitudes towards women</a> specifically to reduce violence against women.</p> <p>Is it worth a go? Of course. We can\u2019t just keep responding to family violence with more laws, police powers and refuges, as important as they are. We need a big shift, a cultural breakthrough, to stop men beating up their wives and partners \u2013 and killing them in alarming numbers (and of course that applies to men being assaulted by their partners or ex-partners).</p> <p>And not only do we want them to stop happening; we want them to become culturally unthinkable. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448308/\">There is evidence</a> that well-designed school programs can reduce relationship violence for young people, who are more likely to be victims of violence than older people. </p> <p>There is worrying research, too, suggesting that many young people are holding on to antiquated ideas. One 2014 study found that a quarter of young people still believe that women who often say no to sex really mean yes. Victim blaming \u2013 maybe the woman provoked the violence \u2013 is still too common, and somehow, these views have to change.</p> <p>The release of the curriculum has led to some headlines in Victoria, of course, as superficial as they are predictable. The Herald Sun\u2019s resident warrior against social justice warriors, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/rita-panahi/rita-panahi-on-safe-schools-and-gender-diversity-programs-in-schools/news-story/4d3d02c39f2d7a7f015e3c6c3796a567\">Rita Panahi, wrote that it was</a> the \u201ctype of ideologically driven sloppy thinking that belongs in a socialist alliance get-together, not in schools\u201d.</p> <p>You can pluck out a line or two that might make it look so. But look deeper. It\u2019s much more than a program to reduce violence against women, as vital as that is. It just might help our kids \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 to learn critical life skills. To be more resilient in the face of setbacks, protect themselves and others from harm, cope with challenges of modern life and respect each other\u2019s differences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/i-wrote-the-safe-schools-lgbti-program-tony-abbott-its-vital-and-it-changes-lives\">I wrote the Safe Schools program Tony Abbott. It's vital and it changes lives | Chris Bush</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children in early primary school will talk about their emotions, learn relaxation techniques to cope with stress, about how to talk to themselves positively when they get angry or frustrated. They will start to learn about problem solving and when to ask for help if they need it.</p> <p>And they begin to think about gender stereotypes that are already embedded by the time they reach school. This is as relevant for boys as it is for girls. The materials for older students point out that young men experience violence at higher rates than young women, and that boys are especially vulnerable to being teased or bullied if they are not typically \u201cmale\u201d, especially if they are gay or transgender.</p> <p>For the little kids, it\u2019s about what\u2019s your favourite ice cream, what\u2019s your favourite playground game, or your favourite quiet time activity. Can boys and girls like different things? The same thing? It even throws in the old chestnut \u2013 is it OK for a boy to like pink and a girl to like blue? Why?</p> <p>In older year levels, the program introduces more complex ideas. By year 11 and 12, it\u2019s full on. How to cope with the stresses of study and exams, how to set goals, positive psychology, relaxation techniques, how to handle conflict in relationships, alcohol abuse, looking out for his each other\u2019s safety at parties, and what the law says on sexual consent and sexting. </p> <p>None of this should be controversial. It can\u2019t be a bad thing for young adults to think about how invisible LGBTI people can feel if our language, culture and discussions assume that the only \u201cnormal\u201d thing is to be heterosexual. Or to think about why the word \u201cgirl\u201d is often used as an insult, or why women are under-represented in our parliaments and earn on average 17% less for doing the same work. And most importantly, how these things might be challenged.</p> <p>We have been talking about these things for so long, and while much has changed for women \u2013 and men \u2013 much has not. Gender stereotypes and expectations, reinforced by the media and advertising, are often limiting even though we have had discrimination laws in place for a generation.</p> <p>We are living through a time of big social change, an impatient push by women, the LGBTI community and minority cultures for significant breakthroughs. It will take determined effort but despite pockets of resistance and the messiness of it all, many citizens are ready for it.</p> <p>It will be fascinating to see if this program shifts attitudes and reduces violence. We will only be able to tell if it persists for many years beyond the next election, and that is not assured \u2013 the Liberal opposition is muttering about \u201cbrainwash(ing) our children with propaganda\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the government steams on, at least so far.

If they upset one employer in the close-knit Korean community they fear being blacklisted by all employees as troublemakers.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cultural \u2013 there is not a culture of worker organisation in Korea.

Fewer than 10% speak English at home.<br></p> <p>The office of the fair work ombudsman says it has uncovered a string of cases involving exploitation of Korean workers over the past two years, dominated by \u201cpersistent underpayment\u201d of workers.</p> <p>Several migrant employers have told the ombudsman they undercut minimum wage rates because they paid agoing rate for overseas workers.</p> <p>The ombudsman, Natalie James, says the so-called \u201cgoing rate\u201d for overseas workers of any nationality is a myth that must be dispelled.<br></p> <p>James says it is illegal for employers to arbitrarily set and pay low, flat rates of pay, and that minimum wage rates apply to everyone in Australia \u2013 including visa holders \u2013 and are not negotiable.<br></p> <p>Last

Sainsbury\u2019s is understood to be still in talks, while Asda is thought to have brought in parent company Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, to add muscle to its negotiations. </p> <p>The Bradford-based Morrisons chain, however, appears to have given in to Unilever\u2019s demands and is now charging \u00a32.64 for a 250g jar of Marmite, up from \u00a32.35 previously.</p> <p>A spokesman for Morrisons said: \u201cSometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising although we do our best to avoid this.\u201d</p> <p>In the past two weeks, 92 of the 228 Unilever food lines stocked at Morrisons have gone up in price, while only 19 have been reduced, according to the Grocer trade journal, which cited data from market analysis firm Brand View.</p> <p>Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said suppliers were facing huge increases in costs on items such as packaging and all kinds of ingredients, from spices to fruit and vegetables, as the pound had fallen in value.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe writing is on the wall. Price increases have happened and will continue to happen across the board. Exchange rates are hammering everyone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One source said that Morrisons had no choice but to pass on price rises from Unilever to shoppers. Other industry insiders suggested the supermarket was making a political point \u2013 trying to highlight the pressure from Unilever by raising prices significantly on one of its most high-profile brands.</p> <p>Such was the furore over the pricing spat with Tesco  that sales of the spread soared 60% at the major supermarket chains in a spate of panic buying by fans, according to industry data analysts IRI.</p> <p>In a publicity stunt, Asda cut its 250g Marmite price to \u00a32. Tesco and Waitrose have so far kept their prices at \u00a32.35 and Sainsbury\u2019s has not moved from \u00a32.50.</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/british-shoppers-told-to-expect-price-rises-after-steep-fall-in-pound\">UK consumers have been told to brace themselves for price rises</a> in the coming months. A number of suppliers are understood to have approached supermarkets asking for cost increases to be covered. Earlier this month, KitKat owner <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/nestle-hints-at-price-rise-to-offset-weak-pound\">Nestl\u00e9 also admitted that prices were likely to have to rise</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, Somnath Saha, chief executive of Typhoo, told the BBC tea prices are set to rise. He said the firm\u2019s costs had gone up by between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000 a month and \u201cunfortunately the cost of a cup will go up\u201d.</p> <p>He said the tea firm\u2019s profits would take a hit: \u201cIn a year\u2019s time there will be an impact of \u00a33m on our bottom line. How can we sustain that? It is affecting us really badly. We are trying to do as much as we can to mitigate this cost but we are coming to a position now that costs need to be passed on.\u201d</p> <p>Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, warned earlier this month that supermarkets could not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were inevitable.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, supermarket bosses have said that they will try and protect shoppers from price rises, not least because they face rising competition from discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which undercut them on many basic goods.</p> <p>Most retailers buy their currency well in advance so that it will take time for foreign exchange rate changes to feed through. They are also benefiting from commodity price falls in some areas that are helping to offset the fall in the value of the pound. </p> <p>Tough competition from the discount chains has been driving prices down but there are signs the deflation is coming to an end. Market research group Kantar Worldpanel said grocery prices fell by an average 0.8% in the three months to 9 October, but this was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/tesco-increases-grocery-market-share-sales-rise\">the smallest drop in nearly two years</a>. </p>",

  "<p>The final chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/calais-france-rebukes-britain-over-abandoned-refugee-children\">Calais debacle </a>promises to be as depressing as those that preceded it. With around 1,500 teenage refugees still held in shipping containers on the smouldering site waiting for a decision on their future, French and British officials have embarked on a last-minute flurry of undignified diplomatic buck-passing over who should be responsible for them.</p> <p>For the past 18 months both governments have behaved appallingly in their failure to address the crisis; this disorganised denouement is merely the predictable continuation of the chaos that went before.</p> <p>The refusal of both governments to resolve what was (from a global refugee crisis perspective) a very small problem was startling. In the past year <a href=\"http://http//ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:First_time_asylum_applicants,_Q2_2015_%E2%80%93_Q2_2016.png\">1.4m asylum applications </a>have been made in Europe; 641,000 of them in Germany, 142,000 of them in Sweden. The scale of the Calais site should have been easily manageable.</p> <p>Instead the crisis was ignored and the camp became a uniquely horrific spot. With no proper water supplies, sewage systems or electricity and only second-hand tents for shelter, it felt worse than the worst slums of Mumbai, and yet it was overlooked by comfortable suburban houses, just half a kilometre from the town\u2019s cheerful zinc-countered bistros.</p> <p>Conditions were worse than in camps set up in disaster and war zones because of the absence of any mainstream charity or official French involvement in providing food or shelter for its 10,000-plus inhabitants. A network of grassroots charities stepped in to try to help; some were brilliant, some much less so. It was disturbing to see responsibility for providing food and shelter for thousands fall on the shoulders of volunteers.</p> <p>Refugees could not conceal their dismay when they arrived. The smell of burning plastic and raw sewage was overpowering. In the summer there were piles of fly-ridden, dead rats on the pathways. In the winter, families slept in wooden shacks that let in the rain. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/calais-france-rebukes-britain-over-abandoned-refugee-children\">Calais: France bows to pressure on abandoned refugee children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most striking was the large number of lone child refugees, dispatched by their parents to seek safety in Europe. British tabloids have raged with scepticism about the ages of the children and the motivations of their parents, but over the course of numerous trips over the past year I met dozens of children aged between 8 and 16, who had spent months living in total squalor, hoping to join relatives in the UK.</p> <p>Volunteers collected accounts of tear-gassing of children and documented cases of children hit by rubber bullets shot by riot police. But the bigger scandal was that hundreds of children were left to live in a water-logged field, some for over a year, with no help from the French or British governments.</p> <p>While both countries were languidly debating who should take responsibility, vulnerable asylum-seekers with family in the UK were taking matters into their own hands, and trying to get to Britain illegally; they risked their lives most nights trying to hurl themselves on to lorries, hiding in refrigerated containers \u2013 usually unsuccessfully, sometimes with fatal consequences.</p> <p>There is no memorial for the 14 refugees who died this year except the understated list kept by the local prefect\u2019s office \u2013 the file includes <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/15/very-scared-death-teenage-stowaway\">Raheemullah Oryakhel</a>, the 14-year-old from Afghanistan who died when he fell from a moving lorry and was hit by a car (the driver did not stop). It lists a \u201cmigrant whose sex could not be identified, found drowned in the port of Calais\u201d, an \u201cAfghan migrant 22 years, hit by an HGV on the A16\u201d, and an \u201c18-year-old female Eritrean found dead on the ring road near junction 47\u201d.<br></p> <p>Most of these deaths went unreported. When the Guardian wrote about Raheemullah\u2019s death, the coverage attracted some no longer surprising vitriol, with tweets commenting \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cOne less to worry about\u201d. One of the most dispiriting aspects of writing about the refugee crisis has been this exposure to the high-levels of public hostility to a group of people who have mostly spent the last year fleeing violence.</p> <p>While it is good that the British government has begun to accept some responsibility, the disparity in the numbers housed by the French (6,000), and the 274 children given shelter by the UK speaks for itself. The president of the local regional council, Xavier Bertrand, joined Bernard Cazeneuve, France\u2019s home office minister, in criticising the British response, describing it as insufficient. </p> <p>As work progresses swiftly on the \u00a31.9m UK and French co-funded one-kilometre-long wall, designed to stop a new Calais camp from forming, it would be nice to think that homes could be found for the remaining refugee children with equal speed and efficiency.</p>",

Now the focus should shift towards implementing this decision.\u201d</p> <p>It is not clear how the sulphur cap will be implemented or policed.</p> <p>No agreement was reached on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/shipping-progressives-call-for-industry-carbon-emission-cuts\">capping carbon dioxide emissions</a>. Shipping is a fast-growing source of greenhouse gases, projected to account for 17% of global emissions by 2050, though the industry has long been omitted from international agreements on climate change, including the UN\u2019s Paris accord signed last year and due to come into force next month.</p> <p>Instead, IMO members agreed to further monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions data from international shipping, with a view to drawing up an action plan to reduce them. But that plan is not likely to be implemented before 2023. The IMO first began to make plans to reduce emissions in 2003, yet little action has been taken. Shipowners and shipping companies want to guard any data they collect on fuel consumption, seeing it as a competitive issue.</p> <p>Sotiris Raptis, shipping officer at Transport and Environment, said: \u201cThis can in no way be seen as a proper response to the challenge laid down by the Paris climate agreement. The International Maritime Organisation is proposing to stall any action until 2023. The decision to delay by at least a further seven years any agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping constitutes an abject failure by national governments and the shipping industry.\u201d</p> <p>Jytte Guteland, a Socialist MEP, said the agreement was not enough: \u201cThe shipping sector must play its role in Europe\u2019s transition to a low-carbon society. Time is of the essence, and in the absence of IMO action, the EU must include ships\u2019 emissions in its 2030 climate target. By setting up a climate fund for shipping, Europe can help industry cut carbon in a cost-effective way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\">First deal to curb aviation emissions agreed in landmark UN accord</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP, added his support for unilateral action from the EU: \u201cInternational shipping is the only transport sector not contributing to climate goals in Europe. Since the IMO will not be considering, let alone proposing, any emissions reduction measures for many years to come, our duty is to make sure that Europe takes action.\u201d</p> <p>Both shipping and aviation have been excluded from international negotiations on climate change, partly due to the difficulty in allocating their emissions to a particular country, but also because of the reluctance of both industries \u2013 which continue to grow strongly as globalised trade increases \u2013 to submit to the international monitoring that climate change regulation requires.</p> <p>The aviation industry this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\">took its first steps toward reducing the impact of aircraft on the climate</a>. The International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed that airlines would have to offset some of their emissions by buying carbon credits, which require investment in carbon-reduction schemes such as growing new forests and installing new renewable energy. The shipping industry has been slower to adopt such measures.</p> <p>Shipping fuel is much heavier and thicker than aircraft fuel, and produces more greenhouse gases. Airlines have an economic incentive to use the lightest fuel possible, which can include biofuels derived from plants. But ships are capable of carrying the heavier, more polluting \u2013 and, crucially, cheaper \u2013 fuel on long voyages, so there is little economic incentive for the industry to change its practices.</p>",

Its figures showed that shoppers spent \u00a3700m less on clothing, shoes and accessories in the year to 25 September than they had during the previous 12 months.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/debenhams-targets-bhs-customers-with-new-lighting-departments\">Debenhams said its clothing</a> business had fared slightly better than the 4% decline seen across the market in the past six months as growth in holiday clothing, including swimwear, and outfits for special occasions rose, while sales of everyday clothing slid. \u201cMaybe gone are the days of just buying. You have got to really want something to buy,\u201d said Suzanne Harlow, the group\u2019s trading director.</p> <p>The weather has not been kind to fashion industry executives in recent years, with mild winters followed by erratic summer temperatures making it difficult to persuade Britons to update their wardrobes at the start of a new season.</p> <p>However, some of the malaise in spending was self-inflicted, said McCorquodale: \u201cFashion retailers have tried to straddle the seasons, but have not done a particularly good job of it. A lot of the fashion has just not been that inspirational.\u201d</p> <p>The cold snap earlier this month provided clothing chains with a much-needed boost, according to the weekly high street sales tracker produced by advisory firm BDO, which monitors the performance of mid-sized fashion chains. </p> <p>However, its latest data shows sales are once again falling, with like-for-likes down 1.21% in the week to Sunday 23 October. \u201cWhile some of the upscale and bespoke fashion retailers enjoyed moderate boosts, this was offset by declining sales amongst mid-range fashion retailers and across the peer group,\u201d said BDO. </p> <p>Analysts are keenly watching how clothing market leader Marks &amp; Spencer reacts to the tough trading environment. Its new boss, Steve Rowe, appears to be holding his nerve, with the most notable winter promotion being a chance to buy a wool scarf for \u00a35 when customers spend \u00a340. Rowe is trying to wean the retailer off an over-reliance on discounting after more than 40% of its clothing was sold on promotion last year.</p>",

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u2019s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u2019s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency.

This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u2019s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance.

  "<p>The word \u201cwarm\u201d comes up frequently in descriptions of the bass-baritone Gerald Finley. And rightly so. The Canadian singer and actor brings a generous and affecting lyricism to every role he touches, whether it\u2019s the Robert Oppenheimer of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYiokai3FW4&amp;list=TLQLlsvdjbg6A\">John Adams\u2019s Doctor Atomic</a>, or else Rossini\u2019s Guillaume Tell, which he is singing this season at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera.</p> <p>And Finley has emotionally resonant skills as an actor, too, whether he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/03/the-rakes-progress-review-metropolitan-opera\">channeling the dark humor</a> of Stravinsky\u2019s The Rake\u2019s Progress or communicating the austere longing of Kaija Saariaho\u2019s L\u2019amour de loin. Even when he finds himself in the middle of an operatic uproar \u2013 as happened with last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/30/guillame-tell-review-royal-opera-house-sex-violence-and-protacted-booing\">Royal Opera House production</a> of Tell \u2013 Finley\u2019s performances are often judged the best part of the show.</p> <p>So it\u2019s with some surprise that I discover Finley has never taken an acting class. \u201cI\u2019ve had to pick it up along the way,\u201d he concedes during a morning in between performances at the Met. \u201cYou can tell the actors that stand there, and you go: Wow, they\u2019re unbelievably active! Interesting to look at. And I thought: I really want to be that. I want to know that there\u2019s things in my face, in my demeanor, in my posture, that convey uncertainty, desire, love, disappointment, confusion \u2013 all those things just by standing.\u201d </p> <p>He credits \u201csome really great directors who have seeded things\u201d. This group includes the late English director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/30/robin-phillips\">Robin Phillips</a>, who took charge of Ontario\u2019s Stratford Festival in the 1970s. \u201cI was 32 or 31, doing Marriage of Figaro \u2013 and he staged it in an Edwardian style. We learned how you could do what he called \u2018toasty turns\u2019, where you\u2019re warming yourself against your colleagues, when you take your turn. He said that gives a haughtiness and yet a sort of respect. Just simple techniques with your head \u2026 Those sort of things were wonderful anchor points for me as an actor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd6c053fda14ee3b607adc09f85d03269065a144\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd6c053fda14ee3b607adc09f85d03269065a144/0_311_4748_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finley in the Royal Opera House\u2019s controversial production of Guillaume Tell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finley in the Royal Opera House\u2019s controversial production of Guillaume Tell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finley\u2019s opening night performance of the Tell role, in Pierre Audi\u2019s new production, showed how much acting craft the baritone has absorbed over the years. Rossini\u2019s epic dances past the four-hour mark (even with some slight cuts, at the Met). And there are long stretches where Tell doesn\u2019t have much singing to do. But in Audi\u2019s decadently gloomy and gently surreal production, Tell can often be seen haunting the edges of this or that grand choral outburst. And you can always observe the gears turning within Finley\u2019s characterization, as the Swiss archer gradually prods himself into a state of active resistance against an Austrian occupation.</p> <p>\u201cThe interesting thing is the relationship between Tell and his son,\u201d Finely says. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s the conflict that\u2019s set up, from the very start: where life is crap, and my son is growing up and starting to use a crossbow \u2013 ready to get killed. So this is great! And as soon as Leuthold says \u2018my only daughter has been taken from me\u2019, that immediately strikes a chord in Tell \u2026 For me that\u2019s like: \u2018He\u2019s killed a soldier for what he did to his daughter. Would I do the same?\u2019 The answer is yes.\u201d</p> <p>The singer sounds a bit less interested in the famous archery trick that has lodged the Tell story in the pop-culture consciousness. \u201cThe apple moment? People can decide what expectation they have for that as the dramatic high point of the opera \u2013 and be completely disappointed. Or: \u2018OK, that was good enough. Now what\u2019s next?\u2019 That\u2019s still part of the drama. But for me it\u2019s the emotional impact which is the key.\u201d And for all his admirable focus on the complexities of the broader opera, Finley makes sure to provide a haunting rendition of Sois immobile.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1veNfYeiohw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1veNfYeiohw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He says his interest in longevity means turning down some roles that are now being offered to him. \u201cThe whole journey into Wagner \u2013 I\u2019ve done three productions now of [Meistersinger]. And people say \u2018ooh, it\u2019s a slippery slope; you\u2019ll get that big [wobble] trying to push it out over the orchestra\u2019 \u2026 But it\u2019s very instructive. Hans Sachs I found wonderful; it sits very happily in part of my voice. I would not probably do Sachs in houses as big as here. And that\u2019s just a reality.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys that can do Wotan \u2026 But I have other roles that I really want to manage; I want to make sure that I still get to do those. I\u2019m looking forward to things like Scarpia. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a G\u00e9rard in [Andrea] Ch\u00e9nier for me? I would love to sing the aria! \u2026 As a result of singing Hans Sachs I\u2019m singing much better in my higher range. Simply because of the stamina required to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"877cbfb3c7512f4eac2b97834fd7c91f06b1855c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877cbfb3c7512f4eac2b97834fd7c91f06b1855c/0_0_5477_3651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finley as Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger Von Nurnberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finley as Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger Von Nurnberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finley says that his 17 performances of the Sachs role, over the last year, tempts him into thinking that he can do anything \u2013 \u201cbut I still have to be sensible about it all.\u201d He also notes that he\u2019s not just a singer of opera. Along with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and conductor Gustavo Dudamel, Finley reunited with Saariaho back in 2015, for a concert piece called True Fire (which she wrote with him in mind).</p> <p>\u201cKaija\u2019s music can be contemplative \u2013 and you have to let yourself go into the experience of the music \u2026 But True Fire is some of her darker work. I\u2019m doing it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/emcj5v\">in London in December</a> with the BBC Symphony, and also with the Hamburg Radio Orchestra, in June next year. And then recording it with the Helsinki Philharmonic \u2026 So I\u2019m still doing my recital repertoire and my concert repertoire. I have three passions in my singing life, and I need to nurture all of them. But I\u2019m really optimistic about the future, because I\u2019ve had such a great technical ride in the last four or five years. Singing repertoire which hopefully isn\u2019t beyond me. Getting to know great pieces \u2013 and now doing them in wonderful places.

  "<p>Tetris is a phenomenon. Created in 1984 by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov, it was initially passed hand to hand by floppy disk. Soon it was crossing national borders and generations like no game before or since. Sales and downloads are now in the hundreds of millions, and the first film of a sci-fi trilogy based on its ever-descending blocks is due in 2018.</p> <p>The story behind its creation \u2013 a tale of idealism, legal wrangling, murder and vast profits starring amateur game designers, Soviet bureaucrats, Japanese and American electronics companies and Robert Maxwell \u2013 is compelling. Brown chronicles Tetris\u2019s spread and the software giants\u2019 desperate dance around the rights for various markets, and ponders humanity\u2019s need for games. The result is a decent introduction to a fascinating moment in cultural history, touching on Nintendo\u2019s backstory and the 1980s revolutions that made gaming one of the world\u2019s biggest creative industries.

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland has been driven deep into the red again by legal costs and a hefty restructuring bill as it enters its ninth year under government ownership.</p> <p>The bailout of the Edinburgh-based bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">was announced in October 2008</a> and \u00a345bn of taxpayer money was eventually pumped into the bank, which has not reported a full-year profit since then.</p> <p>In the first nine months of 2016, RBS made a \u00a32.5bn loss after incurring a \u00a3469m loss in the third quarter. It was profitable in the same three months last year.</p> <p>As Ross McEwan, the chief executive, tried to focus on the \u00a31.3bn of profits generated in the third quarter before the legal and restructuring charges, he said the 73% taxpayer-owned bank faced several hurdles in the months ahead. </p> <p>Among them is the admission that it will fail to meet a deadline to divest 300 branches \u2013 which were to be known as Williams &amp; Glyn. That deadline was imposed by the European Union as a result of its taxpayer bailout. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/rbs-paid-consortium-including-church-of-england-at-least-180m-for-flotation\">After a number of failed attempts</a>, RBS said full separation and divestment could not now be achieved by the end of 2017. </p> <p>Discussions are under way with the Treasury to discuss how it can spin off the branches. The bank was ordered to get rid of them by the EU as a penalty for its bailout. </p> <p>The inability to dispose of W&amp;G \u2013 a process which has already cost \u00a31.7bn \u2013 is one of the barriers to the government selling off any more of its stake and the bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends.</p> <p>The third quarter was knocked by restructuring costs of \u00a3469m, largely W&amp;G, a \u00a3425m legal bill and a \u00a3300m loss incurred because of changes to tax rules.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cThese results reflect that noise. Our core business results were good with a \u00a31.3bn adjusted operating profit, our best quarter since 2014.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://investors.rbs.com/~/media/Files/R/RBS-IR/results-center/q3-results-2016-announcement-28102016.pdf\">its third-quarter results,</a> RBS warned that it faced a \u201crange of uncertainties\u201d, which included a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the sale of mortgage bonds. The bank said it could face charges and costs that would be so large it could knock its level of capital.</p> <p>RBS said it did not know when it would be able start paying dividends, with McEwan adding that performance targets he set for 2019 would not be met. He is expected to announce in February what measures would be needed to respond to the post-Brexit-vote environment.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s shares initially rose on Friday but fell back to close at 194p, down 1.2% and well below the average price of 502p paid by taxpayers during the bailout. </p> <p>As a result of missing the W&amp;G deadline, McEwan faces the possibility of the EU installing a trustee at end of next year. But he said he did not know what the consequences would be of missing the already extended deadline.<br></p> <p> RBS had deployed 7,000 staff to work on the divestment but this has now been cut back to 350. The bank has abandoned any hope of a stock market flotation for W&amp;G, bringing that formally to a close this week by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/rbs-paid-consortium-including-church-of-england-at-least-180m-for-flotation\">redeeming a bond it had sold to a consortium</a> of private equity firms \u2013 and the Church of England. The bond was to convert into W&amp;G shares. </p> <p>A trade sale may be possible as Clydesdale bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/clydesdale-bank-offer-rbs-royal-bank-scotland-branches\">said this week</a> it had made an offer for the branches.</p> <p>Small-business owners were angered when RBS did not set aside any money to pay compensation for the poor treatment they claim they received from the bank\u2019s now defunct global restructuring group. A delayed report into the conduct of the division is expected to be published by the Financial Conduct Authority by the end of the year. </p> <p>\u201cRBS continues to mislead the market by not making adequate provisions to meet pending legal challenges,\u201d said James Hayward, chief executive of RGL Management, which was formed to sue RBS over the claims.</p> <p>RBS set aside an unspecified sum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/private-investors-vow-to-take-rbs-to-court-over-125bn-claim\">to cover a \u00a34bn legal claim </a>from investors in relation to its 2008 cash call. Attempts at mediation have failed and McEwan said: \u201cWe are exploring settlement options. If that fails we\u2019ll be in court in March 2017.\u201d This raises the prospect of former RBS boss Fred Goodwin being called to court. </p>",

She said that others who might vindicate her claims were afraid to speak out. \u201cI am aware that some people at British Cycling are afraid to come forward due to the culture of fear that exists, as they don\u2019t want to lose their jobs,\u201d Varnish said in a statement on her website.</p> <p>Varnish\u2019s claims were later joined by those of the Paralympian Darren Kenny, who also alleged insulting language on the part of Sutton. \u201cThe term used to refer to us was generally \u2018gimps\u2019 with another word in front of that,\u201d Kenny told the Daily Mail. Another source told the paper: \u201cThey were referred to as wobblies. It was an in\u2011joke used to describe para-cyclists.\u201d</p> <p>After the verdict Varnish released a statement on her website. It read: \u201cI spoke out because I wanted to shine a light on the culture at British Cycling, a culture that in my mind was incorrect.

I\u2019ve always given 100% to my sport and am still in love with cycling, so I hope that British Cycling can use this investigation as a way to improve and create a better environment for the Great Britain team.\u201d</p> <p>Sutton has yet to comment on the decision, though his wife Abbie tweeted: \u201cTwo words spring to mind when the word liar is used #jessvarnish #neverhappened #watchthisspace.\u201d</p> <p>This is a turbulent time for British Cycling, which as well as having to replace its head coach \u2013 Sara Symington is widely expected to take over from Sutton \u2013 is also losing its long-standing chief executive Ian Drake in April after he announced his resignation from the post this month. It was also announced on Friday that the governing body will be asked to explain the use of therapeutic use exemptions at a parliamentary hearing, which is expected to take place in December.</p> <p>\u201cThe findings of the investigation will help the development of the organisation alongside the independent review into the culture of the World Class Programme, jointly commissioned by British Cycling and UK Sport, and led by Annamarie Phelps,\u201d the British Cycling statement said.</p>",

  "<p>Gregory Pincus, the maverick scientist who co-invented the female contraceptive pill, first tried to come up with a male equivalent in the 1950s. Nearly six decades on we are still waiting.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\"> Friday\u2019s news</a> that male contraceptive jabs are almost as effective as the female pill is remarkable as much for the lack of progress it highlights as for the impressive result the trial delivered.</p> <p>There are genuine scientific reasons why creating a male pill is tricky. But today\u2019s results, together with a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3863448/Male-Pill-moves-step-closer-British-scientists-discover-way-stop-sperm-swimming-men-just-sex.html\">separate advance earlier in the week</a> , make it a good time to ask whether the main obstacles are technical or a lack of will to develop the drug.</p> <p>A central scientific challenge in developing a male pill is achieving the right balance of hormones that provides reliable and reversible contraception without inducing unacceptable side-effects. </p> <p>Getting this right is a tightrope walk and the research fell just on the wrong side of the line. The World Health Organisation decided to stop enrolling men on its trial earlier than planned after being alerted to side effects, including low mood, acne and higher than usual libido (today some coverage interpreted this as a bonus of the drugs, although there is no suggestion that this is how the men or their partners saw it).</p> <p>Participant safety must always be the first consideration when running clinical trials. It is worth noting, though, that three-quarters of the 300 men who took part in the trial said they would continue to use this method if they had the choice \u2013 and the decision to halt the trial was not unanimous.</p> <p>Richard Anderson, a professor of clinical reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh and a co-author, says: \u201cIt was a big disappointment when the trial was stopped, as the trial monitoring committee were happy with progress and safety, but another WHO committee made the decision.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists did not attempt to quantify whether the side-effects were comparable or worse to known side-effects of the female pill, but we know that these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/pill-linked-depression-doctors-hormonal-contraceptives\">can also be substantial</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many couples for whom the female pill is not an option,\u201d says Sarah Jones, a reader in pharmacology at the University of Wolverhampton, who is working on an alternative form of male contraceptive. </p> <p>\u201cIt has terrible side-effects as well for some women. It\u2019s not much of a choice. I\u2019m sure there are couples that would relish this [male contraceptives].\u201d</p> <p>A second challenge, for the male contraception, is that the hormones they normally rely on are quickly metabolised by the liver, meaning that it\u2019s difficult to package the drugs in a pill form. Again, it is worth noting that most of men on the trial said they would be happy to go forward with the injection method.</p> <p>Anderson and colleagues are due to start another trial using a similar hormone combination delivered through a gel that men could rub onto their chest each morning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">Male contraceptive jab almost as effective as female pill, trial shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are also new findings suggesting that targeting the sperm directly \u2013 by using a fast-acting pill or a nasal spray that a man could take before sex, for example \u2013 rather than using hormones might work. Until now, this approach had eluded scientists, because sperm is so impenetrable \u2013 or, as Jones puts it, \u201cyou just can\u2019t get into the little buggers\u201d.</p> <p>She published findings this month showing that designer compounds could be smuggled inside sperm cells and target proteins that are required for the sperm to swim, essentially stopping them in their tracks.</p> <p>The progress convinces Anderson that a male contraceptive will be available eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing that it\u2019s going so slowly,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Focus groups run by Anderson and others convince him that there is a clear and immediate demand. \u201cAbout 90% of women we saw at a family planning clinic said it was a good idea, to share the responsibility,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThey say: \u2018I\u2019ve done that [taken the pill] for 15 years and had a baby. Come on it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>However, funding from pharma companies \u2013 essential to run the trials involving thousands of men that would be required to get a product licensed \u2013 is not forthcoming.</p> <p>Herjan Coelingh Bennink, who until 2000 was global executive vice-president of the reproductive medicine programme at the Dutch pharmaceutical company, Organon, has offered an insider\u2019s perspective on why this might be the case.</p> <p>\u201cAt board level it was only middle-aged white males,\u201d Bennink <a href=\"https://mosaicscience.com/story/why-are-we-still-waiting-male-pill-birth-control-contraceptive\">told Mosaic</a> , an online science magazine produced by the Wellcome Trust, this year. \u201cI tried to explain how important it could be, but they never got further than saying to each other, \u2018Would you do it?\u2019 \u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t do it\u2019. It was not considered male behaviour to take responsibility for contraception.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson said that commercial factors may have also impacted the decision to shift away from developing a male pill. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by that characterisation,\u201d he says. \u201cThough it probably does have a grain of truth,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, there are still scientific hurdles to be overcome before we have a safe, reliable male contraceptive.</p> <p>But science is not there to solve life\u2019s simple problems. When someone at the European Space Agency said let\u2019s chase down a comet 250m miles away and land a robotic probe on it, nobody said \u201cThat sounds easy \u2013 let\u2019s do it\u201d.</p> <p>If we\u2019re looking for reasons why we\u2019re still so far from equality in who bears the burden of birth control, let\u2019s not place lack of scientific ingenuity at the top of the list.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2016. Herjan Coelingh Bennink was global executive vice-president of the reproductive medicine programme at Organon, not Schering as a previous version said.</p>",

Why even now, even as he has often been the butt of jokes, are Dan Brown\u2019s books and movies still so popular? These are questions often asked of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey\">Fifty Shades</a> books, and of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/twilight\">Twilight</a>, and other dumb-but-fun global publishing hits. They are less often asked of Brown. </p> <p>Brown came into this world with a posh pedigree. He attended the fancy Philips Exerter prep school, and went on to the very well-regarded Amherst College, where once he reportedly shared a creative writing seminar with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/12/david-foster-wallace-my-teacher\">David Foster Wallace</a>. You might say his life took an unexpected turn after graduation. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown\">his Wikipedia page explains</a> in excruciating detail, as a young man his ambitions lay not with literature. They lay with the synthesizer. He recorded <a href=\"http://ajournalofmusicalthings.com/author-dan-brown-once-wrote-a-song-about-phone-sex-among-other-things/\">a few synthesizer albums</a> \u2013 with titles like SynthAnimals, Perspective, and Angels &amp; Demons \u2013 before deciding to move permanently into the world of letters. </p> <p>As a writer, Brown takes himself very seriously. Here is the sort of thing he says in interviews, this one <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/i/dan-brown-novelist-8453503.html\">with the Independent</a> on the eve of Inferno\u2019s publication: \u201cAlthough I studied Dante\u2019s Inferno as a student, it wasn\u2019t until recently that I came to appreciate the enduring influence of Dante\u2019s work on the modern world. With this new novel, I am excited to take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm \u2026 a landscape of codes, symbols, and more than a few secret passageways.\u201d </p> <p>One thing that now seems hard to remember \u2013 even hard to understand \u2013 is that when the Da Vinci Code was published in 2003, it was very well-reviewed. Janet Maslin declared it an \u201cexhilaratingly brainy thriller\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/17/books/books-of-the-times-spinning-a-thriller-from-a-gallery-at-the-louvre.html\">in the New York Times</a>. \u201cThe word is wow,\u201d she wrote, in case the reader missed her point. And Maslin was hardly alone. \u201cLike a terrific school field trip where you come home so full of knowledge and adventure that you stun your friends and family into glazed silence with great bursts of enthusiasm,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/book-review-dan-browns-inferno/2013/05/13/53a7b7ba-bbcf-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_story.html\">raved the Chicago Tribune</a>. It seems to have taken, in fact, several years and several clunkier books to get Brown the bad reputation he now enjoys among cultural commentators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a025f069a2b3f50cd41a86f3ba1f362133baba0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a025f069a2b3f50cd41a86f3ba1f362133baba0b/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones in Inferno, which the critics said wasn\u2019t too hot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones in Inferno, which the critics said wasn\u2019t too hot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The common denominator of those early reviews is that readers appreciated that they were being taught something, while reading The Da Vinci Code. They were learning about Catholicism. Or art history. Or albino monks that attack people in famous art galleries. People love to learn, and they love to do that in the context of a murder which involves a pentacle carved in blood on an art curator\u2019s chest, if at all possible. </p> <p>Brown\u2019s claim to be an authority here has a bit of tarnished. He has been accused of plagiarizing the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/28/danbrown.books\">at least</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/14/danbrown.michellepauli\">twice</a>, though in both cases the writers claiming copying had their claims dismissed from court. There is also a considerable body of literature that challenges Brown\u2019s factuality, for even as his book has positioned itself as fiction it takes, as I said, considerable authority from its promise of facts. </p> <p>Much of the criticism comes from Christian writers and historians. They chiefly object to the conclusion of the Da Vinci Code, the thing Langdon finds out after winding his way through counter-intuitive readings of great works of art. It\u2019s been in the cultural air for a decade so I think it no longer counts as a spoiler: Langdon claims to discover that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, but in fact survived, wed Mary Magdalene, and had a daughter with her. </p> <p>\u201cDan Brown\u2019s story needs a married Jesus to establish a deeper, more sinister point that he is trying to make with his audience,\u201d railed a writer in the conservative American Spectator in 2006. (Regrettably this lectern-thumping article does not seem to be available online.) \u201c... traditional Christianity is oppressive toward women.\u201d One might see this as less a sinister point than self-evident truth, but no matter. It was obviously their anxiety about that particular claim that provoked so much of the nervous conservative reaction.</p> <p>Still, even less ideologically minded people have pointed out that much of Brown\u2019s view of history is hogwash. For starters, the Priory of Sion, an organization integral to the plot of The Da Vinci Code because it is protecting the secret of Mary Magdalene and her daughter, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-priory-of-sion/\">likely never existed</a> even though Brown clearly thought it did. His plodding, conspiratorial interpretations of the paintings he describes in the book drive art historians to drink. The Mona Lisa, they insist, is just what it looks like, without the hidden meanings Brown attributes to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ffed8feda420f54723e5c004be820136d3a2654\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ffed8feda420f54723e5c004be820136d3a2654/0_123_3292_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Never Brown in town: Dan Brown, right, with the cast of Inferno\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never Brown in town: Dan Brown, right, with the cast of Inferno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isa Foltin/Getty Images for Sony Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But people have since believed it. Over the years religious publications have been filled with reports that church parishioners, after reading the Da Vinci Code, suddenly had a host of questions for their priests and theologians. They knew, of course, that the book was fiction. But even so, they wondered how much truth there was in it. A priest, <a href=\"http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/542/article/krispy-kremes-and-da-vinci-code\">writing in 2005</a> for the liberal Catholic weekly America, reported that parishioners had often already heard lectures or read articles that argued against the veracity of the book\u2019s claims. \u201cAttitudes toward these lectures and towards articles that pooh-poohed the claims of the book were generally negative,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>Less often mentioned, in these articles, is that The Da Vinci Code inconveniently hit the Roman Catholic church right after the devastating series of sex abuse scandals in the late 1990s, and early 2000s. People had good reason to believe the church was hiding something from them. And, ironically, a vast conspiracy that began centuries ago about an abstract church issue \u2013 the divinity of Christ \u2013 was undoubtedly easier to contemplate than the sex abuse scandal. It was easier to argue about things that happened centuries ago, in the earliest stages of Christianity, than the things that were happening right now, in front of them.</p> <p>So however clumsy Brown might have been, however dubious his history and however ham-fisted his prose, people found in those book a general cause they can believe in.

Can the proposal given by Heathrow to the airports commission be built and keep charges flat, no it can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The IAG boss added that a runway could be built by Heathrow if there was \u201csome radical change in their [the management\u2019s] behaviour and thinking\u201d, but repeated: \u201cI\u2019m personally not confident they can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Insisting that \u201cthere will be no ability for Heathrow to hike charges\u201d, Walsh said: \u201cIt\u2019s a significant new challenge for the airport and not one they have had to face up to in the past.</p> <p>\u201cIf the argument is that the third runway is positive for the UK economy we\u2019ve got to make sure that it is for the benefit of customers and not for the shareholders.\u201d </p> <p>Heathrow is owned by Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial and the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Singapore and China, along with two pension funds. </p> <p>The airport said it intended to keep charges low.<strong> </strong>\u201cAs our biggest customer, Heathrow has been listening to IAG about the cost of the current proposal for expansion. Heathrow is determined to work with all our airline partners to deliver expansion as cost efficiently as possible \u2013 keeping landing charges low and delivering value for our passengers,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>Walsh once championed a third runway but refused to be involved in the latest lobbying after the coalition government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/24/third-runway-heathrow-scrapped-baa\">scrapped expansion plans in 2010</a>. But, he said: \u201cIt represents an opportunity for BA as clearly its current schedule would operate better if operated over three runways and it gives BA and other airlines an opportunity for expansion which we don\u2019t have today.\u201d<br></p> <p>He suggested BA could maintain or increase its dominant position at the London hub because of a relaxation of rules after Brexit. While it could only have received a minority of new slots under EU rules, Walsh said that by the time a runway was built, \u201cslot allocation rules will have to be determined\u201d and government \u201cwill have more flexibility\u201d.</p> <p>Walsh said air fares could rise in near future because of the effect the Brexit vote had on the value of the pound. </p> <p>\u201cConsumers are looking at price increases. Ticket prices have been declining and will continue into Q4 [the rest of 2016]. But in time if sterling continues to be weak, you are looking at increases in fares,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The drop in sterling contributed to a 3.6% decline in profits for IAG in its last quarter, which covers the most lucrative summer season. In the months to September, operating profits dropped to \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.1bn), as revenues fell 4% to \u20ac6.5bn.</p> <p>\u20ac162m of that was directly attributed to the currency fall for IAG, whose revenues mainly accrue through pounds spent on BA fares. <br></p> <p>Although the short-term impact of the EU referendum was a dent to profits, he said: \u201cLonger-term a weaker pound will mean the BA cost base is better. Our principal competition is US carriers on the transatlantic routes and we\u2019ll have a lower cost base. It\u2019s swings and roundabouts.\u201d</p> <p>An uncertain operating environment, terror attacks and air control strikes were also blamed by IAG as it downgraded its 2016 profit forecast once again, this time to \u20ac2.5bn, a figure that would still represent year-on-year growth of between 7% and 8%. </p>",
  "<p>On the eve of the home match against Crystal Palace last weekend, the players and staff of Leicester City interrupted their final training session to stand in a circle and observe a minute\u2019s silence in memory of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, whose 70-year reign had ended with his death a few days earlier. The following day, on the pitch at their stadium, they posed for a rather unusual pre-match team picture. Front and centre, held by their captain, Wes Morgan, was a large gold\u2011framed photograph of the monarch. The players were wearing black armbands.

The first of the new generation of foreign owners was Mohamed Al Fayed, who took Fulham from the third tier to a solid existence in the top flight and a European final during his 16 years of flamboyant stewardship. At Watford the Pozzo family assumed control in 2012 and, despite getting through managers at an indecent rate, succeeded in returning the club to the Premier League.</p> <p>For others the experience has been rather different.

The protests in 2010 against the Glazer family\u2019s financial stewardship of Manchester United, symbolised by the wearing of green and yellow Newton Heath FC scarves, quickly died away. But in a wider and more profound sense the ownership of clubs rooted in their communities by foreign entities, whether as investment vehicles or trophy purchases, may be having the effect of disengaging the emotions of the domestic football fan base from the game as a whole. In the phrase currently fashionable in political debate, it is \u201chollowing out\u201d the feeling that fans have for their sport.</p> <p>What is to be made of the situation in the West Midlands, a virtual petri dish for the ownership of English football clubs by Chinese businessmen, with Guochuan Lai at West Brom, Paul Suen Cho Hung at Birmingham City, Tony Xia at Aston Villa and Guo Guangchang at Wolves? If any of those owners were to bring real success to their clubs, they would receive the grateful adoration of their season-ticket holders. But the suspicion that they are not in it simply for the pleasure of owning a football club, or even for the local prestige that motivated the chairmen of earlier eras, is seeping like a slow-acting poison into the body of the league.</p> <p>Perhaps it helps to explain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/24/sky-sports-bt-sport-people-switching-football-off\" title=\"\">recently announced decline in TV&#xa0;viewing figures</a> for live matches transmitted by Sky and BT this season. No doubt several factors are in play, including the feeling that the introduction of the regular Friday night match has finally created a surfeit of live football. The rebranding of the unloved League Cup as the EFL Cup has succeeding in making the competition even more of an irritating irrelevance, cluttering up the fixture list in a way that no major American sport would permit. And there may also be a growing boredom with the domination of the narrative by the small group of celebrity managers \u2013 Mourinho, Guardiola, Klopp, Wenger, Conte, Pochettino \u2013 at the top clubs, created and fuelled by the media.</p> <p>By other measurements, the Premier League is as healthy as it is wealthy. TV income continues to enrich many participants, deserving and otherwise. Stadiums remain full because fans are committed to their individual clubs. For the television audience, however, there seems to be a growing resistance to the relentless hysteria of the promotional buildup.

  "<p>Prince Charles urged governments, individuals and businesses to take greater care of the world\u2019s soils as part of an initiative aimed at keeping carbon locked in soil, rather than escaping into the atmosphere and causing global warming.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://4p1000.org/understand\">\u201c4 per 1000\u201d</a> project is a pledge to reduce the amount of carbon leaked from soils by 0.4% a year, which would be enough to halt the rise of carbon dioxide levels in the air. Nearly 180 countries have signed up to the initiative that was set up by the French government as part of its efforts to make the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/obama-paris-climate-deal-ratification\">Paris agreement on climate change</a>, signed last year, a success.</p> <p>At a ceremony this week to celebrate the initiative, the prince said that the preservation of farmland, forests and soils were of \u201cabsolutely critical importance - for, in my experience, the fertility and health of the soil is at the heart of everything\u201d. Drawing on his own work as an organic farmer, he contrasted organic methods with the \u201cpreviously conventional\u201d farming systems which he called \u201ctoxic\u201d.</p> <p>The 4 per 1000 initiative does not require farmers to adopt organic methods, but does encourage more attention to farming techniques, which are currently contributing to the erosion of soils around the world.</p> <p>The prince said this project could \u201cmake a remarkable contribution to the wellbeing, livelihoods, food security and resilience of farmers, to the health of the planet and to addressing climate change\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is clear that doing the right thing by our soils, our forests and our peatlands would make a remarkable contribution to the fulfilment of the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> <p>But he challenged governments and businesses to espouse the goals: \u201cAt the end of the day, will we be able to take the necessary urgent steps - or will there be the usual procrastination, argument and denial that have so bedevilled any meaningful progress in addressing ever more dangerous climate change?\u201d</p> <p>The French agriculture minister, St\u00e9phane Le Foll, said the prince\u2019s involvement was important because \u201cat the end of the day, ministers change but the prince always remains\u201d.</p> <p>Le Foll added that farming and forestry alone could be huge contributors to the reductions in greenhouse gases necessary to halt climate change, and small changes to farming methods \u2013 such as covering slurry pits, collecting or flaring methane emissions from slurry, more precise use of fertiliser, and working the soil less intensively - could save tens of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. Better farming methods could also improve food production, he said, showing that \u201cfood security and combating climate change are complementary\u201d.</p> <p>The French government plans to hold an event at the forthcoming UN meeting on climate next month in Marakech, at which it hopes ministers will sign a formal letter of their intention to make good on the 4 per 1000 goal.</p> <p>Recent research found that using soil to soak up carbon from the atmosphere could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/22/soil-carbon-storage-not-the-climate-change-fix-it-was-thought-research-finds\">take more than a century to have the effects needed</a>. However, preserving existing soils and the carbon stored in them could have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/10/soil-our-best-shot-at-cooling-the-planet-might-be-right-under-our-feet\">quicker beneficial effect</a>, as losing that carbon to the air through poor farming methods adds immediately to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>",

  "<p><strong>New York, October 28, 2016</strong> - Guardian US today announced funding of $550,000 from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to produce a year-long series of sustained and deep reporting on the growing homelessness crisis in the western United States. The project will focus on bridging the gap between journalism and activism by engaging with readers and inspiring them to take action to spark real change via new technology provided by<a href=\"https://actionbutton.org/\"> Speakable</a>.</p> <p>While homelessness has been steadily declining nationwide since 2007, it is a critical issue in the western US, where tent cities have become a defining feature of major cities and local governments are increasingly declaring \u201cstates of emergency\u201d over the number of people lacking shelter.<br></p> <p>According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s most recent annual homeless assessment, California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii were four of the five states with the highest increases in homelessness in 2015. California alone accounts for 21% of the nation\u2019s homeless population.<br></p> <p>Support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will allow Guardian US to expand and deepen its coverage of homelessness through reporting and investigations, interactives, films and deep engagement with readers and viewers. Speakable\u2019s innovative<a href=\"https://actionbutton.org/\"> Action Button</a>, which will be added to all the journalism produced in the series, will enable and encourage readers to take action to address some of the issues highlighted throughout the series, for example to donate to, or volunteer with, local organizations working on the ground to combat homelessness throughout the western US.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian US editor, Lee Glendinning</strong>, said: \u201cAt Guardian US, we\u2019re committed to reporting on some of the most prevalent and troubling issues that face America every day, such as the homelessness crisis. This kind of journalism can often leave readers wanting to find ways they can do something to help, and we\u2019re so pleased this groundbreaking partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will allow us to experiment with new ways in which our journalism can motivate our community to take action. By engaging deeply with our audience throughout this series, and by encouraging them to be part of the solution, we hope to collectively create genuine change on this devastating issue.\u201d<br></p> <p>Audience engagement metrics and insights from the 12 month project will be studied carefully to better understand the effectiveness of this new model of action oriented reporting that translates into meaningful participation and action by readers.<br></p> <p>The project will be run from the Guardian\u2019s San Francisco bureau and overseen by its <strong>west coast bureau chief, Paul Lewis</strong>, who commented: \u201cHomelessness is a devastating problem in the western states - but shockingly underreported. We\u2019re thrilled to have an investment of resources that will enable sustained reporting on this subject - and similarly excited to have the opportunity to innovate with a new technology that will encourage our readers to take action.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ends<br></p> <p><strong>Media inquiries</strong></p> <p>E: press.office@theguardian.com</p> <p>T: + 1 917-900-4675</p> <p><strong>About Guardian News &amp; Media<br></strong></p> <p>Guardian US, with newsrooms in New York, Washington DC and San Francisco, covers US and global news for an online audience across America.</p> <p>Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM), publisher of<a href=\"http://theguardian.com/\"> theguardian.com</a>, is one of the largest English-speaking newspaper website in the world.

  "<p>\u201cIt stinks!\u201d This was Staten Islanders\u2019 first response when asked about Fresh Kills \u2013 their dubious civic landmark. For many years it was the largest landfill in the world, although since closing in 2001 it has been exhaustively remediated and now reportedly smells like \u201copen meadows\u201d.</p> <p>Many residents still bear the scars of their role in New York City\u2019s digestive system \u2013 the receptacle of practically all of its garbage for almost 70 years (it was opened in 1947 as a temporary dump on a salt marsh and agricultural land). The landfill has long contributed to Islanders\u2019 sense of being a backwater; the forgotten borough, confirmed by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/superstorm-sandy-staten-island-forgotten\">slow official response to the devastation</a> wrought by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Then there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a>, strangled by a cop on Staten Island in 2014 for selling loose cigarettes. That stank too.</p> <p>I was born in New York City and spent nine years of childhood and 35 years of adult life there. Now and then I went to Staten Island for the ferry ride, art, friends, the Buddhist centre \u2013 but I\u2019ve never seen Fresh Kills. </p> <p>\u2018Kill\u2019 is a Dutch word for stream. Long an apparent geographical misnomer, the name suddenly made tragic sense in 2001 when the landfill became a sorting ground and then burial site for personal effects and human micro-remains from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ground-zero\">Ground Zero</a>. Some thought that mingling human bodies with garbage would cross a line, defy a social taboo. But expediency won out, and the site now known as West Mound holds the remains, human and architectural \u2013 almost a million and a quarter tons of them. A memorial is planned.</p> <p>No public place is a better gauge of a society\u2019s values than a landfill site. After the consumption of global goodies in the privacy of our homes, city-dwellers take out the garbage. The scale of this disgorging/excretion process is noticeable only during garbage strikes, when the stench of the bursting, plastic-bagged mountains on every street corner permeates daily life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7483aff3629b61f65e7445d2e75e2286242954c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7483aff3629b61f65e7445d2e75e2286242954c/0_76_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh Kills closure sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh Kills closed in March 2001, only to be used again six months later following the World Trade Center attacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth A Keiser/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Capitalism thrives on unsustainable growth and expansion while its by-products \u2013 its waste \u2013 also grow and expand exponentially.

Its circuitous journeys are another story, involving intensely competitive <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/residential-generators-of-private-carter-collected-waste.shtml\">private carters</a>, which were sometimes controlled by Mafia groups \u2013 including the Gambino and Lucchese families \u2013 and other organised crime syndicates. Still, Fresh Kills at its height received about 10 million tonnes of garbage annually, transferred from barges by cranes and dump trucks to create trash mountains that towered over the neighbouring communities.</p> <p>What fills a landfill? Garbage archaeologist William Rathje says it\u2019s not the styrofoam and disposable diapers we imagine, but paper \u2013 which biodegrades very, very slowly, after hundreds and maybe thousands of years. As an ageing writer and hard-copy freak living virtuously off the grid on solar power, and owner of far too many books \u2013 which may, in this electronic age, end up in landfills \u2013 I represent a sizeable percentage of the garbage-producing demographic. I shudder to think of my banished personal trash archive.</p> <p>Although it was estimated that Fresh Kills still had 20 more years of capacity, the landfill was abruptly closed by three Republican officeholders who owed their victories to the people of Staten Island. By 2000, all five New York boroughs had found out-of-state sites to replace it, leading to more transportation by trucks, more climate-changing emissions. The 13,000 tonnes of residential waste generated by 8 million people every day have been diverted into a new \u201curban waste stream\u201d (another kind of kill). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"973b9e8f7b8294005e0735830a86d94d240460b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973b9e8f7b8294005e0735830a86d94d240460b4/0_132_1915_1149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garbologist William Rathje on a New York City garbage barge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garbologist William Rathje on a New York City garbage barge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Science Faction</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2008 bill for collecting and \u201cdisposing\u201d of New York\u2019s residential trash was around a quarter of a billion dollars. The insidious inequalities built into contemporary capitalism still make it easy to tell if you\u2019re in a less visible neighbourhood that generates little clout or respect by the amount of trash in the streets. Residents tend to internalise neglect until some really heavy community organising gets under way, and pressure is applied to the most effective power points. </p> <p>According to waste pundit Steve Cohen, the incineration of trash, which can also generate electricity, pollutes less than transporting waste in diesel-fuelled trucks to leaking out-of-state landfills. He recommends smaller-scale, community-based waste management facilities that would share the blessings and the burden of this most necessary public service. </p> <p>The department of sanitation is currently involved in a long-term process to rebuild its marine transfer stations to export residential waste in containers by rail and barge \u2013 still expensive, but not as bad as trucks hauling it out of state and then coming home empty. </p> <p>And then there\u2019s recycling, which, even in the 21st century, has never been fully enforced in New York \u2013 it doesn\u2019t pay well enough, so the stuff often ends up in the landfill. Each new mayor makes a resolution to amend this situation. Each new mayor fails.</p> <h2><strong>News from the underworld</strong></h2> <p>If Fresh Kills had stayed open, it would soon have become the highest point on the east coast \u2013 another marker of human triumph over nature, dubious heir to the great mounds of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/17/lost-cities-8-mystery-ahokia-illinois-mississippians-native-americans-vanish\">pre-European Mississippian cultures</a>. </p> <p>After a tangled bureaucratic history, however, Fresh Kills\u2019 2,200-acre site is now moving toward its <a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/freshkills-park/about-the-site\">reincarnation as a public park</a> almost three times the size of Manhattan\u2019s Central Park. The New York sanitation and parks and recreation departments will be collaborating on its development for decades. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fieldoperations.net/project-details/project/freshkills-park.html\">Field Operations</a>, the firm of James Corner (architect of the extremely successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jan/30/high-line-park-green-cities-industrial-pastoral\">High Line on old elevated tracks in Lower Manhattan</a>), won the International Design Competition for the master plan of Fresh Kills in 2001, and has suffered ever since from the frustration of trying to work creatively with 45 city agencies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9262ec17e58776ce6b332e2e4075f02fc1a0fb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9262ec17e58776ce6b332e2e4075f02fc1a0fb0/102_0_1883_1130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rendering of what Freshkills Park will look like.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rendering of what Freshkills Park will look like.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Freshkills Park/City of New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The park plan has been viewed skeptically by some Staten Islanders, but certain aspects of the never-ending purification process are truly green. Methane is harvested on the site, providing energy to heat 20,000 local homes. Tree planting and other beautification efforts began in the 1980s and accelerated in 2008. </p> <p>The mounds of refuse are being capped with an impermeable plastic liner and eight additional layers of barrier material to separate the ground we touch and walk on from the landfill below. Here an extensive network of piping and drainage channels works away unseen, emerging in the white stacks of the flare stations, bringing news from the underworld. </p> <p>Reclamation includes a system for the capture of leachate (also known as garbage juice), containment and delivery for treatment, and a slurry wall around the site\u2019s perimeter. As sea levels rise with climate change, a rehabilitated Fresh Kills will offer human-made wetland buffers for neighbourhoods threatened in the inevitable future storms.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://freshkillspark.org/\">official website</a> for the new and improved Fresh Kills features a deliriously positive view of the distant future. Areas of the park will boast networks of paths and waterways accessible by canoe, kayak, foot, horseback, bike or car, along with diverse wildlife habitats and research and educational facilities. There are existing precedents in \u201cwildlife refuges\u201d built on toxic sites across the country, like the plutonium production and nuclear waste dumps at the former Rocky Mountain Arsenal and Rocky Flats in Colorado, or Patricia Johanson\u2019s monumental reclamation of a sewage plant in Petaluma, California. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/27/new-york-rubbish-all-that-trash-city-waste-in-numbers\">What does New York do with all that trash?

Investing in universal credit is a far better way of supporting those who need it most.\u201d </p> <p>Duncan Smith introduced universal credit to combine <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/overview\">employment support allowance</a>, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit and housing benefit into one system.</p> <p>At the time of his resignation, Duncan Smith accused George Osborne and David Cameron, then chancellor and prime minister, of chasing an \u201carbitrary\u201d spending cap by focusing cuts on those who \u201ccan less afford to have that fall on them\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday, the <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/about/story\">Centre for Social Justice</a>, a thinktank chaired by Duncan Smith, released a report saying 3 million universal credit claimants would be <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/library/case-strengthening-universal-credit-work-allowances\">\u00a31,000 a year poorer</a> by the time the scheme had fully replaced working tax credit in 2022. </p> <p>\u201cThe first steps someone makes into the job market are often the most difficult and yet they are the most important. For someone who has been out of work for a while, the work environment can be a daunting place. These people need to be encouraged and supported to make this transition well,\u201d it said. </p> <p>\u201cMoreover, those in relatively low-paid work need to receive appropriate support. This is precisely what the UC [universal credit] work allowances were designed to do when the CSJ first developed this reform. This is why they are so important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/csjthinktank/status/791912556277354496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IDS being interviewed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews\">@BBCNews</a> on CSJ call 4 Govt 2 reverse Universal Credit cuts so low income workers have more money in their pockets <a href=\"https://t.co/l1s26cI1V7\">pic.twitter.com/l1s26cI1V7</a></p>&mdash; CentreSocialJustice (@csjthinktank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/csjthinktank/status/791912556277354496\">October 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme ahead of his intervention, Duncan Smith said cuts to the in-work element of universal credit would frustrate the aim to coax more people into the workforce. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the key elements \u2026 is that as you cross into work, the thing called the work allowance, the amount of money which you can retain before it\u2019s tapered away, so that\u2019s allowed for somebody with sickness or disability or whatever, those were all reduced, and the problem with that means it\u2019s more difficult therefore to get people into work and keep them in work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think, as I say, the government needs to be flexible enough to review things when they think it is not going to work and press the point. We want people into work, we have got more people into work, we want them to progress through work.</p> <p>\u201cBut also, importantly, we want to make sure work always pays, and one of the key elements going forward will be we need to get that lift, and you will get that if those allowances are restored.</p> <p>\u201cI put this paper forward in the hope that what I\u2019m asking for gets delivered, because \u2026 [the] prime minister, I genuinely believe, wants to deliver for the bottom five-tenths.</p> <p>\u201cUniversal credit is designed to do that and therefore we should put the money there, rather than going for another lift in the [income tax] thresholds.\u201d</p> <p>Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, backed Duncan Smith\u2019s intervention and called for a Commons vote on the planned cuts. <br></p> <p>\u201cIain Duncan Smith spent a year defending his own cruel cuts to universal credit, falsely reassuring MPs and the public that no one would lose out, not even by a penny,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s welcome that he and a growing number of Tory MPs are realising the true impact these cuts will have on low-paid workers. As with tax credits, it\u2019s now clear the government doesn\u2019t have enough support for these changes to go ahead.</p> <p>\u201cIf the cuts to universal credit aren\u2019t abandoned in the autumn statement, there needs to be an urgent vote in parliament to defeat them outright and to spare millions of low-paid workers these devastating reductions to in-work support.\u201d</p> <p>Debbie Abrahams, the current shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cEven the man chiefly responsible for the Tories\u2019 cruel and ineffective social security reforms is backing Labour\u2019s call for the government to reverse these nasty cuts to work incentives in the social security system.</p> <p>\u201cThis government claimed they wanted to make work pay, but then slashed the budget of universal credit, leaving 2.5 million working families \u00a32,100 worse off. Labour is calling for the full reversal of these damaging cuts, to restore the principle that work always pays.\u201d </p> <p>Duncan Smith is one of a number of Conservative backbenchers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-tory-backlash-cuts-in-work-benefits-universal-credit\">preparing to campaign against</a> the planned cuts to in-work benefits in the hope they will be reversed by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, in his statement on 23 November. </p> <p>Heidi Allen, the South Cambridgeshire MP who confronted May about the issue at prime minister\u2019s questions this month, has described the rollout as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/20/heidi-allen-mp-tory-tax-credit-rebel\">said she \u201cwon\u2019t rest\u201d</a> until the cuts are softened. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Soaring mercury, sinking cities, mass extinctions. It is easy to catastrophise climate change: faced with the sheer enormity of the climate challenge, people can tend towards despair and nihilism. For others, its seeming distance (both chronologically and, for many of us in the global north in particular, geographically) can seduce us with the easy denial that it is someone else\u2019s problem to fix. <br></p> <p>The technology and resources to move towards a post-carbon society are essentially all there. What we lack is a broad, civic movement to get behind the urgency \u2013 and significant opportunities \u2013 of this transition. So rather than looking darkly into a dystopian future in which we are passive victims, it is vital to make climate change relevant in the here and now \u2013 the air we breathe, the food we eat, the way we travel. Human-scale things we have agency to change. We need to find new ways to narrate and envision a fairer, cleaner future in which we can actively participate. <br></p> <p>This year\u2019s annual Lovelock Commission <a href=\"http://www.capefarewell.com/latest/891-lovelock-4.html\"><em>Cloud Crash</em></a> by artist duo HeHe, a collaboration of Cape Farewell, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the <a href=\"http://msimanchester.org.uk\">Museum of Science and Industry</a> (MSI) in Manchester, is an example of how art can enable major public engagement in what former chief scientific advisor Sir David King posits as \u2018<a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/blog-post/2342417/sir-david-king-climate-change-is-not-the-biggest-challenge-of-our-time-its-the-biggest-challenge-of-all-time\">the biggest challenge of all time\u2019</a>. <br></p> <p>The Lovelock Commission takes inspiration from pioneering climate scientist James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia Theory, which posits the earth as a single self-regulating organism \u2013 and this year the commission focuses on atmospherics - namely, man-made emissions. The headline event for this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/\">Manchester Science Festival</a>, <em>Cloud Crash</em> seeks to make pollution \u2013 and its component part, climate change \u2013 visible, and asks some uncomfortable questions of society. </p> <p>The role of the scientist and that of the artist is to make the invisible visible. Gone are the pea soupers that choked London 60 years ago. Today\u2019s pollution is largely invisible to the naked eye \u2013 and all the more insidious for it. A recent <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/271641490/King-s-College-London-report-on-mortality-burden-of-NO2-and-PM2-5-in-London\">study</a> by King\u2019s College London revealed that 9,500 Londoners die each year due to long-term exposure to air pollution, and that levels of pollution in major cities including London, Leeds and Birmingham will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/10/uk-cities-breach-eu-pollution-limits-2030\">exceed legal limits until at least 2030</a>. WHO estimate exposure to the particulate matter - small particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter (PM10)- caused <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/\">3 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2012</a> through cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers.</p> <p>This invisible menace needs to be brought into the light so that we can understand what we are fighting. With <em>Cloud Crash</em> HeHe took as point of departure the <a href=\"https://sci.ncas.ac.uk/airquality/\">air quality forecast maps</a> produced by the (NERC funded) <a href=\"https://www.ncas.ac.uk/index.php/en/\">National Centre for Atmospheric Science</a> (NCAS) \u2013 that show, in hauntingly beautiful detail, levels of ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide as it sweeps across the UK. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"526b700c77a59f88582d5b9a1e90aeabbfe5e065\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/526b700c77a59f88582d5b9a1e90aeabbfe5e065/0_51_3370_2023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Airbag by HeHe, part of the Cloudcrash commission.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airbag by HeHe, part of the Cloud Crash commission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What they have produced are three new pieces placed in-situ across the MSI site. In <em>Airbag</em> an ordinary car has crashed against a steel post in the courtyard. In a playful reversal of the polluting emissions of everyday cars (one of the largest contributors to lethal nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter emissions), this car has become a suspended cloud chamber, insulating a floating microclimate from the outside world. It is an object of reflection and provocation \u2013 as HeHe explain \u2018there is a certain irony in admiring the beauty of such a fragile atmosphere, held inside an object which is so violently transforming our own unprotected airspace.\u2019 <br></p> <p><em>Diamonds in the Sky</em> is an immersive audio-visual experience based in the Air and Space Hall,<em> </em>that<em> </em>imagines a swarming cloud of pollution particles slamming into the side of Beetham Tower \u2013 Manchester\u2019s landmark skyscraper which has come to symbolise the post-industrial reinvention of the city. Expanding on pollution forecast maps, this video piece highlights invisible ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter using vivid saturation colour \u2013 each particle per million represented by a pixel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612f0c8b337266be85f0ecab560bf6d59470d393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612f0c8b337266be85f0ecab560bf6d59470d393/221_202_5037_3023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burnout by HeHe, part of the Cloudcrash commission.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burnout by HeHe, part of the Cloud Crash commission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Hemingway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally,<em> Burnout </em>asks difficult questions of the arts industry and its role in climate change. A scale-model of the Tate Modern belches out vapour clouds \u2013 as if it is simultaneously an art museum and an active energy producer. The building\u2019s original incarnation was Bankside, London\u2019s major fossil-fuel power station from 1952 to 1981, whereas today Tate Modern is often referred to as an \u2018art powerhouse\u2019. By so doing, <em>Burnout </em>confronts both the building\u2019s past and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/11/fossil-fuels-arts-world-divorce-is-way-the-world-is-moving-tate-bp\">arts sector\u2019s modern day collusion with the fossil industry</a>. Despite a recent decision from Tate to drop BP sponsorship after 26 years, the sector is still overshadowed by certain partnerships. For instance, what many pressure groups such as <em>BP or Not BP </em>call the \u2018<a href=\"https://bp-or-not-bp.org/2016/09/27/we-release-a-kraken-in-the-british-museum/\">controversial and ironic\u2019</a> sponsorship of \u2018Sunken Cities\u2019 exhibition by BP (a show rebranded as \u2018Sinking Cities \u2013 Flooding our World\u2019 by Greenpeace in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/19/greenpeace-activists-scale-british-museum-to-protest-bp-sponsorship\">publicity stunt back in May</a>)</p> <p>Above and beyond, <em>Cloud Crash</em> explores a key issue \u2013 that to consume and create culture of all kinds is also to consume energy, however it may be sanitized. Brilliant organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.juliesbicycle.com\">Julie\u2019s Bicycles</a> are doing vital work in helping the arts sector reduce their own environmental impacts. Without this, even the most successful public engagement activity and artworks relating to climate change could prove something of a Phyrric victory.</p> <p>Artists and scientists are natural collaborators, both are explorers <em>and</em> storytellers, seeking out new ways of understanding, communicating (and indeed, changing) the world around them. So when it comes to the dry (or simply terrifying) language of climate science, the marriage of the two can be particularly fruitful. Artists can respond to environmental data in work that provokes real engagement. By communicating these issues in lateral, innovative ways, by using humour and humanity, these sorts of works can reach us on a more animal, cellular, level \u2013 and therefore, hopefully, demand our response. </p> <p>It is important to remember that the dialogue between artists with scientists is two-way. The innate creativity of artists can also inform the work of scientists. NERC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/whatwedo/engage/public/pe-pilot/\">recent call</a> for public engagement pilot activity celebrates this dialogue, as they seek to support new work that engages members of the UK public with relevant contemporary issues of environmental science whilst also building engagement capacity in the environmental science research community - in particular providing opportunities for early career researchers and PhD students to develop skills in they way they approach, and present, their own research. The arts can come to the service of sciences as much as the other way round.</p> <p>When it comes to climate science it is all about finding the right language and tone for it - reframing it as an opportunity not sacrifice, making tangible the intangible and giving agency where once there was apathy. Above all, we need to make climate change relatable to us all \u2013 and in this there is a great deal more work to do. It is vital that climate-focused arts reach as wide and varied an audience as possible. Diversity is critically important in the climate battle, enabling the society-wide engagement it demands.</p> <p><em>Lucy Wood is an arts producer with a focus on climate change, food systems and migration.

Meanwhile, apps like <a href=\"http://smartreality.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SmartReality</a> from JBKnowledge, allow users to hold a smartphone or tablet over designs or plan files and see 2D drawings projected as 3D models.</p> <p>AR is making it easier not only for planners and architects to collaborate with contractors, but to reassure clients and address any concerns they may have. Klawans says its immersive nature means they can \u201cinteract with their building and give feedback on the design before ground has been broken\u201d.</p> <p>The technology\u2019s capacity to deliver cost savings and reduce the chances of a build falling behind schedule can also lead to less cautious investors.</p> <p>\u201cUsing AR to showcase a building or piece of infrastructure to potential investors in its proposed real-world location will help them understand how that asset will connect with its surroundings,\u201d says Dominic Thasarathar, construction industry strategist at <a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autodesk</a>, the software company that provides the building visualisation data for Gilbane\u2019s system to work. \u201cSuch as what the view from the 30th floor of an apartment block might be like. This will make it a more attractive prospect.\u201d</p> <p>There are signs that, beyond bringing flat blueprints and designs to life in front of clients, reducing on-site problems and easing investor worries, AR could provide an end-to-end service. Software is being developed that enables companies to show clients what the inside of a build will look like when furnished a certain way or the finishing touches have been applied to the outside. Of course, virtual reality allows this to be done before a project has been completed and sometimes in more detail, but viewing it outside its context and environment has its limitations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-the-new-creative-mind\">What does artificial intelligence mean for the creative mind?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe beauty of AR is, if you go to a property that\u2019s just been built and you\u2019re not sure how your car will fit, you can stand outside the property and, with your car loaded into the software, position it on the driveway,\u201d says James Barry, head of visualisation at <a href=\"http://www.areasq.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Area Sq</a>, a London-based office interior design firm passionate about the benefits the technology can have. </p> <p>Area Sq is yet to use AR commercially \u2013 it has already integrated VR into its services \u2013 but is considering adopting it soon. Barry says that he expects the ability for clients to picture fittings and materials in place will be powerful. He adds that AR will not only be effective at bringing clients on board from an early stage, but at being a pipeline tool.</p> <p>It makes sense. The technology is already being used to market and sell products to homeowners and shoppers. Apps such as <a href=\"https://www.dulux.co.uk/en/articles/the-dulux-visualizer-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dulux Visualiser</a> enables users to hold phones up to a wall and picture how they would be painted a certain colour. And Ikea allows them to scan images from its catalogue and picture them in their house before they decide to buy. </p> <p>Maximilian Doelle, the chief prototyper at <a href=\"https://www.kazendi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kazendi</a>, the first UK developer for HoloLens, built the HoloLiving app, which allows users to virtually furnish a room, for its client Selligent. He says that the furniture industry, along with the construction sector, will benefit hugely from placing images and virtual objects in the real world. The caveat though is that 3D graphic designers may add things that, while they look good virtually, can\u2019t be replicated in the exact same way. \u201cThere could end up being a discrepancy for customers, between what they expect to see and what\u2019s actually there,\u201d Doelle adds.</p> <p>A true marker of AR\u2019s ability to innovate and provide an end-to-end service may well be whether it will then be used to sell a piece of real estate. Could the future showroom see prospective buyers wearing a headset or walking round viewing it through a smartphone? Not as things stand, says Doelle, but as visuals become more photorealistic and software more sophisticated, the possibility of it being used to sell homes won\u2019t be far off.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

With only that, he will need to fill out documents to become an official Korean citizen, open a Korean bank account, get a job to support himself, and money to secure the expensive deposit for an apartment rental.</p> \n<p>But first, \u201cI will try to find a place to stay and rent a room,\u201d he said on Tuesday, in a phone interview from the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, where he\u2019s been held for nearly nine months.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Crapser\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/03/adam-crapser-deportation-korean-adoption-system-immigration\">two-year-long immigration case</a> came to an end when, in a courtroom located in the detention center, Judge John C O\u2019Dell denied Crapser\u2019s plea to cancel his deportation removal and Crapser waived his right to appeal. He could be deported as early as three weeks from now. But in the meantime, the Korean consulate in Seattle must issue him travel documents, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has to arrange his flight out of the US.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/03/adam-crapser-deportation-korean-adoption-system-immigration\">Korean adoptee in immigration battle fights to remain in his country \u2014 the US</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His ordeal began in January 2015 with a knock on his door. Two Department of Homeland Security officers told him he was facing deportation charges because, despite being adopted at almost four years old by American parents, he was not a US citizen.</p> \n<p>Before 2001, foreign-born adoptees such as Crapser weren\u2019t granted automatic citizenship, instead entering the US on foreign-born adoption visas. Last November, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, introduced the Adoptee Citizenship Act, which would grant retroactive citizenship to all foreign-born adoptees. Then in June, a companion bill was introduced in the House, but there has been no movement in Congress since.</p> \n<p>His first adoptive parents, a strict couple, relinquished custody to the state of Oregon\u2019s foster care system in 1985, when he was around 10 years old, after deciding they didn\u2019t want him any more. After bouncing around foster homes, he was adopted into the Crapser family. Those parents were eventually arrested in 1991, charged with 34 counts of rape, sexual abuse and criminal mistreatment, including extreme physical assault. They were eventually found guilty of 12 of those charges. Adam Crapser was 17 at the time.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t ask to come here [US],\u201d he said about his adoption. \u201cI got placed with some idiots but I went on to live my life the best I could.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Most people don\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t ask to come here.

  "<p>Despite the recognition that violence against women (VAW) is a global health emergency \u2013 one in three women and girls experience violence at least once in their life from the age of 15 \u2013 it has not inspired action by governments.</p> <p>At an individual level, violence immediately affects the health of a woman or girl. The mental and physical health effects can lead to poor earnings, employment instability, and low productivity; they can also result in women being unable to undertake household tasks, like cooking or bringing her children to school, which in turn affects the wellbeing of her children and extended family. These impacts, over a lifetime, reflect a loss of human potential for the individual, her community and the society and economy.<br></p> <p>My work is on measuring the impacts to prove the suffering reaches much further than the individual victims, survivors and perpetrators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Violence imposes burdens on the informal systems of family, kinship, and community networks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of these impacts can be monetised, such as the cost of seeking healthcare for injuries, and we can easily count these as economic costs. However, this is the tip of the iceberg. Capturing the cost of pain, or the long-term impact on capabilities and potential, is far more difficult, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It is necessary to look at the costs to families and informal networks, to businesses small and large, and at the ways all of these costs multiply and affect societies over time.</p> <p>Studies in the global south demonstrate that violence imposes burdens on the informal systems of family, kinship, and community networks. A recent <a href=\"http://egypt.unfpa.org/publications/economic-cost-gender-based-violence-survey-egypt-2015\">study in Egypt</a> found that the most significant economic impacts are the loss of unpaid care work, the burden placed on families to provide refuge for the woman/girl, and the costs to a family of providing protection for women in the public space. </p> <p>This shows that the greatest costs of violence against women are absorbed by informal institutions and thus remain invisible to governments and planners, while placing a significant strain on families, communities and societies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in countries where women\u2019s labour force participation rates are high, costing studies show that violence primarily influences absenteeism and productivity loss in the workplace. For example, a <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2013/2/estimating-the-cost-of-domestic-violence-against-women-in-viet-nam\">study I undertook in Vietnam</a> showed the productivity loss to be equivalent to 1.79% of 2011 GDP. A 2014 <a href=\"http://www.learningtoendabuse.ca/sites/default/files/The%20Impacts%20of%20Violence%20against%20Women_Financial%20Consequences_Peru_1.pdf\">study in Peru</a> (pdf) on the costs to businesses estimated that overall 70m workdays (equivalent to about 230,000 full-time jobs) were lost in a year due to the impacts of violence on women\u2019s and men\u2019s absenteeism and presenteeism (being late, leaving early, not concentrating).</p> <p>We are currently looking at ways, through the UK\u2019s Department for International Development <a href=\"http://www.whatworks.co.za/\">What Works programme</a>, to generate new data on the scale of the cost of VAW and provide basic benchmark data to monitor effectiveness of efforts to address violence. The global What Works programme is also testing ways of preventing violence as well as measuring cost effectiveness to make the rigorous case for investment priorities in promising interventions. </p> <p>The effectiveness of economic empowerment programmes, poverty reduction programmes and others working to address inequality depend on the efforts to combat VAW, which is at the core of the economic and social challenges of our times. </p> <p>We hope that our evidence will translate into systemic action at national and international levels.</p> <p><em></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>When the Guardian reported this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">Theresa May had privately made a passionate case for Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU</a> shortly before the referendum, it didn\u2019t look great. The problem wasn\u2019t her opinion: she was saying the sort of things a member of the remain campaign was supposed to. The problem was that she wasn\u2019t doing so in public \u2013 and the audience for her secret pitch was a select group of bankers from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>May is very far from the first politician to accept such an invitation. She has, for example, put herself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\">same category as Hillary Clinton</a>, who between resigning as US secretary of state and running for president made a number of highly lucrative speeches for the same bank. For both politicians, the idea that they are giving off-the-record briefings to the banking industry that stand at odds with their public pronouncements makes for very bad publicity indeed. For the spin doctors at Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, this must have been a pretty good week.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that \u201cGoldman\u201d or \u201cGoldmans\u201d \u2013 as insiders call the bank \u2013 is in general enthusiastic about publicity. Much like Fight Club, the first rule of the City is that you do not talk about the City: especially at major banks, unauthorised contact with reporters or researchers is grounds for immediate dismissal. Nowhere is this rule enforced more vigorously than at Goldman. There isn\u2019t even a sign with the bank\u2019s name on at its City HQ.</p> <p>In the absence of a more conventional PR strategy, though, visits from the likes of May and Clinton serve a very useful purpose. Other banks may have good risk management, but none has Goldman\u2019s mystique, or its network of former employees, from the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and former US Treasury ministers Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. Goldman loves to present itself as the bank that is better than any of its competitors at drawing the most powerful decision-makers into its orbit \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/jean-claude-juncker-jose-manuel-barroso-decision-to-join-goldman-sachs\">hiring the former EU leader Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso</a> earlier this year. All of this helps with recruitment as well as with holding on to staff. And so, publicity shy though Goldman may be, the outcry over May\u2019s speech this week makes it look exactly the way it wants to.</p> <p>\u201cAny person being seen as at the global top of what they do, be it in basketball, green technology, fashion or chess, will be an interesting speaker for a bank trying to position itself as the global leader in its own field,\u201d says one insider. Another adds: \u201cIt is the rock-star effect. \u2018Look who we know! Look who we got!\u2019 They say that politics is show business for ugly people. Getting a big-name politician in is just part of that \u2013 a celebrity to cheer up and maybe stimulate very well-paid but hard-pressed employees.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5929j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836072\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e2c3de4b0c146d58914f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\">Theresa May\u2019s private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That May was invited to Goldman Sachs and that she accepted, then, is neither surprising nor remarkable, City insiders agree. While her argument may have been more passionately stated behind closed doors, there was technically no gap between what she said at Goldman and her public position at the time and she was not paid \u2013 in line with a generally adhered-to rule that those in office come for free. Though there are other opportunities for political leaders to snuggle up to top bankers, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/refugee-crisis-dominates-downbeat-davos-2016\">World Economic Forum in Davos</a> and conferences such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/bilderberg-conference-dresden-charlie-skelton-bilderblog\">Bilderberg</a>, building some bridges to Goldman must have felt to May like a smart thing to do \u2013 not least because so many of her recent parliamentary colleagues have ended up with a role in banking as \u201cspecial advisers\u201d: John Major at Credit Suisse, Gordon Brown at Pimco, Alistair Darling at Morgan Stanley, William Hague at Citibank and of course Tony Blair taking a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7186975.stm\">reported \u00a32.5m a year</a> at JP Morgan.</p> <p>She may have had more immediate reasons for moving closer to Goldman, too, and if she made any contacts in the margins of her speech these could actually come in useful amid all the uncertainty over a hard, soft or \u201cdirty\u201d Brexit. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/07/alistair-darling-back-from-brink-review\">memoir Back from the Brink</a>, Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer in 2008, recounts how at one point the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, openly threatened him with no longer buying British sovereign bonds if the government were to introduce a tax on bonuses. Global banks can relocate, and then there is the possibility of a global bank\u2019s chief economist talking down your country. Today\u2019s global mega banks wield immense power and while banks have good reason to lobby governments, politicians have good reason to lobby banks, too.</p> <p>This week, May must have regretted her decision to speak at Goldman, given that the larger public is unlikely to understand that unlike Clinton, who charged an estimated $200,000 per speech, May got nothing. Their audiences appear to have been very different, too. Clinton seems to have spoken mainly to groups of Goldman Sachs clients whom the bank was probably hoping to impress. These are so-called professional asset managers, whose job is to invest the money of pension funds, insurers, rich families or oil-rich countries. Many of them might very well make more than the Goldman Sachs bankers trying to sell them investment products. The term here is \u201cclient entertainment\u201d \u2013 giving your clients something interesting for free in the hope of securing some business later. Recent regulation makes it increasingly hard for banks and brokers to take clients to expensive restaurants, exclusive cultural events or prestigious football, tennis or golf tournaments in exotic locations. But flying out for a speech by a global political celebrity is usually still allowed. In the words of one insider with decades of experience: \u201cBringing in a very expensive speaker is also a way of saying to your clients: \u2018See how much we care for you, that we paid XXX to get this person here! We play in the big leagues.\u201d</p> <p>The same dynamic seems to be at work when global banks bring in a celebrity to speak to their youngest recruits. A young maths student who finished an internship at a big global bank said: \u201cWhen they flew in a famous politician from the other side of the globe just to talk to us interns, you can\u2019t help feeling, well, important. You think, wow, my bank can do this?\u201d</p> <p>All in all, those responsible for crafting Goldman\u2019s image as the world\u2019s most powerful and well-connected bank must have been happy to see this week\u2019s outrage about May\u2019s speech. Could the same be said of those actually in the audience?</p> <p>Goldman\u2019s top brass are paid well over \u00a33m a year, and nearly all of them must make the bank a multiple of that amount in order not to be demoted or \u201cculled\u201d by the end of each year. Based on how much the average senior banker works, \u00a33m breaks down to a little under a thousand pounds an hour. So there they were, sitting in a room listening to May rehearsing the same arguments she had made many times before, positions she was to abandon within days after the referendum. Even worse, May\u2019s speech might very well have contributed to the false sense of complacency in the City over the referendum result. In retrospect, then, attending the speech must now feel to those in the audience like a momentous waste of time.

The Catholic belief in bodily resurrection at the end of days makes this position unsurprising, and the church clearly has a vested interest in discouraging casual rituals outside their control, but it\u2019s a proscription that doesn\u2019t sit well with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/22/more-than-half-britons-would-choose-cremation-over-burial\" title=\"\">current trends in the UK</a>.

Alternative trends in the disposal of bodies are moving towards burial. The <a href=\"http://www.naturaldeath.org.uk/index.php?page=the-anbg\" title=\"\">Association of Natural Burial Grounds</a> (ANBG) represents more than 270 woodlands and meadows run as natural cemeteries in the UK; 20 years ago there was only one such facility.

The Tories obviously think they\u2019ll gain from it now, and they\u2019re probably right. Whether it\u2019s telling bankers they\u2019re right, and nothing will change, or telling the public they\u2019re right, and a revolution is at hand, the party is not just picking sides, but creating them.

At the moment, the Labour party.

The fact that the party is shot through with its own destructive ideological divisions only makes matters worse.</p> <p>The real risk is that Labour is seen as a party of middle-class messiahs, who see the country as divided between their disciples and the rest. The \u201crest\u201d being, by definition stupid, greedy, racist, immoral and always and for ever wrong. According to much post-Brexit analysis, many of those who don\u2019t agree with Corbyn\u2019s Labour chapter and verse are those living in the much-touted \u201cheartlands\u201d, which are currently reported to be turning hard to the right.</p> <p>So things don\u2019t look good for the left, or British society as a whole. But aside from today\u2019s political wrangling, the real question is how far will this go. Is the Undivided campaign the start of a backlash against the self-interested division of Britain? I doubt it. There\u2019s far too much to gain from the divide-and-conquer strategy currently in play, and far too much to lose from not getting in on it.</p> <p>Politicians are not famous for long-termism, but they ignore these warnings at their peril. British society is sick; it has been for a long time. The Brexit vote and the discourse that followed have made the symptoms acute. Our leaders need to think very carefully before they play fast and loose with what holds this country together.</p>",
  "<p>Marianito sat in the clinic office looking downcast. He\u2019d been referred to me in the primary care clinic because of fights at school. Despite complaints from the school about aggression, to me, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, he presented as a soft spoken and quiet 12-year-old of Salvadorean parents. After telling me a little about his favorite video games, he told me that some of the kids at school \u201chave been messing with me\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m fat and I smell.\u201d <br></p> <p>Marianito was morbidly obese, and to make matters worse for a twelve-year-old, he had a condition called encoporesis, in which he would have bowel movements without warning at school, leading to bad smells and social humiliation. <br></p> <p>Aside from a regimen with his paediatrician to improve his bowel control, and psychotherapy, it seemed to me that increasing his exercise to address his mood, social isolation, and obesity, might benefit him. Marianito brightened a little when we discussed the idea of getting involved in a sport. He admitted that he was often bored at home, and would really like to get involved with football especially, or maybe play soccer. <br></p> <p>As I explored exercise possibilities with his mother, it became clear that the simple plan of more exercise in the fresh outdoors was a seeming impossibly idea. His mother worked two jobs, and was not often home when Marianito was awake. The pair lived in a large low-income housing development outside of Washington, D.C. There were no parks nearby save the small patches of grass off the walkways in the development. Plus, the mother did not want Marianito walking any distance on his own. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/jun/14/are-hispanics-less-likely-to-get-diagnosed-with-adhd-in-the-us\">Are Hispanics less likely to get diagnosed with ADHD in the US?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are bad people who live in our neighbourhood,\u201d she said.

How could they pay the fee to be on the team? How would he get to the practices? <br></p> <p>As I considered Marianito\u2019s predicament, I became interested in the issue of greenspace in communities, and the impact this can have on children and adolescents in urban environments. <br></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(16)30172-1/pdf\">creative study in the July issue</a> of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry examined levels of aggression in 1,287 twins and triplets in Southern California born between the years of 1990 and 1995. The authors used satellite imagery to find an aggregate measure of vegetation called the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NVDI) surrounding the home. The study found that both in the short term (6-months to 1-year) and the long term (1 to 3 years), having greenspace within 1000 meters was associated with reduced aggressive behaviours in this group of 9 to 18 year olds. Even when authors controlled for things like socioeconomic factors, age, gender, race, self-rated neighbourhood quality, maternal depression, traffic density, and even ambient temperatures, the difference in aggressive behaviours remained. In the sample studied, boys, people with lower perceived neighbourhood quality, children born to mothers who smoked, and those with lower socioeconomic status were more likely to be aggressive. <br></p> <p>The authors estimated that the benefits of increased greenspace was equivalent to 2 to 2.5 years of behavioural maturation. The actual individual-level difference in aggressive behaviours was relatively small, but when looked at in the aggregate the difference from a public health perspective was impressive. <br></p> <p>What is it about greenspace that may result in reduced aggression? Does having a field or park nearby simply allow kids to get more physical activity? Is there something about the presence of trees and grass? Or, presuming adequate safety measures, does greenspace provide a place for children and adolescents to interact socially?<br></p> <p>Several recent studies have found that exercise reduces depression and anxiety in adolescents, factors which may be contributing to aggression. For example, <a href=\"http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(16)30170-8/pdf\">a meta-analysis in the same journal</a> reported that aerobic exercise at least three times per week for 7 weeks had moderate effects on depression in adolescents ages 13 to 18. <br></p> <p>Is it exercise alone that provides the benefit or the natural surroundings? BMC Public Health published another <a href=\"http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com.ezp.welch.jhmi.edu/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-10-456\">systematic review</a> which found that there seems to be a benefit to physical activity in a \u201cnatural environment\u201d over that of a \u201csynthetic environment\u201d like a gym. Potential factors suggested by other authors include decreased noise density and reduced air pollution with greater vegetation. Alternatively, there may be still unseen/undetectable factors that make the families who live near greenspace different from families who don\u2019t. <br></p> <p>Certainly for Marianito, having a park nearby would be no panacea. For example, there was a sense of hopelessness emanating from the mother-son pair \u2013 the feeling that problems were insurmountable \u2013 something to work on in therapy, and potentially, to help the mother get into her own treatment.</p> <p>Elections, Syria, and the health of presidential candidates \u2013 these are the current obsessions of America\u2019s divisive politics. But if adding greenspace in cities could result in less depression, less aggression, better health of urban youth \u2013 isn\u2019t this a policy many of us could get behind? Marianito, for one, would be grateful. </p>",

Less well off students are likely to face increasing affordability issues: i) maintenance grants have been converted to repayable loans, affecting 20% of students (half of whom see the grant as essential for their studies); ii) tuition fees may rise more from 2017; iii) 77% of recent graduates are worried about their student debt. </p> <p>#3: Risk of oversupply and softening yields: We estimate the current pipeline of purpose built beds equates to about a quarter of existing beds.

It\u2019s a potential disaster for Taymour, who tries to \u201cplay by the rules, one foot in and one foot out\u201d, and for Rasa it precipitates a crisis of <em>eib</em>, or shame, the fear of what people will say, and the necessity of lying it imposes.</p> <p>But Teta\u2019s spying is only one of Rasa\u2019s problems in a novel that is set on a single day. His friend Maj has been arrested, either because of his human rights work or his sexuality. In flashbacks, we see how, in a hidden nightclub called Guapa \u2013 the \u201cpocket of hope\u201d that gives Saleem Haddad\u2019s wonderful debut its title \u2013 Maj belly-dances in full niqab adorned with an image of Marilyn Monroe. \u201cWe are all performing,\u201d he declares, referring to <em>eib</em>, and to the demands of survival in a prying dictatorship. The president\u2019s gaze, no less than Teta\u2019s, \u201cunpacks your existence bit by bit until you are naked and helpless, your most secret thoughts out in the open for all to see\u201d.</p> <p>The unnamed, composite Arab city Rasa lives in is clogged with traffic, policemen, cynical cab drivers and new and old refugees. The city is divided between west and east, the west is \u201csplit from the rest of the country\u201d and \u201csucked into the global economy\u201d. In the eastern slums the municipality rips up roads then neglects to rebuild them. There are power cuts, piles of rubbish, and festering resentment.</p> <p>This is a post-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline\">Arab spring</a> landscape. Rasa remembers how the protest started: he and his friends standing alongside \u201cthe chain-smoking trade unionists, the women syndicates, the bearded Islamists\u201d. Met at first by American tear gas and local thugs, then by gunfire and tanks, their slogans became more religious. Soon \u201crevolution\u201d was recast as \u201ccrisis\u201d. Now, people are stuck between authoritarianism and terrorism, militarism and neoliberalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"290a4a02e0d706a582f728f1d7f52170d7c39edd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290a4a02e0d706a582f728f1d7f52170d7c39edd/0_646_3282_4103/800.jpg\" alt=\"Saleem Haddad.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saleem Haddad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rasa works for a media venture founded optimistically as the \u201cfirst in a canon of new local media free from the constraints of the president\u2019s propaganda\u201d, but which has quickly become a translation company serving foreign journalists. On the day in question, he accompanies an American correspondent to meet Ahmed, an opposition leader who assumes that \u201ceveryone wants an Islamic state\u201d and plans an ideal city, not zoned by class but arranged around mosques. The police have killed Ahmed\u2019s son and, in an eery echo of the pro-Assad slogan \u201cAl-Assad or We Burn the Country\u201d, Ahmed\u2019s wife declares: \u201cWe will make the entire country burn so that his death is not in vain.\u201d As he translates, even Rasa feels the pull of the Islamist worldview. It would provide him with family, \u201cauthenticity\u201d, and clear positions. \u201cI am like them: misunderstood, vilified by the regime and the media,\u201d he thinks.</p> <p>As the single day\u2019s action hurtles to its explosive conclusion, it is punctuated by remembrance and reflection. There are family memories, strictly controlled by Teta just as the president controls national history. Their flat is a shrine to Rasa\u2019s dead father and a way of dismissing his vanished mother. (The painful degeneration of Rasa\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage is brilliantly drawn.) And there are memories of Rasa\u2019s time in the US \u2013 he arrived there as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">Twin Towers</a> fell. In the US he was \u201cqueer\u201d on account of being Arab and Muslim, \u201cthe by-product of an oppressive culture, an ambassador of a people at war with civilisation\u201d. Reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/nov/16/classicalmusicandopera.fiction\">Amin Maalouf</a> had taught him that \u201can individual identified most strongly with the aspect of their identity that was under attack\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Guapa is equally astute in its analysis of Arab and American mores</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Participating in the American anti-war protests amid \u201cthe smoky haze of alcohol and debate\u201d, he had met Arabs who behaved very differently to those he knew at home \u2013 women who didn\u2019t straighten their hair, men who grew their beards unkempt. He suffered unrequited love, gained friends who overused the word \u201cproblematic\u201d, and was forced to re-examine his identity. An Arab-American man had accused him of being too westernised; a French woman had told him he was too Arab. Rasa\u2019s struggle for self-definition, mirroring the complex battles for self-determination being fought out in Arab societies, is the novel\u2019s central theme.</p> <p>So much insightful commentary is packed into <em>Guapa</em>, on themes ranging from the effects of bilingualism to the symbolic appropriation of the keffiyeh, but none of it disrupts the narrative flow.

  "<p>The business secretary has insisted there was \u201cno cheque book\u201d involved in the assurance given to Nissan before the carmaker agreed to keep investing in Britain.</p> <p>Greg Clark reportedly gave a \u201clast-minute written promise\u201d to Nissan to protect the company from the consequences of Brexit, in a pledge that will fuel Labour\u2019s demand for the government to publish any private guarantees.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC1\u2019s Question Time on Thursday night, Clark indicated there had been no offer of financial compensation or state aid. \u201cThere\u2019s no cheque book. I don\u2019t have a cheque book,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe important thing is that they know this is a country in which they can have confidence they can invest. That was the assurance and the understanding they had and they have invested their money.\u201d</p> <p>Nissan plans to turn its Sunderland factory into one of the biggest car plants in the world, producing two new models, after gaining \u201csupport and assurances\u201d from Theresa May about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.</p> <p>The agreement with the government will safeguard the future of more than 7,000 jobs and delivers what will be perceived as a major boost to the economy after the referendum. </p> <p>However, the commitment from Nissan to stay in the UK sparked a political row, with Downing Street <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-decision-to-stay-in-sunderland-averts-catastrophic-consequences\">forced to deny that it had offered the Japanese company a sweetheart deal.</a></p> <p>The Guardian understands the government has privately told executives in the car industry that it is confident the sector can retain tariff-free access to the single market. The government and senior executives believe the UK automotive industry is in a strong position when it comes to negotiations about leaving the EU because Britain imports more cars from Europe than it exports.</p> <p>The Nissan announcement was made soon after new figures showed the economy had fared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-defies-brexit-slowdown-fears\">far better than expected in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote.</a> In the first official verdict on how the economy has performed since the referendum on 23 June, the Office for National Statistics said GDP had grown by 0.5% in the third quarter. This was down from 0.7% in the previous three months but well ahead of City forecasts of 0.3%.</p> <p>In a further boost, Toyota, which has a large factory in Derbyshire, also appeared to commit its future to the UK. Didier Leroy, the chief competitive officer and executive vice-president, said Brexit was not a reason to abandon its operations in the country and that he had \u201ctrust in the UK government that it will offer fair treatment\u201d for companies when negotiating its exit from the EU.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/27/theresa-may-hails-nissans-decision-to-build-new-car-in-uk-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59gpn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2846714\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May hails Nissan's decision to build new car in UK \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5812224ee4b0219a00d394f7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/27/theresa-may-hails-nissans-decision-to-build-new-car-in-uk-video\">Theresa May hails Nissan\u2019s decision to build new cars in UK \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nissan has committed to building its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-decision-to-stay-in-sunderland-averts-catastrophic-consequences\">Sunderland</a>, potentially creating hundreds of jobs. It will be the first time the X-Trail will be made outside Japan. Nissan said it wanted to develop Sunderland into a \u201csuper plant\u201d that would build more than 600,000 cars a year.</p> <p>The future of the Sunderland factory had been in doubt since the referendum. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, warned that the Japanese company could decide to build its next-generation models outside Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\">if it did not receive compensation for any loss to competitiveness it suffered after Brexit</a>.</p> <p>May hailed Nissan\u2019s decision as \u201cfantastic news\u201d and a vote of confidence in the UK. It is the first major investment decision in the automotive industry since the referendum.</p> <p>Although Ghosn said the government had offered support and assurances, Nissan and the government repeatedly refused to say what had been promised and whether any public money was involved, despite pressure from Labour.</p> <p>A source close to Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain and is the biggest carmaker in the country, said it was relaxed about Nissan\u2019s deal and had also been \u201creassured\u201d by the government about access to the free market during private discussions. \u201cThe government is fully aware of JLR\u2019s plans. Discussions are taking place,\u201d the source said.<br></p> <p>Although Downing Street refused to reveal the details of its discussions with Nissan, it signalled that it had not made any declaration to the EU about a proposal to offer state aid. The prime minister\u2019s deputy official spokesman said: \u201cThe assurances are that we will get the best possible deal. There was no special deal for Nissan.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Nissan had been promised that it would not face tariffs on its exports to Europe, he added: \u201cI can\u2019t be any clearer. The dialogue we\u2019ve had with Nissan as we do with other companies is a reassurance that we are determined to get the British industrial sector the best possible deal. It is a reassurance. There is no deal. We have a dialogue with Nissan and many other companies.\u201d</p> <p>He declined to comment on whether the industry had been promised lower energy costs, which is another potential financial incentive for Nissan. Industry sources said the government could provide subsidies towards training existing staff and hiring new workers.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said he was pleased there would be continued investment in Sunderland, but said concerns remained about any secret deal between the government and the carmaker.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are any inducements that have been offered, and quite obviously if you are offering big inducements to one industry or one manufacturer, then all the others will quite reasonably say: \u2018Well, what about us?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only a few months into Brexit and we don\u2019t know what the terms of the agreement are between Nissan and the government.\u201d</p> <p>May met Ghosn at Downing Street for a private meeting earlier this month while Clark, the business secretary, met company representatives on a recent trip to Japan. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One, Clark declined six times to say what support had been offered to the company. \u201cWe have had, obviously, as you might imagine, lots of communication between us, but actually what it rests on is a very strong mutual confidence,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/no-10-denies-sweetheart-deal-with-nissan\">No 10 denies 'sweetheart deal' with Nissan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible. We think that the mutual interest between our European neighbours and ourselves is very strong in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Lawther, senior Nissan official for Europe, told the Guardian that there had been \u201cno financial package outside the normal, in the public domain request, for grant support\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt comes down to trust at the end of the day. We are confident the government is taking sufficient measures to make sure the whole of the automotive industry will be competitive at the end of the process.\u201d</p> <p>He said Nissan had stopped production lines at 11am in Sunderland to inform staff of their announcement.</p> <p>One in three British cars are manufactured in Sunderland, where Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7bn since it opened the factory in 1986. More than 7,000 people are employed at the site, with a further 28,000 supply-chain jobs reliant on the factory, mostly in the north-east.</p> <p>\u201cOur dream is a 600,000-car super plant; there\u2019s not many of those in the world,\u201d Lawther said.</p> <p>The news led to a split in Labour and the trade unions. Union leaders and local MPs such as Iain Wright praised the news while senior Labour figures such as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, criticised the government for a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. </p> <p>\u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment. We are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s position on the single market has been unclear since May took over as prime minister. She has repeatedly said the UK wants to maintain as much full and free access to the trading bloc as possible.</p> <p>But neither No 10 nor the Treasury has ruled out the possibility that certain industries could face tariffs as a result of a post-Brexit deal with the EU or a reversion to World Trade Organisation rules. </p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, confused matters further on Thursday by declaring: \u201cIf we are leaving the EU, we are leaving the single market.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>Like the Olympics, interest in the civil service tends to peak every four or five years in moments of high political drama, such as the 2010 general election, when cabinet secretary Sir Gus O\u2019Donnell guided the nation into its first postwar coalition government.</p> <p> And with no shortage of high political drama since 23 June this year, politicians and civil servants have been thrown into turmoil and career changes by the EU referendum result.Amid all the uncertainty, civil servants are as keen as everyone else to find out what the government\u2019s policy is on the Brexit negotiations. Keener, in fact, since it is they who must see the whole thing through. As Sir Simon Fraser, former former under-permanent secretary at the Foreign Office who left in July 2015 for a job with consultancy Flint Partners,  says: Brexit is now the only game in town for the civil service.</p> <p>Whether or not they work for one of the main Brexit-focused departments, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a>\u2019s Department for Exiting the EU, any aspiring civil servant would look at the emerging Brexit negotiations and say \u201cI need to be across this\u201d, Fraser <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14823/simon-fraser-discusses-whitehall-and-negotiating-brexit/\">told an audience of his former colleagues</a> at the Institute for Government thinktank earlier this week. \u201cIf you want to make a career as a civil servant in the next five years, this is the issue in town,\u201d he said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The task of Whitehall this autumn is to get their heads down and do some hard policy thinking.</p> <footer> <cite>Sir Simon Fraser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The civil service is already drafting in support for the Brexit negotiations, including <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/boris-johnson-drafts-former-fco-europe-director-special-adviser\">former UK ambassador to Denmark David Frost </a>at the Foreign Office. In June, Melanie Dawes, permanent secretary at DCLG, <a href=\"http://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/civil-service-brexit-unit-departments-must-be-ready-give-staff-new-eu-team-says-dclg\">said </a>government departments had to be willing to give up their \u201cbrightest and best\u201d to work on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Star Whitehall insider Ollie Robbins, formerly of the Home Office, the Cabinet Office, the Treasury and No 10, is heading up the new Department for Exiting the EU as its permanent secretary, while safe pair of hands Martin Donnelly, who formerly ran the business department, has set up the new Department for International Trade, which is <a href=\"http://www.govopps.co.uk/global-search-launched-to-recruit-permanent-secretary-for-department-for-international-trade/\">now recruiting</a> for a top civil servant. </p> <p>Fraser warned that the talks would be incredibly difficult, tough and complex. The EU would seek to dissuade other countries from leaving by making it \u201cabsolutely clear there is a price tag attached\u201d to departure. But he believes the UK has some strong cards in its hand.</p> <p>Brexit negotiations will be in four phases. First must come the divorce and separation, under the triggering of Article 50, then the negotiations over the future relationship between the UK and the rest of the EU. But other negotiations must also take place at the same time, including an interim deal to span the time taken for the first two negotiations, and trade negotiations with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Civil servants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/30/divisions-emerge-as-whitehall-draws-up-brexit-scenarios\"> have been asked to assess the impact of a wide range of Brexit scenarios</a>, with reports expected to be fed into the Brexit department run by Davis. </p> <p>Fraser said ministers and politicians would need \u201chard-headed pragmatism\u201d to succeed, but said they can count on the loyalty and professionalism of the civil service. He also said prime minister Theresa May was right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">to announce the date for triggering Article 50</a>, as it would give civil servants and ministers time to formulate their negotiating position. \u201cShe has played her hand well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe task of Whitehall this autumn is to get their heads down and do some hard policy thinking.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/fear-of-uk-civil-service-paralysis-over-eu-negotiations\">Fear of UK civil service paralysis over EU negotiations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But at a time when civil service numbers have been slashed, there is deep concern across Whitehall. The civil service is at its smallest size since the second world war, employing about 392,000 full-time staff \u2013 an 18% drop since the coalition government came to power in 2010. Dave Penman, director general of the FDA union that represents the most senior civil servants, asked Fraser whether the level of cuts could threaten the success of the Brexit negotiations. \u201cClearly we have got to look at that,\u201d responded Fraser, saying if the UK wants to be effective globally, not just in the Brexit negotiations, it must recognise the resources needed. \u201cI am on record as saying that hollowing out the civil service threatens our diplomatic network, for instance.\u201d </p> <p>In June, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, called on the government to begin a rethink of cuts to staffing levels. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to get through this mammoth negotiation, they are going to have to increase resources for a period of time \u2013 and they ought, logically, to put a stop on haemorrhaging people,\u201d he said. </p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The rumours started early on in my career. Having come back from pre-season training a couple of the players in my own dressing room made a joke about me going camping with a team-mate. The innuendo followed me for the whole of my career. If a game I was playing in was quiet the songs would start. \u201cLe Saux takes it up the arse\u201d rang out from the terraces for 15 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/08/martin-oneill-homophobic-football-ireland-homosexuality\">Let Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s gaffe spell the end for homophobia in football | Dan Tickner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I had no support from anybody in football, and in fact a few people made it worse. Suddenly I became the non-gay, gay spokesman in the sport. In some ways, it would have been easier if I had been gay. I could have just stood up and said: \u201cYes I am, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d Instead there was a weird situation of denying it, but at the same time saying there would be nothing wrong if I was.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the dressing room would be incredibly supportive if a team-mate choose to come out now. Society and football as a whole have changed massively since I played, as a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/37760114\">BBC survey</a> this week shows, 92% of fans would have no problem if one of their team\u2019s players was gay. Progress has been made. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/26/majority-fans-gay-players-no-problem\">that still leaves 8%</a> who say they would stop supporting their team if there was a gay player. If that 8% are so appalled at the thought of a gay player being on their team then we should ask them to step forward, own their views and we can just ban them. They\u2019re not welcome in football.</p> <p>When I started out, anybody who was perceived as different was an easy target for the bullying culture and humour that exist in the sport. This was true for black players for many years \u2013 they were treated appallingly and it was seen as a toughening-up exercise. Thankfully that has changed. The game opened its doors to people from different backgrounds and cultures, reflecting a broader societal shift. And that\u2019s always the caveat with football: people may try to focus on the sport as the problem, but it\u2019s only ever reflective of society. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/19/joey-barton-tells-owen-jones-homophobia-not-just-problem-in-football-video\">people\u2019s prejudices were challenged</a> on a regular basis that kind of intolerance was driven out on the terraces and in the dressing room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2838bc78429cd32a44c018d49a1985439eb0d154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2838bc78429cd32a44c018d49a1985439eb0d154/0_95_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Hitzlsperger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Germany international Thomas Hitzlsperger only revealed he was gay after retiring because he wanted to focus on being the best player he could be.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s obviously a huge difference between race and sexuality in terms of visibility. The numbers of black players was obvious \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/13/racism-football-premier-league-campbell\">they had strength in numbers</a>. If a player wanted to come out their support network is less obvious. The Premier League and Germany international Thomas Hitzlsperger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/08/thomas-hitzlsperger-gay-footballer-interview\">only revealed he was gay after retiring</a> because he wanted to focus on trying to be the best player he could be.</p> <p>Football is a highly pressurised arena, so it\u2019s completely understandable why someone would not want to add that extra layer of intrigue, attention and focus. Because whether we like it or not, when a top-level professional footballer does come out the attention on them will be huge. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be abusive, but they will become a role model, a trailblazer for an area of the game that isn\u2019t up to speed with the rest of society. That\u2019s not a responsibility to take on lightly, regardless of how welcoming an environment football can become.</p> <p>At the moment other sports are leading the way \u2013 and rugby league\u2019s Keegan Hirst, of the Wakefield Wildcats, has shown how accepting we can be.</p> <p>I don\u2019t agree with Greg Clarke, the FA chairman, when he says that he doesn\u2019t think football is ready for a gay player to come out, saying it might be a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/37760114\">\u201cyear or two\u201d</a> before it\u2019s safe enough for them to do so. That sends completely the wrong message. A lot has changed in the past five years \u2013 and now I don\u2019t think there is a wrong time for someone to step up and say: \u201cThis is who I am, I\u2019m proud of that, and now it\u2019s up to you in the game to support me.\u201d Everybody has a duty to protect and help that person. The press, the fans, the players, the stewards.</p> <p>But a football pitch will never be a \u201csafe space\u201d \u2013 it isn\u2019t for anyone. If you do something wrong, you\u2019ll get hammered. If you do something right you\u2019re applauded. This is not your regular working environment. Every football song, every dig at a player, every time a team wins or loses, there\u2019s one-upmanship, there\u2019s the mocking of the loser and the gloating of the victor. And that\u2019s not going to change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c59787b6663a132e1906b54d137534c476a12ce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c59787b6663a132e1906b54d137534c476a12ce1/0_60_2688_1613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brighton and Hove Albion defender Shane Duffy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brighton and Hove Albion defender Shane Duffy: \u2018Homophobic abuse used to be commonplace but has been driven out of the stands.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The challenge is in educating people about what is and isn\u2019t an acceptable part of that. I sat in the stands at Chelsea when I was 18 with fans behind me abusing the opposition\u2019s black players, when we had three black players of our own. That doesn\u2019t happen to black players any more \u2013 a racist supporter shouting things is now so isolated they can be removed immediately. That\u2019s where it has to get with homophobia. Sadly there are still 8% as ignorant as those people sat behind me as a kid. It\u2019s mindless. We just have to work harder, to create better education, less tolerance of intolerance, and make sure these people get exposed. That\u2019s already happening \u2013 just look at the shift at <a href=\"http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/brighton-hove-albion-proud-to-support-football-v-homophobia-2948148.aspx\">Brighton and Hove Albion</a>, where homophobic abuse used to be commonplace, but has been effectively driven out of the stands.</p> <p>Success won\u2019t just be about gay players coming out. Success will be everybody feeling welcome in the game. If there are young gay men out there not going into football because they fear they can\u2019t be themselves, or that they\u2019re being judged, then that\u2019s a failure. And that\u2019s what we have to change. Perhaps part of that will be having gay role models, so players coming out will be an important part of that. But let\u2019s not pretend that won\u2019t amplify the media attention around an individual and that\u2019s not football\u2019s fault.</p> <p>We can\u2019t make people feel obliged to come out \u2013 as Hitzlsperger made abundantly clear, the most important thing for a footballer, whether gay or straight, will always be to make the most out of the short career they have. It\u2019s up to us to take up the slack and open up sport to everybody in society and drive homophobia out of football.</p>",
  "<h2>Kolmanskop, Namibia</h2> <p>Sand in itself is not spooky (unless you are frightened by beaches), but desert sand slowly filling a ghost town does rather chill the spirits. This former <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/08/kolmanskop-namib-desert-_n_5431202.html\">German mining town</a> was founded a century ago by diamond hunters, and once sported a ballroom, skittle alley, casino and tram. But the diamonds dried up and the town was abandoned to the elements in 1954. To this day, it is supposedly haunted by the ghosts of miners who died in the brutal heat of the desert. A TV crew for Destination Truth once locked themselves in the meat locker of the old butcher\u2019s shop, and recorded some \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voice_phenomenon\">electronic voice phenomena</a>\u201d of ghosts whispering in their ears \u2013 which is certainly a better story than travelling all the way to the desert and finding nothing supernatural at all.</p> <h2>Prague, Czech Republic<br></h2> <p>Considered by many aficionados to be the most haunted city in Europe, Prague is known for its <a href=\"http://prague-stay.com/lifestyle/review/840-the-headless-templar/\">headless Templar Knight</a>, who is often spotted trotting down the cobbled streets at night gripping his head in one hand. To release the knight from this ghastly doom, a living bystander must grab his sword and stab him in the heart \u2013 a feat that, unsurprisingly, has not yet been accomplished. To the north of the city lies <a href=\"http://www.ghost-story.co.uk/index.php/haunted-castles/250-houska-castle-blatce-czech-republic\">Houska Castle</a>, where Nazi officers supposedly conducted occult experiments during the war; in its grounds lies a building that was allegedly constructed to <a href=\"http://www.mcgeesghosttours.com/gate-to-hell-at-castle-houska/\">cover a hole full of demons</a>. Given the way this year is going, it\u2019s tempting to suspect that some of them have managed to leak out.</p> <h2>Shepherdstown, West Virginia</h2> <p>There\u2019s no shortage of allegedly haunted cities in the US.

However, weird things <a href=\"http://www.shepherdstownchronicle.com/page/content.detail/id/502942/Town-serves-as-home-to-ghosts-from-past.html?nav=5091\">have long been reported</a> in <a href=\"http://historicshepherdstown.com/\">Shepherdstown</a>.

Some say it is the most haunted place in Asia. Yet perhaps the city\u2019s freakiest sight is <a href=\"http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/singapore%E2%80%99s-most-enduring-ghost-stories\">Haw Par Villa</a>, a theme park built in 1937 to illustrate Chinese folklore, and which some people say conceals one of the actual gates of hell. Security guards report weird nocturnal screams, and the exhibits feature creepy waxwork people torturing each other in gruesome detail. Some say these models are actual dead humans covered in wax, which would certainly explain a lot.</p> <h2>Chichen Itza, Mexico</h2> <p>This <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/483\">monumental Mayan city</a> in Yucatan, built around the sixth century, boasts an enormous pyramid, a ball game court, and towering stone statuary and temples. Some pretty amazing things still happen here: for instance, the pyramidal Temple of Kukulcan, devoted to a snake deity, is designed so that on the spring equinox, the sun strikes the stones in such a way as to make it seem as though a serpent is crawling down the pyramid\u2019s side. Chichen Itza also supposedly hosted mass human sacrifices, and tourists and guides now report seeing the ghosts of those killed, and of old priests doomed to wander the city forever.

From 1833, the most vicious criminal recidivists were transported to Port Arthur from Britain. A decade later, a <a href=\"http://portarthur.org.au/activities/separate-prison/\">panopticon-style prison</a> \u2013 inspired by the writings of <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/Bentham-Project/who/panopticon\">Jeremy Bentham</a> \u2013 was built to house them, and its regime induced such despair that many prisoners committed murder in order to escape it by being sentenced to death. It followed the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.convictcreations.com/history/punishments.html\">Silent System</a>\u201d where prisoners were not allowed to talk, were held in solitary confinement, and had to wear hoods when in the company of other prisoners.

A wraith that used to haunt the Golden Fleece pub allegedly followed an American visitor home to tug at her hair every night.

We know some students were doing these procedures at home, with equipment they had taken from the hospital.

  "<p>Along with urban cable cars, bids to stage the Olympics, cycle hire schemes and the building of outposts of the Guggenheim Museum designed by Frank Gehry, creating elected mayors has become one of those ubiquitous remedies for all urban ills. For a while they are presented everywhere as a magic surefire formula, before their attractions fade to make way for the next big thing. But in itself, appointing a mayor is not enough.

So far the phenomenon has been most visible in London and Bristol. Manchester will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/03/manchester-directly-elected-mayor\" title=\"\">choosing its first directly elected mayor next May</a>. The successful candidate will be expected to turbocharge not just the city but an entire region.</p> <p>There is a template in our capital, because the writ of the London mayor covers a wide area. But in governance terms, London and Manchester are very different. It is enough to compare Manchester town hall in all its 19th-century gothic splendour with London\u2019s 21st-century equivalent, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jul/08/arts.highereducation\" title=\"\">the glass testicle</a>\u201d, as Ken Livingstone called it before he took up residence, to begin to see the differences.

Under Tony Blair and his minister for London, city-wide democracy became the equivalent of a chatshow hosted by the mayor, with an invited audience of assembly members. It looks good on television but it fails to hold the mayor to account. The elected members are reduced to a monitoring role, with the right once a year to vote down the&#xa0;budget.</p> <p>Manchester is doing things differently. The new mayor will sit on the Greater Manchester combined authority, alongside the 10 district council leaders, echoing a model that was considered and rejected for London. Whoever wins from the all-male shortlist in Manchester will need their consent for his initiatives on housing, transport and planning. How this works in practice is yet to be seen, but it certainly seems to offer a better chance of heading off the more whimsical policies of the mayors London has attracted.</p> <p>There are lessons good and bad to be drawn from the capital\u2019s experience. Livingstone, who won the first elected mayoralty in 2000, modelled himself on the big city American mayors, visionaries such as Fiorello La Guardia and Ed Koch in New York. To judge by his way of hiring friends and allies there was also a touch of Chicago\u2019s venal Richard Daley, with the imperial style of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in his pyramids at the Louvre phase thrown in.</p> <p>It is inconceivable that a traditionalist Labour local council leader would do what Livingstone did and earmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/09/mugh-muir-diary-nelson-mandela\" title=\"\">\u00a3100,000 from the Greater London Authority budget</a> to defend in court his personal choice of sculptor for a (singularly lifeless) tribute to Nelson Mandela. Nor would such a figure ever have claimed that it was his duty as mayor to lead rather than to listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a968543574b3a0447da61c1d60efd629418a8faf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a968543574b3a0447da61c1d60efd629418a8faf/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London\u2019s Heron Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London\u2019s Heron Tower: \u2018Ken Livingstone had the shameless effrontery to suggest that those trying to stop it erupting on the skyline were the heritage Taliban.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a destiny made manifest in his decisions on everything from aesthetics to congestion charging.</p> <p>Livingstone\u2019s two terms demonstrated both the strengths and weaknesses of the London model. It certainly saw the creation of an impressive transport system, placing the capital far ahead of Paris and New York in that respect. But neither he nor Johnson made London better at offering their electorate affordable homes than any other British city.</p> <p>The London mayoral system prefers to outsource than to deliver its services. It encourages candidates with the charisma, and the soundbite style, to win elections. It turns the mayor into a brand, encouraging gestural planning and expensive political gestures that have unintended consequences.</p> <p>The London we see now is a product of such gestures. No traditional local government in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/14/garden-bridge-half-truths-deceptions-evasions-thames-london-rowan-moore\" title=\"\">would have backed the garden bridge</a>, as Johnson did so expensively. No council leader would have had Livingstone\u2019s shameless effrontery to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-80453915/heritage-taliban-in-retreat-after-heron-inquiry\" title=\"\">those trying to stop the Heron Tower erupting on the skyline were the \u201cheritage Taliban\u201d</a>. The Heron Tower turned out to be a 46-storey-high battering ram, tipped by a decorative steel needle that tore its way through London\u2019s planning system.</p> <p>This history is important because Livingstone set a model for other mayors in Britain. Liverpool\u2019s Joe Anderson recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/12/opponents-of-new-liverpool-tower-block-are-luddites-says-mayor\" title=\"\">called the objectors to his plan to allow a 22-storey tower</a> to rise next to St George\u2019s Hall, the city\u2019s Grade I listed masterpiece, \u201cluddites\u201d. Livingstone personally made the Shard possible by insisting Transport for London lease 10 floors, transforming the, up until then, fragile finances for the project. Despite coming to power with a promise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/boris-johnson-proper-debate-london-skyline\" title=\"\">to end what he called the phallocracy of the new towers</a>, in Johnson\u2019s time the city turned into the forest of high rises that nobody voted for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14984c2bff2d6a8f7237994e37e237dfc42b83c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14984c2bff2d6a8f7237994e37e237dfc42b83c7/0_199_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Georges Hall, Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Georges Hall, Liverpool: mayor Joe Anderson called objectors to his plan to allow a 22-storey tower to rise next to the city\u2019s Grade I listed masterpiece \u2018luddites\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Paterson/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It need not be like this. Mayors don\u2019t always use their powers in pursuit of private aesthetic obsessions. Bogot\u00e1, for example, has been well served by a succession of mayors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/17/enrique-penalosa-mayor-bogota-colombia-bus-traffic-un-habitat\" title=\"\">notably Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa</a>, who created new parks, tamed traffic, pushed cars off the pavements, invested in schools, and utilised sophisticated bus lanes as a low-cost alternative to a metro.</p> <p>In 2015, a Conservative chancellor, who though he did not yet know it was on the edge of political oblivion, spelled out the creation of a northern super city. The new Manchester mayor is one step in that process. It is not an obvious fit. Manchester\u2019s town hall was built for a more traditional form of local government that is no longer fashionable. It housed a city corporation equipped to take on every aspect of the wellbeing of its citizens. It was a paraphrase of Westminster government, with a ceremonial role for the mayor, a leader and a civil service. So the transition will require a good deal of adaptation.</p> <p>Those who lead will also need the capacity to cope with the controlling instincts of Theresa May, who finds power in the hands of cities troubling. France abolished the post of mayor of Paris on four separate occasions. Margaret Thatcher snuffed out two decades of London-wide local government.</p> <p>The Manchester experiment must be given a fair opportunity to succeed or fail, because local democracy is too important to be at the mercy of vendettas or changing fashions in planning policy, especially when instability plagues national politics in Britain. A strong mayor, with the right powers and resources, might yet rediscover the civic virtues that Manchester\u2019s town hall continues to embody. They might also be the most credible example for municipalities elsewhere.</p>",

Management has helped conserve this unique landscape, whereas elsewhere in Britain it has been lost to afforestation, windfarms or overgrazing.\u201d</p> <p>Grouse shooting in England and Wales leads to more than \u00a315m a year being spent in rural areas and supports more than 1,500 jobs, according to Anderson.

So this week it was two men in matching Akubras, touching their way around Queensland.</p> <p>But touching can be a two-way street and, this week, Rockhampton touched back. When Turnbull arrived in the beef capital on Thursday, he was welcomed by the local paper, the Morning Bulletin, <a href=\"http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/time-for-a-fair-go-pm/3104899/\">which chose to depict him on page one as a cartoon clown.</a><br></p> <p>There was no subtlety in the paper\u2019s message.</p> <p>An editorial accompanying Malcolm the clown declared central Queenslanders \u201cdie earlier than your neighbours in Wentworth, Sydney\u201d (Mr Harbourside Mansion was implied, not stated). It said people were poorer, had worse health outcomes and fewer job opportunities. \u201cSo far, your government has failed to demonstrate it has a coherent plan to move the dial,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The Morning Bulletin noted there was now a new player in the political mix in Canberra. \u201cThere are any number of reasons Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party is surging in the polls in this area. A lack of faith our people have that the two parties will make a difference is a key one of those.\u201d</p> <p>Hint hint, Malcolm. We\u2019ve got Pauline, the dynamic red, so you\u2019d better bloody pull your finger out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/17/newspoll-suggests-one-nation-may-become-a-persistent-thorn-in-coalitions-side\">Newspoll suggests One Nation may become a persistent thorn in Coalition's side</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve reached the point in the story where I tell you Turnbull, Joyce and Canavan weren\u2019t the only politicians winding their way through Queensland.<br></p> <p>Hanson was in Gympie, <a href=\"http://www.gympietimes.com.au/news/pauline-hanson-sets-her-sights-on-gympie/3104425/\">smiling beatifically out of the pages of the local paper</a>. Next week, with parliament still in a brief hiatus before the big sprint to Christmas, she\u2019ll be in Charleville, Longreach, Palm Island and Maryborough.</p> <p>\u201cPeople now feel they do have a voice on the floor of parliament \u2013 that someone is actually listening to them,\u201d Hanson told the Gympie Times. \u201cThe political patsies are out of touch and the issues faced here, including unemployment, are being faced across the country as well.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are sick and tired of the stranglehold the major political parties have on the people. They\u2019re struggling in many areas, including a downturn in manufacturing and higher costs of living \u2013 they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being listened to.\u201d</p> <p>Hanson now has licence as a Queensland senator to travel throughout the state, the benefit of political incumbency for a micro-party used to campaigning on the smell of an oily rag. Her profile as a Queensland senator gives her a significant springboard to build her fanbase among the disaffected in a state in the middle of a difficult economic transition.</p> <p>Cleverly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/pauline-hanson-gets-prized-nationals-spot-on-nbn-committee\">she has also got herself on parliament\u2019s national broadband committee</a>, which not only puts her in the centre of one of the most red-hot political issues west of the divide, it also allows her to move with her committee colleagues around the country at taxpayer expense in the event the committee decides to travel.</p> <p>Current indications suggest she\u2019s right on to it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/28/pauline-hanson-tells-government-to-back-broadband-cable-for-norfolk-island\">This week, Hanson was spruiking for the forgotten people of Norfolk Island</a>, asking the government to underwrite a plan to connect the island to a new fibre optic cable stretching between Australia and New Zealand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson is back, and it's still just as hard to counter her rhetoric with facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you happened to miss Hanson\u2019s deft quickstep with the NBN committee, it\u2019s worth a brief recount. She made it known to the government she wanted to be on that committee, but inconveniently, she lacked the numbers to win a Senate ballot.</p> <p>John Williams, the veteran, independently minded National senator, was prevailed upon by the government Senate leadership to give up his spot. Williams went graciously, which really was big of him, given Hanson is coming after the Nationals\u2019 bush constituency in no uncertain terms, and there are a bunch of Liberals still on the NBN committee who clearly didn\u2019t make way. Now, there is only one National on the NBN committee. Such is life, or politics, in any event.</p> <p>Tracking back to the week, when Joyce wasn\u2019t touching things with the prime minister in Queensland, he was at the National Farmers Federation national congress in Canberra (with Pauline and Katter).</p> <p>Joyce\u2019s political career in Canberra runs in cycles. Sometimes he\u2019s leashed, largely because Liberal colleagues insist that he is. Other times he\u2019s completely off the leash, either because he can\u2019t bear the constraints of Canberra\u2019s talking point orthodoxies a moment longer, or because it\u2019s politically convenient for the government that the leash comes off.</p> <p>You might have noticed we are back in an unleashed period, a let-Barnaby-be-Barnaby moment, and the unleashing relates to political convenience.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/barnaby-joyce-derides-labor-as-communists-in-front-of-chinese-ambassador\">At the NFF, Joyce found his inner Pauline</a>, sounding identical to the One Nation leader on the subject of foreign investment, even though the Turnbull government\u2019s policy is to welcome foreign investment.</p> <p>Warming to his Trumpesque, heavy-on-sovereignty light-on-facts theme, Joyce declared floridly at the NFF: knees up, people are not prepared to \u201cdie for a rented country\u201d. \u201cThe love of one\u2019s country is best delivered when you own that country,\u201d Joyce reasoned. He noted in a subsequent radio interview that people tend to love something more when they own it.</p> <p>And here, we land squarely on the Turnbull government\u2019s dilemma.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/30/please-prime-minister-burst-the-bubbles-of-self-serving-rhetoric-for-our-sake\">Please, prime minister, burst the bubbles of self-serving rhetoric \u2013 for our sake | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The One Nation bloc is four votes in the new Senate. Hanson needs to be appeased inside the parliament, because those votes will be periodically necessary. She\u2019s a swing vote to cultivate. War isn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>But outside the parliamentary precinct, she\u2019s diabolical trouble. One Nation, if it gets its act together in this parliament, poses an existential threat to the Coalition\u2019s core vote. Hanson needs to be neutralised outside the parliament.</p> <p>So the Turnbull government has to make some important decisions.</p> <p>From my vantage point, the options look like this. The government could try and neutralise Hansonism by strengthening the position of the Nationals in the bush with a combination of head patting and cash, and \u201cletting Barnaby be Barnaby\u201d.</p> <p>But things could get complicated. If the political pressure starts to rise on the Nationals, we could see Barnaby off the leash not only with a burst of front-bar whimsy, but with a list of demands for serious revisionism on policy.</p> <p>The trade-off during the Howard period between the Liberals and the Nationals was crude, but highly successful: Nationals toed the line on economic rationalism and, in turn, the money flowed to regional electorates.</p> <p>But we are a distance from the placid consensus vibe of the Howard era. We\u2019ve entered peak fractious and if things get too hot in the bush, the Nationals might seek new terms of engagement.</p> <p>The government will then have a choice. It can lurch into populism and follow Hanson down the path of Hansonism, or it could hug the middle with some practical action.</p> <p>One way of combatting the forces giving rise to Trump and Hanson and the Brexiteers is to start thinking more deeply about equity, which, I now believe, is an unavoidable conversation for the centre right. One way to address the anger and alienation with major party politics in Rockhampton is start connecting with the losers of three decades of economic transformation. Yes, really.</p> <p>One of the more interesting interventions in recent times came from Turnbull\u2019s departmental head, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/australia-must-deliver-benefits-of-globalisation-to-win-public-support-top-public-servant\">who argued in favour of redistributive policies</a> as a mechanism for rebuilding public consensus for open economies in an atmosphere of rising protectionism.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call that one the better-angels recourse.</p> <p>Make no mistake, this will be one of the most fascinating plays of this parliamentary term.</p>",

Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d says a senior official. They\u2019re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans. Trump\u2019s invocation at the debate of Clinton\u2019s WikiLeaks emails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are \u201csuper predators\u201d is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls \u2013 particularly in Florida.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaGreen/status/791587739246309376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.

  "<p>United Nations member states have <a href=\"http://reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/1com/1com16/resolutions/L41.pdf\">voted overwhelmingly to start negotiations on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons</a>, despite strong opposition from nuclear-armed nations and their allies.</p> <p>In the vote in the UN disarmament and international security committee on Thursday, 123 nations were in favour of the resolution, 38 opposed and 16 abstained.</p> <p>Nuclear powers the United States, Russia, Israel, France and the United Kingdom were among those that opposed the measure.<br></p> <p>Australia, as forecast last week, and as a long-time dependant on the US\u2019s extended nuclear deterrence, also <a href=\"http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/results/\">voted no</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/australia-will-not-support-negotiations-to-outlaw-nuclear-weapons\">Australia will not support negotiations to outlaw nuclear weapons</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/1com/1com16/resolutions/L41.pdf\">The resolution</a> now goes to a full general assembly vote some time in December.<br></p> <p>The resolution aims to hold a conference in March 2017 to negotiate a \u201clegally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination\u201d.<br></p> <p>Support for a ban treaty has been growing steadily over months of negotiations, but it has no support from the nine known nuclear states \u2013 the US, China, France, Britain, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a> \u2013 which includes the veto-wielding permanent five members of the security council.</p> <p>But Australia has been the most outspoken of the non-nuclear states. </p> <p>During months of negotiations, Australia has lobbied other countries, pressing the case for what it describes as a \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d approach of engaging with nuclear powers to reduce the global stockpile of 15,000 weapons.<br></p> <p>Australia has consistently maintained that as long as nuclear weapons exist, it must rely on the protection of the deterrent effect of the US\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the second largest in the world.</p> <p>When he appeared before Senate estimates last week, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u2019s assistant secretary, Richard Sadleir, forecast Australia\u2019s rejection of the vote: \u201cConsistent with the position to that we took to the open-ended working group (into nuclear disarmament) report, we will be voting no with respect to that resolution.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/banning-nuclear-weapons-is-crucial-for-global-health\">Banning nuclear weapons is crucial for global health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadleir said Australia\u2019s position on nuclear disarmament was \u201cconsistent and clear\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not support a ban treaty,\u201d he said. \u201cA ban treaty that does not include the nuclear weapons states, those states which possess nuclear weapons, and is disconnected from the rest of the security environment, would be counterproductive and not lead to reductions in nuclear arsenals.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Tilman Ruff, founding chair of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons and co-president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, said the vote was a \u201chistoric step\u201d for the world that \u201cheralds an end to two decades of paralysis in multilateral nuclear disarmament\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers are especially encouraging given the ferocious pressure on countries to vote no by the nuclear-armed states, who see that this will fundamentally challenge their continued possession of nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe treaty will fill the legal gap by which the most destructive of all weapons \u2013 nuclear weapons \u2013 are the only weapon of mass destruction to not yet be outlawed by international treaty.\u201d</p> <p>Ruff said Australia should reverse its opposition \u201cand get on the right side of humanity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is doing dirty work for Washington, and is willing for US nuclear weapons to be used on its behalf, and potentially with its assistance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is inconceivable that Australia would not eventually sign up to a treaty prohibiting the last to be banned and worst [weapons of mass destruction]. We\u2019ve signed every other treaty banning an unacceptable weapon, and on some, like chemical weapons, we were a leader.\u201d</p> <p>Ruff said that given there were no nuclear disarmament negotiations under way or planned, a ban treaty was the only feasible path towards ridding the world of nuclear weapons available now. </p> <p>The efficacy of a ban treaty is a matter of fierce debate.<br></p> <p>Without the participation of the states that actually possess nuclear weapons, critics argue it cannot succeed. But proponents say a nuclear weapons ban will create moral suasion \u2013 in the vein of the cluster and landmine conventions \u2013 for nuclear weapons states to disarm, and establish an international norm prohibiting nuclear weapons\u2019 development, possession and use.</p> <p>Non-nuclear states have expressed increasing frustration with the current nuclear regime and the sclerotic movement towards disarmament.</p> <p>With nuclear weapons states modernising and in some cases increasing their arsenals, instead of discarding them, more states are becoming disenchanted with the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text\">nuclear non-proliferation treaty</a> and lending their support for an outright ban.</p>"
