  "<p>Friday\u2019s meeting of every energy minister in Australia is looking to be at risk of bowing to gas industry demands and sparking a run on gas development around the country to head off a supposed shortage.<br></p> <p>If they do that, it will be in the absence of any clear picture of actual gas supplies in Australia.</p> <p>It will also happen amid concerns that those new supplies will land in the hands of the companies that already own most of the gas, and so do nothing to increase competition \u2013 the task that many say is the key to lowering energy prices around the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/australian-gas-40-cheaper-japan-than-australia-despite-export-costs\">Australian gas 40% cheaper in Japan than in Australia despite export costs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gas prices have been rising. Those rising gas prices have led to a rise in electricity prices. And when wholesale electricity prices reached extreme levels in the first couple of weeks of July, the gas industry smelled blood.</p> <p>\u201cGas-fired plant is ideal for responding rapidly to spikes in demand or sudden falls in renewable output,\u201d Malcolm Roberts, chief executive of the oil and gas industry lobby group APPEA <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/the-power-of-gasfired-electricity-generation/news-story/77b83cb89d4344c13b41ae5aa5868a19\">said in the Australian</a> newspaper.</p> <p>He argued that gas generators were getting squeezed out of the market by renewables and called for policies that encouraged more gas exploration to occur, \u201cotherwise eastern Australia will face a supply-side crunch\u201d.</p> <p>Three days later, the Council of Australian Governments energy meeting was called. Josh Frydenberg, the federal minister for environment and energy, said the meeting would discuss gas supply, among other things.</p> <p>Later that week Frydenberg went on <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4508656.htm\">ABC\u2019s Lateline and said</a>: \u201cWe need more gas supply. And more gas supplies in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Soon state ministers appeared to get on board. On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/gas-crisis-fears-drive-reform-on-csg-projects/news-story/d2c8a0bd10b8a3b8e37fc4b359e83134\">unnamed sources told News Corp</a> Australia that they were considering allowing the expansion of coal seam gas. In New South Wales that would mean weakening environmental regulations, and in Victoria it would mean lifting a state-wide ban.</p> <p>But if that happens, it will be despite the policy makers having no knowledge of whether there is actually any gas shortage at all. And it will happen despite the gas prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/energy-companies-withholding-supply-to-blame-for-july-price-spike-report-finds\">not being the main cause of those extreme prices in South Australia</a>.</p> <p>In April the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/release-of-east-coast-gas-inquiry-report-into-the-increasingly-complex-and-uncertain-gas-market\">released its inquiry</a> into the east coast gas market. The ACCC recommended that more information about gas supplies, as well as financial information, should be disclosed.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of consistent, publicly available data on the sector is an impediment to participants, investors and policy makers,\u201d he said. (Nevertheless, the ACCC did go on to also call for more gas supplies to be opened up.)</p> <p>But state policy makers already knew they were acting in the dark. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/lack-of-transparency-on-gas-market-could-lead-to-taxpayer-ripoff-in-pipeline-folly-20140829-109xzg.html\">As reported by Fairfax Media</a>, in 2012 the NSW energy minister, Anthony Roberts, told a parliamentary committee exactly that.</p> <p>Tony Wood from the Grattan Institute told Guardian Australia that more information would help the market operate better. \u201cIt would be valuable \u2013 and this is not unusual in the world, by the way \u2013 to have the major resource companies publish their forward resources on the basis of a standard, agreed methodology.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly makes sense if you have a fight over whether we have enough gas.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce Robertson, a gas market analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, agrees. \u201cThey have got to insist on consistent disclosure of reserves and resources in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do it in the US so it\u2019s not a big deal or a radical proposal.\u201d</p> <p>In a promising sign, Frydenberg said on ABC\u2019s AM program on Friday that there would be agreements at the Coag meeting on that would be \u201cdesigned to create greater liquidity and transparency in pricing\u201d.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe do have an abundance of gas, but we have very secret, long-term contracts which don\u2019t produce enough efficient competition in pricing, and we\u2019re going to change that today.\u201d</p> <p>But for Robertson, the main issue was breaking up what he said was basically a cartel with both the gas producers and the pipeline operators.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/ross-garnaut-says-australia-facing-looming-economic-time-bombs\">Ross Garnaut says Australia facing looming economic 'time bombs'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said given that the gas producers such as BHP have claimed they have plenty of gas, the only thing driving up prices can be an exploitation of market power. Again, that was something identified by the ACCC inquiry, which concluded: \u201cThere are currently very few constraints on monopoly pricing by pipeline operators.\u201d</p> <p>Simms said in April: \u201cThe difference between a competitive market and an uncompetitive market in south-eastern Australia could be as much as $4 a gigajoule for wholesale gas.\u201d </p> <p>Robertson points out that if the price rises are a result of a lack of competition, then increasing the supply of gas won\u2019t help \u2013 it would still be owned by the same operators and transported through the same pipelines.</p> <p>Wood agreed that there was a need to break up what is known as a \u201cBass Strait joint marketing venture\u201d which allows the two main operators there \u2013 BHP Billiton and ExxonMobil \u2013 to sell as a bloc.</p> <p>But Wood thinks lifting blanket bans on CSG \u2013 like the one in Victoria \u2013 is a good move. Breaking blocs of gas companies, and forcing them to release more information, are two ways that the gas market could be improved, which would have knock-on effects for the electricity market.</p> <p>But many others are pointing out a plethora of other options that Coag should consider. A big coalition of conservation and community groups, including Solar Citizens and GetUp, issued a joint statement calling for the Coag energy council to focus on developing a plan to move towards 100% renewable energy. The logic is that besides being essential to meet climate change targets, competition with the gas operators doesn\u2019t have to come from other gas operators \u2013 renewable energy can also do that.</p> <p>The Greens made similar calls. Their deputy leader, Adam Bandt, said: \u201cThe energy ministers must enable Australia to become a renewable energy superpower instead of protecting the rent seekers in the fossil fuel industry.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/cost-of-stopping-new-coal-and-gas-projects-in-freefall-costings-reveal\">Cost of stopping new coal and gas projects in freefall, costings reveal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And South Australia\u2019s energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, who has been at the centre of this national debate, has also emphasised the role of new technology in fixing the energy market. \u201cBattery storage of renewable energy is also an exciting technology that, as it develops, will be a game changer and will dramatically bring down costs as cheap renewable energy is able to be delivered around-the-clock,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c... Currently, the [national electricity market] is not working, the gas market is not working and climate policy has not been integrated into energy policy, and that is leading to consumers paying too much for power.</p> <p>\u201cThis is now an urgent issue that requires the ministers to take back power in decision making, form a consensus and agree to a reform of the energy market.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens at the Coag energy council meeting, the importance of good national policy on energy is hard to overstate, sitting at the very base of both the economy and the environment.</p>",
  "<p>Cleaners who scrub toilets and change sheets for the world\u2019s elite sportsmen and women at the athletes\u2019 village in Rio earn less than \u00a310 a day, the Guardian has learned, even though many leave home at 4am and return from their Olympic workplace after 9pm.</p> <p>Their wages, indirectly paid by the UK service company Clean Event, are less than half what a housekeeper in Rio can expect and sit uneasily with the first-world service demanded by the International Olympic Committee.</p> <p>The figure also contrasts sharply with the \u00a3700 daily stipend paid to IOC executive members, who also get free hotel accommodation and flights.</p> <p>The cleaners are easy to spot at the workers\u2019 entrance of the village. Almost all are black women in blue uniforms printed with \u201chousekeeper\u201d. Around their necks are entry passes issued by Clean Event, though they work directly for a Swiss human resources subcontractor, Adecco.</p> <p>In a grim labour market, with unemployment at a record 11.3%, many are grateful for any job. But few laud the pay and conditions. One young woman, who requested anonymity, said cleaners were sometimes asked to do tasks outside their job description \u2013 such as clearing construction site debris. They were also banished from the grassy plaza provided for athletes and so had to rest in smoking areas, and often missed lunch because of long canteen queues.</p> <p>When cleaners fell sick or had an accident, she said, they were initially prohibited from using the main medical centre in the athletes\u2019 village, which was reserved for Olympic competitors. Instead they had to go to public hospitals farther away. This policy had subsequently been changed, she said, after the workers complained they were being treated like animals.</p> <p>But there are still problems. A second cleaner said an elderly worker fainted with a suspected heart attack. Police, rather than medical staff, removed her from the village. \u201cNo ambulances arrived because the preference is for the athletes. It\u2019s humiliation at every turn,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cleaners are paid 5.91 reals (\u00a31.40) an hour. But deductions for food, transport and insurance left some earning little more than \u00a31 an hour for their eight-hour shift. The return on their time invested was even worse when commuting times were included. Rio\u2019s sprawl and poor public transport networks mean some have to travel more than two hours each way. The pay \u2013 just above the minimum wage \u2013 is legal but at odds with the global standards expected inside the Olympic bubble.</p> <p>\u201cThe athletes must be aware of our working conditions because they can see the poor quality of the work we do. There are too many buildings, not enough staff and no real incentive to do a good job,\u201d said a third cleaner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/07/rio-olympic-park-contruction-workers-clash-security-guards\">Rio Olympic Park construction workers clash with security guards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All six cleaners interviewed by the Guardian complained of long lines for the canteen, which offered food that was described as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cdisgusting\u201d even though the cost was subtracted from their pay.</p> <p>Most said they accepted the conditions and were glad of the chance to earn money and see Olympic athletes. Their proximity \u2013 and lack of adequate training and supervision \u2013 has contributed to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-06/rio-2016-moroccan-boxer-arrested-for-alleged-sexual-assault/7696532\">cases of sexual harassment against athletes</a>, as well as accusations of theft and prostitution by cleaners. A few crimes have been proven but the innocent majority are also suffering from guilt by association.</p> <p>\u201cWe are being treated like dogs, like thieves,\u201d said the second cleaner. \u201cWe often receive gifts from the athletes. They sign authorisations and we take pictures with them to prove that they gave the present to us. We also get signatures from our supervisors. But the security guards forbid us from leaving with the gifts, because they think we stole them. We can\u2019t wear brand-name tennis shoes because we\u2019ll be accused of theft.\u201d</p> <p>Observers at the village said the situation was humiliating and unjust.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a mess. The companies that are involved are closing their eyes,\u201d said a Brazilian volunteer inside the athletes\u2019 village, who said all of the cleaners were Afro-Brazilians from poor backgrounds. \u201cThe foreign service companies get a big contract and then pay this shameful amount of money because they choose the poorest workers. They couldn\u2019t do that in Sydney and London but they do that in Brazil. I feel bad about that.\u201d</p> <p>However, Manuel Thedim, director of the Institute of Work and Society, said broader problems were to blame for the discrepancies in conditions in London and Rio.</p> <p>\u201cThe world isn\u2019t a pretty place. If the productivity is less in Brazil, you pay less.\u201d He said the salary was not absurdly low: although house cleaners in middle class families could earn 60% more, he said, they tended to have higher social capital and better contacts.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s labour ministry said it had notified Adecco about irregularities in the village, including food and equipment lapses that put workers at risk.</p> <p>Clean Event offices in Rio and London did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>In a statement, the Rio 2016 Olympic Organising Committee expressed respect for labour rights and said it insisted that \u201ccontractors are in compliance with current legislation in Brazil\u201d.</p> <p>It has previously acknowledged security problems in the Olympic Village, which has a workforce of 5,000 people for its 18,000 guests, and controls have been tightened, including repositioning cameras to monitor people as they arrive and leave.</p>",
  "<p><em></em><em></em>Elysium Ranches, a housing development near Islamabad, was supposed to be a paradise. Spread over six sq miles of land, it would boast luxurious \u201cfarmhouses\u201d costing up to \u00a3340,000 each, a seven-star hotel and an international-standard golf course to ensure it was \u201cthe ultimate place of happiness and tranquillity for its residents\u201d.</p> <p>Or so promised the scheme\u2019s glossy 2009 corporate prospectus, which predicted revenues of \u00a3493m. The public would buy their slice of heaven from Pakistan\u2019s most powerful and respected institution, the army.</p> <p>But seven years on there is nothing to show for the project except furious investors who say they paid for ranches that never materialised. </p> <p>A corruption investigation has looked into senior retired officers, including relatives of the army\u2019s former chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who for many years was the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/23/pakistan-army-general-kayani\">most powerful figure in the country</a>.</p> <p>Also under examination are three <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1234554\">former managers</a> of the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), a wing of the army that builds developments to house senior retired officers and also makes enormous profits selling homes to civilians. They deny any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The DHAs, which enjoy special legal privileges and operate in cities across the country, are just one part of a vast military business empire that is unique to Pakistan. It encompasses everything from banks to factories and is rarely subject to scrutiny.</p> <p>According to Ayesha Siddiqa, a critic of the military\u2019s entanglement in business, it is a recipe for corruption. \u201cIn the name of providing defence as a public good, the army is constantly furthering its own corporate interests and those of a small elite of retired senior officers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Elysium Ranches is one of three disastrous real estate ventures by the army in recent years, all of which have involved partnerships with well-connected private companies that were supposed to pay handsomely for the privilege of using the army\u2019s DHA brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d4d878320a1b0627686dce6c78b6f715e5d4a2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4d878320a1b0627686dce6c78b6f715e5d4a2d/0_0_764_458/500.jpg\" alt=\"General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inter Services Public Relations/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The partner in the Ranches project was Elysium Holdings, a company linked to three brothers of Kayani, who served as army chief from 2007 to 2013.</p> <p>So far two former senior DHA officials have been arrested, along with Waseem Aslam Butt, the former chief executive of Elysium Holdings, who claims he has been used as a scapegoat to protect Kayani\u2019s brothers.<br></p> <p>The 2009 prospectus plays up the military connection. Babur Kayani, one of four directors, is described as a member of \u201ca family that has been involved in the security and armed forces of Pakistan for three generations\u201d. A profile of Amjad Kayani\u2019s stresses his \u201cvery close connections\u201d to the DHA.<br></p> <p>Amjad Kayani was <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1237345\">questioned by the National Accountability Bureau</a> in February. Neither he, Babur nor a third brother, Kamran, have been arrested or charged with any offence.</p> <p>Kamran Kayani was also involved in a Lahore venture called DHA City, which is under investigation for not being delivered despite a reported \u00a3100m having been collected from customers.</p> <p>Perhaps the most spectacular failure was one the Kayanis were not involved in, DHA Valley, a vast new suburb that was to be built adjacent to Elysium Ranches and was to offer relatively affordable housing to junior officers and less affluent civilians.</p> <p>More than 150,000 customers rushed to make payments totalling a reported \u00a3400m when the scheme was announced in 2009. Seven years later almost no work has been done and much of the land that was supposed to be turned into suburbs has been earmarked for a new water reservoir.</p> <p>The Guardian approached the DHA and the office of the army\u2019s spokesman with questions about all three scandals but neither agreed to speak.</p> <p>The fact that all three scandals are being investigated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has been credited to Raheel Sharif, a popular general who has been army chief since November 2013.</p> <p>One retired general who served under Kayani said Sharif was determined to clean up an institution he believed should be focused on defending the country and not building luxury housing.</p> <p>\u201cHe is a professional soldier, not a praetorian soldier,\u201d said the retired general. \u201cHe comes from a distinguished military family and has always been under that much extra pressure to meet those high standards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3b8462a6e42f27f65e14b55c3aa0aac2d081285\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b8462a6e42f27f65e14b55c3aa0aac2d081285/0_299_4802_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People play street cricket in a DHA suburb in Karachi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People play street cricket in a DHA suburb in Karachi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scandals involving the military are often hushed up. Retired officers have even been brought back into service in order to deal with their cases through closed-door courts martial. Those found guilty are rarely imprisoned but forced to step down or stripped of some of their retirement privileges.</p> <p>In April the army chief won plaudits after it was publicly revealed that six officers had been sacked for corruption. The step was widely interpreted as an attempt to set an example to Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, who was pitched into a political crisis after his children were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/apr/05/pakistan-prime-minister-nawaz-sharif-children-deutsche-bank-panama-papers\">named in the Panama Papers leak</a> as being linked to offshore companies.</p> <p>Nawaz Sharif and the government have pointed out that none of the offshore companies were in his name, and vigorously denied any wrongdoing. His son, who owned one company, and his daughter, who was a trustee of another, have also protested their innocence.</p> <p>Earlier Raheel Sharif, the army chief, had called for \u201cacross-the-board accountability\u201d and said it would not be possible to end terrorism unless \u201cthe menace of corruption is uprooted\u201d.</p> <p>The NAB investigations into Elysium Ranches and DHA City are all the more striking because of the involvement of the Kayani brothers, who have issued public statements staunchly denying any wrongdoing. They also insist their older brother, the ex-army chief, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/89519-Gen-Kayani-had-no-role-in-our-business-says-brother\">had nothing to do with their business interests</a>.

The broad bay of the seafront has long provided a multi-element recreational course for the more determined Cariocas \u2013 a place where bronzed, shirtless septuagenarians plod unstoppably past the drinks shacks and meat stalls, where everyone from wobbling, Lycra\u2019d-up 40-somethings to the six-packed beach boys and bikini girls indulges in a little athletic bodily display.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/18/brownlee-brothers-gold-silver-olympic-triathlon-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vbn7\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2665852\"            data-video-name=\"Team GB's Brownlee brothers take gold and silver in triathlon - video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b5dd93e4b0c23bfed8ab51\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/18/160818brownlee_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/18/160818brownlee.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/18/160818brownlee_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/18/brownlee-brothers-gold-silver-olympic-triathlon-video\">Team GB\u2019s Brownlee brothers take gold and silver in triathlon</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Rio embraced the triathlon here, with large crowds, cheers as the athletes passed and rows of flags across the art deco blocks on the front. Afterwards both Brownlees praised the course, including the water, which has been an object of sewage-based fascination over the last year. \u201cThe water on the beach was absolutely fine. I\u2019ve seen nothing in it to worry about. I\u2019ve certainly swum in worse,\u201d Alistair said, a moment of gallantry that will delight his hosts.</p> <p>The swim had produced a bunched start, the field disappearing toward the near horizon like a pod of angry dolphins. Less than 20 minutes later the Brownlees sprinted from the sea in a narrow fifth and sixth. A few laps into the bike stage the breakaway came, the brothers leading a group of 10 away from the field. There was a moment of sadness for the third Brit, Gordon Benson, who crashed his bike and emerged later with some fairly brutal looking wounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2d83d860a9470327e7d8a49af4b01d2c96a8be2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2d83d860a9470327e7d8a49af4b01d2c96a8be2/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee rest after crossing the finish line, with Union Jack and White Rose of Yorkshire flags.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee rest after crossing the finish line, with Union Jack and White Rose of Yorkshire flags.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over to you then, Jonny and Ali. The decisive spurt came midway through the run. Alistair spotted a slackening in the lead group and called out to his brother to push on together. For a moment there was the stark spectacle of the two streaking away alone in the Rio sun. Then with a lap and a bit to go, Alistair kicked for home, producing a burst of speed that burnt his brother off, a devastating act of racing will.</p> <p>There is, of course, a fascinating sibling dynamic here. Two years older at 28, Alistair still projects the assertive, slightly edgy drive that often seems to motivate an elder sibling. \u201cI\u2019ll never let him win,\u201d he joked ahead of this race. And so he didn\u2019t. These are proper competitors in every sense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/alistair-jonny-brownlee-rio-triathlon-olympic-games\">Brownlees not so brotherly in run-up to Rio triathlon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed the Brownlee double-act looks like a wonderfully functional family drama, a pair of elite athletes who have risen to the top while remaining accessible, funny, and everyday. A decade ago Alistair abandoned a Cambridge medical degree to return to Leeds, study sport, and concentrate on competing: a decision that has been vindicated beyond any sense of scale.</p> <p>Asked about plans to celebrate, he replied, \u201cWell, I could do with a drink.\u201d Famously, the Brownlees were refused one in a London pub in 2012 after wandering in wearing their medals just after last orders. There should be no such problems on Copacabana, a place where the beer flows like wine and where nothing ever really seems to close. Darlings of the Rio beachfront, architects of one of the genuinely stunning moments of these Olympics, the Brownlees have probably earned more than just the one.</p>",

  "<p>The American swimmer Ryan Lochte was on Thursday accused of making up a story of being robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro, in one of the most bizarre stories to have emerged from the Olympics. <br></p> <p>Lochte, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-rio-robbery-timeline\">whose cool account of confronting armed thieves</a> had gripped America and embarrassed Brazil, has been accused by Rio police of a complete fabrication.

The charges would not carry the threat of jail time under Brazilian law. </p> <p>Instead of escaping the clutches of robbers, Lochte, along with fellow competitors Jack Conger, Gunnar Bentz and Feigen, is alleged to have had a minor altercation with a security guard after damaging property at a Rio petrol station.</p> <p>At a press conference in the seaside district of Leblon, Fernando Veloso, the head of Rio\u2019s civil police, said one of the swimmers had confessed that the story was a lie and blamed Lochte. Veloso said the swimmer told them that Lochte was drunk and stressed, and created the fake story that he then re-told on US television. He did not identify the swimmer. Veloso did not explain why Lochte had given the false story, but said the swimmers were accompanied by two women who had followed in a second car.</p> <p>Police said no charges have been brought against the athletes yet since the case is still under investigation. But the officials appeared angry with Lochte and his team-mates for allegedly manufacturing the account. Lochte had said a man dressed as a police officer had placed a gun against his head and demanded money during a robbery at a gas station.</p> <p>Veloso said none of these things happened and the swimmers were not confronted in a violent manner.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-video-robbery-what-happened-rio-olympics\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vd2j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2666755\"            data-video-name=\"The changing story of swimmer Ryan Lochte\u2019s big night out \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"TV Globo, NBC/Today, Reuters, Getty Images\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b63e6ce4b0c23bfed8acf7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400085&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400085&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400085&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400085&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400085&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/18/ryan-lochte-video-robbery-what-happened-rio-olympics\">The changing story of swimmer Ryan Lochte\u2019s big night out</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe athletes should apologize for what they have done to the people of Rio,\u201d he said.

I\u2019m certainly not above it.

It wasn\u2019t even weed. It was tobacco. From a hookah! It was about the silliest act of rebellion one could imagine, but I still tried to pretend like it didn\u2019t happen. I swore that I didn\u2019t do anything, that I was God\u2019s special little angel on a mission to say please and thank you to everyone I came across. </p> <p>My lie worked up until the hotel called my parents to demand they pay to have the carpet I trashed replaced. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever purchased carpet in Israel, but it\u2019s not cheap.</p> <p>In the moment when my youthful indiscretion came to light, I could have done what Ryan Lochte is reported to have done and concocted an elaborate fib to explain away the mistake. Maybe it was my roommate who burned the carpet? Maybe I was lighting candles for the Sabbath? Perhaps I discovered that I loved the smell of incense at the tender age of 13? What if I was cooking a meal for a hungry transient and I dropped the hot plate I was using on the floor? Could a robber have broken into my room and put out a cigarette?</p> <p>No, of course not. That\u2019s all nonsense. I burned the carpet. I told my parents. They were heartbroken, as you would imagine. How could their perfect angel baby have been smoking anything \u2013 and then damaged private property in the process? It was their first inkling that I might have rebellious tendencies. Actually, the second. I stole a Ghostbusters action figure from a friend when I was six, which I was forced to return in the most public, humiliating way possible. </p> <p>I was a child when these incidents occurred. I also wasn\u2019t participating in a global athletic competition watched by millions of people. There also wasn\u2019t a security camera tape that appeared to show me burning a carpet or stealing a toy. My untruths had way more of a chance to succeed than the ones Ryan Lochte reportedly told. So, what was he really hoping would come of all of this? </p> <p>It might just have been that he wanted to spare his mother the indignity of knowing her son could be the kind of guy who breaks into gas station toilets \u2013 a high-end, medal-winning version of the stereotypical \u201cugly American\u201d tourist. </p> <p>Parents often say that they\u2019d rather their child tell an unpleasant truth than lie to them. I don\u2019t believe that for a second. Granted, I am not a parent yet, but when I am, I\u2019d rather not know my kid was huffing paint or knocking down mailboxes with a tire iron. </p> <p>Blissful ignorance is what I\u2019m after. \u201cCall me when you need bail\u201d is my motto. If Ryan Lochte\u2019s mother was half as chill as that, maybe Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz would still have their passports. </p> <p>Maybe for the next Olympics, every athlete should have to share a room with their mom. Good luck causing any trouble in a foreign country when your mother is snoring a few feet away and knows exactly when your curfew is.

Why are we waiting?<br><strong>Ann and Neil Holmes</strong><br><em>Bromsgrove, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government\u2019s obesity strategy published today was an opportunity to tackle childhood obesity and household food insecurity that has been missed. While welcoming some positive elements in the strategy, such as the targets for reducing sugar content in food and drink, and the commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Healthy Start scheme</a>, we are dismayed by the government\u2019s lack of ambition.</p> <p>We know from the significant bank of evidence that exists on childhood obesity that in order to tackle it we need limits on food marketing to children, continuation of vital public health schemes, and strong targets for the reduction of childhood obesity. Instead the government\u2019s strategy relies on voluntarism, an approach that has so far failed to make any real inroad into childhood obesity.</p> <p>We need a strategy that can stand up against the major spending power of the big food and drink brands. The seven biggest brands alone spend more than \u00a3300m a year on marketing, over 10 times the amount spent on the government\u2019s flagship healthy eating initiative. But this strategy has failed to deliver.</p> <p>It is time for the government to make a real statement on tackling childhood obesity in the UK.

However, we need to think not just about reducing sugar consumption, but promoting physical activity too.</p> <p>We have invested strategically, and successfully, in promoting Olympic cycling. Yet all over Britain, parents are deterred from allowing their children to cycle to school for fear of road danger.</p> <p>The Dutch spend \u00a324 per person annually on creating a cycle-friendly environment, and 49% of pupils there cycle to school.

It\u2019s hardly surprising that 1% of school trips in Britain are cycled, and our obesity rates are significantly higher.</p> <p>As part of its obesity plan, shouldn\u2019t the government use some of its sugar tax revenues for enabling non-athletes of all ages to cycle safely for day-to-day journeys? That would be a hugely cost-effective way not only to tackle obesity, but also congestion, air pollution and climate change. By creating people-friendly streets and communities, it would surely be a fantastic vote-winner too.<br><strong>Roger Geffen</strong><br><em>Policy director, Cycling UK </em></p> <p>\u2022 The government has started consulting on the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks. We are already seeing marketing for sugar-free drinks as being healthier than the originals, and they will now be cheaper.

To expect them to access generic services is unrealistic. We know that sex workers are targeted by violent offenders. Without services to protect and to support them when they are victims, offenders will get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>Georgina Perry, a former manager at Open Doors, a long-established and well regarded NHS service for sex workers in east London, said the service\u2019s funding was being cut by 43%. She resigned last week over the cuts and her concerns that a new funding model, set up by Hackney council, compromised patient confidentiality.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point we had 12 individuals out of 120 living with TB-HIV co-infection,\u201d says Perry. \u201cThese are really terrible statistics. When we first started with our street sex workers virtually 100% of them were homeless, they didn\u2019t have GPs, [and] they were using A&amp;E as their primary care.

Within hours they found me a hostel. They sorted out my housing benefit, my GP and my mental health. I didn\u2019t even have a clean pair of knickers.

They took us out and bought us ice cream; it felt like the family I never had. Then, little by little, without you even noticing, they will take steps back. And then you realise that you are capable, you can be independent. But if you need them, they are there.</p> <p>\u201cMy son wanted to go and start taking drugs, my daughter had stopped going to school. But once I started going to Open Doors, I changed their lives.

  "<p>Earlier this week, according to Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a> died. \u201cWhat an awful thing to wake up this morning and one of the first things you see is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPMileyCyrus&amp;src=typd\">#RIPMileyCyrus</a>!\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePerezHilton/status/765176194425688065\">tweeted Perez Hilton</a>. \u201cMy heart sank! THANKFULLY she\u2019s fine!!\u201d. Having spent most of the day near the top of Twitter\u2019s list of worldwide trends \u2013 so often in 2016 a morbid roll call of genuine celebrity deaths \u2013 it took a while for people to work out how and why a hashtag proclaiming the death of a very much alive pop star had captured people\u2019s imagination. The answer? Fan wars.</p> <p>Twitter has tended to be a safe-ish medium for pop stars to manipulate when they have something to promote, with the more rabid fans (or \u201cstans\u201d) encouraged to get things trending in order to unlock \u201cexclusive content\u201d. Increasingly, however, hashtags are being used by groups of fans \u2013 \u201cfandoms\u201d \u2013 not to promote stars, but as weapons in the murky world of online wars. Various fandoms, used to feeding off the thrill of interacting with their idols, and emboldened by being grouped together and named (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a>\u2019s Little Monsters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a>\u2019s Beliebers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\">Rihanna</a>\u2019s Navy), have decided to make their own entertainment. Namely, they start Twitter \u201cparties\u201d that prematurely celebrate the end of a pop star\u2019s career (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/charlieputhisoverparty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#CharliePuthIsOverParty</a> trended on Wednesday after the singer allegedly replied to a fan with the word \u201cdie\u201d).</p> <p>So what brought about Cyrus\u2019s Twitter-only death? The hashtag was <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/3420254/miley-cyrus-racist-twitter-exo-kpop-trend-ripmileycyrus/\">traced back to a fallout between fans of Bieber and those of K-Pop boyband Exo</a>. Both said their idols were more popular after the two performed on the same night in separate venues. A fan of Cyrus, perhaps noticing an opportunity to throw the cat in among the already excitable pigeons, made some fairly derogatory comments about K-pop fans, and the hashtag emerged shortly after (as with most of these trending hashtags, it\u2019s unclear exactly who started it; some K-pop fans even accused Cyrus fans of doing it to make them look bad).</p> <p>K-pop fan Ram, whose tweets trying to explain the whole sorry situation were retweeted nearly 700 times, thinks these new, more chaotic fan wars are a demonstration of loyalty. \u201cI don\u2019t know about other fandoms, but here in the K-pop fandom if you see someone bashing your idols you should stand up and defend them,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like my fandom is my family. They\u2019re people you love and you should defend people you love.

Like Ram, he was moved to act by a need to defend the honour of his idols. \u201cThe K-pop community is definitely a family,\u201d he says, citing Twitter as the only way someone from a small US Midwest town has of interacting with his idols. \u201cWe argue here and there about small stuff, but when someone attacks any of us, we gather together and put people in their place. The positive thing about being part of a fan army is that you always have someone watching your back \u2013 we have a shoulder to lean on, and someone to cry with who understands where we are coming from. We are supporting our idols, too. When they are having a hard time, we step in and make them feel better, and fight off any negativity.\u201d</p> <p>Another fan \u201cfighting off negativity\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/selena-gomez\">Selena Gomez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\">Taylor Swift</a> fan Sean Arcilla, who lives in the Philippines. More a messenger of peace, Arcilla\u2019s aim is to spread unity, one hashtag at a time. \u201cFirst of all, fans with hatred in their hearts started these hashtags,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people are joining in because they want to defend their affected idol, but some people are just making fun of it, and enjoying tweeting the hashtag so it will trend easily. I miss the old days, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>For Bradley Stern, editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http://popcrush.com/\">the PopCrush website</a>, these hashtags are part of the fans\u2019 sense of entitlement in an age of direct digital access. \u201cThis all lends itself to the false notion, especially by young fans, that we are owed something from these people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe air of mystery has now entirely gone as a result, as more and more pop stars attempt to cultivate this relatable brand of interaction with their fans. So we\u2019re invited to feel this false sense of intimacy because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/09/nick-jonas-last-year-was-complicated-review-single-sad-and-highly-sexed-pop\">Nick Jonas</a> tweeted you directly with a winky face, for example.\u201d Arcilla, however, sees things differently. \u201cI am a fan of Selena and Taylor, but if I\u2019m owed something from them, then what is it? It\u2019s the music. The speeches. The help they give to us fans. If they make a mistake then I will prove to them that a mistake is only a mistake. Because our idols are people, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff52845ba1b1921db7a167d5c930c1065c98784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff52845ba1b1921db7a167d5c930c1065c98784/20_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Necki Menij Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Necki Menij Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Increasingly, this sense of direct connection between pop star and fan, and the allure that link holds, is blurring the power dynamic. Some fans seem to want to cause online chaos to get the attention their slightly wary idols are now not so keen to give them. \u201cI think celebrities are starting to distance themselves from the voices of their stan communities, which maybe drives some people to come up with something so controversial that the artist is forced to speak out,\u201d says David Monger, creator of popstar parody YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GingerTheHorse\">The Nekci Menij Show</a>. \u201cAt this point, things move so quickly you have maybe a few hours to get your campaign going by any means necessary. It\u2019s an environment where attention is the most valued commodity, and if you\u2019re trending, I guess you\u2019re rich.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/16/justin-bieber-quits-instagram-selena-gomez\">Justin Bieber quits Instagram after feud with Selena Gomez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One recently trending topic, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/sorryjustinbieber\">#SorryJustinBieber</a> \u2013 started after Bieber closed down his Instagram account following a spat with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/justindeactivatedparty?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#JustinDeactivatedParty</a>) \u2013 was actually used as a trap by Bieber\u2019s fans. Rather than showing a stream of tweets apologising, it was full of anger at Bieber for daring to close his Instagram account in the first place (shutting down a social media account, a fan\u2019s best way into your world, is tantamount to slamming a door in their face). \u201cI think there are a certain amount of fans who love their favourite artists so much, they are actually mean to them. It\u2019s almost the same as making fun of your sibling, in a way,\u201d says Stern. \u201cYou love them, but you\u2019re allowed to pick on them because you really \u2018get\u2019 them. And that can get scary.\u201d For Flores, it\u2019s a fan\u2019s only way of showing the pop star how their behaviour affects them, even if it means grabbing their attention under false pretences. \u201cWhen a fandom is hurt, they will literally try anything to get the message across to their idol.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b866a43caf724607fdf15bb5871f36b7fb4a121c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b866a43caf724607fdf15bb5871f36b7fb4a121c/0_53_4352_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demi Lovato.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demi Lovato.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RMV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the days of 80s and 90s pop megastars, it was fairly easy to gauge how successful they were using sales figures, chart placings and ticket sales. Now the water is murkier, with the less controllable world of social media playing a crucial role in galvanising a fanbase into streaming songs, watching videos and showing off their loyalty, with sites such as Billboard running online competitions to find out \u201c<a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/fan-army-bracket/\">Whose Army is the Strongest?</a>\u201d. With fans conditioned to monitor their idol\u2019s every movement, there\u2019s a real sense of investment that heightens the scrutiny the pop star finds themselves under. Earlier this week, for example, singer Demi Lovato\u2019s mum posted a video on Snapchat in which she made a joke about the Zika virus. Demi could be heard laughing in the background. Within minutes the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DemiLovatoIsOverParty\">#DemiLovatoIsOverParty</a> was trending, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/demi-lovato-forced-apologise-after-8625740\">leading to an apology from Lovato</a>. \u201cNowadays, one dodgy comment can literally end your career,\u201d Monger says. \u201cThese \u2018party\u2019 hashtags are a massive exaggeration, but in that moment, fans might feel like that person has just alienated their whole fanbase permanently.\u201d For rival fandoms looking to stick the knife in, such slip-ups are seized upon. \u201cPop fans have never been thirstier to police and label someone problematic or petty or shady, because above all else, it provides them with some added entertainment,\u201d Stern says.</p> <p>As with most things in pop, there\u2019s a sense of transience, with thetrend of pop-star-bashing hashtag \u201cparties\u201d hopefully a fad that will die out. The trending hashtags usually only last a couple of hours, with their shelf life only extended by confused fans trying to work out the conversation or people jumping on the bandwagon. \u201cA Twitter trend explodes and disappears, and then another rises up,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThe cycle continues.\u201d Somewhere along the line, however, that cycle has morphed, with the passion that\u2019s always been at the heart of pop now strangely mutated.</p>",

She has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/29/jill-stein-on-vaccines-people-have-real-questions/\">said</a> that there are \u201creal questions\u201d about corporate influence over vaccines and that there is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ixbr5/i_am_jill_stein_green_party_candidate_for/d31ydoe\">widespread distrust of the medical-industrial complex</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But in a CNN town hall event on Wednesday, Stein said her statements have been taking out of context and that previous concerns over mercury in vaccines have now been resolved.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s kind of an effort to divert the conversation from our actual agenda, because the idea that I oppose vaccines is completely ridiculous, or that I\u2019m anti-science,\u201d Stein said.</p> <p>\u201cI am certainly not hostile to science. I\u2019m not anti-science. I believe that asking questions is part of our responsibility as scientists. And as physicians, we always need to be asking those questions.\u201d</p> <p>Stein spent much of the televised question-and-answer session lambasting Trump and in particular Clinton, stating that she will \u201chave trouble sleeping at night\u201d if either the Republican or Democratic candidate is elected.</p> <p>\u201cAs despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Donald Trump, you know, bashes immigrants and is a xenophobic and racist loudmouth, but Hillary Clinton, you know, has been promoting these wars that have killed a million black and brown people in Iraq, for example.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democratic Party has become the party of deportation and detentions and night raids with, you know, millions of people deported under Barack Obama.\u201d</p> <p>Stein said Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state violated rules \u201cwith a sense of impunity\u201d, and she accused the Democratic candidate of organizing a \u201csmear\u201d against erstwhile opponent Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cBernie did everything right, and his supporters did everything right, but the playing field was really steeply and unfairly tilted against you,\u201d said Stein, who has actively courted Sanders supporters and the man himself, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/jill-stein-bernie-sanders-green-party\">offering to stand aside</a> as the Green party candidate in favor of him. </p> <p>\u201cMany people have looked to us from Bernie\u2019s campaign as Plan B, so that if they ran into trouble, they could continue building this revolutionary campaign, but now all the stronger for being inside of a revolutionary party that supports the work that you\u2019re doing and will continue to build it until we prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Stein said her campaign is largely aimed at 43 million young people who would benefit from her policy of abolishing student debt through the Federal Reserve. The Green party candidate also wants the US to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030, introduce a single-payer public health insurance program, establish a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage and slash military spending by \u201cat least\u201d 50%.</p> <p>Stein said her running mate, activist Ajamu Baraka, is an \u201cinspirational and passionate advocate for justice and for human rights\u201d. But Baraka, who also appeared at the town hall, was questioned over his previous description of Barack Obama as an \u201cuncle Tom\u201d.</p> <p>Baraka said he used the term to \u201csort of shock people into a more critical look at this individual. And that\u2019s how I did it. And I stand by that, even though it sounds very inflammatory, and provocative, and probably very strange to this massive audience here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Baraka also warned that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to deal with Donald Trump even after the election, win or lose, because he is appealing to a social base that is prepared to continue to embrace some of the darker side of humanity\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHis appeal to folks who embrace xenophobia, racism, his bigotry around religion, the unfortunate reality is that it has resonated with some elements of the society,\u201d Baraka said.</p> <p>Stein\u2019s initial goal is to break through 15% in opinion polling in order to take the stage with Trump and Clinton during the presidential debates. This appears to be an optimistic target, however, given that recent polling puts the Green party candidate <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">under 5%</a>. </p> <p>A new Public Policy Polling survey of Texas voters found that Stein<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/291759-poll-jill-stein-tied-with-harambe-trailing-deez-nutz-in-texas\"> is tied</a> with Harambe, a western lowland gorilla shot and killed at Cincinnati zoo in May, at 2%.</p>",
  "<p>The residents of a small coastal Alaskan village have voted to move to the mainland because of rising sea levels, but they may not have the funds to do it. </p> <p>The 600-person village of Shishmaref, located on an island just north of the Bering Strait, has for decades been ravaged by erosion tied to climate change, leading residents to seek a more sustainable place to live. </p> <p>But the community is racked by poverty, making it difficult to relocate, which is estimated to cost $180m. </p> <p>Officials held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/alaska-town-shishmaref-vote-climate-change-relocation\">a special election on Tuesday</a> so residents could vote on whether to relocate or to stay and add environmental defenses. The vote was relatively close, with 89 for relocating and 78 to remain. </p> <p>But both choices came with a steep price tag. The most recent estimate on relocating, from a 2004 Army Corps of Engineers study, was $180m. Officials said it would cost $110m for the environmental protections needed for the community to safely stay in one of Alaska\u2019s most eroded coastal areas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/shishmaref/giv-31075cm3e7f01cyG2/\" data-alt=\"Alaska map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/shishmaref/giv-31075cm3e7f01cyG2/\">Alaska map</a> </figure>  <p>Mayor Harold Weyiouanna Sr <a href=\"http://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Shismaref-to-vote-on-Tuesday-about-whether-to-relocate-erosion-plagued-village--389999922.html\">told local news channel KTUU</a> that doing nothing was not an option because while land crumbles into the sea, the community continues to grow. </p> <p>\u201cThey did put a seawall or rock walls up, and it seems to be holding, but we need more protection to protect the whole island,\u201d Weyiouanna said. </p> <p>The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) said Shishmaref is one of 31 villages that face \u201cimminent threats\u201d from flooding and coastal erosion.</p> <p>Shishmaref residents have been considering relocation since the mid-1970s, when it first introduced shoreline defense structures. The community also voted to leave in 2002, but was unable to because of cost. </p> <p>In February 2015, Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior, announced $8m in funding for \u201cprojects that promote tribal climate change adaption\u201d in Alaska. But that is far short of the money needed in Shishmaref and, likely, the most vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. </p> <p>In February, a community of about 60 people in Louisiana was named as the first official climate refugees in the US. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/resettling-the-first-american-climate-refugees.html?_r=0\">The federal government granted $48m</a> for the relocation of people in Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana, which is disappearing into the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>By 2050, 50 million to 200 million people are expected to be displaced by climate change, according to the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security and the International Organization for Migration.</p> <p>Shishmaref residents say they have felt the pressure to move for decades. </p> <p>\u201cWithin the next two decades, the whole island will erode away completely,\u201d wrote Esau Sinnok, a Shishmaref native and Arctic Youth Ambassador, <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/blog/my-world-interrupted\">in an essay</a> for the Department of the Interior in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cTo put this in perspective: I was born in 1997, and since then, Shishmaref has lost about 100 feet,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn the past 15 years, we had to move 13 houses \u2013 including my dear grandma Edna\u2019s house \u2013 from one end of the island to the other because of this loss of land.\u201d</p>",

Alistair is aiming to retain the crown he won in London but will have to fend off his younger brother Jonny who took bronze four years ago, as well as major medal prospects from Spain and France.</p> <h2>What you need to know</h2> <p>For those new to triathlon, it is a relatively straightforward but utterly gruelling event made up of a 1.5km swim, a 40km cycle, and finishing with a leisurely 10km run. In Rio the athletes will swim out into the Atlantic, completing one circuit of the marked course before returning to ditch the goggles for a road bike. The cycle takes in eight laps of a much tougher course than London which cuts inland from the coast and drags uphill before swinging back down to Copacabana Beach. The run is a little more forgiving: four relatively flat circuits along the coastline with legs burning to the end. </p> <p>The fastest men typically take around 1hr 45min to complete the race, depending on the course and conditions; transitions between each discipline are included in the overall time. There are 56 athletes listed for a busy start which means the swimming could get pretty dicey, and penalties are commonplace. Drafting (slipstreaming) is allowed in the cycling part of the race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/worldtriathlon/status/766254726161707009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Beach start swim, 8 laps up a steep hill &amp; a swift run makes for 1 EPIC <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/triathlon?src=hash\">#triathlon</a> course! <a href=\"https://t.co/LZWCVOhhlq\">https://t.co/LZWCVOhhlq</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/P7vOlWbWzo\">pic.twitter.com/P7vOlWbWzo</a></p>&mdash; World Triathlon (@worldtriathlon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/worldtriathlon/status/766254726161707009\">August 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Britain\u2019s Brownlees</h2> <p>Great Britian\u2019s Alistair Brownlee begins the race as the favourite for gold.

G\u00f3mez broke his elbow in a cycling accident last month ruling himself out of the Games.

The pick of the bunch might be Spain\u2019s Mario Mola, twice a world series silver medallist, and his compatriot Fernando Alarza could prove a useful foil in the cycle. France\u2019s Vincent Luis won bronze in the 2015 world series and is likely to mount a serious challenge, and Richard Murray of South Africa will also be targeting a medal. There are plenty of athletes who could figure at the finish in an event which has its unpredictable elements, but winning gold will require solving a puzzle no one could in London four years ago: how to beat the Brownlees.</p> <p><strong>Scheduled start time: </strong>11am in Rio (3pm BST)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:29:20.768Z\">at 2.29pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Russia will hold its first nationwide elections in more than four years next month, but political analysts are paying more attention to a series of curious changes in Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle than they are to the campaigning. While the elections are seen as a foregone conclusion that will decide little, tremors inside the Kremlin could be much more significant.</p> <p>Last week, one of the president\u2019s oldest allies, his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov, was replaced with his deputy Anton Vaino, who has a reputation as an able technocrat but has little political heft. Ivanov, who like Putin was a KGB agent \u2013 and was once spoken of as a potential successor \u2013 was given what appears to be a humiliating demotion to the transport and environment brief.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/vladimir-putin-may-believe-time-is-ripe-for-another-invasion\">Vladimir Putin may believe time is ripe for another invasion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ivanov was just the latest of Putin\u2019s old friends to be shuffled aside. Viktor Ivanov, another former KGB associate of Putin, was left without a job when his powerful anti-drug agency was disbanded; and the powerful railways boss Vladimir Yakunin was pushed aside earlier this year, refusing the consolation prize of a senatorship.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Analysts are split over the reasons for the changes. Some have suggested people such as Sergei Ivanov are being moved to neutralise any potential spheres of opposition to Putin among his old friends. Others disagree. \u201cThese people are the most loyal of anyone; they have survived so long exactly because they are so loyal,\u201d says political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Whatever the reason, the effect of Putin\u2019s purge is the removal of those who have known him long enough to be able to raise doubts with him, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst who worked with the Kremlin for more than a decade. \u201cThe one thing that the new appointments have in common is that they have no political identity and no political weight. Putin\u2019s friends around him were at least an informal check. When you have an absence even of informal checks, it\u2019s dangerous. The centre is being stripped of all restrictions and that can only be dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0999be019e81a05db5c5bb4b695d6d8d1565b8ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0999be019e81a05db5c5bb4b695d6d8d1565b8ad/124_319_3366_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Ivanov was the head of Russia\u2019s Federal Service for Drug Control.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Ivanov was the head of Russia\u2019s drug control service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even those close to the Kremlin remain in the dark about the real reason for the change, though this has not stopped the speculation.

If he succeeds, by the end he will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century.

They are natural. </p> <p>But the fire currently ripping through this collection of rural communities in San Bernardino county, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, does not seem normal and certainly not beneficial to humans or nature.

When figures tell us that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/01/pay-gap-black-white-uk-workers-widens-more-qualifications\">black workers with degrees on average earn 23% less</a> than white workers with degrees, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that we are worth less.</p> <p>To tackle the issues, schools have to continuously ask themselves tough questions about the underachievement of their ethnic minority pupils. Did Roweena not achieve her level 5 because of her own disaffection or because key teachers simply didn\u2019t believe she was ever capable of doing so?</p> <p>As for the government, we need a curriculum that reflects this nation\u2019s rich cultural diversity. We need more teachers from ethnic minorities in our classrooms, and we need them to be more than role models. We need to recognise that certain groups of students will need extra support and that the schools teaching them will require increased funding as a result. It all might sound radical, but really isn\u2019t. Forty more years of woeful discrimination and underachievement is not an option.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kehinde-andrews\"><strong>Kehinde Andrews</strong></a><strong>: The loss of public sector jobs has shattered one of our few footholds</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"363c9c7a9072b31cd90d016bae157aee4383ee8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363c9c7a9072b31cd90d016bae157aee4383ee8f/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kehinde Andrews.

Over the past five years there has been a 49% increase in ethnic-minority long-term youth unemployment, compared with a 2% fall in white youth unemployment. The report also found that black and Asian workers are more than twice as likely to be in the insecure work that is blighting Britain.</p> <p>Nothing about these findings should be surprising: black young people have historically suffered from disproportionately high levels of unemployment and limited opportunities. However, it is no coincidence that inequalities have worsened since 2010, when the coalition government began dismantling social provision. This report is evidence that austerity has hit ethnic-minority groups the hardest.</p> <p>The mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/nov/14/sure-start-centre-closures-coalition\">closure of Sure Start centres</a> and the defunding of youth services were obviously going to have an impact on minority young people, who are more likely to live in the inner-city communities where these services are most needed. Perhaps the bigger issue has been the loss of decently paid, secure public sector work that offered ethnic minorities decent employment.</p> <p>When left to its own devices the free market has shown again and again that it will racially discriminate. This is why the Race Relations Act was passed in 1965, and ethnic minorities have <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/Parliamentary%20briefings/CutsdebateMarch2011.pdf\">largely relied on public sector employment</a> for career advancement. The loss of <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/2015-06-17#total-uk-public-sector-employment\">more than a million public sector jobs</a>, either disappearing completely or outsourced to the private sector, has shattered one of the few footholds for ethnic minority young people to gain a real stake in society. To begin to address these inequalities the government must end the nightmare of austerity; invest in services for ethnic-minority young people; and provide the kind of secure employment opportunities that are ever more decreasing.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/diane-abbott\"><strong>Diane Abbott</strong></a><strong>: Look at the unspoken ways in which exclusion happens</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03a5efe095df9814eed8b2fc42ed7fa243b3bc8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03a5efe095df9814eed8b2fc42ed7fa243b3bc8e/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Diane Abbott.

But it is 40 years since the Commission for Racial Equality, the predecessor body to the EHRC, was set up with that exact remit. Are we destined to go round in circles on race equality? Or worse, in some respects are we going backwards?</p> <p>The report points out that \u201cwhen it comes to who runs Britain, overall ethnic minorities are still hugely underrepresented in positions of power\u201d. For instance the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/10/who-are-the-new-mps-middle-aged-white-men-again\">proportion of BAME \u2013 black, Asian and minority ethnic \u2013 MPs</a> is still only 6.3%, despite 12% of Britons being from a BAME background; in 2012, of judges who were prepared to declare their ethnicity only 5.9% were BAME; and as of May this year, 11 police forces in England and Wales have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/21/four-police-forces-no-black-officer-mp-inquiry-cheshire-north-yorkshire-dyfed-powys-durham\">no ethnic minority officers above the rank of inspector</a> and there were no ethnic-minority chief constables.</p> <p>For decades the professions have paid lip service to issues of representation and a mix of exhortation and mentoring has been attempted. But progress has been painfully slow. Forty years after society first realised that we need a \u201crace relations strategy\u201d we must do better.</p> <p>The recent <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/party-documents/ChakrabartiInquiry.pdf\">Chakrabarti inquiry</a> into racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism in the Labour party had some insights into how discrimination works. She said: \u201cI am sorry to report that a \u2018welcoming environment\u2019 has not been the overwhelming experience of many BAME members, including those from Afro-Caribbean, Muslim and Sikh communities in particular.\u201d I have heard many stories from across the country of members who felt that they were \u201cgood enough to deliver votes and leaflets\u201d but not for staff or leadership positions within the party or to be candidates for public office. Monitoring, mentoring and targets have their place.

She was made to feel, all too keenly, the fact that she \u201cwas just another Asian woman too stupid to get out of this on her own\u201d. And she was made to feel this not once, not twice, but every day by every agency she so desperately turned to.<br></p> <p>That gutting feeling that you will not be taken seriously, that you will not be listened to, that your voice is somehow less important because it is expelled from a throat that happens to be coloured brown or black \u2013 or any other colour that isn\u2019t white \u2013 is one that every abuse survivor from a BAME background I have ever encountered is drowning in. And their fears of being treated harshly, unfairly, unjustly, insensitively because they happen to have a scarf or cornrows on their head is \u2013 as this much welcomed report highlights \u2013 not unfounded. From suffering the daily <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/widespread-inequality-risks-increasing-race-tensions-warns-ehrc\">humiliations of unemployment</a> to being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/corsica-mayor-bans-burkini-violence-beach-protests-sisco-france\">bombarded by discussions of what you should be wearing</a>, the message is clear: \u201cYou are not one of us.\u201d</p> <p>So when a non-white woman finds herself trapped in an abusive marriage, or wakes up one morning after having been raped or sexually abused by someone she knows, who will she turn to for help, understanding, and a safe way out? Probably not the predominantly white, male-centric services that so openly continue to <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigning-and-influencing/femicide-census/\">fail even their white female counterparts</a>.

Flagged up here are many of the burning issues that BAME communities face: endemic discrimination in stop and search, massive disproportionality in prosecution and sentencing. Disappointing, though, given the racialisation of the \u201cgangs\u201d issue, by police, CPS and media alike, is the failure to mention the joint enterprise laws. This doctrine has operated over the years as a mechanism to create guilt by association, hoovering up and criminalising young poor men and children with alarming regularity. Nevertheless, the report is timely. It disrupts the self-congratulatory narrative, established soon after the Macpherson report, that Britain has entered a post-racial era. If there is racism, it\u2019s an individual failing \u2013 not the problem of the system.</p> <p>If the report\u2019s findings are backed up by the Lammy independent review into the treatment of, and outcomes for, BAME individuals in the criminal justice system, then this could strengthen the call from community organisations for much needed radical reform. But if this is to happen, we have to get beyond an approach that sidetracks the debate into one of recruitment and retention of more BAME police officers, prosecutors, judges. The problems for young BAME people lie far deeper than this.</p>",

There are some clues. First, it\u2019s clear that Trump is an ardent supporter of the leave campaign \u2013 or at least, he became one when he finally found out what it was.</p> <p>When Trump was asked by journalist Michael Wolff for a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/donald-trump-conversation-politics-dark-898465\">Hollywood Reporter</a> interview published in June what he thought about Brexit, he was flummoxed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnd Brexit?

Immigration \u201chas been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/donald-trump-brexit-222874#ixzz4HhECYHSg\">a horrible thing</a>\u201d for Britain, he told Fox News. \u201cA lot of that was pushed by the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And after the vote, on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">trip to Scotland</a> to promote his golf course, Trump called the vote \u201ca great victory,\u201d attributing the Brexit vote to immigration and opposition to the \u201cglobal elite\u201d before boarding his gilded private jet to return to the US campaign trail.</p> <p>But why go back to Brexit now? Assuming Trump reads more than his own press cuttings, he may have spotted some news that suggests Brexit has not, as yet, been as catastrophic to the UK economy as first feared.</p> <p>Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve issued the minutes of its latest meeting and mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-brexit\">Brexit 20 times</a>. However, for all its concern the Fed concluded that Brexit had had little impact on the US and global economy. And in the UK, public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\">confidence has rebounded</a> after the Brexit vote, with consumers shrugging off fears of imminent doom.</p> <p>Of course, the consequences of Brexit (or a Trump victory) will play out over years, not weeks. All of Britain\u2019s trade agreements with the EU must now be renegotiated. Top companies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/ford-considers-closing-factories-raising-prices-europe-brexit\">Ford</a> and Goldman Sachs have warned they may cut back or leave the UK following the vote.</p> <p>Back in the US, Trump\u2019s economic policies are under attack and he has been forced to reshuffle his election team in the face of withering polls. But just for a moment this morning, maybe, Trump thought he\u2019d backed a winner. And like the Brexit, he\u2019ll surprise us all come November.</p> <p>Go ahead, call him MR BREXIT.<br></p>",
  "<p>Dolly Parton long ago ascended to icon status. It\u2019s decades since she transcended the genre of country music and became a vast global brand: these days, the headlines are more likely to be about her theme parks or her philanthropy than her music.

But the latter also reveals the album\u2019s big failing: Parton\u2019s inability to, as she once put it, \u201cleave no rhinestone unturned\u201d. It starts out as a raw cheating ballad, flipping between wracked and defiant, its impact sharpened by being performed by just Parton and a guitar. Then, midway through, there\u2019s a sudden sweep of chimes and the band comes in and the mood changes from flinty and sparse to syrupy and sentimental. It\u2019s frustrating: if Parton would just dial down the kitsch a bit more, she\u2019d have a genuinely fantastic album on her hands.</p> <p>But then Dolly Parton has never done that. Even at her mid-70s peak, the tougher songs were always separated by a sea of slush: on Jolene, the album that produced her two greatest songs, I Will Always Love You and the title track, still had to share space with pretty mawkish filler. Some great songs, some not-so-great songs, an impressively sharp realism that gets submerged beneath corn and goo: perhaps this album does offer pure Dolly Parton after all.</p>",
  "<p>The first of many women we see projected on to a large stage screen tonight is Naomi Campbell, clad in knee-high leather boots, fearsome headgear and little else. For a lingering 20 minutes in black and white she dances playfully to the sound of low drones, like static waves lapping a digital beach. It could be a long-form arty fragrance commercial. You\u2019d only be half surprised if it ended with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://anohni.com/\">Anohni</a> breaking out of a box and telling us she\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQKjMvG7BLU\">not going to be the person she\u2019s expected to be any more</a>. </p> <p>Quite how this pensive intro relates to the former Antony and the Johnsons musician\u2019s Mercury-prize nominated eco-conscious electro album Hopelessness isn\u2019t obvious. Even less so why Campbell \u2013 supermodel of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/16/usa\">chucking-mobile-phone-at-a-maid infamy</a> \u2013 has been selected as effectively Anohni\u2019s earth mother spiritual avatar (she will appear onscreen again at the end of the show, miming the words to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pei4SnavUk\">Drone Bomb Me</a> with tearful eyes). But, as a device for announcing this show\u2019s clever multimedia credentials, not to mention its superior breeding to your average pop performance, it\u2019s effective. Drawing on Chichester-born, New York-made Anohni\u2019s background in performance art, this is a suitably striking audiovisual live treatment of what is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/anohni-hopelessness-review-the-most-profound-protest-record-in-decades\">comfortably one of the year\u2019s best records</a>.</p> <p>Anohni finally appears to sing <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fi0q0O4V5Qs\">4 Degrees</a>, her synth-powered banger about rising global temperatures. Dressed like a Jedi, her face shrouded by a veil, she cuts a mysterious, almost forlorn figure, disembodied even from her own gymnastically supple and fragile voice. She\u2019s flanked by American experimental musician Daniel Lopatin AKA <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://pointnever.com/\">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and Scottish beatsmith and sometime Kanye West go-to guy Ross Birchard AKA <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hudsonmohawke.com/\">Hudson Mohawke</a>. The pair resemble DJ friars in headphones and robes, prodding at laptops as they reconstruct Hopelessness\u2019s crisp, clean, imposing electronic architecture.</p> <p>The at-times transcendent quality of the music is at jarring odds with the grisliness of Anohni\u2019s words, which range across subjects from the dying natural world to political hypocrisy and sexual violence with unflinching brutality. On Watch Me she coos a sarcastic come-on to CIA snoops watching her watching pornography. On Obama she grimly denounces the outgoing president who swept to power on a tide of the very thing that her album desperately decries a subsequent loss of: hope. Set to a stuttering trap beat, Indian Girls \u2013 one of a handful of non-Hopelessness tracks performed tonight \u2013 includes such stomach-turning imagery as \u201cyou cut the throat of Indian girls / drove a stick from anus to mouth\u201d.</p> <p>Save for a terse thanks to collaborators and crew after the credits roll, Anohni doesn\u2019t speak a word, lest the spell somehow be broken. It would all feel like the work of someone who takes herself far too seriously were it not all done with such fine theatrical poise. If the catastrophic future which Anohni starkly prophesies comes to pass, we\u2019ll wonder why we didn\u2019t take her words more seriously still.</p>",
  "<p>My uncle, Fred Tomlinson, who has died aged 88, was a singer, conductor, composer and musicologist who will be remembered for his involvement, via the Fred Tomlinson Singers, with such shows as Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus, The Two Ronnies, Dad\u2019s Army and Only Fools and Horses (among many others). But there was much more to his life and career.</p> <p>Born in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, into a musical family, he was the youngest of four children of Fred, a factory foreman, and his wife, May (nee Culpan), a teacher. Fred senior was a keen amateur musician who founded and conducted the Rossendale male voice choir. One of his brothers was the composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/jun/30/ernest-tomlinson-light-music\" title=\"\">Ernest Tomlinson</a>, my father.</p> <p>All the children sang, and the three boys won scholarships to Manchester Cathedral choir school, with Fred junior following his two older brothers there in 1937. It was there that he came across the song Balulalow by Peter Warlock, which began a lifelong interest in his music. War economies closed the choir school in 1940 and the boys were dispersed. Fred won a place at King\u2019s College school, Cambridge, and was there until his voice broke.</p> <p>He continued his studies at the local grammar school and went on to study maths, statistics, Italian and music at Leeds University. There he met his future wife, Pamela Mellor, also a singer. Fred\u2019s horizons broadened with exposure to more modern music. \u201cI thought there was no one but Bach, but then I discovered Doris Day,\u201d he said. In later years his singing group was the Hi-Lo\u2019s.</p> <p>Following university, he did two years of national service in the RAF, mainly serving in Singapore. Then he moved to London to work for a music publisher alongside Ernest, until joining the George Mitchell Singers. He married Pamela in 1956 with George Mitchell as best man.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgaRd4d8hOY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QgaRd4d8hOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Fred Tomlinson wrote the music for Monty Python\u2019s Lumberjack Song, with words by Terry Jones and Michael Palin.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>From then on Fred\u2019s career was mainly on radio and television, but also in concert. His outstanding sight-reading ability meant that he was in demand in every genre, from early music through to pop.</p> <p>For the Monty Python show, Terry Jones and Michael Palin wrote the words to the famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgaRd4d8hOY\" title=\"\">Lumberjack Song</a>, and Fred wrote the music. Palinsaid: \u201cFred insisted on high standards, and much work and rehearsal went into ensuring that something extremely silly was also extremely polished.\u201d</p> <p>As chairman of the Peter Warlock Society for 25 years, Fred joined with other musicians to give concerts, recordings and lectures. Under the pseudonym Frederick Culpan he wrote a companion piece to Warlock\u2019s opus The Curlew using the same instrumentation. He also wrote several books about Warlock and edited many of his songs for publication.</p> <p>Pamela survives him. His elder daughter, also a singer, was killed in a car accident in 1990. His younger daughter, who had Rett syndrome, died in 2011.</p>",
  "<p>\u00d6tzi the Iceman, a naturally mummified corpse found trapped in the ice of the Italian Alps, has become something of a celebrity in the 25 years since tourists first stumbled upon his frozen remains \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that his sense of style has come under scrutiny. </p> <p>Scientists studying the 5,300 year-old remains say they have finally unravelled the secrets of \u00d6tzi\u2019s wardrobe.</p> <p>The new research reveals that the iceman was potentially a versatile tailor, with skins from sheep, goats and cattle as well as hides from a brown bear and roe deer used to create his outfit.</p> <p>Ron Pinhasi, co-author of the research from University College, Dublin said the findings show that \u00d6tzi was \u201cpretty picky\u201d when it came to his choice of skins. \u201cTo me it seems pretty sophisticated in terms of the capacities to use so many different materials from different animals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Aged around 45 years, \u00d6tzi is believed to have bled to death after being hit in the shoulder by an arrow. But it\u2019s not only his grisly demise that has been a subject of scrutiny. Scientists have inspected almost every aspect of the iceman\u2019s remains, revealing everything from his medical history (it turns out \u00d6tzi had Lyme disease) to his penchant for a scrap \u2013 with a deep cut on his hand suggesting he was involved in a brawl shortly before his death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/08/otzi-the-icemans-5000-year-old-stomach-bug-sheds-light-on-human-migration\">\u00d6tzi the Iceman's 5,000-year-old stomach bug sheds light on human migration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while it was previously known that the iceman had used various types of leather to create his wardrobe \u2013 an array of clothing including a loin cloth, cap and coat, the Copper Age leather manufacturing processes, and the impact of time itself, made it difficult to tease apart exactly which species of animals were used.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/srep31279\">Scientific Reports</a>, researchers from Ireland and Italy describe how they analysed a type of genetic material, known as mitochondrial DNA, that was extracted from nine fragments from six of his garments, including his loin cloth and fur cap.</p> <p>\u201cThe main question of study was to see what species these leathers were from and then the secondary question was are these species domestic varieties or not,\u201d said Niall O\u2019Sullivan, first author of the research from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy.</p> <p>The results reveal that the Iceman used at least five different species to create his clothes. His loin cloth, the scientists found, was made of sheepskin, his shoelaces of cow-leather, his leggings from goat hide, and his coat made from a mixture of both sheep and goat hide, taken from at least four different animals, that had been joined together. What\u2019s more, analysis of the mitochondrial DNA revealed that the sheep, goats and cattle from which the leather was made were domesticated animals.<br></p> <p>But \u00d6tzi\u2019s hat and quiver, it turns out, were fashioned from rather more exotic materials \u2013 the cap was made from the hide from a brown bear while the quiver fashioned from the skin of a roe deer. </p> <p>That, says O\u2019Sullivan, shows that while \u00d6tzi was likely to be from an agricultural or herding community, he was an enterprising chap. \u201cIt is possible that he might have used his hunting ability to capture and kill a bear, or it [could be] that he came across a dying bear and opportunistically took the skin and used it as leather,\u201d says O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cIt shows us that he was opportunistic and resourceful and used to the best of his ability the scarce resources which were available to him in a very harsh environment.\u201d </p> <p>The iceman, it seems, was also adept at a bit of make do and mend. \u201cThe Copper Age neolithic style of making leather was very primitive, clothing would have decomposed and degraded quite quickly under normal circumstances,\u201d says O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cSo he had to rapidly change his clothes and he was probably constantly renewing the clothes and augmenting it so that bits didn\u2019t fall apart.\u201d</p>",

What is there to struggle for if there is no chance ever of a job that will pay beyond bare subsistence? With no prospects, drinking, smoking and eating the wrong things become small compensations in lives with very little else. Being out of control becomes a mindset ever harder to climb out of. Why defer small gratifications when there is no greater reward on offer?</p> <p>Most people have social incentives not to give in to temptation \u2013 and even then we often fail \u2013 but those who have nothing are likely to give up more easily. From every social signal, poor children know from their first day at school that they are low in the pecking order and that gap between them and the rest widens with every school year, as their self-esteem falls away.</p> <p>Those on the margins, excluded from life\u2019s best things, eat themselves into an early grave. It is inequality and disrespect that make people fat. Look at the historical figures: obesity took off in the 1980s, up more than 400% in the years since inequality exploded. The link between inequality and obesity is stark around the world: among developed nations, America is the most unequal society and the fattest, with Britain and Australia next on both scores. Europe is better and the Scandinavian countries best of all.</p> <p>There may be social policy reasons, as social democratic governments invest in picking up family problems earliest. But the big picture is this: where the status and income gap in a society is smallest, so are the waistbands. Turn to that great classic of inequality research, The Spirit Level: Why Equality Is Better for Everyone, by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, and chapter seven documents how <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/obesity\" title=\"\">wider income gaps mean wider waists</a>.</p> <p>That dispiriting fact could be an invitation to nothing-can-be-done fatalism, when of course governments should do all they can to stop the food industry making us all needlessly fatter, with the NHS picking up the bill. But yet again, social dysfunctions spring from the unequal state of the whole society.</p> <p>There is a nasty tendency to fat-shame the poor, a vicious cycle in which people are blamed individually for both their obesity and their poverty.</p> <p>But the social facts suggest Britain would get thinner if everyone had enough of life\u2019s opportunities to be worth staying thin for. Offer self-esteem, respect, good jobs, decent homes and some social status and the pounds would start to fall away.</p>",

  "<p>Less than a year ago, health experts hoped David Cameron\u2019s government might do what every previous one had failed to do since obesity rates began to soar in the 1980s: deliver a strategy that would help people to eat less and to eat more healthily. <br></p> <p>The heart of the problem, said the seminal Foresight report in 2007, is the \u201cobesogenic environment\u201d. People are besieged with adverts and promotions for fatty, salty, sugary food. Coffee shops and takeaways crowd the high streets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\">Childhood obesity: UK's 'inexcusable' strategy  is wasted opportunity, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action\">childhood obesity strategy</a>, eventually delivered after months of delay, has disappointed everyone. Even the food and drink industry is unhappy, because at the core of the plan is the sugar tax, announced in March by the then chancellor, George Osborne, coupled to a voluntary deal with manufacturers to cut by 20% the amount of sugar in products enjoyed by children.</p> <p>Health organisations \u2013 from doctors in royal colleges, to cancer and diabetes charities, to children\u2019s campaigners \u2013 are appalled and vocal. They say it is far from the draconian, game-changing plan that the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, promised last October. </p> <p>The nine-page document, whittled down from 30 and slipped out in August while Theresa May is on holiday, \u201clets down a generation of children\u201d, the Faculty of Public Health says. Cancer Research UK says it is inexcusable for the government to miss the opportunity to clamp down on advertising and promotions for junk food, while the Food Foundation says parents hoping for help in protecting their children against obesity will wake up \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory MP who chairs the health select committee, says \u201cbig interests have trumped those of children\u201d in the \u201cdowngraded\u201d plan. None of these are habitual critics of government.</p> <p>Noticeably silent, though, is Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, which has to pick up the bill for obesity, estimated at \u00a34.2bn a year. He has frequently said obesity will bankrupt the NHS. Now he is saying nothing.</p> <p>The same goes for Alison Tedstone, the director of diet and obesity at Public Health England, which was charged with investigating what would work and made recommendations that were supposed to underpin the strategy. It said the most important measures were the restriction of junk food advertising on TV and social media to stop the targeting of children, and bans on cut-price promotions in supermarkets. The sugar tax was lower down its priority list. That advice has been spurned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/seven-healthy-foods-with-high-levels-of-sugar\">Seven 'healthy' foods with high levels of sugar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tax on sugary soft drinks is, of course, welcomed by health experts, although it does not come in for two more years. Reformulation of products to reduce sugar by 20% is a sound aspiration, but as with the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/12/food-industry-responsibility-deal-little-effect-health-study\">responsibility deal</a>\u201d the Cameron government made with the food industry, it is voluntary. Ironically, says Graham McGregor, the professor of cardiovascular medicine who heads Action on Sugar, the industry wanted mandatory reformulation, to remove any competitive disadvantage.</p> <p>McGregor also points out that there is nothing in the strategy on fat, which is another contributor to obesity. Just as sugar was put into yoghurts to preserve the taste when manufacturers made low-fat versions, so fat could now re-appear to make up for the loss of sugar.</p> <p>And wrapping the strategy in the Olympic flag inspires none of the health experts. Schools are asked to give children 30 minutes more physical activity a day and parents another 30 minutes on top of that. It is a laudable aspiration \u2013 but not with a view to cutting obesity. Exercise is vital in many ways, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/28/study-reveals-that-exercise-alone-wont-cause-weight-loss\">studies show it does not lead to weight loss</a>.</p> <p>There have been plenty of failed government attempts to get to grips with obesity in the past.

This obscures the reality that some of the most significant health advances have been made by population-based public health approaches in which the overall welfare of the population trumps certain individual or industry freedoms. The public smoking ban is a prime example. It has already had an impact on reducing cardiovascular mortality. The government should ban the buy one, get one free culture for fizzy drinks and junk food.

  "<p>There are many ways in the English language to describe the act of disappearing without a trace or explanation \u2013 fleeing, vanishing, going awol, taking off, \u201cstepping out for cigarettes\u201d \u2013 but none are as suggestive as the Portuguese <em>embora</em>. Idra Novey unpacks the layers of meaning embedded in this concept in her debut novel, Ways to Disappear, which starts with a very literal <em>embora</em>. In the first scene, a famous middle-aged female novelist climbs up an almond tree with a suitcase and a cigar and vanishes from the planet.<br></p> <p>But Novey is much more interested in figurative notions of \u201cdisappearing\u201d; how we vanish from the definitions we impose upon ourselves and others. Her action-packed, tragicomic novel follows Emma, a thirtysomething Portuguese translator who, when hearing that \u201cher author\u201d Beatriz Yagoda has vanished, leaves her frustrating life in Pittsburgh for Rio to investigate the disappearance. The story is sensual and fast-paced, suspenseful and subtle, full of observations about Brazilian life and North American double standards.</p> <p>In writing her novel, translator Novey had to perform a disappearance of her own in order to write without feeling under scrutiny as a translator-turned-novelist. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone I was working on the novel for five years,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t even tell my own sister until I sold the novel. I needed that privacy, because I didn\u2019t want to have to redefine myself.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was wondering, how can you write fiction that is as lyrical and sensual as poetry?</p> <footer> <cite>Idra Novey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ways to Disappear is full of mock definitions by Novey, presented as dictionary entries alongside radio announcements, emails and poems. \u201cI wanted to surprise myself and burn down the house of fiction on every page, as much as I could,\u201d she says. She estimates she rewrote every section in the book around five times: \u201cIf I was working on something and I didn\u2019t like where it was going, I approached it like a poem and just erased it entirely and started again.\u201d She wanted to avoid \u201cfiller\u201d written simply to get to the next bit of the story. \u201cI was wondering, how can you write fiction that is as lyrical and sensual as poetry \u2013 and that moves to the next meaningful moment as quickly as poetry does?\u201d<br></p> <p>A literary translator at the centre of an action-packed novel might sound unlikely, but Novey thinks otherwise. \u201cBut we are the heroes of literature!\u201d she exclaims. Ways to Disappear is the product of that old advice: write the book you want to read \u2013 and Novey wrote this one, with a fellow translator as the lead. \u201cI kept coming across books that had translators as characters, and they didn\u2019t ring true to me. They were often portrayed as somewhat inhibited characters who wished that they were braver. I actually find that translators are brave people who have lived all over the world, who speak multiple languages and fly all over and they\u2019re just really big-hearted and adventurous people. I think it\u2019s a really joyous, beautiful life \u2013 getting to know the work of other people in this intimate way. And there\u2019s nothing about it that\u2019s inhibited.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"543b37e581fd2cd59949b53edcf1096814258385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/543b37e581fd2cd59949b53edcf1096814258385/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Idra Novey\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think [translation] is a really joyous, beautiful life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donata Zanotti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her own life story and outlook are not inhibited either. Born in western Pennsylvania in 1978, she learned Spanish young and then moved to Chile and Brazil to pursue her dreams. She is remarkably determined in all things, it seems. As she tells it, she met her husband on the New York subway and immediately knew they would get married. \u201cI called my grandma to tell her, and she said to me \u2018oh Idra, you\u2019re so dramatic.\u2019 Five years later we married, and two children, 15 apartments and three countries later we\u2019re still together.\u201d Now living in Brooklyn, Novey speaks only Spanish at home, spends a month every year in Chile, and reads in Spanish and Portuguese every night. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d she explains, \u201cI like to get out of the language I\u2019ve been living or teaching in.\u201d</p> <p>The zippy plot of Ways to Disappear is sprinkled with meditations on language and with sharp assessments of the publishing world. As soon as Yagoda disappears, her books acquire a renewed interest and an optimistic loan shark sees a newly discovered book as an opportunity to make millions (little does he suspect hundreds is a much more likely figure for fiction in translation).</p> <p></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do think we all have a desire to disappear \u2013 especially from our online lives.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea of vanishing came to her from lived experience as a translator: \u201cYou sort of fade to disappear. You\u2019re on the sidelines, not often interviewed. And yet every word on the page came from your imagination! I also think as a woman writer, we tend to disappear from the canon and from the record. Clarice Lispector [whose The Passion According to GH Novey translated in 2012] was a peripheral writer until long after her death, when she became more visible internationally.\u201d But that invisibility can also be liberating: \u201cYou\u2019re both at the centre of it and up against the wall. It\u2019s kind of a beautiful freedom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do think we all have a desire to disappear \u2013 especially from our online lives \u2026 You log into your social media account and realise that even when you\u2019re not on there, you\u2019re continually visible. But also, we\u2019re all going to disappear eventually, as mortals \u2013 vanishing is inevitable! Part of the thing about disappearing is that it\u2019s almost a little death. People say sex is a little death, but vanishing is like a little death as well; frightening, but also desirable. To experience some brief form of disappearance can feel like preparation for the permanent vanishing we\u2019ll all have.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2016/jul/22/catching-the-zeitgeist-with-eileen-myles-martin-macinnes-and-idra-novey\">Catching the zeitgeist with Eileen Myles, Martin MacInnes and Idra Novey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new interest in translated literature in the English-speaking world \u2013 with initiatives such as August\u2019s <a href=\"https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/2016/08/01/women-in-translation-month/\">Women in Translation Month</a> \u2013 is nothing novel to Novey, who since childhood has known her sights were set on a global conversation well beyond American \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/116778/mfa-vs-nyc-most-useful-explanation-how-writers-get-paid\">MFA culture</a>\u201d. \u201cI was very used to being an outsider.

  "<p>A-Rod who? The omnipresent slugger\u2019s nickname, so long on the tip of our tongues, seemed long gone by the time two ballyhooed Yankees prospects bounced into the Bronx on Saturday. And so what was supposed to be a weekend awash with nostalgia \u2013 Alex Rodriguez\u2019s departure, the honoring of the 1996 World Series champion Yanks and a Monument Park plaque for Mariano Rivera, became much more about tomorrow than yesterday. </p> <p>The Yankees, for all their winning (some 27 World Series titles), have suffered in the past. Their most famous collapse came in 1965, when an empire that brought 10 titles, 15 pennants in 18 seasons, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra and a host of Yankee elites, crumbled to the core. <br></p> <p>The Bronx Zoo teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 Thurman Munson, Reggie Jackson, Ron Guidry and later Dave Winfield \u2013 brought four pennants and two titles before they faded. That 1996 team restored order, bringing about an era that looked more like the glory years, even if they could never possibly match the ring count: 24 winning seasons, 18 play-off appearances, seven pennants and five titles. <br></p> <p>Now, finally, the <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/04/watch-the-yankees-core-four-reunite-before-derek-jeters-last-home-opener\">Core Four are gone</a>, A-Rod is gone, and other peripheral links to their last title are fading.</p> <p>The Yankees have actually been in a transition mode for several years and have continued to stay competitive, but now the 2016 season becomes well and truly about rebuilding, which doesn\u2019t necessarily add up to doom, gloom and losing.</p> <p>To the surprise of many, the energy around the stadium didn\u2019t drop off after A-Rod\u2019s big send-off \u2013 quite the contrary. Aaron Judge and Tyler Austin sizzled in their first game in pinstripes Saturday, both hitting home runs on debut. Gary Sanchez is on the verge of pushing Brian McCann out of the catching position and into a DH role. Clint Frazier, acquired at the trade deadline is their No1 prospect at Triple-A and already is acting like the next coming of A-Rod, trying to pick up <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenselter/?hl=en\">social media star Jen Selter</a> on Instagram. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/clintfrazier/status/761202023320657920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenSelter\">@JenSelter</a> now that both of us are in New York, I think it&#39;s only fair you let me take you on a date! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SelterFrazierDate?src=hash\">#SelterFrazierDate</a></p>&mdash; Clint Frazier (@clintfrazier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clintfrazier/status/761202023320657920\">August 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Frazier is still in Scranton, but he obviously expects to be in the Big Apple shortly, possibly when the rosters expand in September. <a href=\"http://yanksgoyard.com/2016/08/16/yankees-september-call-ups/\">So are a host of other Yankee prospects</a> that have seen their farm system \u2013 already beefed up over the last few seasons \u2013 further enhanced at the trade deadline. <br></p> <p>In just a few days we learned that there\u2019s more to the Yankees future than just waiting for Bryce Harper in 2019. Their dealing of Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller and Carlos Beltran yielded 10 prospects, plus Adam Warren, now playing a key set-up role in the bullpen. Three of those were top prospects, Frazier, shortstop Gleyber Torres and pitcher Dillon Tate. <br></p> <p>The Yankees system is stacked, which doesn\u2019t always measure up on a big league level. So the question is, can the Yankees stay competitive during their latest transition? Turning such a trick would make a mockery of tanking teams such as the Astros and Braves, clubs that chose a long, arduous road filed with pain and suffering while rebuilding. <br></p> <p>Comparing smaller market rebuilds to the all-powerful Yankees might seem flawed, but it\u2019s not always about the money: Brian Cashman turned an acquisition of Chapman for their sixth and 10th-ranked prospects into the top rated Torres at a cost of just over $5m. If the infielder turns into a star down the road it will be an inexpensive steal. <br></p> <p>Right now it looks like the Yankees can\u2019t lose, even when they try to. After dealing away their biggest chips, New York are playing with a buzz at their ballpark, an outside shot at the post-season and a well-defined road map towards the future.</p> <h2>Video of the week<br></h2> <p>Once upon a time, there was rumor that the reason for the foul territory bullpens inside AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco was that the architect forgot to put them into the design. Humorous, but horse patootie. As it happens, the pens, which are so tight that relievers have no choice but to sit with the team in the dugout, were put there to allow fans to see who is warming up in a move designed to bring more intimacy to the game experience. </p> <p>Those bullpens also brought us Monday night, when Hunter Pence tripped over the right-field pitcher\u2019s mound, fell on his back, and still managed to make a ridiculous catch.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HL0vSd8LVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6HL0vSd8LVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A perfect 10 for Pence. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Honorable mention to Toronto Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zWBD8dtduY\">whose glove is keeping up with his suddenly smoking bat.</a></p> <h2>Quote of the Week</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m extremely hurt, the way things are being handled.

The 36-year-old has appeared in 93 of Oakland\u2019s 119 games thus far, isn\u2019t facing lefties and hasn\u2019t been pinch-hitting. </p> <h2>Who\u2019s closer to victory: Donald Trump or the Cubs?</h2> <p>This is a week that the Cubs are actually closer to being Donald Trump than an actual baseball team. <br></p> <p>On Sunday night, Chicago closer Aroldis Chapman pitched an incident-free ninth-inning against the St Louis Cardinals. Then the Wrigley Field DJ went to his archive, digging out Smack My Bitch Up, a 1990s track from The Prodigy. While it\u2019s true that a parent probably doesn\u2019t want to explain what smacking up a bitch is to an overtired nine-year-old pre-teen on a Sunday night, the selection becomes much worse when considering that Chapman served a 30-game suspension for an alleged domestic violence incident. <br></p> <p>The Cubs fired the DJ and apologized for the actions of their employee, one who recklessly called attention to their acquiring of a player accused of choking his girlfriend. <br></p> <p>This sort of straight-up provocation is right in Trump\u2019s wheelhouse, a Grade-A 100% Trump move. And come to think of it, considering Trump\u2019s past statements on women, I\u2019m of kind surprised we haven\u2019t heard that track at some of his campaign events.

In a year that Big Sexy went deep for the very first time in his long career, Colon has added another missing link to his arm-length r\u00e9sum\u00e9: a walk. It took 282 career plate appearances, but the beloved 43-year-old Mets hurler laid off a high 3-2 fastball during what was actually an extremely impressive at bat against Arizona\u2019s flame-throwing Robbie Ray. The impossible had finally happened. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MLBStatoftheDay/status/765389958500593665\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At age 43, after 19 seasons and 281 plate appearances, Bartolo Colon draws his first career walk. <a href=\"https://t.co/rxoynjwSkA\">pic.twitter.com/rxoynjwSkA</a></p>&mdash; MLB Stat of the Day (@MLBStatoftheDay) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLBStatoftheDay/status/765389958500593665\">August 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The next milestone for Colon? A stolen base. <br></p> <p>2) Giancarlo Stanton, bopper, home run champion, launcher of moonshots: out for the season after a serious groin injury on Sunday. The question is, do the Marlins, who find themselves right in the thick of the National League wild card race, actually need him to compete? This season, Miami are actually 12-4 without Stanton in the lineup and 50-53 with him. In 2015, the Fish were 30-44 with Stanton ripping, and 41-47 with him sitting. So during that span, Miami are two games over .500 without him and 17 under with him. <br></p> <p>While losing a bat the caliber of a Stanton may seem like the death knell for play-off baseball in southern Florida, we\u2019re talking about a team that\u2019s been competing despite an offense that\u2019s scored the fourth fewest runs in the NL. Their ability to win is not entirely attached to their lineup, or the bat of Stanton. <br></p> <p>3) Another team right in the play-off hunt are the Pittsburgh Pirates, a twice scorned franchise still reeling off the back of their recent wild card play-off defeats. <br></p> <p>The Pirates are desperate for a chance to lose their third wild card game, and have been showing signs of coming around after a frustrating season. Their mishmash rotation received a youthful injection that has changed the outlook considerably. Jamison Taillon is possibly the best rookie hurler in baseball, while fellow rookie Chad Kuhl has also helped solidify a starting five that suddenly seems more than legit. Ryan Vogelsong is back from injury, the newly acquired Ivan Nova is enjoying NL baseball and ace Gerrit Cole is steady despite being lit up his last start: that\u2019s a far cry from a group that included Jon Niese, Jeff Locke and Francisco Liriano this season. <br></p> <p>With the bullpen steadily adjusting to the loss of closer Mark Melancon, and a core of Francisco Cervelli, Andrew McCutchen, Jung Ho Kang, Sean Rodriguez and even David Freese, all scorching over the last week, there are signs that the Bucs may be equipped to make the play-offs for a third straight season after all, especially after heading out west and defeating the Dodgers and Giants in back-to-back series. <br></p> <p>4) Rob Manfred appeared as a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17317663/rob-manfred-baseball-changing-quicker-ever\">guest columnist on ESPN.com</a> on Wednesday to point out that baseball is changing quicker than ever, and that it\u2019s the commissioner\u2019s \u201cobligation to manage change so that the beauty of our game is preserved in a way that future generations continue to embrace the sport\u201d. Here\u2019s a few points Manfred made:<br></p> <ul> <li>In 1975, the average game was 2 hours and 30 minutes. Now the average game is three hours.</li> <li>Back in 1988, the average major league club used 17 pitchers over the course of the season. In 2015, the average club used 27 pitchers \u2026 we are seeing less of our star starting pitchers, more delays for pitching changes, and less action at exciting points late in the game. </li> <li>Players are hitting home runs at a record pace, but the number of balls put in play is at a historic low. There have been more strikeouts this season than in any other season in baseball history since 1871. </li> </ul> <p>Obviously, the boss thinks some things do need adjusting, so it seems that baseball will be seeing more tweaking in coming seasons, some of which may be being currently negotiated with the MLB Players\u2019 Association in the next collective bargaining agreement that expires in December. </p> <p>5) ICYMI: Indians catching prospect Francisco Mejia had his 50-game hitting streak snapped on Sunday. Mejia, was 0-3 with a walk while playing for the Class-A Lynchburg Hillcats. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MLBPipeline/status/764999968386064384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">80 days<br>50 games<br>2 teams<br>1 near trade<br>The epic streak of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Indians\">@Indians</a> prospect Francisco Mejia: <a href=\"https://t.co/lUac1mMq1r\">https://t.co/lUac1mMq1r</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/itAAhNe8nJ\">pic.twitter.com/itAAhNe8nJ</a></p>&mdash; MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLBPipeline/status/764999968386064384\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>6) Dusty Baker says Bryce Harper needs to be left alone to get out of his \u201cslump\u201d. The reigning MVP is hitting a staggering 281 points below his 2016 OPS of 1.109, while his batting average has tumbled by more than 100 points. <br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to tell him different things,\u201d said the Nats manager. \u201cBut after a while, you have to come out of it on your own, because everybody in the world has suggestions for him. Everybody. Some of the guys come and see me. Former players even.

What\u2019s scarier than the decline is what happens when he starts hitting: the Nats already have the fourth most runs scored in the NL despite Harper\u2019s \u201cstruggles\u201d. <br></p> <p>7) Kyle Koster of TheBigLead.com says that Tim Tebow is selling baseball memorabilia. Balls and bats can be yours for $125 and $175 a piece. I would love to know who takes real money out of their pocket and buys signed Time Tebow baseball stuff, and why. If anyone is willing to provide insight into this incredible phenomenon, please let us know. <br></p> <p>8) It isn\u2019t often, or ever, that a visitor to Philadelphia gets a hero\u2019s welcome but that\u2019s exactly what Chase Utley received in his first game back at Citizens Bank Park. Utley got plenty of brotherly love: two standing ovations and a curtain call while putting together another one of those nights where the 37-year-old rose to the occasion with a pair of homers including a grand slam. After three years of steep declines, Utley has put together a season as improbable as his Dodger team, which is now in first place despite all the injury obstacles of the season. <br></p> <p>9) And finally, is Jonathan Papelbon taking his throat and testicle grabbing services back to Boston? Papelbon was a chief offender inside the recent Nats bullpen blowups and was released, as per his own request, over the weekend. Since then <a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/08/17/john-farrell-reached-out-to-jonathan-papelbon-on-returning-to-the-red-sox/\">Sox manager John Farrell has had chats about his returning to Fenway Park</a>, where he spent the first seven seasons of his career. Outside of a rocky June and July, Papelbon has pitched reasonably well, posting a 3.00 ERA in April, May and August. However, Papelbon would be moving from what must be the lightest hitting division in all of baseball into the heavy hitting AL East, so Sox fans will be counting on that old change of scenery factor kicking in if they land their former closer. </p>",

Since those discussions began in 2012 the Ogiek have been allowed to live undisturbed on the land.</p> <p> But the boundary between the 17,000-hectare (42,000-acre) reserve and KFS-controlled land has never been made fully clear, says Justin Kenrick of the <a href=\"http://www.forestpeoples.org/\">Forest Peoples Programme</a>, an NGO that has been working with the Ogiek. </p> <p>Kenya\u2019s 2010 constitution protects indigenous rights to land, but the community land bill that is meant to put these into law is yet to be passed by parliament.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/578f4bcae4b03c1910482ffc#sdfootnote2sym\"></a>\u201c[Ogiek] rights have been brutalised,\u201d says Esther Mwangi, a scientist at the <a href=\"http://www.cifor.org/\">Centre for International Forestry Research</a>. \u201cA lot of this happens because of the lack of political power and influence.\u201d</p> <p>Things had been looking up for the Ogiek of Mount Elgon. They have written bylaws to ensure protection of the forest \u2013 which have been shared with government agencies, as part of their fight to convince the authorities that they had coexisted with the forest and its wildlife for centuries. They were also working with the KFS and <a href=\"http://www.kws.go.ke/\">Kenya Wildlife Service</a> to hand over poachers and illegal charcoal burners.

Kitelo claims trees are not being replanted and that farming is covering about 30,000 hectares, three times the area it is supposed to cover. Meanwhile, the KFS maintains that conservation requires the forest to be uninhabited.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no one living there,\u201d says Alex Lemarkoko, the KFS\u2019s head of enforcement, who claims that in June his team were only \u201cclearing\u201d the area of livestock herders. \u201cIn terms of evictions \u2013 no we have not done evictions.\u201d</p> <p> Lemarkoko also denied the existence of villages on the moors above the forest. \u201cIt is too high, people cannot live there \u2013 they don\u2019t live there,\u201d he says. \u201cHunting and gathering is a primitive practice, it doesn\u2019t happen in Kenya.\u201d</p> <p>The KFS believes people and wildlife must be kept separate. But, as Kenrick points out, numerous studies have shown that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bit.ly/1kpdAVW\">indigenous groups are often the most effective guardians of forests</a>. \u201cThe colonial approach to conservation has involved evicting the very communities who have sustained their lands for centuries or millennia, leaving their forests at the mercy of those whose only interest is in exploiting them,\u201d he says.</p> <p> This \u201ccolonial approach\u201d is followed across Kenya.

  "<p>Ice scientists are mostly cheerful and pragmatic. Like many other researchers coolly observing the rapid warming of the world, they share a gallows humour and are cautious about entering the political fray.</p> <p>Not Peter Wadhams. The former director of the Scott Polar Research Institute and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge has spent his scientific life researching the ice world, or the cryosphere, and in just 30 years has seen unimaginable change.</p> <p>When in 1970 he joined the first of what would be more than 50 polar expeditions, the Arctic sea ice covered around 8m sq km at its September minimum. Today, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/14/melting-arctic-ice-our-world\">hovers at around 3.4m</a>, and is declining by 13% a decade.

Above all, he says, people who study climate change should speak up and be prepared to risk the blighting of their careers and absence of honours. </p> <p>But he joins other climate researchers to cross lines that the public may still find unacceptable. He wants global action to find new ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and is not afraid of nuclear power \u2013 both of which answers can be swallowed \u2013 but he also argues for a colossal, global research programme in geo- engineering. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/climate-crisis-media-relegates-greatest-challenge-hurtle-us-collapse-planet\">The climate crisis is already here \u2013 but no one\u2019s telling us | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the deliberate attempt to reduce warming by the planetary-scale manipulation of weather patterns, oceans, currents, soils and atmosphere to decrease the amount of greenhouses gases. </p> <p>Spraying sun-reflecting chemicals into the atmosphere, mimicking volcanoes, blocking sunlight and fertilising the oceans with iron filings attracts people who think that technology has all the answers, but it should strike fear into most of the world, which has not been responsible for warming and which has no reason to trust politicians\u2019 or scientists\u2019 further meddling with planetary forces. </p> <p>How to proceed safely in a warming world without disastrous unintended consequences?

The efforts of women activists in the city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/01/boko-haram-maiduguri-nigeria\">Maiduguri</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/14/nigeria-women-activists-boko-haram\">Bring Back Our Girls campaign</a> prompted global protests and offers of support from governments around the world. The Chibok girls joined corruption, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jun/21/scamsandfraud.consumeraffairs\">\u201c419\u201d email scams</a> and oil as what the outside world knows of Nigeria.</p> <p>The attention has all but died down even though, 856 days after the abduction, the majority of the girls are yet to come home. This video, which gave a sign that some were still alive and in JAS hands, has reignited national and international debate about what should be done.</p> <p>Although the abduction from Chibok and the inability to secure the release of the girls has become symbolic of the conflict and the government response, it is representative of systemic issues rather than an exceptional case.

Women and girls in the north-east have been injured in and traumatised by attacks, which have left many with disabilities. Healthcare and counselling are unavailable or unaffordable. An impending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/un-accused-of-failing-as-nigerian-food-crisis-threatens-hundreds-of-thousands\">famine is now likely due to devastated farmland and the diversion of humanitarian aid</a>. With husbands and fathers often absent, women and girls struggle to provide for families. Few options for livelihoods are available due to the impact of the violence, low levels of education and societal norms.</p> <p>This reality, and the impact of rising food prices, means many feel they have no choice but to sell sex to survive. Reports of sexual exploitation and abuse in internally displaced people\u2019s (IDP) camps \u2013 even by government officials and members of the military and civilian militias \u2013 have yet to be met with strong action.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was last in Maiduguri, women activists told me of seeing men go to camps to find 'cheap brides'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The impact of the conflict on other kinds of gender-based violence is unknown, but we know that domestic violence often rises after violent conflict. When I was last in Maiduguri, women activists told me of seeing men go to IDP camps to find \u201ccheap brides\u201d: girls for whom they did not have to pay a high bride price.</p> <p>In addition to looking at all forms of violence against women and girls, we need to recognise their agency: women have negotiated humanitarian access with JAS for medical care; and they are instrumental in providing for families and communities. Before international agencies came to the north-east, it was women and men there who took care of IDPs.</p> <p>However, government response does not match these realities. As in other countries, women are left out of the decision-making process on what happens in the north-east: committees of inquiry, government positions and peace negotiations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/14/un-accused-of-failing-as-nigerian-food-crisis-threatens-hundreds-of-thousands\">UN accused of failing as north-east Nigeria at risk of famine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gendered assumptions are evident when talking about JAS. Men are seen as choosing to join while it is assumed that women have been forced. This is not always true. There is a spectrum between the forced and voluntary for women and girls, as there is for men and boys. Although women and girls make up the majority of those taken, JAS has abducted boys and men too.</p> <p>This latest video should prompt us to reflect on the holistic solutions needed, as well as what can be done to rescue these girls. Strategies to prevent abductions, ensure comprehensive service provision and address stigma should be put in place. A more nuanced approach to how gender norms play out is needed to ensure the realities facing male and female combatants are reflected in programmes for disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and rehabilitation. We need to prioritise women\u2019s meaningful participation in peace-building and other areas of decision-making, and take action to rectify the marginalisation, frustration and unequal power relations felt by women and men.</p> <p>The abductions from Chibok are only one part of the story. Without looking at the whole picture, we do not recognise that other women and girls are suffering too.</p>",

That\u2019s because it\u2019s popular to say that a meme has died once it has been reported on by the media and reproduced by the masses. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jun/08/the-month-in-memes-viral-comedy-june-2016\">Unicycling frog Dat Boi</a> has been declared dead on a number of occasions, but is still regularly referenced on social media. It echoes the age-old adolescent frustration about alternative culture being co-opted by the mainstream, and is proof that, in some quarters, the kind of memes you\u2019re into says just as much about you as your Instagram feed or your preferred Labour party faction.</p> <p>Yet mainstream culture\u2019s appropriation of memes can be a serious issue. Many memes first gain traction on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Twitter\">Black Twitter</a> \u2013 the name given to a subset of the platform\u2019s users best known for birthing social justice movements such as Black Lives Matter. One recent trend directed by Black Twitter has been the creation of memes from 90s PBS cartoon <strong>Arthur</strong>. Stills from the show are used as shorthand for various feelings \u2013 a closeup of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BestArthurMemes/status/759137680051625984\">Arthur\u2019s clenched fist</a>, for example, equals suppressed rage \u2013 while the different skin colours of the characters allow meme-makers to layer on jokes about racial politics, such as Arthur\u2019s sister DW silencing her white bunny friend as she utters the dubious phrase <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coolminnie16/status/758648466088169472\">\u201call lives matter\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e7c0bac09562f18663efdac68c9ef4e93e713f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e7c0bac09562f18663efdac68c9ef4e93e713f8/0_0_592_458/500.jpg\" alt=\"arthur\" width=\"500\" height=\"387\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arthur\u2019s first has become a Harambe meme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/alexmemepage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when a meme like this becomes popular, the concept of Black Twitter is often erased from the conversation: in the case of Arthur, many websites wrote about the phenomenon without referencing who came up with it. And when that is viewed as part of a narrative that has seen white people endlessly appropriate black culture, it becomes about more than just who projected adult emotion on to a kids\u2019 cartoon first.</p> <p>Returning to the subject of death (this is 2016: worst year since records began, after all), you may remember hearing the story of <strong>Harambe</strong>, the 17-year-old gorilla who was killed in May after a child climbed into his enclosure in Cincinnati Zoo. Meme-makers have seized on this gorilla\u2019s death (initially on Black Instagram, as it happens), honouring the ape in social media posts with a cod-fanaticism that belies references to a number of things. Originally, the blinkered mourning of Harambe was a parody of the hysteria expressed by some social media users at the news of its shooting, yet in his afterlife, Harambe\u2019s death and the remembrance of it have been woven into multiple other narratives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8f051bfc05fc8a9e6f642b7803558016d169ee7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8f051bfc05fc8a9e6f642b7803558016d169ee7/0_0_488_571/427.jpg\" alt=\"2016 has been a year characterised by great loss\" width=\"427\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2016 has been a year characterised by great loss</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@WORLDSTAR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>2016, for example, has seen an unprecedented number of major cultural figures pass away, leading to the media to indulge in a perpetual state of bereavement. Some memes have included Harambe in this pantheon of greats, a joke that acts as a sort of release valve from the pressure of constant mourning. At the same time, Harambe also represents stubborn remembrance in a world of rolling atrocity news \u2013 don\u2019t forget it\u2019s been four months since he died, roughly 10,000 years in meme-time \u2013 and part of the joke is trying to make anything and everything a tribute to him, countering the compulsive forgetting that the media usually practises. (See, for instance, the defaced <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-mock-memorial-defaced-with-harambe-the-gorilla-epitaph-a3300936.html\">Taylor Swift mural</a> that commemorated the singer\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d after losing a spat with Kim and Kanye, and some US teens <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/rip-harambe-the-gorilla-who-died\">tricking Google</a> into renaming a street Harambe Drive.) </p> <p>These callbacks are a standard meme mechanism, but what\u2019s different about Harambe is how much importance he has been imbued with over time. As of August 2016, Harambe is widely regarded to be of cosmic significance, his death half an opening of a Pandora\u2019s box of 21st-century ills, half a martyrdom of saint-like proportions. Earlier this month <a href=\"http://gawker.com/poll-five-percent-of-americans-would-vote-harambe-the-1784603044\">Gawker reported on a poll</a> that saw 5% of people choose Harambe as their preferred presidential candidate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811a830c37713e3a319a606aa1c7ea5e4c8579c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811a830c37713e3a319a606aa1c7ea5e4c8579c4/445_0_11542_6928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Australian road safety campaign\u2019s Graham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Australian road safety campaign\u2019s Graham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/road-safety-confronting-sculpture-shows-human-vulnerability-to-crashes\">Road safety: confronting sculpture shows human vulnerability to crashes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rounding off a triad of death-related memes is <strong>Graham</strong>.

  "<p>\u201cYou need to puncture your raft before you arrive, or they\u2019ll send you back.\u201d \u201cIf you apply for the relocation programme, they send you to Venezuela.\u201d \u201cIn Europe you won\u2019t need money, everything is free.\u201d</p> <p>These are just three of the many confusing rumours that migrants and refugees might hear. Some of them are downright dangerous, like the one about the raft. Others cause people to make the wrong decisions or take risks. <br></p> <p>In response, the Mediterranean Rumour Tracker project has been launched to better inform migrants of the facts. Fieldworkers who speak Arabic or Farsi engage with people in the Greek camps, collect the rumours that are circulating, and then verify or dispel them. This information is posted on a dedicated <a href=\"https://newsthatmoves.org/en/category/rumours/\">website</a> and corresponding Facebook pages in English, Arabic, Farsi and Greek.</p> <p>\u201cWith our Facebook pages, we reach about 350,000 people,\u201d says Stijn Aelbers of <a href=\"https://internews.org/\">InterNews</a>, the organisation that has set up the rumour tracker in collaboration with two other NGOs: <a href=\"http://translatorswithoutborders.org/\">Translators without Borders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.actionaid.org.uk/\">ActionAid</a>. \u201cBut we think face-to-face contact is just as important. People like to talk with a real person, they want to be able to ask questions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes we are able to prevent people from falling in the trap</p> <footer> <cite>Nayief Salameh</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Migrants and refugees are constantly on the move; this means traditional media often don\u2019t reach them. So they get their information from hearsay, from stories that circulate among their group. Aelbers says: \u201cAs many of these stories are unfounded or only half true, they run the risk [of taking the] important next steps on the basis of false information.\u2019\u2019 </p> <p>Some rumours arise simply because people misinterpret information they get. \u201cThe rumour about Venezuela, which as a South American country cannot be part of the EU-relocation programme, probably stems from a Greek ferry boat called Venizelos,\u201d he adds. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48361f96da64d792724df709a47c5f0a20b7231f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48361f96da64d792724df709a47c5f0a20b7231f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a life vest to guide a raft carrying Syrian and Iraqi refugees onto the island of Lesbos from Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a life vest to guide a raft carrying Syrian and Iraqi refugees onto the island of Lesbos from Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rumours can also be damaging in other ways. Some may be told not tell the authorities that they are Muslim, leading them to lie during registration procedures, which can cause problems later on. And rumours in refugee camps that some groups are treated better than others, or simply get better food, can lead to conflict and brawls.</p> <p>The concept of the rumour tracker is not new. InterNews tried it out during the Ebola crisis in Liberia and during the earthquake in Nepal in 2015. \u201cRumours play an enormous role in every crisis, because people will always fill in the gaps in the information they get,\u201d Aelbers says. \u201cSo when a government campaign informs them that Ebola kills, but they see some patients recovering, rumours spring up immediately that these people are ghosts. <br></p> <p>\u201cBy dispelling rumours you can avoid huge problems. And this is certainly the case during the refugee crisis, where so many people are basing their survival strategies on false rumours. In a way, the refugee crisis is also an information crisis.\u2019\u2019</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/20/children-fleeing-conflict-deserve-more-world-humanitarian-summit\">Children fleeing conflict deserve more than razor wire and border fences | Carsten V\u00f6lz and Andreas Papp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shabnam Mortazavi is one of the four volunteers that work as refugee liaison officers for the rumour tracker in the Greek camps. Being of Iranian descent, she is fluent in Farsi, which not only enables her to communicate with Iranians, but also with Afghans, a large group among the migrants. She has recently arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos, where she\u2019s visiting the official and unofficial camps.</p> <p>\u201cMy work starts with simply talking to people,\u201d she says. \u201cI go up to them and ask them how they are and what\u2019s challenging them. I give them useful information and try to build up trust. And then they start to tell me the rumours they\u2019ve heard.\u201d </p> <p>She writes down everything she hears meticulously. \u201cRumours are also a good barometer: they tell you what\u2019s going on among migrants,\u2019\u2019 Mortazavi says. \u201cThe stories are changing all the time. When the Balkan countries where closing the borders for Afghans in February and March, there were constant rumours that they would be admitted again soon. Right now we hear lots of rumours about family reunification and returning to Turkey.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>The smugglers also spread these stories about the borders to persuade people to use their services, or to drive up the price. They might also tell migrants that in Europe everything is free, encouraging people to spend all their money on passage. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey will also say: once you come to Greece, you will be transported to Germany immediately,\u201d says Mortazavi\u2019s Arabic-speaking colleague Nayief Salameh. \u201cI met people who believed this rumour and sold everything they had to come to Greece. They were devastated when they arrived and found themselves stuck in a camp. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/close-worlds-refugee-camps-says-david-miliband\">David Miliband: close the world's refugee camps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut sometimes we are able to prevent people from falling in the trap,\u201d Salameh continues. \u201cFor example, Greek travel agents on the islands spread the rumour that migrants who book a ferry to Athens need to also buy a bus ticket to Macedonia. It was a lie to make more money \u2013 once people arrived in Athens, they found out there was no bus. It\u2019s very helpful when you can dispel such rumours.\u2019\u2019 </p> <p>Aelbers believes that the need for the rumour tracker service highlights the failure of larger NGOs to keep migrants informed. \u201c[They] tend to be quite reluctant to provide information. Sometimes that\u2019s good, because the situation changes every day. But it is not always in the best interest of the migrants. Our approach is different. We work with information given by refugees.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>InterNews\u2019s motto is that communication is aid. \u201cMigrants and refugees often feel cut off from the world,\u201d Aelbers says. \u201cThere are not many people who speak their language [so] even fewer people are prepared to listen to them. And they seldom come across someone who says, \u2018OK, I am going to find out whether this story you\u2019ve heard is true and give you helpful information\u2019.\u201d </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

R\u00f6yksopp? Earlier this week, he finally revealed a few items from his current motivational playlist, including Promises by Nero and Skrillex and No Beef by Afrojack and Steve Aoki. That aggressive combination of jabbing synths and pounding kick drum is pretty standard for Phelps; in the past, he has dropped names such as Young Jeezy, Eminem and Lil Wayne. But while Phelps\u2019s teammate Ryan Lochte is reported to get similarly fired up by Lil Wayne\u2019s rhetoric in The Sky Is the Limit (\u201cCos the sky is the limit / The sky is the limit / And if you look high, you see that I\u2019m gonna be in it\u201d), the collective playlist of 2016\u2019s Olympians is a more multi-dimensional musical beast.

  "<p>The protest that interrupted Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) on Wednesday was perfectly pitched. Just after the prime minister warned about the international return of \u201cinward-looking\u201d populist politics, in came a woman with a sign reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/close-the-bloody-camps-protesters-disrupt-malcolm-turnbull-speech\">\u201cFFS close the bloody camps\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s attempt to project seriousness and toughness on economic matters was overshadowed by a reminder of how the Liberal party actually wins elections. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/close-the-bloody-camps-protesters-disrupt-malcolm-turnbull-speech\">Refugee protesters disrupt Malcolm Turnbull speech: 'Close the bloody camps'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His attempt to criticise the likes of Pauline Hanson and Donald Trump in the name of free markets was deflated by a blunt reference to an electoral history that he, and everyone who has benefited from it, should never be allowed to disavow. </p> <p>If you didn\u2019t catch the speech, Turnbull diagnosed the rise of rightwing populism as an outcome of \u201cuncertainty\u201d: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Political divisions in advanced economies \u2013 particularly where there is high unemployment or a high risk of unemployment \u2013 are feeding on a sense of disenfranchisement among many people who feel the rapid economic changes of our time, have left them behind.</p> <p>Political responses to this mood of disaffection can have the potential to destabilise global growth, perhaps even reversing some of the spectacular gains that we have made over recent decades, through open markets and free trade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Note that Turnbull\u2019s main concern is that this all leads to \u201cprotectionism\u201d. He doesn\u2019t mention the blatant xenophobia that figures like Hanson and Trump invoke in scapegoating minority groups, and the heightened racial tension that this produces. </p> <p>In a way, that makes sense. The Liberal party has shown, at least since the Tampa election of 2001, that it is more than happy to recalibrate the Hansonist message to its own ends. It has been populist on immigration, and ruthlessly orthodox on economics. </p> <p>It has been far more concerned with departures from neoliberal doctrine than with the fate of those \u2013 including children \u2013 who have been imprisoned for seeking asylum in Australia. </p> <p>Since 2001, at crucial moments, it has run on platforms that scapegoat refugees, while doing nothing to ameliorate the economic system that produces a feeling of \u201cdisenfranchisement\u201d among those who have been \u201cleft behind\u201d, and drives some of them into the arms of racist parties. </p> <p>In particular, in 2013, when Tony Abbott won the majority that Malcolm Turnbull has all but lost, he ran a relentlessly negative and cynical campaign that could almost be a prototype for Trumpism. </p> <p>Where Trump promises to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d; Abbott said he would \u201cstop the boats\u201d. Where Abbott promised to \u201cend the waste\u201d, Trump promises to \u201cdo better deals\u201d. While Abbott pandered to climate change denying crackpots, Trump peddles conspiracy theories about his primary opponents. Each energised the rightward edge of his party. </p> <p>And both men have projected hypermasculine public images while prosecuting intensely personal, sexist campaigns against female opponents. While Trump talks about \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d, Abbott yelled about Julia Gillard\u2019s \u201ccriminal government\u201d. </p> <p>Granted, Tony Abbott and Donald Trump have different relationships to their parties\u2019 establishments, but the fact that the Liberals promoted Abbott is not to their credit. </p> <p>Turnbull served as a cabinet minister while all this was going on, and when the opportunity arose to knock off Abbott, he was happy to swoop on the fruits that the 2013 campaign bore. He is complicit in the further entrenchment of racially-inflected scapegoating as the Australian right\u2019s way of doing politics. </p> <p>In office, Turnbull may have wound back the rhetoric, but he hasn\u2019t changed refugee policy at all, and seems unable or unwilling to rein in those members of his party who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/13/senator-cory-bernardi-wins-inquiry-into-halal-and-kosher-certifications\">obsess about halal food</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/17/hell-will-freeze-over-before-i-pull-out-of-reclaim-australias-rally\">attend Reclaim Australia rallies</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/if-malcolm-turnbull-cant-fix-this-mess-tony-abbott-is-available\">If Malcolm Turnbull can't fix this mess, Tony Abbott is available | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he deserves any credit at all, it arises from the fact that his lack of evident enthusiasm in administering these policies has led the likes of <a href=\"http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/malcolm_turnbull_you_are_finished/\">Andrew Bolt to criticise him</a> relentlessly. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Liberal party has been the principal agent in embedding an immigration system, and a kind of ambient public racism, that acts as a <a href=\"http://www.ukipdaily.com/how-australia-stopped-mass-immigration/\">model for populist right wing groups</a> in Europe and elsewhere. (Labor\u2019s craven accommodation of this \u2013 after having initiated mandatory detention in the first place \u2013 is a discussion for another day.)</p> <p>And Turnbull\u2019s solution to the social and economic dislocations that far-right parties exploit is \u2026 more of the same. More free trade agreements, more tax cuts for business, and some vague noises about \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d. </p> <p>None of this suggests that Malcolm Turnbull understands what gives rise to populist revolts. And anyway, no one needs to take his pronouncements on rightwing populist ideas seriously until he stops profiting from them, and closes the bloody camps. </p>",
  "<p>It had been more than four months since we last walked through this woodland. Gone were the songs of wood warblers and blackcaps.

In Morocco, for example, the water table of the Sa\u00efss deep aquifer \u2013 one of north Africa\u2019s largest aquifers \u2013 has fallen by an annual average of 3m over the past 20 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d919b41e30577f0ff787e46b3ceaeea56a6a7994\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d919b41e30577f0ff787e46b3ceaeea56a6a7994/0_0_2304_3072/750.jpg\" alt=\"A young boy stands next to a newly installed water pump in the Rift Valley, Ethiopia\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young boy stands next to a newly installed water pump in the Rift Valley, Ethiopia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Villholth/IMWI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the right policies and incentives are in place, however, groundwater can be exploited sustainably, argues Jeremy Bird, director general of IWMI.</p> <p>Not only is groundwater more locally available and more reliable than rain in many parts of Africa, says Bird, it also serves as a better buffer to climate shocks: \u201cIt provides an opportunity for farmers to move one step up the ladder from very uncertain rain-fed irrigation, which is subject to the vagaries of climate, to supplementary irrigation, which offers them the ability to provide water when the crop really needs it.\u201d</p> <p>Improving Africa\u2019s irrigation infrastructure has long been a goal of national policymakers and development agencies. The World Bank, for instance, is currently trying to mobilise international funders to help <a href=\"http://www.westafricagateway.org/content/en/sahel-irrigation-initiative-programme-more-better-and-faster\" rel=\"nofollow\">double irrigation levels</a> in six countries in the drought-prone Sahel region. </p> <p>The Sahel Irrigation Initiative Programme, with input from IWMI, is now considering the use of simple, farmer-managed pump bores alongside its focus on more expensive canals, reservoirs and other centrally-managed surface water infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Vincent Casey, water, sanitation and hygiene senior adviser at WaterAid, however warns these simple pumps must be managed well: \u201cDespite the advantages of convenience and affordability, the scale of pumping is very difficult to regulate which inevitably has economic consequences when groundwater is depleted.\u201d<br></p> <p>Africa may have considerable untapped aquifers, but not all are able to be easily and affordably accessed, says Casey. \u201cRural electrification has been limited, discounting the possibility of politically motivated energy subsidies that could make high powered pumping affordable to small scale farmers\u201d. Capacity for groundwater withdrawal is also hampered by a lack of reliable hydro-geological data (Ethiopia has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.trust.org//item/20140225161943-p7812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mapped less than one quarter</a> of its groundwater resources) and relevant expertise. </p> <p>All these factors contribute to a patchy experience of groundwater projects to date. According to UPGro \u2013 a DFID-funded research programme examining groundwater in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://upgro.org/consortium/hidden-crisis2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly one third</a> of such projects in sub-Saharan Africa fail within a few years of construction. The World Bank puts the estimated cost of groundwater project failures at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://upgro.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hidden_crisis_final_report_v7.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than $1.2bn</a> (pdf) in lost investment over the last 20 years. </p> <p>The main aim of GRIPP, which is focusing on projects not just in Africa but around the world, is to correct this trend through the promotion of research and knowledge-sharing around sustainable groundwater withdrawal practices and policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/13/namibia-drought-coca-cola-meat-construction-industry-water-crisis-climate-change\">'Extreme measures are needed': Namibia's battle with drought comes to its cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A vital step in this respect centres on farmer buy-in, says Ugandan water planning expert Callist Tindimugaya, vice president of the International Association of Hydrologists, a GRIPP partner. Because groundwater is an \u201cinvisible commons\u201d, he argues, farmers struggle to know what comprises sustainable usage. Government provision of cheap power for water pumps and other price incentives to promote agricultural productivity can lead to overuse as well, he adds.</p> <p>\u201cLocal initiatives to co-manage the resource are increasingly being explored as an important element in sustainable groundwater use as farmers realise their common interest in safeguarding the resource,\u201d says Tindimugaya. </p> <p>A case in point from another part of the world is in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, where farmer groups in over 700 communities agreed to collectively monitor groundwater levels, to plan their crop planting jointly and to adopt water-saving techniques. The project, which ran from 2003 to 2009, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/apfarms/reports/GCPIND175NET-APFAMGS_eval_final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">successfully reduced overexploitation</a> (pdf) in the semi-arid state. Since the project ended, however, and without adequate governance systems in place, most of the farmer-led initiatives have ceased.<br></p> <p>Policymakers might find incentives the best initial defence against unsustainable abstraction, says Bird. He cites a <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/21325090/Irrigation_Management_Reform_in_Northern_China_Case_Studies_in_Shanxi_Province\" rel=\"nofollow\">pilot project</a> in the Chinese province of Shanxi, where farmers access set volumes of water from the state-run pumping system with pre-paid smartcards. If they use less than their quota of pumping time, they can trade it with other farmers.</p> <p>\u201cOur role is to identify the types of policies which might work in a particular situation, learn lessons from other areas and then assess the impacts of these policy decisions over time and see what the implications have been,\u201d says Bird. </p>",

We understand the clash of calendars came about because News chose an earlier date this year to coincide with a visit to Sydney by Rupert Murdoch.
