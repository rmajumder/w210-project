  "<p>Just over a decade ago, it took all of Ichiro Akuto\u2019s powers of persuasion to convince a bank to lend him the money to open a whisky distillery.<br></p> <p>Today, despite working out of modest premises with just two tiny pot stills in the hills of Chichibu, a town 100 km northwest of Tokyo, Akuto\u2019s single malts are winning rave reviews from the global whisky cognoscenti.</p> <p>Many are willing to pay hundreds of dollars - and in a few cases much more - for a bottle of single malt from what is Japan\u2019s smallest distillery.<br></p> <p>The Whisky Magazine, a British publication, has consistently given awards to Akuto\u2019s firm, Venture Whisky, and its range of \u201cIchiro\u2019s\u201d single malts now rival those from the bigger and more established Japanese distillers Suntory and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/21/japan-whisky-industry\">Nikka</a>.</p> <p> This year, Akuto <a href=\"http://www.worldwhiskiesawards.com/venture-whisky-ichiro-s-malt-chichibu-single-cask-no-3867.25946.html\">won first prize</a> in the Japanese single malt single class category at the World Whiskies Awards.</p> <p>The 50-year-old traces Japan\u2019s newfound obsession with whisky to its long history of brewing sake. \u201cWe love perfecting the art of making things, so you could say we\u2019re quite geeky in that respect,\u201d he says. \u201cThat determination to do things right extends to whisky.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"030d9a20e7f9eb3086c204e923a5fa5a493ae2e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/030d9a20e7f9eb3086c204e923a5fa5a493ae2e9/0_55_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Venture Whisky uses two pot stills imported from Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venture Whisky uses two pot stills imported from Scotland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The comparison is particularly apposite in Akuto\u2019s case. His grandfather, a sake maker, was running the family\u2019s 300-year-old sake brewery when, on a whim, he decided to obtain a distiller\u2019s license a year after the second world war ended.</p> <p>Akuto\u2019s father continued to dabble in whisky making, using two stills imported from Scotland to produce about 400 casks. By 2000, however, the end of Japan\u2019s bubble economy and a decline in sake consumption forced the family to sell up.</p> <p>The sale, though, turned out to be the beginning of Ichiro Akuto\u2019s successful career as a distiller, after he snapped up the unwanted stills and casks of maturing whisky from the brewery\u2019s new owners.</p> <p>He launched Venture Whisky in 2008 and produced his first label \u2013 Ichiro\u2019s Vintage Single Malt 1988 \u2013 the following year. Much of the rest of the inherited stock went into Venture\u2019s award-winning \u201ccard\u201d series, with each small batch labelled with the name of a playing card.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58ee8bae1c35147adb7b24a9112c6b7227ef188f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ee8bae1c35147adb7b24a9112c6b7227ef188f/19_376_2451_3062/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ichiro Akuto, president of Venture whisky, outside his distillery in Chichibu, Japan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ichiro Akuto, president of Venture whisky, outside his distillery in Chichibu, Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The whiskies sold out as soon as they went on sale, bought, in some cases, for tens of thousands of yen online by whisky enthusiasts. Some bottles in the series are now considered collector\u2019s items.</p> <p>Akuto achieved another milestone last year when a bottle of his 1960 Karuizawa single malt \u2013 made with whisky rescued from the family sake brewery - sold for a US$118,500 at an auction in Hong Kong, a record for a Japanese whisky. </p> <p>The bottle sold at Bonhams was one of its kind just 41 in existence, but it is the whiskies - which cost anything from a few thousand yen to 100,000 yen or more - made exclusively at the Chichibu distillery that are reinforcing Japan\u2019s unlikely status as a whisky superpower.</p> <p>Most of the distillery\u2019s barley comes from Norfolk, with smaller quantities from Germany and Scotland, whose peaty tones initially struggled to win over Japanese drinkers more accustomed to lighter, floral flavours. Akuto is also experimenting with barley grown locally, a bold move that, if successful, promises to produce a genuinely Japanese whisky.</p> <p>The company produced 90,000 bottles of whisky last year, about half of which were for the international market, with the UK, France and Taiwan among its biggest customers. It has also started exporting to the US.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf we were interested in just making balanced, easy-to-drink whiskies then we would inevitably have to compete with Suntory and Nikka,\u201d says Yumi Yoshikawa, Venture\u2019s brand ambassador.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re trying to do the opposite \u2013 making whiskies with character that are not necessarily balanced or easy to drink. That\u2019s how we\u2019re keeping our market share,\u201d adds Yoshikawa, whose love of the \u201cwater of life\u201d has taken her on study tours to 70 distilleries around the world over the past five years.</p> <p>Venture\u2019s older single malts of the future are maturing in 4,000 casks that once contained sherry from Spain and Portugal, wine from France and bourbon from the US. At the firm\u2019s in-house cooperage, lengths of Japanese oak are being turned into wholly domestic casks that will impart new flavours to its whiskies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ae56a542e9ca284786d0a1818a0aa56005c3745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ae56a542e9ca284786d0a1818a0aa56005c3745/0_13_4920_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casks of whisky at Venture Whisky\u2019s distillery in Chichibu, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casks of whisky at Venture Whisky\u2019s distillery in Chichibu, Japan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chichibu\u2019s hot, humid summers and cold winters are ideally suited to whisky production, with the temperature variation exacerbated by the town\u2019s mountainous location. \u201cThat all makes for deep whisky maturation,\u201d Akuto says.</p> <p>The number of international awards going to Japanese whiskies underlines the dramatic progress the country\u2019s distillers have made since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/american-actor-charlotte-kate-fox-mother-japanese-whisky\">Masataka Taketsuru</a> launched Suntory\u2019s Yamazaki distillery in 1923. As recently as the 1990s, whisky \u2013 usually the blended variety \u2013 was often drunk as highballs or watered down, mizuwari-style, in salaryman bars.</p> <p>Chichibu, though, is the closest Japan comes to a genuinely craft distillery, with a staff of 14 whose average age is just 30. \u201cWe\u2019re not competing with the big companies,\u201d says Akuto, who likens his enterprise to a lean sumo wrestler who, lacking the heft to bulldoze his opponents, must rely on faultless technique and a sense of adventure.</p> <p>\u201cYou could say that we\u2019re building our own, more exclusive sumo ring and keeping out the bigger guys out that way,\u201d he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c08ebb558d6cad65d4c973d6d4b20c7762a901dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08ebb558d6cad65d4c973d6d4b20c7762a901dc/0_235_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles of whisky produced at Venture Whisky\u2019s distillery in Chichibu, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bottles of whisky produced at Venture Whisky\u2019s distillery in Chichibu, Japan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has ambitious plans for his distillery, including a 10 percent annual increase in sales and expanded premises. But he has no intention of selling his idiosyncratic whiskies in supermarkets or convenience stores; instead, their growing number of devotees must go online or buy directly from specialist suppliers, including high-end department stores.</p> <p>\u201cOur whiskies are relatively expensive, and they\u2019re intended to be drunk over time and savoured,\u201d says Akuto, whose next big project is to release a 10-year-old whisky to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, followed by a 30-year-old single malt made entirely in Chichibu.</p> <p>Judging by the reviews his tiny distillery has received so far, they will be worth the wait.</p>",

  "<p>I pity the civil servants in the Department of Health who are forced to give platitudinous responses to the press (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/secret-documents-reveal-official-concerns-over-seven-day-nhs-plans\" title=\"\">Leak reveals doubts over \u2018seven-day NHS\u2019</a>, 23 August). In 2012 the then secretary of state for health, Andrew Lansley, fought tooth and nail (using taxpayers money) to hide the risk assessment done before the disastrous health and social care bill, despite intervention by the information commissioner. There, the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d has occurred after the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Civil servants are right to be worried that there is not enough money or sufficient trained staff available to carry out the policy, as there is insufficient money to run the NHS as it exists, providing a five-day elective (planned) and seven-day emergency service.</p> <p>The lack of detailed planning of the proposed service is analogous to the way the Cameron government approached the EU referendum. What the NHS needs is more money to deal with rising demand, which could easily be found by scrapping the wasteful tendering processes which have resulted in almost \u00a320bn of contracts going to the private sector since 2013, reviewing PFI debts costing over \u00a32bn per year, reducing expenditure on the CQC, which has become unwieldy but arguably has failed to prevent hospital disasters, and reducing the six-figure salaries that too many top managers are now paid.

But Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured during the military dictatorship, has vowed to fight to the end. \u201cThe only thing that kills anti-democratic parasites is the oxygen of debate,\u201d she told supporters last week.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Impeachment supporters believe a final vote \u2013 which is expected to be passed by the necessary two-thirds majority of the 81 senators on Tuesday or Wednesday \u2013 will provide catharsis and allow Temer\u2019s administration to plot a new course for the nation.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Opponents say it is the culmination of a constitutional coup to end 13 years of Workers party rule, runs roughshod over the democratic choice of the 54 million voters who re-elected Rousseff in 2014,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-michel-temer-cabinet\"> reverses progress towards gender and ethnic equality</a> and is part of a plot to curtail the \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">Lava Jato</em>\u201d (car wash) corruption investigation that has implicated dozens of senior politicians.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The numbers are against the president.

Newspaper forecasts suggest there has been little progress since then in swaying senators to switch sides, but Rousseff\u2019s supporters have not given up hope of a last-minute reprieve and promise to fight to the end.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere will be a very strong debate because all sides are tense,\u201d one senator, Vanessa Grazziotin, told local media in a warning that Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the upper house would not let the president go quietly \u201clike a lamb to the slaughter\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In the early years of her presidency, she was one of the most popular leaders in the world, with approval ratings of 92%. But Rousseff, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/dilma-rousseff-brazil-impeachment-fight-congress-vote\">poor communicator who presided over several years of decline and upheaval</a>, has become deeply unpopular with the electorate and for much of the past year her approval ratings have hovered around 10%. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Many of her allies, including the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, have been implicated in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/brazil-government-crisis-briefing-dilma-rousseff-lula-petrobas\"><em>Lava Jato</em> investigation into corruption at Petrobras</a>, which has tainted almost all of the major parties. As a former energy minister and head of her party, critics say, Rousseff should have known what was going on, but she has not been charged.<br></p> <p>Instead, she is being impeached for window-dressing government accounts before the last election by issuing decrees on spending without congressional approval and waiting several months to reimburse a state-owned bank for a low-interest financing scheme for family farmers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Senators must decide if this is a \u201ccrime of responsibility\u201d that merits removal from office. Rousseff\u2019s lawyers claim the argument against her is more political than legal. Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous national and regional administrations, but they are a pretext to remove a leader who has struggled to assert her authority.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There are widespread concerns about the way she has been elbowed out of power by her former running mate, Temer, who conspired against her even though he, as former vice-president, bore a similar share of responsibility for failed economic policies and widespread corruption.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Opinion polls suggest the interim president is almost as despised as his predecessor. \u201c<em>Fora Temer!</em>\u201d (Temer out) placards were prominently displayed during the Olympics.

She has previously noted that the impeachment process was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/brazil-lower-house-speaker-eduardo-cunha-resignsimmediately\">launched by the former house speaker Eduardo Cunha</a> after the Workers party refused to protect him from corruption and perjury accusations in the congressional ethics committee. Tapes of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/brazil-dilma-rousseff-plot-secret-phone-transcript-impeachment\">secretly recorded conversations</a> have also revealed that Temer\u2019s most powerful ally in the upper house \u2013 the PMDB Senate leader Romero Juc\u00e1 \u2013 was plotting to oust Rousseff because he wanted to curtail the <em tabindex=\"-1\">Lava Jato</em> investigation, which implicated him and dozens of other politicians in the multibillion-dollar corruption scandal at the state oil company Petrobras.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Following the president\u2019s statement, senators will begin their interrogation. It is likely to be a noisily partisan affair. Up to 20 supporters from each side will be invited into the chamber. Rousseff\u2019s allies will include Lula, the former president, senior ministers and the musician Chico Buarque, who has been prominent at many anti-impeachment rallies. Their opponents will include leaders of the <em tabindex=\"-1\">Vem Pra Rua</em> (take to the streets) campaign and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/24/brazil-activists-march-free-markets-margaret-thatcher-rand-paul\">libertarian <em tabindex=\"-1\">Movimento Brasil Livre</em></a> (Free Brazil Movement). <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Several questions \u2013 including the first of the session from Kati\u00e1 Abreu \u2013 will come from allies, which will provide an opportunity for the president to highlight the positives of her time in office. Since the Workers party gained power in 2003, tens of millions of Brazilians have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/brazil-bolsa-familia-decade-anniversary-poverty-relief\">moved out of poverty thanks to \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">bolsa familia</em>\u201d welfare payments</a>, increased access to education and \u2013 until the last few years \u2013 a strong economy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She will also declare once again her innocence of any crime. Her supporters also emphasise that Rousseff has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\">a far cleaner record than that of many of her accusers</a> in both the lower and upper house.</p> <p>Last week, the Workers party senator Gleisi Hoffmann told the upper house that \u201cno one here\u201d had the moral ground to judge Rousseff.

She could have chosen immigration. If the conventional wisdom is now that the leave vote was a yelp of outrage, the attendant consensus is that foreigners were its source.</p> <p>The prime minister went instead to the issue that is the functional, rhetorical and ideological opposite of immigration: inequality. She has ordered <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-orders-government-audit-to-tackle-racial-disparities-in-public-service-outcomes\" title=\"\">a government audit into racial disparities in public service outcomes</a>. By 2017, a citizen armed only with his or her age, postcode and racial profile will be able to determine the likelihood of being unemployed, detained under the Mental Health Act, arrested or excluded from school.</p> <p>The audit will be updated annually. There are reasons to be sceptical, principally the simultaneous announcement of huge cuts to NHS services, which makes a mockery of the language. It\u2019s no good becoming more equal just because everybody\u2019s access to healthcare has worsened. Yet the fact is, she has done something exceptional.</p> <p>With bold, relentless and unscrupulous repetition, the combined forces of the leave movement established truisms that were never true: that immigrants milked the benefits system, filled up the insufficient housing and put unbearable pressure on public services. There was a time, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/mar/31/immigration-big-issue-left-cant-get-right-labour\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband\u2019s famous mug</a>, when Labour would have challenged these perceptions with evidence; now we see Owen Smith <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/owen-smith-says-schools-area-11806234\" title=\"\">trotting out lines about an influx of refugees</a> squeezing natives out of primary schools, in a country (Wales) that has accepted <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37186114\" title=\"\">just 112 Syrians</a>, and where most of its primary schools have surplus places.

She has eschewed the fiction of direct causation \u2013 that your low wages are the result of a cheaper foreigner \u2013 in favour of indirect causation: your wages are ratcheted down by your limited opportunities. She treats the new distrust of experts with the respect it deserves \u2013 precisely none \u2013 and sets about creating the data set from which expertise proceeds.</p> <p>She has done more than reject the Crosbyfication of politics, which demands every debate be reduced to its basest question. She has chosen her own frame for the debate.</p> <p>It is unlikely, of course, that she\u2019ll be able to act on her findings. Having simultaneously kicked off this audit, and Brexit, with a data-heavy, sector-by-sector analysis of what every business wants and needs, she\u2019ll wind up in 2017 with a roomful of beautiful data visualisations, all requiring contradictory actions.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say we intuit correctly that some elegant way will be found to avoid Brexit; possibly laying out its implications, slowly and clearly enough, will suffice. Inequality is different. As evidence of it builds and deepens over time, the old platitudinous equilibrium, where everyone is against it but nobody thinks they can do anything about it, will become harder to maintain.</p> <p>Inequality is highly abstract and seems to have a momentum of its own, given that it constantly travels in the opposite direction to the one everybody claims to want. This gives it the inevitability of gravity or weather. The academic\u2019s answer is to try tethering it back to something concrete and actionable, with demonstrable outcomes: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18917932\" title=\"\">a wealth disparity of X leads to a longevity difference of Y</a>.</p> <p>As vital as that is, it answers only half the question: how do we know that inequality is damaging? It doesn\u2019t answer the more important riddle, the one that would wrest from inequality its status as a physical feature of the universe, and bring it back to level of human agency: by what mechanism does inequality do this damage? How can one child\u2019s education be stunted by the existence of a richer child five streets away? How does one person\u2019s bonus drive down another\u2019s wages?</p> <p>The answers lie not in regrettable prejudice but in balance of power: as profit is distributed more towards capital than labour, and the workforce becomes more precarious, its precariousness can be leveraged against it to drive down pay and conditions further, and the insecurity deepens. As capital concentrates and finds a haven in property, the balance of power shifts between landlords and tenants. Owning a house becomes impossible and rents get more expensive, creating a feedback loop where the power of the tenant in the workplace diminishes further, as saving becomes impossible.</p> <p>It would be unthinkable for a Conservative of any pedigree to formulate solutions to this. Yet with her focus, May will make the problem steadily more urgent, while furnishing&#xa0;more radical minds than her own with the evidence they need to make ambitious demands. Far from appropriating inequality for her own rhetorical&#xa0;advantage, as George Osborne did with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne\" title=\"\">\u201cliving wage\u201d</a>, May has&#xa0;actually opened it up as a field of play in which her own moves are obsolete and new thinking is not just possible but irresistible.</p>",

  "<p>The Irish politician Peter Barry, who has died aged 88, played a key role in the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985.

To blunt the edge of rising radical nationalism in Northern Ireland and shore up support for the more moderate Social Democratic and Labour party, FitzGerald and Barry engaged in talks with Margaret Thatcher to persuade her to introduce the 1985 agreement.</p> <p>In return for more security co-operation on the island (including the extradition of republican suspects to the north), the Fine Gael-Labour government in Dublin were given a more active role in the day-to-day running of Northern Ireland. Irish officials were dispatched to Belfast and soon became embedded into what was known as the \u201cbunker\u201d, the Irish government\u2019s heavily fortified compound in the east of the city.</p> <p>Barry and other Irish ministers then used their influence to obtain some changes to British policies, such as the banning of a controversial Orange parade in Portadown, County Armagh, as well as more overall intervention on British decision-making in the province.</p> <p>The bunker became a focal point of unionist and loyalist protest, and Barry himself a unionist hate figure. In 1986 he found himself uniquely standing in four separate Northern Ireland parliamentary byelections \u2013 a candidate called \u201cPeter Barry\u201d (in fact a unionist activist named Wesley Robert Williamson who had changed his name by deed poll) was put up against a united unionist electoral front in North Antrim, South Antrim, East Derry and Strangford in February of that year.</p> <p>The unionists regarded the agreement Thatcher signed with FitzGerald as treason, and while Barry was the hate figure, it was Thatcher\u2019s effigy that was burned during a mass rally at Belfast City Hall, during which the Rev <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/12/the-rev-ian-paisley\" title=\"\">Ian Paisley</a> memorably bellowed out, \u201cNever, never, never\u201d after asking the crowd if Dublin had a right to have a say over the governance of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Even the Royal Ulster Constabulary, seen by many nationalists and republicans as a unionist police force, had the \u201cBarry\u201d label hurled at them during the protests. As the RUC held the line and protected the bunker from mass assaults, as well as upholding the ban on the Portadown march, which led to rioting and the death of one loyalist protester, hardline unionists jibed that the police had become \u201cBarry\u2019s boot boys\u201d.</p> <p>Peter was born in the prosperous Cork suburb of Blackrock, when the Irish Free State was only six years old and the wounds of the civil war between those who accepted partition and those who violently opposed it were still bleeding. The son of Anthony, who ran the family business <a href=\"http://www.barrystea.ie/\" title=\"\">Barry\u2019s Tea</a>, and his wife, Rita (nee Costello), Peter was educated at Christian Brothers\u2019 college, Cork. He followed his father on parallel career paths: both served as lord mayor of Cork and then in the D\u00e1il for Fine Gael, and Peter also became a major importer for and shareholder in the business. He turned it into what is now a multimillion-euro brand. The product, popular throughout Ireland, was inevitably subjected to a unionist boycott in the 80s.</p> <p>Barry entered the D\u00e1il in 1969 for Cork City South-East. In 1973 he joined Liam Cosgrave\u2019s coalition cabinet as minister for transport and power. He became minister for education in 1976, and, when FitzGerald became leader of Fine Gael three years later, he was elected his deputy. From 1981 to 1982 Barry served as minister for the environment and was then appointed foreign minister, a position he held for five years. For the last couple of months of FitzGerald\u2019s government, he was t\u00e1naiste or deputy prime minister.</p> <p>His star was always hitched to the rise of FitzGerald, whom Barry regarded as a hero and mentor, believing that his leader had stepped down too early as head of Fine Gael in 1987 when the party lost 19 seats to its old rival, Fianna F\u00e1il. Barry contended that Fine Gael would have \u201csettled down\u201d if FitzGerald had stayed in the post, instead of remaining out of power for more than a decade. Barry himself retired in 1997.</p> <p>His political lineage continues to this day, with one of his daughters, Deirdre Clune, serving as a TD for Cork South Central, and elected in 2014 as an <a href=\"http://www.deirdreclune.ie/\" title=\"\">MEP for Ireland South in the European parliament</a>. Barry\u2019s wife, Margaret (nee O\u2019Mullane), whom he married in 1958, died in 2013. He is survived by their six children, Tony, Deirdre, Donagh, Conor, Peter Jr and Fiona.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Barry, politician, born 10 August 1928; died 26 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>As the current election cycle heads into its grueling 10,000th week (with a scant 700 more before the election) the campaigns of human hellmouth Donald Trump and presidency-seeking robot Hillary Clinton are both hard at work grinding for cash to stay afloat. While the larger cash injections to these campaigns seem to come from a complicated web of corporate pals, shady oligarchs and people who owe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/clinton-foundation-bill-hillary-us-election-state-department\">Clinton Foundation</a> a favor, they\u2019re not above seeking a couple bucks from the average Joe, either. Thus, for many Americans, quickly identifying and moving contribution-seeking emails into trash or spam folders has become as much a part of their morning routine as a first cup of coffee. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/libertarian-gary-johnson-president\">Libertarian Gary Johnson: crazy election cycle means 'I might be next president'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be blunt, these emails are weird as hell. They\u2019re frequently formatted in a style that\u2019s a little too similar to those scheming spam messages seeking your help to unlock an enormous African fortune held in place by international banking regulation, or promising longer lasting, more satisfying boners. The caps are locked, the graphics are lo-fi. A recent message from DCCC.org features splashes of red, green, and blue highlighting, and opens with a single-sentence paragraph: \u201cWe\u2019re freaking out.\u201d</p> <p>I get that the choice of words there is supposed to come off as relatable to the casual constituent, and scary enough to motivate donations \u2013 but isn\u2019t the idea of congressmen \u201cfreaking out\u201d a little upsetting? Hey, DCCC, \u201cfreaking out\u201d is reserved for college freshmen who just found out their roommate\u2019s cousin dated the drummer from Twenty One Pilots in 2006. We\u2019re counting on you chumps to govern us. You only get to publicly freak out when you either discover that an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth or your email gets hacked. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>Emails from the Clinton campaign are a bit nicer and more polished. I received one the other day purporting to be a personal note from Hillary that opened: \u201cFriend \u2013I\u2019ll keep this short because I know how much you already do for this team.\u201d</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that nice? We\u2019re friends; she knows I don\u2019t have all day to read emails; she\u2019s recognizing what I\u2019ve already done to service her commitment to the idea that she deserves to be president. </p> <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s latest messages offer an interesting incentive to donors \u2013Executive Membership. There\u2019s a graphic of a gold card that says \u201cTrump\u201d at the top, and at the bottom it has Trump\u2019s signature over \u201cAuthorized by the future President of the United States\u201d. Pretty cool, right? And get this \u2013 normally there\u2019s a one-time induction fee of $100, but for a limited time only they\u2019re slashing rates and offering the deal for the low, low price of 35 bucks.</p> <p>So the list of things the Trump campaign has in common with a late-night infomercial now includes: a cheap, garbage product you absolutely don\u2019t need; a spokesperson who is either feigning enthusiasm for cash or actually soulless; multiple vague promises to improve the quality of your life with little to no evidence the product can do what it claims; and limited time, low, low prices if you act fast.</p> <p>The only problems with the Trump campaign Executive Membership (beyond that it involves giving money to Donald Trump, the worst thing to happen to North America since \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 the Jamestown settlement?) is that it isn\u2019t clear what the membership gets you. It\u2019s not even clear if you get that golden card.</p> <p> That\u2019s a big mistake. The Trump campaign needs to offer its Executive Members some perks. How about offering cardholders personalized messages explaining what Trump <em>meant to say </em>after each public statement and a strand of Mike Pence\u2019s weirdly brittle hair to use as a lockpick? And why stop there? How about a Super Executive Membership for $50, which could entitle members to a free consultation with a Trump campaign attorney following any violence they take part in at an authorized Trump rally? At the top level, there could be a Huge, Fantastic Membership, where for just $1,000 Trump will take you on a personal tour of the Kremlin.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get any contribution emails from third-party or independent candidates, because none of those people will ever be president and my time on Earth is ultimately finite, but I\u2019d be willing to guess that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/libertarian-gary-johnson-president\">Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson\u2019s</a> emails arrive totally blank, allowing recipients the freedom to decide how the text should appear. E-mails from Green party candidate Jill Stein are probably rife with crossed-out text and revisions, as I can only imagine she would have just as tough a time deciding the right way to request your money as she seems to have deciding whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/jill-stein-anti-vaccination-green-party-ridiculous\">vaccinations are harmful</a>.</p>",

Nevertheless, this fixture does pitch the premier outfits from two regional powerhouses. West Brom are the only top-flight team from the West Midlands (an area with 11 league titles), while Middlesbrough can claim pre-eminence in the north-east (10 titles) after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/sunderland-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">beating Sunderland last Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Provincial pride aside, this rivalry isn\u2019t the fiercest. It\u2019s been six years since these two teams last met, with the Baggies winning the last four matches by an aggregate score of 11-0. Those games, played in the first and second tiers as both clubs slid out of the Premier League in 2009, were followed by West Brom securing an immediate return to the promised land, while their beaten opponents settled in the mire.</p> <p>As Boro battled their way back, West Brom set off on a run of six straight top-flight seasons, years of relentless boinging replaced with 11th, 10th, 8th, 17th, 13th and 14th placed finishes. Yet with doubts over Tony Pulis\u2019 style, a quiet transfer window and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/27/west-brom-fans-bigger-picture-middlesbrough-tony-pulis\">a mysterious new owner</a>, there\u2019s plenty of gloom around the Hawthorns \u2013 in sharp contrast to the Riverside, where a reliable core and a little transfer market magic have Boro on nobody\u2019s list of relegation favourites.</p> <p>Kick-off is at <strong>1.30pm BST</strong>; team news and build-up to follow.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-28T11:38:34.610Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>There were more than 4,000 severe breaches of animal welfare regulations over the past two years at British slaughterhouses, according to data released by the government\u2019s food watchdog under freedom of information laws.</p> <p>The data, comprising reports by vets and hygiene inspectors, details instances of needless pain and distress that include chickens being boiled alive and trucks of animals suffocating or freezing to death.</p> <p>The log of reports submitted to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) reveals how regular breakdowns on production lines, equipment failures and poor procedures in abattoirs result in thousands of animals being subjected to avoidable suffering each year. Many individual acts of cruelty and neglect by slaughterhouse staff, hauliers and farmers are also documented, alongside malpractice that increases the risk of food poisoning.</p> <p>The FSA, which released the data to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), said \u201conly a tiny percentage\u201d of animals that pass through Britain\u2019s slaughterhouses are affected, adding that \u201cthe vast majority of meat processors comply with regulations\u201d.</p> <p>Meat inspectors and campaigners argue there is an under-reporting of welfare abuses, blaming insufficient staff and the often intimidating working conditions at abattoirs. </p> <p>Vets and meat hygiene inspectors working for the FSA inside abattoirs reported a total of 9,511 animal welfare breaches between July 2014 and June 2016, with records classified into three categories according to severity. Category 2 refers to a low-risk isolated incident, while category 4, the most serious, means animals were subjected to \u201cavoidable pain, distress or suffering\u201d.</p> <p>The BIJ\u2019s analysis reveals almost half the recorded incidents were category 4 breaches \u2013 a total of 4,455, or an average of six a day. A single breach can involve hundreds of animals. Between April 2011 and July 2014 there were 6,859 reported incidents in all categories.</p> <p>Neil Parish MP, chairman of the Commons select committee for environment, food and rural affairs, described the results as shocking.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no place for animal cruelty at any stage of farm production \u2013 including the slaughterhouse,\u201d said Parish. \u201cThis country prides itself as having some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world. It\u2019s vital the authorities crack down on any abuses and ensure there is zero tolerance to any mistreatment of animals when slaughtered.\u201d</p> <p>The welfare infractions included a cow being \u201cviolently slammed\u201d against a wall following an argument between two workers; an abattoir worker beating three bulls with a wooden stick and electric prod; and a haulier hitting and kicking cattle during unloading, an incident that was caught on CCTV. Many involved sheep being grabbed by the wool and ears or dragged by the horns, or pigs being lifted by their ears and tails.</p> <p>Failures in the slaughter process were also highlighted, with thousands of instances of animals not being stunned properly and in some cases not stunned at all. Inspectors recorded cases of chickens and pigs being immersed in tanks of scalding hot water \u2013 used to soften the skin and remove hair or feathers \u2013 while still alive.</p> <p>Almost 600 instances were recorded of animals arriving at slaughterhouses already dead. In one case 574 chickens, from a load of 6,072 birds, died after being left on a lorry in very hot conditions. This counts as one welfare breach despite involving hundreds of birds.</p> <p>The data also highlights practices that could facilitate the spread of the bacteria campylobacter, the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. About four in five cases of the infection, which kills about 100 people a year, come from contaminated poultry.</p> <p>Ensuring birds are as calm as possible when they are being caught and transported is an important preventative measure, because stressed birds defecate more, potentially spreading the infection and increasing the risk of meat contamination. However, the data includes regular instances of chickens being \u201coverstocked\u201d in crates and incidents of birds being left in lorries for lengthy periods of time. In one case, because of a breakdown at the plant, 14 trucks were left overnight for more than 12 hours; in another, birds were left in crates at the abattoir for 20 hours.</p> <p>The British Meat Processors Association, the industry trade body, declined to comment on the findings.</p> <p>More than 900 million farm animals are killed for food each year in Britain. There are 317 approved slaughterhouses across the UK, most run by a handful of large companies that dominate the meat processing sector. </p> <p>It is unclear from the data how many of the breaches resulted in any sanctions or improvements. Most of the category 4 breaches were referred to regional Trading Standards offices, which have responsibility for monitoring farms and transportation, but there is no requirement for the vets and inspectors who make the referral to record details of what happens next.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the FSA said it had \u201czero tolerance\u201d for welfare breaches and used a \u201cproportionate approach\u201d to enforcement. Action could include suspending or withdrawing certificates of competence from slaughterers, referring cases for prosecution, stopping operations or serving welfare enforcement notices.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a comprehensive animal verification procedure in place at every slaughterhouse for monitoring animal welfare,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201c[Category 4 breaches] can be the result of unavoidable accidents rather than deliberate abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Between June 2014 and July 2016, the spokesperson said, all category 4 breaches resulted in enforcement action. But in 2013 and 2014 the FSA referred 14 breaches of welfare regulations to the CPS, of which four resulted in prosecutions. Three of those prosecutions were later dropped.</p> <p>Of the remaining cases, four resulted in warning letters. Over the course of the two years, two slaughterers\u2019 licences were suspended and three were revoked for failure to comply with welfare legislation.</p> <p>The fact that serious welfare breaches were the exception not the norm was not the point, said Marc Cooper, head of farm animals at the RSPCA.</p> <p>\u201cSuch incidences of severe pain, distress and suffering are wholly unacceptable and completely avoidable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re avoidable, that means they shouldn\u2019t be happening at all \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t be seeing one. You would hope that strong enforcement action would be taken.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

Accepting the only job offer she got, from Sanford C Bernstein, in 1995, Krawcheck was its chief executive by 2001. By 2002, Sandy Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, had lured her away to take over as head of Smith Barney. </p> <p>In 2005, she was chief financial officer of Citigroup and tipped to become Wall Street\u2019s first female CEO. Even her high-profile firing following the financial crisis didn\u2019t derail her career: Krawcheck surfaced as the head of the newly merged Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s wealth management division, charged with overseeing the famed \u201cthundering herd\u201d. </p> <p>Then Bank of America\u2019s CEO, Brian Moynihan, possibly threatened by her high profile, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2015/01/02/sallie-krawcheck-wants-take-women-top-business-294332.html\">offered her a choice between departure or demotion</a>. She chose to leave. The aftermath of that high-stakes Wall Street power struggle led to her next great eureka moment.</p> <p>\u201cThere are different ways to attack the boys\u2019 club than from the inside,\u201d she tells the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b937bf624c8ba167fb85798181be3399c8296766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b937bf624c8ba167fb85798181be3399c8296766/0_264_1000_599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Krawcheck became head of Smith Barney after quickly rising to CEO of Sanford C Bernstein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Krawcheck became head of Smith Barney after quickly rising to CEO of Sanford C Bernstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For years after her 2011 \u201cresignation\u201d from Bank of America, Krawcheck debated with herself. She knew being a woman had given her a fundamentally different perspective on the way that Merrill Lynch\u2019s \u201cherd\u201d of largely male brokers and financial advisers did business, a view that had been shaped and refined by her years at Citigroup. \u201cBut I made all the arguments to myself,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were plenty of firms out there already\u201d that could opt to do business in a different way, to serve their clients \u2013 especially women \u2013 better. Except that they didn\u2019t. </p> <p>\u201cI watched and watched,\u201d Krawcheck says. The percentage of financial advisers at big Wall Street firms that were men remained unchanged, about 85%. And that matters, she says, because they didn\u2019t pay much attention to the women among their clientele, even when they thought they did. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d study this, when a male adviser met with a couple, and ask him how much time he thought he spent interacting with each member of them, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, 55/45.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>In fact, the evidence showed he had spent 90% of his time talking to the man, and not realized it. Unsurprisingly, Krawcheck found that when they were widowed, 70% of Merrill\u2019s clients took their assets and left. </p> <p>BMO Wealth Institute calculates that women <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/women-control-a-majority-of-americas-wealth.html/?a=viewall\">control about 51% of all personal wealth in the US</a>, or some $14tn, and projects that figure to hit $22tn by 2020. Investment firms cannot afford to disregard women or to lose them as clients. And yet they weren\u2019t hiring women as advisers.</p> <p>\u201cOne firm used a marine corps questionnaire for hiring,\u201d Krawcheck recalls.</p> <p>Since it wasn\u2019t her job to force Wall Street into recognizing what it was doing wrong, she decided to try to start doing it the right way. The first step <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/sallie-krawcheck-buying-85-broads-2013-5\">was the purchase</a> in spring 2013 of 85 Broads, a financial membership and networking community established by alumnae of Goldman Sachs, which she promptly renamed <a href=\"https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/\">Ellevate Network</a>, to reflect its new mission: to provide more women with a way to become involved and engaged in their finances.</p> <p>Earlier this year, she rolled out the next stage of her plan, <a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/\">Ellevest</a>: an investment platform designed around women\u2019s needs and priorities, not those of the men who run Wall Street and the firms where she cut her teeth.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole icon of a bull that stands for Wall Street \u2013 you couldn\u2019t come up with an image of a more male environment,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen feel that the brand doesn\u2019t speak to them.\u201d </p> <p>They also, she argues, speak a very different language when it comes to money, and have very different objectives, which men don\u2019t grasp at all.</p> <p>To the extent that the big Wall Street firms attempt to cater to women, they \u201cpinkify\u201d their offerings, Krawcheck says. Why, she asks, does a woman-friendly approach to investing \u201chave to mean the junior version? </p> <p>\u201cSomehow there is this feeling that women require remedial financial education and so everything must be dumbed down. The reality is that we all need a lot more education, but guys just go ahead and invest anyway.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018Just friggin\u2019 pay them more\u2019</h2> <p>Krawcheck\u2019s irritation and anger at this kind of systemic bias \u2013 and its impact on women, who end up so alienated by the Wall Street system and so daunted by the difficult of finding a firm or an independent adviser who will listen to them that they simply avoid seeking out the investment advice they need \u2013 creep through her trademark charm and humor. </p> <p>When others suggest that it doesn\u2019t make sense to focus on the <a href=\"https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/articles/7238-the-gender-gap-that-s-really-hurting-us-and-it-s-not-the-one-you-think\">investment gender gap</a> because it\u2019s more important to close the gender pay gap first, you can almost hear her grit her teeth before answering. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s like saying you broke your arm and you broke your leg, but I\u2019m not going to fix your broken arm because I can\u2019t fix your broken leg yet!\u201d </p> <p>As far as the gender pay gap itself is concerned, she has no patience at all. \u201cJust friggin\u2019 pay them more\u201d is Krawcheck\u2019s message to companies that still compensate men and women inequitably. \u201cOh, and if you haven\u2019t stopped to check whether you have a gender pay gap? You do.\u201d </p> <p>And now Krawcheck has created a place where those women, tired of testosterone-fueled investment jabber about relative price/earning ratios and the best mid-cap growth mutual fund to pick, can find an investment home.</p> <p>Krawcheck\u2019s Ellevest does not \u201cpinkify\u201d investing, she insists, but it does start the process in a very different way. Ellevest\u2019s objective isn\u2019t to design a portfolio that will beat the market or focus on the exciting investment concept of the day. Instead, the robo-adviser designs portfolios based on the user\u2019s investment time horizon and risk tolerance. </p> <p>\u201cWomen think in terms of goals-based investing,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>It\u2019s slightly pricier than rivals (the fee is 0.5% of assets a year), but cheaper than working with a traditional financial adviser would be. Moreover, as Krawcheck points out, it\u2019s a process designed to ensure that women actually feel that their portfolios and goals are in sync. </p> <p>\u201cWomen value capital preservation many times more than men, but you won\u2019t find that reflected\u201d at Merrill Lynch or anywhere else in the industry, she argues.</p> <p>It\u2019s early days still. If the company thrives, however, there\u2019s no downside: success will give women an alternative to the Merrill Lynches of the world and give the latter a much-overdue wakeup call, the kind that its leaders couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t listen to from inside the walls. </p> <p>Welcome to Wall Street\u2019s girls\u2019 club. </p>",

Already, the effect on business costs is evident with <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/producerpriceinflation/july2016\">input prices rising in July</a> for the first time since 2013. In an otherwise low inflation environment, many businesses have little pricing power so margins are squeezed.</p> <p>There have also been declines in commercial real estate prices and some property funds erected barriers to people wishing to withdraw money.</p> <p>Little of this is good news. But no economic planes have fallen from the sky and no economic power stations have turned themselves off.</p> <p>On the contrary, while surveys said consumer confidence had collapsed, Britain appears to have spent July at the shops. And we were not browsing: <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/july2016\">retail sales volumes were 1.4% higher</a> than in June, strong growth by any standard. Surveys also said that hiring had ground to a halt. Yet the number of people claiming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">unemployment-related benefits fell in July</a>.</p> <p>So will Brexit turn out to have been a latter-day Y2K? Some of the claims of the immediate economic consequences of voting leave have been unfounded, but it is too early to declare peace.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/new-uk-car-sales-slow-down-to-a-trickle-in-july\">Car sales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bba.org.uk/news/statistics/high-street-banking/july-2016-figures-for-the-high-street-banks/\">mortgage applications</a> hint that people are pausing when it comes to big purchases. Among the more reliable surveys, such as that conducted by the Bank of England\u2019s agents, there are signs of businesses <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/default.aspx\">taking stock before committing to investment</a>. Economic performance could yet dip.</p> <p>Concerned that the worst would come to pass, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England has acted decisively</a>. While that will blunt any immediate adverse consequences of the leave vote, the more meaningful effects will happen later and demand a different type of response.</p> <p>The long-term economic challenge of Brexit is that voting for restrictions on migration and limiting access to overseas markets will lead to slower growth than would otherwise have been the case. Trade makes us better off, on average, because it allows companies and countries to focus on what they do best. The threat of competition engendered by trade also keeps businesses on their toes, eking out improvements that lead to faster growth and higher incomes.</p> <p>So Brexit becomes a growth challenge and there is barely an economic problem that cannot substantially be solved by faster productivity growth. One route to consider is more investment: create better assets than we have today and they will generate higher incomes tomorrow. That means not only more money in people\u2019s pockets but could lead to better-funded public services.</p> <p>Especially in an uncertain environment in which businesses might hesitate to invest, there is a role for government. Currently, we are committed to balancing this year\u2019s spending and revenue unless growth is very weak. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/22/surveys-brexit-impact-uk-eurozone-g20-lagarde-sports-direct-live?page=with:block-5791fe91e4b0d75e7e5f29f1#block-5791fe91e4b0d75e7e5f29f1\">As part of the reset of fiscal policy</a>, a rule allowing government to borrow for sensible investment while otherwise keeping a tight grip on the public finances would complement the Bank of England\u2019s measures and lay a platform for long-term growth. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/520086/2904569_nidp_deliveryplan.pdf\">The National Infrastructure Delivery Plan</a> is replete with sound projects.

  "<p>In the Mongolian taiga, or snow forest, a few kilometres from the Russian border, a group of 250 reindeer herders preserve their traditions with care.

A reindeer herder, hunter and protector of the traditions of his people, he watches over his community and their traditional lands. He is the oldest man in the Dukha camp, a respected sage to whom the group listens. </p> <p>Originally from Russia, the Dukha (who are also called Tsataan in Mongolian) are closer in traditions and way of life to the Sami people, the reindeer herders of the Arctic, than to Mongols of the steppe, who are traditionally famers and live in gers.</p> <p>These Dukha nomads move their <em>ortz</em> according to the migrations of the reindeer in these wild mountains \u2013 the only environment favourable to their animals.

Then the war broke out, and the Russian soldiers wanted to recruit our men to go and fight far away from us. We fled to the south.

Known for their vast knowledge of the taiga and their capability as hunters, they were hired as \u201cstate hunters\u201d by Mongolia\u2019s communist government.</p> <p>Oltsen is one of the best hunters in the group, and is capable of confronting the bears that menace the reindeer herds. \u201cMy father was a state hunter,\u201d says Oltsen, proudly. \u201cHe hunted, would go down to the villages to bring the meat, and would return with vegetables and flour. This became more difficult after the fall of the communist government: he lost his job. But we have pursued commercial activity, selling furs and meat when we can. Tourists came as well, and we began to do crafts. They liked that.\u201d<br></p> <p>The situation has worsened: without a place in society, regarded as merely reindeer herders, the Dukha have become marginalised. In 2011, their lives changed radically. </p> <p>\u201cPeople came and told us that they had studied the taiga for 10 years,\u201d says Oltsen, bitterly. \u201cWe had never seen them. They explained to us that this territory had become a national reserve and that new laws had been put in place. They had decided that we couldn\u2019t hunt any more and that only three areas were authorised for the pasturing of our reindeer. We were no longer permitted to take them beyond the Tengis river and the Gugned Valley. But how would we live if we weren\u2019t able to hunt any more? </p> <p>\u201cTo make sure that we didn\u2019t hunt, they forbade us from bringing our dogs to guard the reindeer. But there are wolves here. Our herds were decimated. We don\u2019t have anything but our reindeer. It\u2019s our right to take care of them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Under Mongolian law, hunting is forbidden in the Tengis Shishged national reserve, as are fishing and chopping wood, and only limited migrations are allowed, in order to preserve biodiversity. Recently, rangers have been deployed to protect the area. Itn is easy to imagine how relations between these rangers \u2013 mainly young, urbanites \u2013 and the Dukha, who have dwelled in these lands for hundreds of years, rapidly became strained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/global_dev_mongolia/giv-31075hJUYzYo1DM5x/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/global_dev_mongolia/giv-31075hJUYzYo1DM5x/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t let us live any more.

If these things are outlawed, we\u2019re no longer free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they want to make us Mongols of the steppe,\u201d asks Oltsen. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do anything other than live here. But I know the taiga better than anyone. I know every corner of this mountain. I know the animals and we show them respect, just as our fathers taught us. We communicate with nature. If I go hunting and don\u2019t see many animals, it means that nature isn\u2019t ready to give them to me and I go home. We lose our culture if we can\u2019t hunt any longer or can\u2019t keep our reindeer.

The Dukha aren\u2019t complaining about their new source of revenue, which allows them access to resources and luxuries they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, yet they remain defiant when it comes to their tradition of preserving, in their own way, the land on which they live. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them, even with their motorbikes and their park,\u201d Buyantogtoh says. \u201cWith or without them, we will conserve our forest.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they come and talk with us?\u201d asks Ganbat. \u201cWe would tell them what to protect and where the animals are.

They live in regions threatened by exploitation, conservation of which nonetheless sometimes comes at the expense of those who reside within them.</p> <p>In 2014, Mongolia <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/mng/law-on-the-protection-of-cultural-heritage_html/Cultural_Heritage_Law_eng.pdf\">passed a law</a> to create <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/mng/law-on-the-protection-of-cultural-heritage_html/Cultural_Heritage_Law_eng.pdf\">protected cultural areas</a> (pdf), which would be managed by local communities and help to preserve their cultural heritage.

  "<p>Everyone at this year\u2019s Edinburgh International Television Festival was expecting Vice chief executive Shane Smith to ruffle a few feathers when he gave the annual MacTaggart lecture on Wednesday evening, but few were prepared to be quite so ruffled.</p> <p>In a rambling speech interrupted by references to drinking, drug taking, becoming director general of the BBC \u2013 and, at one point, a moth landing on his head \u2013 the boss of the digital media empire lambasted broadcasters for neglecting the interests and needs of the world\u2019s youth.</p> <p>The TV industry has been aware it has something of a youth problem for years, but Smith\u2019s speech has pushed the issue centre stage. The hyperbolic, confrontational language he used has re-energised the debate, and many have taken umbrage at a North American upstart coming to Scotland to tell UK broadcasting it\u2019s out of touch. It\u2019s not hard to see why.</p> <p>\u201cNow the baby boomers have had a stranglehold on media and advertising for an entire generation,\u201d he told the assembled producers, TV bosses and journalists at the Edinburgh Playhouse. \u201cThat stranglehold is finally being broken by a highly educated, ethnically diverse, global thinking, hard-to-reach generation. And media is having a hard time adapting to this rapid change.\u201d</p> <p>Topics such as climate change or LGBT issues that young people care about are covered rarely if at all, he said, because the people making TV are making it about the things that interest them. \u201cIt\u2019s a different market and it consumes media in a different way. It can\u2019t be advertised to traditionally and it wants media to be specific only to them. This is hard for baby boomers to get their heads around. You have a lot of baby boomer executives saying \u2018I don\u2019t know, put a skateboard in it\u2019. There is no easy solution.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of that it changed everything. Everyone said young people don\u2019t care about news [and] they sure as hell don\u2019t care about international [news]. Bullshit. They care. But they don\u2019t like the way it\u2019s been portrayed up until now.

It\u2019s a good rallying cry ... but it shows us how precious what we have in the UK is.\u201d</p> <p>Sky\u2019s managing director of content Gary Davey said Smith had missed the point. \u201cWe all have to acknowledge that we probably need to encourage more young people to be in the creative process,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re already doing a lot of what he\u2019s advocating .... We have a fantastic diversity of channel types and programme types ... It\u2019s a fantastic breadth of choice. We are effectively servicing lots of target groups.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Smith was \u201ca genuine disrupter or emperor\u2019s new clothes\u201d, ITV director of television Kevin Lygo was less diplomatic, saying he was \u201ctrying not to use the word \u2018odious\u2019\u201d, and was met with a round of amused applause.</p> <p>Channel 5\u2019s director of programmes Ben Frow (who had skipped Smith\u2019s speech altogether) made a telling intervention on the topic of sex on TV to justify a show that debuted at the start of the century. \u201cKids like sex and confrontation, and Big Brother has both.\u201d And while Moore said it was patronising to say the young are only interested in sex, her list of shows that get the youth vote \u2013 including The Great British Bake Off, The Apprentice, and programmes about Brexit \u2013 did not suggest a revolutionary approach to the audience.</p> <p>Jay Hunt, Channel 4\u2019s chief creative officer, later added there was a danger of creating a \u201ccult of youth\u201d and \u201cdemonising\u201d old people. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to make shows for people over 34.

Yet for all the pride in good shows dealing with important issues, the stats suggest young people are paying less and less attention to it. Ofcom\u2019s Communications Market Report published earlier this month showed the average British person watches almost two-thirds of their video diet as live TV, and with recorded TV included that rises to almost 80%. Yet live viewing drops to little more than a third for 16- to 24-year-olds and less than half when recorded is thrown in. Almost 40% of their time is spent with free or paid on-demand video and, of course, short video clips of the kind you find on YouTube.</p> <p>Research by Enders Analysis commissioned by former Channel 4 executive Liz Warner, who helped launch Big Brother, paints an even bleaker picture for the leading TV executives who gathered in Edinburgh. Enders found that the average age of viewers of BBC1 and BBC2 is 62, while on ITV it is 60 and on Channel 5 it is 58. On Channel 4, the average age is 55 and on \u201cyouth\u201d channel E4, it dips to 42, which is also the average age of the UK population.</p> <p>In her Bafta lecture last month, titled TV Is Old and Boring, Warner warned of a danger \u2013 losing a generation \u2013 remarkably similar to the one described by Smith. She said that TV was rehashing old ideas, failing to take risks and becoming a less appealing place for young people to work. \u201cWe have failed to engage with a whole generation of digital talent, the younger generation are not switching on, television is failing the young.\u201d Unlike Smith, though, she wasn\u2019t talking from a background of US television, but from a career firmly rooted in the UK. Her warning was stark. \u201cIt\u2019s got beyond being anecdotal and I think we\u2019re facing a creative chasm and a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s message, and certainly Smith himself, may not have gone down well with his audience in Edinburgh. But he\u2019s not the only one worried about whether TV is doing enough to make sure it offers a younger generation of viewers what they want.</p> <h2>Is the online-only BBC3 a success?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5da4601b89a2e0043f0786ffb641ca1e193d5152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5da4601b89a2e0043f0786ffb641ca1e193d5152/0_440_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie Yates is to front a BBC3 documentary on gun crime in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flagged up \u2026 Reggie Yates is to front a BBC3 documentary on gun crime in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>BBC3 remains central to the BBC\u2019s attempts to reach young people despite going online only seven months ago, but a recent survey by Thinkbox showing the corporation has seen an 18% fall in its youth audience since the linear channel\u2019s closure has raised questions about the move.</p> <p>In the post-MacTaggart interview at the Edinburgh TV Festival Vice\u2019s Shane Smith said closing the channel was a mistake.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know I would have closed [BBC3] down.

  "<p>No longer the domain of Saturday afternoon barbecues, cooking over wood and coals \u2013 intentionally charring and burning \u2013 has become quite a trend. Bearded men in waxed aprons fill every Nordic restaurant worth its salt and the technique has been celebrated at restaurants such as the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/20/kitty-fishers-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Kitty Fisher\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blackaxemangal\">Black Axe Mangal</a>. Though the grill masters of London\u2019s Turkish ocakbasi restaurants will tell you it\u2019s nothing new.</p> <p>You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that this cavemanesque cooking is all about meat, but in fact vegetables sit centre stage at most of these kitchens. At home, we\u2019ve overlooked how much a bit of char and smoke can compliment a beloved vegetable or boost a neutral cheese, such as halloumi or feta. An aubergine is an obvious pairing with a bit of smoke \u2013 babaganoush is a friendly blend of vegetables and smoke, as is a halved aubergine grilled and basted in white miso on every turn. Onions too, work well grilled slowly and tossed through plump pearl barley grains. Even halved little gems are transformed when quickly charred and simply dressed in oil, vinegar and chopped herbs.</p> <p>This charring is, of course, possible on a griddle pan or even a good heavy\u2011based frying pan, but its natural habitat is on the barbecue. The resolution to cook outside to me seems most welcome on a weeknight, when taking the kitchen outside brings a holiday feeling to an otherwise normal Tuesday or Wednesday. These have been the char-edged suppers we\u2019ve cooked quickly this summer.</p> <h2><strong>Harissa and lime halloumi with flatbreads</strong></h2> <p>Halloumi is a real crowd-pleaser when it comes to barbecues. I have never understood the blanket fascination, but I do like its texture when its cooked just right, charred and crisped a little on the outside and perfectly melting inside, if you hit this sweet spot, gone is the offputting rubbery squeakiness. It does need some help on the flavour front; a quick marinade will boost your squeaky cheese out of its simple milky profile. It pairs well with a hit of hot chilli and a little bit of sweetness.</p> <p>Here, it has a quick dip in a harissa, lime and rose marinade, which is backed up by a grilled relish that combines smoke from charred red onions, some piquancy from a good drizzle of pomegranate molasses, sweetness from red peppers and a salty olive kick. It\u2019s also great in flatbreads, burgers and toasted sandwiches. The cooling yoghurt dampens down the chilli as well as providing a pleasing temperature contrast between the fridge-cold yoghurt and the grill-hot halloumi.</p> <p>If you like, you could stir a few crushed dried rose petals into your harissa to make it rosy. By all means, use jarred roasted red peppers to speed things up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5dccfdb4644670d31a964d44f736653b60b535dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dccfdb4644670d31a964d44f736653b60b535dd/0_0_4912_6394/768.jpg\" alt=\"Harissa and lime halloumi with flatbreads\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you can find it, use rose harissa here for the halloumi marinade.

Wafer thin they grill in seconds and make a fine salad, but here I go for bigger pieces, cooked until the outside chars and the inside steams to a buttery softness.

It was the brainchild of the brilliant Robbin Holmgren, the head chef at Fifteen London. I am sure his version is much fancier, but this is how I do it at home. Any leftover lovage oil can be kept in a jar in the fridge for a few weeks.

Sieve the oil to get rid of any big bits of herb, then transfer to a jar and set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Next, heat your barbecue (or griddle pan) until it\u2019s smoking hot. While it heats up, cut your courgettes \u2013 bigger ones into rounds and smaller ones into long slices. Once the griddle is hot, char your courgettes on both sides until nicely charred and softened a little in the middle.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Serve the charred courgettes on a platter next to the burrata torn open, finished with a good pinch of sea salt and a grinding of black pepper, and a good drizzle of the lovage oil.</p> <h2>Anna\u2019s tips for barbecuing vegetables</h2> <ul> <li>Cook on charcoal or wood if you can as it will impart that smoky flavour that gas barbecues won\u2019t.</li> <li>Use lumpwood charcoal. It\u2019s more expensive but will hold heat longer so you will use less. Avoid firelighters if you can.</li> <li>Wait for the right moment to cook. This may sound basic but wait for the flames to properly die down. You want the coals white hot, grey and glowing which give the most even heat.</li> <li>Control the heat just as you would if you were using a gas hob. If things are too hot then take your food off and let the coals cool down.</li> <li>If you are cooking more than one thing it might be useful to have two temperatures on your barbecue. To do this, once the coals are hot pile most of them to one side which will be hot for grilling, and a few on the other side for warming bread and gentler cooking.</li> <li>Don\u2019t oil your vegetables before they hit the grill. Instead, dress them carefully after grilling, while they are still warm in good olive oil, citrus or vinegar.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Anna Jones is a chef, writer and author of A Modern Way to Eat and A Modern Way to Cook (Fourth Estate); annajones.co.uk; @we_are_food</em></li> </ul>",

They claim that Hatcher and other plaintiffs are criminals who only became hooked because they illegally abused the drugs \u2013 a position backed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who could face a hit to their<strong> </strong>multibillion dollar market. </p> <p>That argument met with derision from one of West Virginia\u2019s US senators, Joe Manchin, who likened attempts to blame the victims for their addiction to the tactics of cigarette manufacturers. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same argument that the tobacco industry used. They can\u2019t go down that path,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic because we have a business model for it. Follow the money. Look at the amount of pills they shipped into certain parts of our state. It was a business model.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Rapidly escalating doses</h2> <p>Hatcher received his first opioid prescription after he fell down steps working at a motel in 2003. The state workers\u2019 compensation fund referred him to a busy pain clinic, the Wellness Center in Williamson, a declining coal town of about 3,000 people. </p> <p>The clinic was run day-to-day by Dr William Ryckman, who formerly worked as a physician at a federal prison. Ryckman said in a deposition that he was hired to work in Williamson in 1997 by a prisoner he befriended, Henry Vinson, who served five years for running a gay prostitution ring in Washington DC. Ryckman described the former prisoner as \u201csetting up the practice\u201d and recruiting doctors. Vinson said he did no more than manage the building.</p> <p>Hatcher\u2019s first consultation was with another early recruit to the clinic \u2013 Dr Katherine Hoover. She moved to West Virginia in the midst of a legal battle to keep her medical licence in Florida after she was accused of having asked a 17-year-old patient to have sex with her son.</p> <p>Hatcher said Hoover immediately prescribed him opioids and rapidly increased the dosage. He said he was alert to the dangers because he once counselled drug addicts but he trusted the doctor and assumed he would be safe if he diligently followed the prescription. Yet within six months he was addicted to the opioids.</p> <p>\u201cI had to have that pill every morning to get out of bed, to function. To go without it, the physical pain. Oh gosh. Your hands is jerking. You feel the cramps in your arms and your legs. The anxiety. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what am I going to do here? It\u2019s real bad. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s the worst time of my life,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you\u2019re addicted to them</p> <footer> <cite>Wilbert Hatcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hatcher said his head told him he needed to get off the drugs and he hoped the doctor would reduce his prescription. Instead, he found that Hoover barely examined him and then stopped bothering to see him at all \u2013 instead leaving prescriptions for him to pick up for cash without a consultation. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re taking them, you\u2019re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you\u2019re addicted to them. You\u2019re not going say stop giving them to me,\u201d he said. Like many of those hooked on opioids, Hatcher needed ever-increasing doses to satisfy the addiction. Eventually, he looked to the black market to top up his prescriptions. \u201cYou can go out on the streets and get it. I\u2019ve done it. There are people in my life that I would never have associated with. There are people that couldn\u2019t get five minutes of my time because I knew what they were doing. These were drug dealers. But now these people are in my circle because they have the pills I need,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew who had them. This is my town. This is where I grew up. You knew who they were.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/25/opioid-epidemic-prescription-painkillers-heroin-addiction\">How cracking down on America's painkiller capital led to a heroin crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drugs took over much of his life. They were costing him large amounts of money but also time with his children because he would spend hours waiting for dealers. His answer was to quit a well-paying but demanding position as assistant manager at Walmart and take a $10-an-hour job in an auto parts store.</p> <p>Hatcher weaned himself off the drugs with the help of counseling in 2013. He got his job back at Walmart but regards those years as a lost decade.</p> <p>\u201cI could have been the store manager by now. But when your mind is not functioning correctly, you\u2019re not thinking clearly, you lose that opportunity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawyers for the doctors, pharmacies and pain clinics named in the legal action claim that Hatcher\u2019s addiction was his own fault. They say he and other addicts abused the drugs by buying some illegally, grinding them up to get a more powerful high or \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d in search of several prescriptions at once. </p> <p>\u201cThe very core of (their) alleged claims stem from their own criminal, illegal and immoral activity,\u201d the defendants said in court papers.</p> <p>Cagle does not deny that some, but not all, of his clients misused drugs before their opioid addiction. But he said that neither justifies prescribing them opioids for years on end nor the circumstances of other plaintiffs who never touched illegal drugs and only became hooked on painkillers after seeking treatment for work injuries or car accidents.</p> <p>Cagle contends that the doctors and pharmacists knew just how addictive the drugs were but kept on prescribing and dispensing them in large quantities because they were making big profits. Hatcher says the claim he became an addict because he abused drugs is back to front. He and others say they became addicted while following the prescriptions and only once they were hooked did they abuse drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a circle. You go to the doctor and they bill you. The pharmacy, they\u2019re a part of it because they were giving out a whole bunch of pills. It\u2019s business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is spit town. How many pills were they selling? Enough for a major city. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018No medicine was practiced at her office\u2019</h2> <p>The Wellness Center, later renamed Mountain Medical Care, was shut down after a federal raid in 2010. Federal prosecutors who convicted some doctors and an administrator at the clinic described it as a moneymaking machine, raking in more $4.5m a year as word spread beyond Williamson that opioid prescriptions could be had with ease. In legal papers to seize Hoover\u2019s assets, federal officials said she prescribed more pain medication than any other doctor in West Virginia during the 2000s.</p> <p>Among her other patients was Willis Duncan, who worked as an electrician in coal mines for more than 30 years until he was referred to the clinic after he suffered a crushed sternum and broken ribs in a work accident.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d get to the clinic at five o\u2019clock in the morning. They didn\u2019t open till eight o\u2019clock, but at five o\u2019clock there would be a hundred people there waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could tell them your dick hurts and they would write you a script. The doctor\u2019s signature was already on it when you went in.\u201d</p> <p>Federal investigators said the doctors frequently did not even see the patients they were writing prescriptions for. Hatcher and Duncan both noticed that after handing over cash they picked up prescriptions signed by a Dr William Ryckman, who had never examined them. Ryckman, one of Vinson\u2019s first hires, lived nearly 300 miles from the clinic in Pennsylvania and was later convicted of sending blank prescriptions to the clinic which assistants filled in with patients\u2019 details. He was jailed for six months and lost his medical licence. The authorities also found a bank account with Ryckman\u2019s name on it and more than $1m in cash deposits but he denied knowledge of it. </p> <p>Another Williamson doctor, Diane Shafer, who Ryckman said in his deposition was married to Vinson, at one time wrote more painkiller prescriptions than some hospitals in West Virginia.</p> <p>\u201cShafer simply handed out prescriptions in exchange for cash, even pre-signing scripts for patient files,\u201d said the lawsuit against her for allegedly contributing to the death of a patient. \u201cNo medicine was practiced at her office.\u201d</p> <p>Shafer was arrested, admitted to illegally prescribing opioids and was sentenced to six months in federal prison. She has been barred from practicing medicine after surrendering her licence. </p> <p>Hatcher, Duncan and the other plaintiffs contend that the doctors were only part of the problem. They allege the pain clinics were working in league with drug stores, which also made large profits from selling the opioids. The lawsuit calls them \u201camong the most grossly negligent pharmacies in America\u201d.</p> <p>One was a small stone building on Williamson\u2019s main street, Tug Valley Pharmacy, which became notorious in the town for the long lines of out of state cars at its drive-through window. Its owner, Randy Ballengee, said in a deposition that he filled up to 200 prescriptions a day from the Wellness Clinic but did not know that it was widely spoken of locally as a \u201cpill mill\u201d. Witnesses testified that drug deals were openly made outside the pharmacy and that prescriptions were refilled early for cash. </p> <p>Hatcher used another pharmacy in the neighbouring town of South Williamson, just across the border in Kentucky. Its owner, Larry Ray Barnett, who has since died, also claimed in a deposition not to know about the pain clinic\u2019s reputation. But federal authorities said both pharmacies made large profits off of opioids. Duncan was earning $2,500 a week working in the mines but estimates he was spending close to a $1,000 on pills.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They all worked together.

More, more, more, more, more, more, more. Just kept increasing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hatcher said he believed doctors and pharmacists got away with it for years because people in the state have been \u201cstereotyped for years as barefoot, toothless and inbred hillbillies to now welfare drug abusers\u201d.</p> <p>He said the exploitation was perpetuated by the stigma around drug addiction.</p> <p>\u201cPeople that are affected by this treat it just as sexual abuse once was treated, as the public has made it to be something that is shameful and dirty,\u201d he said.</p> <p> </p> <h2>\u2018Handing out drugs like candy\u2019</h2> <p>By the time the Wellness Center was shut down in 2010, Henry Vinson had been in and out of prison for a second time after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting one of the clinic\u2019s doctors, Armando Acosta, in evading taxes by keeping patients\u2019 payments off the books. Vinson today denies he did anything of the sort but said he pleaded guilty to protect his mother because a \u201cmalicious\u201d federal government threatened to indict her too. Vinson\u2019s mother, Joyce Vinson, owned the building with the clinic until she died in 2006 and Henry inherited it. Four years later he agreed to relinquish the $1m property to the government in return for a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted for whatever criminal activities may have taken place at the Wellness Center.</p> <p>Today, Vinson denies having any direct role in setting up or running the clinic. \u201cI have never been in the clinic business. I have never been in that practice. I would think it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s responsibility to see patients and if there\u2019s a patient care issue, I would think that\u2019s between the physician and a patient,\u201d he said. </p> <p> Hoover left the US for the Bahamas. Federal authorities seized her assets and she was stripped of her medical licence over the allegations she pressured a patient to have sex with her son. Hoover has defended the prescriptions as legitimate. </p> <p>A similar pattern played out across West Virginia. By the 2000s, the Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, a town half an hour\u2019s drive north of Williamson with a population of little more than 300, was among the top 25 dispensers of hydrocodone opioid pain medication in the entire country. Federal investigators later accused the pharmacist, James Wooley, of working in concert with the owner of a local medical centre, Debra Justice. The pair allegedly \u201chatched a get rich(er) quick scheme to open a pain clinic that would refer all of its prescriptions for controlled substances to Sav-Rite Kermit\u201d. Investigators said the clinic and pharmacy were \u201chanding out drugs like candy\u201d.</p> <p>At its peak, Sav-Rite was selling more than 3m dosages of hydrocodone a year, earning $6.5m, in an impoverished town of a few hundred people. Investigators said there was so much cash receptionists had difficulty closing the till.</p> <p>Key to the success of the scheme was to find doctors prepared to cooperate. One of them was Dr Donald Kiser. Among the prescriptions he wrote was one for $500 worth of opioids and valium for William Preece, a former coal miner who had been injured in a work accident. </p> <p>Preece overdosed on the drugs the next day. It came just two weeks after Preece had received an earlier prescription for opioids originally prescribed for an injury as a coal miner after he was caught in a rock fall. </p> <p>Preece\u2019s sister, Debbie, said he fought hard to shake the addiction, including attending a methadone clinic. But he kept returning to the pills and the pain clinic kept giving him prescriptions. \u201cI get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cAfter he was not able to work in the mines, he opened a little store for a living. Then he ended up losing his home, his store, everything he had due to the addiction ... Wooley\u2019s clinic, the Sav-Rite, was a like a circus. They even handed out popcorn to people waiting in line. You would see licence plates from everywhere. Virginia. Ohio. Tennessee. Kentucky.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95a4b29663f78006c3e4119c3a78eb121013bdd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a4b29663f78006c3e4119c3a78eb121013bdd7/0_175_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Preece remembers her brother: \u2018I get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Preece remembers her brother: \u2018I get emotional about it because I can\u2019t get over it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kiser was sent to prison for seven years for violations of federal drug laws and lost his medical licence.

In 2012, Wooley pleaded guilty to illegally selling prescription medication and conspiracy, and was sentenced to six months in prison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is this whole chain of manufacturers, doctors, distributors, wholesalers</p> <footer> <cite>Francis Hughes, the state\u2019s former chief deputy attorney general</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The West Virginia authorities say none of this would have been possible if it had not been for distribution companies pouring drugs into the state. The attorney general\u2019s office has sued a dozen firms which between them delivered more than 200m opioid pills to West Virginia in the five years to 2012. The lawsuits alleged that the companies knew large numbers of the drugs were sold by \u201cnotorious pill mills\u201d but were more interested in profit. </p> <p>\u201cIt is this whole chain of manufacturers, doctors, distributors, wholesalers,\u201d said Francis Hughes, the state\u2019s former chief deputy attorney general who was instrumental in the legal actions. \u201cWe were seeing drugstores that were located in a town where the population is 365 running millions of dollars a month through the drugstore selling opiates.

Its clients included Tug Valley Pharmacy in Williamson.

  "<p>Over the 11 years that Angela Merkel has been at the top of German politics, steering her country through global financial crashes, European debt crises and the aftershocks of wars in the Middle East, she has been able to rely on one constant: the loyalty of her party. If Merkel\u2019s reign has looked so solid, it has partly been because the Christian Democrat leader hasn\u2019t had to see off challenges from within her own ranks.</p> <p>But one year on from the height of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">Europe\u2019s refugee crisis</a>, that situation is changing. While Merkel\u2019s ratings are still strong enough for only a minority to expect her not to run for re-election next year, her liberal stance on the refugee question has for the first time opened up a political space for a challenger from her own party.</p> <p>Over the summer, the darkening tone of Germany\u2019s political debate has been set not by Merkel\u2019s optimistic slogan of \u201cwe will manage\u201d, but by a politician who describes himself as a \u201cburkaphobe\u201d, who calls on Muslim men to be less uptight about showering naked in public gyms, and criticises his leader\u2019s crisis management in all but name. Meet Jens Spahn, the MP for Steinfurt and Borken, deputy finance minister and, if some commentators are to be believed, Germany\u2019s chancellor-in-waiting.</p> <p>Defending the partial ban of the full-face veil that the government wants to introduce following his proposal, he says bluntly: \u201cGermany may not be the right country for those who want to keep their wife in a burka or niqab, especially now that we have become such a sought-after destination for so many. We need to send some strong signals about what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe German people want to help refugees, but they want to help in an orderly way.\u201d</p> <p>Only 36 and openly gay, Spahn may not seem the most likely candidate to lead a conservative rebellion within Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union. \u201cA political path like mine would certainly have been rockier 10 years ago,\u201d he admitted. When he first ran as a candidate in the deeply Catholic M\u00fcnsterland region, some in his party ran a smear campaign to stop him. \u201cObviously, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4/0_271_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian refugee with a picture of Merkel after reaching Munich in September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian refugee with a picture of Merkel after reaching Munich in September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he rejects the idea that his lifestyle runs counter to his politics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the contradiction. Germany\u2019s dominant culture and lifestyle has become a lot more liberal in the last 10 years, whether you are looking at gays and lesbians or at immigration. But my biggest fear is that this new openness is under pressure \u2013 from a very conservative form of Islam and a rightwing backlash against immigration \u2013 and that we will have to fight very hard to preserve it.\u201d When criticising cultural norms in the Arabic world, he deliberately uses the word <em>spiessig</em>, meaning prissy or narrow-minded \u2013 a term in the past often associated with his own party.</p> <p>With a combativeness that can border on arrogance, Spahn first gained a profile as the CDU\u2019s health policy spokesman, repeatedly calling for reforms of the pension system and data protection regulation \u2013 usually two holy cows in German political debate. Having looked like a shoo-in for a ministerial post, Spahn was parked in a junior role in the finance ministry after the 2013 federal election \u2013 a move that some read as a slapdown for the uppity young politician. But in his current role, reporting to influential veteran finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Spahn has been granted a licence to roam across the political field, holding forth on anything from dual citizenship to raising the pension age.</p> <p>Coming from a party that has never openly rebelled against its leader, Spahn is still careful in phrasing criticism of the government. He insisted that he hoped Merkel would run again at the federal elections in 2017 and vehemently rejected the notion that Germany made a \u201cmistake\u201d at the height of the refugee crisis: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/angela-merkel-defends-germanys-handling-of-refugee-influx\" title=\"\">decision of 4 September</a> was correct and logical,\u201d he says. The \u201cbut\u201d is not long in the coming. \u201cBut we should have been quicker to make clear that it was an exceptional situation.</p> <p>\u201cWe all underestimated the power of how mobile phones and social media could change migration movements \u2026 It is certainly not false that no one in Germany had predicted the extent to which other countries were not prepared to help with the refugee crisis.\u201d</p> <p>But his demands on the party leader are unequivocal. \u201cIt is very important that the German government makes it clear that we have won back control since September and October last year, when we had clearly lost control of the situation due to irregular immigration on the Greek-Turkish border,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important that we make clear we are aware of the vast challenge of integration.

While he said there was \u201cnothing I regret more than Britain leaving the European Union\u201d, he criticised politicians \u201cputting the boot into Britain\u201d. Instead, he said, \u201cwe should ask what drove so many people to say: \u2018That European Union is not my own.\u2019 That\u2019s the debate we should be having in Germany, too: does Germany want to be part of a European Union that a majority of Brits don\u2019t feel belongs to them?\u201d</p> <p>In words that will be received with interest in the offices of the British \u201cBrexit ministers\u201d, David Davis and Liam Fox, Spahn appeared supportive of the idea of Britain leaving the single market and instead negotiating a bespoke, \u201cCanada-style\u201d trade deal with the EU. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the one-for-one rules of the single market without free movement. And if you want to have the single market, why leave in the first place? Because in that case you would have to subscribe to the very same rules that are being decided in Brussels without having a say. You may want that, but it wouldn\u2019t make much sense.</p> <p>\u201cBoth sides, and especially Germany, have a great interest in strong economic ties. If you can have a free trade agreement with the US, with Canada, and even with communistic Vietnam, then we\u2019ll get a sensible trade agreement with Great Britain if the will is there.\u201d</p> <p>Spahn dismissed the EU\u2019s delays in ratifying a free-trade deal with America and Canada as uniquely German reservations rooted in anti-American prejudice. Striking a deal with Britain, he said, would be easier to communicate politically. \u201cMost Germans have a positive image of Britain, and I don\u2019t think the majority of Germans are against free trade, per se.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Spahn said it should be up to the EU to negotiate such a deal. \u201cIf you say the European Union is responsible for free-trade deals, which it is, and the European parliament has got democratic legitimacy too, then it would be up to the EU to negotiate such a deal with Great Britain.

  "<p>Autumn statements come and go. Like comets, they blaze across the political sky for a couple of weeks in November and December before disappearing into the inky darkness. By Christmas, they are largely forgotten.</p> <p>This year will be different. For once, it matters what the Treasury cooks up and what would have been a rather mundane affair had George Osborne remained chancellor has become a very big deal indeed.</p> <p>Philip Hammond is the new occupant of 11 Downing Street and he has some big calls to make. Is the economy in need of a post-<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>boost? If it is, can the job be left solely to the Bank of England? If not, can the Treasury take up the baton and at what cost to the public finances? If so, should the stimulus come from lower taxes or higher spending?</p> <p>The answer to the first question is yes. Growth in the second quarter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/26/uk-economic-growth-second-quarter-brexit-eu-referendum\">was reasonably robust at 0.6%</a>, and the indicators since the referendum on 23 June have shown that the economy has held up better than most people anticipated.</p> <p>In part, though, that has been the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">policy action already taken by the Bank of England </a>and by the expectation \u2013 fostered by Hammond \u2013 that there will be more to come in the autumn statement.</p> <p>Some softening in growth can be expected as a result of investment decisions being put on hold. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">Consumer spending appears to have held up well since Brexit</a>, but there have been no figures yet for private capital expenditure. This was already lower in the second quarter of 2016 than a year earlier, and with uncertainty ratcheted up it is possible that there will be further weakness in the second half of the year.</p> <p>The Bank of England is not best placed to cope with this. If interest rates of 0.5% for the seven years leading up to Brexit have failed to persuade companies to invest, it is hard to imagine that interest rates of 0.25% (or even 0.1%) will any more successful. Keynes called this a liquidity trap: business cannot be persuaded to invest no matter how low interest rates go. It is a classic example of the old saw: you can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make it drink.<br></p> <p>Monetary policy, which is what central banks do, is on the point of exhaustion. Indeed, there are some economists who think perpetually low interest rates and QE are the problem. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not that central banks have failed to reduce interest rates enough,\u201d said the consultancy Fathom last week, \u201cbut that the continued application of emergency monetary policy measures has held back growth in productive potential by enabling barely profitable and increasingly unproductive firms to survive. Low rates encourage zombies. Zombies do not grow.\u201d </p> <p>Apart from in the depths of the 2008-09 global slump, fiscal policy has taken a back seat. Finance ministers have sat back and left it to central banks to sort things out. This looked like a mistake in late 2009-10, when the brief flirtation with Keynesianism gave way to the vogue for austerity, and it looks like an even bigger mistake today.</p> <p>There are two necessary preconditions for a Keynesian stimulus: that private sector investment is being prevented by a high degree of uncertainty, and that monetary policy is played out. Both apply in the post-Brexit world.</p> <p>So, Hammond can make a strong case for an expansionary autumn statement on the grounds that there is a risk to the economy that can be dealt with better by the Treasury than by the Bank of England.</p> <p>The next question is what form that stimulus should take. Hammond has two options: to cut taxes or to increase public spending, or perhaps a combination of both.</p> <p>If Hammond goes down the tax route, a cut in VAT is the obvious choice. The chancellor would hope that cheaper goods and services would encourage consumer spending and so limit the risk of the economy sliding into recession. There are, though, drawbacks with this approach. For a start, it is expensive; cutting the main VAT rate from 20% to 17.5% would cost the exchequer \u00a314bn a year. There is also no guarantee that consumers would spend the windfall; they might simply save more. And if consumer spending does increase as a result of a VAT cut, the upshot is likely to be higher imports and a bigger balance of payments deficit.<br></p> <p>The final reason to be wary of a VAT cut is that boosting consumption is a lower priority than raising investment. And if the problem is that the private sector is not investing, it makes sense for the Treasury to boost public investment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc81013ca5c1e4e4550dd2f9601595a064c2f856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc81013ca5c1e4e4550dd2f9601595a064c2f856/0_0_4336_2602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A commuter rushing for a train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passenger numbers on the trains have doubled in the past 15 years while spending on railway infrastructure has remained flat as a share of GDP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the arguments always mustered against higher state investment can be easily countered. Hammond would not be competing against the private sector for the funds available for investment. There would be no \u201ccrowding out\u201d if the Treasury borrowed more, because the private sector has made it abundantly clear over the past decade that it has a propensity not to invest.</p> <p>Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, puts it this way: \u201cIn the current environment, the case for public investment is compelling. Interest rates can\u2019t go any lower, uncertainty is extreme and borrowing is cheap.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the economy is suffering from obvious supply-side deficiencies that would be eased by higher investment: passenger numbers on the trains have doubled in the past 15 years while spending on railway infrastructure has remained flat as a share of GDP; there is no nationwide superfast broadband; there is a looming energy crisis caused by power stations reaching the end of their lives; the UK spends less on infrastructure than any G7 nation apart from the US; there is an acute shortage of new housing that is leading to excessively high property inflation and impeding labour mobility.</p> <p>All in all, Hammond is spoilt for choice. Public investment is a better option for a stimulus than a VAT cut because it provides assets for the future, improves the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential, and generates a stream of income that ensures the investment pays for itself. The deficit, currently 4% of GDP, will rise in the short term but come down over time.</p> <p>Boosting public investment is not without its problems for the government. Despite all the talk about shovel-ready projects, it would take time for extra spending on infrastructure to show up in the growth figures. There are two other difficulties. One is public opposition to new railways and housing. So-called BANANAism (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone) is strong. The other is that the construction sector has a massive problem with skill shortages and the only realistic way to find the workers to build the new homes and lay the new tracks would be to import them from overseas.</p>",
  "<p>In Edinburgh, where I write this, there is concern that the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://calvertjournal.com/news/show/6554/russian-sputnik-news-agency-moves-uk-headquarters-to-edinburgh\">newly opened branch of the Kremlin-backed news agency Sputnik</a> is intended specifically to destabilise post-Brexit English-Scottish relations. Message to Putin: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Vladimir baby! We can handle this one ourselves!!\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, let us compare the contrasting media manipulation strategies of Putin\u2019s Russia and, for example, the Labour party, both of them organisations that have, at times, abandoned their leftwing core beliefs in an attempt to adapt to a shifting geopolitical landscape. If last week\u2019s news is to be believed, Russia\u2019s control of media extends as far as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/23/fbi-new-york-times-hack-russia\">hacking staff at the <em>New York Times</em></a>. As well as the Kremlin getting to see funny cartoons of representational figures holding up signs with writing on them hours ahead of the rest of us, could this hack also mean Russia could plant false stories into American media at source?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a long tradition of essentially dishonest photo opportunities being used to cement policy in the public mind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is Donald Trump, for example, whose rise is fuelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nuclear-football-donald-trump\">fears of forthcoming global nuclear war</a>, actually a fictional creation of Russian propagandists intended to destabilise the west? Oddly, this is a more comforting proposition than the idea that he really exists.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2015, it was suggested that Putin\u2019s deliberately penis-shaped submarines, designed specifically to subconsciously exaggerate our perceptions of Russian genitalia, are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?_r=0\">poking around the transatlantic data cables</a> to ensure the maverick anarcho-superpower\u2019s ability to cut continental Europe off from America. Two campaigns working in opposition might then mean American media were full of Russian lies that we in Europe weren\u2019t actually able to view.</p> <p>On the other hand, this kind of strategy would be typical of Putin\u2019s propaganda guru Vladislav Surkov, a surrealist artist who, despite dressing like a disgraced <em>Top Gear</em> presenter, uses creatively chaotic double-think to sculpt our perceptions of Russia as determinedly as Richard Dreyfuss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yecJLI-GRuU\">mushes mashed potato into mountains</a> in C<em>lose Encounters of the Third Kind.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9f2388443cb9200380101cbd7ee67c6f0221888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9f2388443cb9200380101cbd7ee67c6f0221888/0_0_1884_2817/669.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the one hand, dope-fiend Russian athletes\u2019 disqualification from the Rio feelgood festival was embarrassing; on the other, it creates the impression of a country of unpredictable law-defying crazies so convincingly Surkov himself may have masterminded it. There\u2019s no way of knowing anymore. Surkov may even have written this. I may actually be him without my even knowing it.</p> <p>In March 2015, I wrote, for this paper, a silly fantasy about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/01/vladimir-putin-effigy-naked-back-yard-stewart-lee\">a giant statue of a naked Putin landing in my garden.</a> Reading the below-the-line internet comments later, I realised how thorough Russia\u2019s determination to muddy the waters of opinion was; many of them were clearly generated by almost-literate Kremlin cyber-slaves, rather than by the usual neoliberal trolls taking time off from masturbating over old videos of Toby Young on a rowing reality TV show.</p> <p>Briefly, I adopted a strategy of writing borderline meaningless gibberish about Russia to try and provoke weird responses from the full-time Kremlin-backed commenters. Indeed, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/07/fifa-eurovision-corruption-schools-academies-stewart-lee\">a column about the Eurovision Song Contest</a> three months later I discreetly included the following irrelevant paragraph: \u201cOne may as well give the kosovorotka-marinading wazzocks something incomprehensible to feed to their bewildered brainstems. To me, then, Vladimir Putin is a giant, prolapsed female worker bee that sucks hot ridicule out of langoustines\u2019 cephalothoraxes. Let\u2019s see what crunchy, expansionist lavatory honey this notion causes the parthenogenetic Russian keyboard wendigos to inflate for us this week, in the shadow of Paul McGann and his art gnome.\u201d</p> <p>The problem here was twofold. Firstly, many <em>Observer</em> readers found this nonsense indistinguishable from my usual writing. (As has been pointed out by contributors many times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/01/aa-gill-column-addiction-alcoholic\">I am no AA Gill.</a> Now that man can write!)</p> <p>And, secondly, many of the pro-Putin below-the-line comments the incoherence provoked were, I suspect, actually placed by sassy readers attempting to parody the usual Kremlin posts.</p> <p>Consider, for example, this convincingly odd submission from General Dreedle. \u201cRussia is very well doing without your Opra Winfrey western pornography and youre decadent music. More lies about Ukraine which was only the size of a biscuit before transsexual won.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk\">Sign up to the Guardian's daily email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether the supposed <em>Observer</em> contributor General Dreedle is real or not, the fact is Putin\u2019s Russia has taken political propaganda to the next level, motherfuckers! Meanwhile, here at home, Jeremy Corbyn is filmed sitting on the floor of a train.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of essentially dishonest photo opportunities being used by politicians to cement policy in the public mind. Consider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-life-in-pictures#img-25\">Margaret Thatcher in that tank in 1986</a>; or <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/presidential-elections/videos/tank-ride\">Michael Dukakis in that tank in 1988</a>; or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/jan/12/gulf-war-in-pictures#img-12\">John Major on that tank in 1991</a>.</p> <p>But politicians\u2019 photo opportunities don\u2019t only use tanks. In 2006, David Cameron, who went on to ruin Britain for ever, was photographed in Norway <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/20/david-cameron-hug-a-husky-green-legacy-10-years\">hugging a husky</a>, as he launched the lie that he was unleashing the \u201cgreenest government ever\u201d. But within a few years, Theresa May would close the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/decc-abolition-major-setback-for-uk-climate-change-efforts\">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a> and Conservative propagandists would have gone to any lengths to avoid David Cameron being photographed embracing an animal. (Indeed, now I find myself wondering, was Vladislav Surkov himself the unnamed source of the bought biographer Isabel Oakeshott\u2019s Cameron pig-sex-face story? Or is Isabel Oakeshott herself a Kremlin creation? What kind of name is \u201cIsabel Oakeshott\u201d? Has anyone ever really been called that, in real life, ever?)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/putin-and-the-tiger-russian-presidents-four-best-photo-ops\">Putin and the tiger \u2013\u00a0Russian president's four best photo-ops</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But instead of being photographed in a tank like a normal politician, Jeremy Corbyn last week chose to be filmed sitting on the floor of a train. While clearly intended to highlight the scandal of private rail company ownership, the Labour party\u2019s release of the footage represents an entirely foreseeable own goal.</p> <p>First, it provides the same two blokes that secretly write all the jokes for the comedians on all those shitty TV comedy panel shows with a picture of Jeremy Corbyn sitting on the floor, thus generating loads of pithy one-liners tying together the idea of the number of seats on a train with the number of seats in parliament, ie, \u201cHe should have gone and sat in his own back benches, there\u2019s plenty of room there!\u201d</p> <p>Secondly, as the Corbyn floor film was taken on a train owned by a private company, that company had access to CCTV detailing the circumstances leading up to its creation and it is clearly in its own commercial interests to use that footage to discredit the images, whether the empty seats Corbyn chose to walk by were actually reserved or not.</p> <p>The right in British politics, backed by business and media, is consolidating an unassailable hegemony. Our left needs to raise its game. If you ever got to see film of Putin sprawled on public transport, every single possible interpretation of the footage would already have been minutely mapped.</p> <p><em>Stewart Lee\u2019s new show, Content Provider, is at Leicester Square theatre from 8 November and then touring.

There\u2019s church music in their DNA: Nights (\u201cI wanna see Nirvana, but don\u2019t wanna die yet\u201d) ends with a polyphony of Franks, like a gospel choir warming up in an empty hall. Pretty Sweet reaches heights of holy dissonance with an off-key children\u2019s choir, a sound-clash reflected in the mad, atonal piano of Andr\u00e9 3000 (the only instantly recognisable guest) on Solo (Reprise). Other interludes are expendable, such as Facebook Story, in which the French producer SebastiAn recites a moronic modern parable about social media. Choruses by the Beatles and the Carpenters are stripped of their words and worked into new songs, but these tricks add little, when Ocean already knows how to write a tune like Stevie Wonder (Skyline To).</p> <p>We care more about the circumstances of an album\u2019s release these days than the music itself. Hopefully, Ocean\u2019s latest journey in cerebral, non-macho, boundary-free R&amp;B will be heard long after the fuss has died down.</p>",
  "<h2>Hans Ulrich Obrist: \u2018I can\u2019t live without Instagram\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Swiss-born curator, writer and art historian and artistic director at the Serpentine Galleries. Since 2009, Obrist has held a top 10 spot in <em>ArtReview</em> magazine\u2019s annual list of the art world\u2019s 100 most powerful people.</strong></p> <p>I believe a lot in rituals. I get up very early every morning, around five or six o\u2019clock, and I always start the day by reading 15 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/edouard-glissant-obituary\">Edouard Glissant</a>, a poet, writer and philosopher. I have every book he ever wrote at home and I\u2019ll just pick one and read.</p> <p>For me, Glissant\u2019s work is like a daily toolbox. He comes from Martinique, which is one of a string of islands [making up the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea]. A cultural exchange takes place between these islands and yet they preserve their own identities. So Glissant\u2019s work explores how we can engage with globalisation without falling into the trap of homogenisation. His books are an inspiration, particularly in this current climate of a lack of tolerance. I\u2019m always considering how we could develop exhibitions that embrace mondiality, which don\u2019t lead to separation but to dialogue, which build bridges.</p> <p>After Glissant, I go running, often in the park, because I love London parks. In this city, you can discover new things every day, even after living here for many years. Then it\u2019s breakfast and the office. I read about 30-40 magazines every month: all the art publications through to <em>London Review of Books</em>, the <em>New Yorker</em>, the <em>Economist</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>. In my bag currently I have about 150 articles from the last two weeks; I cut them out and share them with friends. They often trigger something. For example, many years ago I read about a group of 60s architects who had questioned the masterplan, and about Yona Friedman, and this year he has actually built one of our <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/serpentine-summer-houses-2016-yona-friedman\">summer houses at the Serpentine.</a></p> <p>With social media, there are the ones I use for information and the ones I broadcast on. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HUObrist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a> is both. With Facebook, I never really use it actively, just to broadcast my interviews with artists on Facebook Live, or sometimes they\u2019re on <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/HUObrist/1BRKjkmnENVGw\">Periscope</a>. Over the last six months, I\u2019ve also increasingly been using Snapchat. I follow some people I find inspiring, but I also broadcast films, little performances by artists, short sparks, short poems.</p> <p>I can\u2019t live without <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hansulrichobrist/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>. I look at it a lot, about half an hour to an hour a day and then post. My handwriting project on Instagram is a protest against the disappearance of handwriting \u2013 I post a handwritten note there every day. But I also find Instagram very inspiring. The diverse ways people use it is exciting \u2013 whether it\u2019s the artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wolfgang_tillmans/\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> using it for activism with his anti-Brexit posters, or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jenniferhiggie/?hl=en\">Jennifer Higgie</a> [co-editor of <a href=\"https://frieze.com/editorial\"><em>Frieze</em></a> magazine] who posts about a different extraordinary female artist every day, with a little text of biography so it\u2019s really a protest against forgetting.</p> <p>My absolute favourite account though is from Alice Rawsthorn, the design critic of the international <em>New York Times</em>. She structures her posts by week, so each week there\u2019s a new theme \u2013 \u201cDesign and Light\u201d or \u201cDesign Families\u201d \u2013 and each day there\u2019s a new post related to the theme, so for example, there was a stunning <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BG4Jh-3vPa0/?hl=pt-br\">lighthouse from 1750</a> for \u201cDesign and Light\u201d. In a way, she came up with the rules of the game, to actually structure it by weeks, because most people have it as a daily thing. I\u2019m completely obsessed by her Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s a fascinating vision of design that makes us look at the world differently.</p> <p>I always have my best ideas in Sils Maria, a village in the Swiss mountains. I\u2019m from Switzerland and spent a lot of time there as a child. Now I go about once or twice a year. There\u2019s something very magical about the place, the light \u2013 it\u2019s almost at 2,000 metres altitude \u2013 it\u2019s glacial, it has big mountains. Most of my exhibition and book ideas I\u2019ve had there.</p> <p>My favourite cultural venue is actually an imaginary construct \u2013 it\u2019s the unrealised <a href=\"http://funpalaces.co.uk/about/idea-come/\">Fun Palace</a> by the theatre director Joan Littlewood and the architect Cedric Price, who in the 60s came up with this idea of a cultural centre bringing together all artistic disciplines, removing all silos. As a thought experiment, I\u2019m inspired by it every day. Unfortunately the Fun Palace was never built, but you can get a sense of Cedric Price\u2019s work by going to his <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/exhibits/snowdon-aviary\">amazing aviary</a> created with Lord Snowdon at London Zoo. It\u2019s my favourite building in London.</p> <p><strong>Favourite TV</strong> I mostly watch on demand, a lot of Netflix. Recently it\u2019s been <em>The People v OJ Simpson</em>. I also like this exercise of looking at all the films that a director has done \u2013 like Tarantino \u2013 going into breadth and depth at the same time.</p> <p><strong>My litmus test for new ideas</strong> I always ask myself: \u201cIs it urgent?\u201d I use that word often. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a797942ffa944583fbc04e08925ce5e67e6fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a797942ffa944583fbc04e08925ce5e67e6fe5/0_117_498_299/498.jpg\" alt=\"Fabian Riggall.\" width=\"498\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Once Upon a Time in America made me fall in love with cinema\u2019: Fabian Riggall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Funnell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Fabien Riggall: \u2018I have good ideas in the shower, so I get out and get my house wet\u2019</h2> <p><strong>As founder of Secret Cinema, Riggall has transformed how we watch films: since 2007 his live cinematic events have invited costumed fans to explore the immersive world of a movie, from </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nHZAZZqOqM\"><strong><em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest</em></strong></a><strong> to <em>Star Wars</em>. He now plans to expand into the US and produce films.</strong></p> <p>On a good morning, my routine is to get up around 7am and go for a run around Victoria Park, east London, near where I live, or a swim. I feel much more relaxed if I exercise in the morning, but if I\u2019m tired I just don\u2019t do it. I tend to have a lot of good ideas when I\u2019m in the shower, so I get out and get my whole house wet. Then I\u2019ll go and have a coffee in a place called <a href=\"http://www.climpsonandsons.com/\">Climpson &amp; Sons</a> and just have half an hour before the day starts to write to-do lists and notes.</p> <p>The biggest influence on my career has been going to the cinema when I was very young and seeing <em>Once Upon a Time in America</em>, a very violent gangster film from the 80s. I was living in Morocco at the time and I sneaked out to watch it. It\u2019s a very romantic, epic film and it had a profound effect on me. I fell in love with cinema and with the idea of what cinema was.</p> <p>One non-cultural thing that inspires my work is politics. We did a big campaign for Remain through Secret Cinema; for <em>Star Wars</em>,<em> </em>we worked with the <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Refugee Council</a>; for <em>28 Days Later</em>, we supported the junior doctors; for <em>Dr Strangelove</em>, we worked with <a href=\"https://www.warchild.org.uk/\">War Child</a>. I believe that all art is political by nature and I\u2019m passionate about people getting involved in political matters.</p> <p>This summer, I went to Glastonbury, which I think is one of England\u2019s great cultural achievements: it\u2019s an extraordinary balance between types of culture and I like the madness and chaos of it. Just after the sad news about Brexit I saw Damon Albarn perform with the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/the-syrian-national-orchestra-95691\">Orchestra of Syrian Musicians</a>; it was about 60 musicians, with all these different singers. That was special.</p> <p><strong>Favourite cafe to work in </strong>I like the simplicity of Le Pain Quotidien: you sit on these long tables and work really easily.</p> <p><strong>Favourite app</strong> I spend most of my life trying to get off social media, but one app I love is <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/\">Waze</a>, a GPS-based navigation app that takes you away from traffic.

Basically, the Modern House sells post-1940s houses in the UK and they\u2019re not all super-expensive; some of them are beautifully done up ex-council places by Goldfinger or around the Barbican. And I keep saying: \u201cI love that! Look at this 1960s house \u2013 I want to live there!\u201d They recently published a fantastic coffee-table book and they write about the houses beautifully; they\u2019re like museum entries for houses I\u2019d like to live in.</p> <p>Visual pleasure and visual exploration are really important to me, but I\u2019m also a profoundly physical person. I have my best ideas in the 30 minutes following my almost daily yoga session. For me, yoga creates space within the mind as well as realigning the body so that the solutions to whatever I\u2019ve been grappling with in the previous 24 hours or 24 weeks just sort of emerge.</p> <p>One of the litmus tests I have for new ideas is in the body. If I feel a bit sick at the thought of an idea, a bit \u201coooh, God, this is scary\u201d, that actually means it\u2019s a bit exciting, doesn\u2019t it? That feeling in the gut makes me realise that, yes, this is a challenging and therefore sensible thing to do.</p> <p>I walk a lot; I really love walking in the landscape, seeing beautiful things. One of my favourite cultural venues is Jupiter Artland, an outdoor sculpture park about 12 miles outside Edinburgh. It has a really wide range of contemporary sculpture, all commissioned for the site, beautiful woodland and fantastic walks through rolling fields, as well as a lovely house. The artworks include a nine-metre-high shotgun by Cornelia Parker propped up against a very tall tree and a wonderful amethyst grotto by Anya Gallaccio. Installed just beside the cafe are Helen Chadwick\u2019s <em>Piss Flowers </em>\u2013 a kind of garden of Piss Flowers, which I love; they were a seminal piece of work for me when I was younger.</p> <p>In Manchester, in the year since it opened, I\u2019ve been going a lot to <a href=\"http://homemcr.org/\">Home</a>, the multi-artform space in the centre of town. It\u2019s rapidly become a great social space with a diverse crowd, and that\u2019s also true for my teenagers who are 19 and 16; it\u2019s become their space as well. I have lots of breakfast meetings in <a href=\"https://www.figandsparrow.co.uk/\">Fig + Sparrow</a>, a cafe in the northern quarter that also sells really nice Danish homewares. It\u2019s run by two artist-photographers who can\u2019t make a living being artist-photographers so are cafe owners too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/25/cornelia-parker-interview-i-dont-want-to-tick-anyone-elses-boxes-whitworth-retrospective\">Cornelia Parker: \u2018I don\u2019t want to tick anyone else\u2019s boxes\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I could happily live without all technology, but I\u2019m not violently opposed to it \u2013 I just don\u2019t like it to take up too much of the time that I have to be in the world myself. Instagram is my favourite social media because it\u2019s the most visual. I\u2019m quite picky about who I follow \u2013 I only follow people who have a very good eye. So one of my favourites is British-Nigerian fashion designer and occasional curator Duro Olowu, who is just fabulous. He could be commenting on something in his professional life or passing through an airport in Lagos and he sees an extraordinarily dressed woman and catches the print and the style.</p> <p>The thing I really couldn\u2019t live without, though, is my camera on my iPhone, because I want to capture the world as I\u2019m going along, the things I need to remember \u2013 and I need visual anchors for them.</p> <p>In the role that I\u2019m in now, a very small number of artists have been sounding boards, touchstones, inspirations, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/11/richard-wentworth-sculptor-portrait-artist\">Richard Wentworth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cornelia-parker\">Cornelia Parker</a>. For me, the process of working with artists is about exploring the not yet known and that\u2019s why I love my job. But for my whole life my family have been the most incredible anchor. My husband, Nick, who is a work colleague as well, is just so optimistic about possibilities. And there\u2019s nothing better than a toddler\u2019s or a teenager\u2019s view on whatever particularly difficult work problem you\u2019re wrestling with. My daughter, Lily, forged an incredibly close bond with Marina Abramovi\u0107 when she worked with us in Manchester in 2009 and every so often, even now, she\u2019ll say: \u201cYou know if you asked Marina that question she\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019 or she\u2019d tell them to get lost\u201d. But Lily is 16 now so she\u2019d use less polite language than that. In fact, another test for new ideas comes from Marina; she said: \u201cIf you have a lot of ideas and you write them down and think, \u2018Oh I really like that one\u2019, she said, \u2018Throw that idea away, it\u2019s too easy\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>If you only work you lose your capacity to have ideas. So, as I said, I do a lot of physical practice but also gardening. Growing vegetables and things that I have started from seed and that end up on the plate is incredibly important to me. When I was a PhD student, I worked in a remarkable south Indian restaurant in Brighton and I learned how to cook Goan and Keralan food so I particularly like to cook that sort of food, and I live in the curry mile in Manchester so I can get all the ingredients in really big bags. Most of the good projects I\u2019ve worked on have started with a dinner at my house.</p> <p><strong>Unmissable TV</strong> These past couple of months it\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/06/legacy-danish-tv-drama-bbc-borgen\"><em>The Legacy</em></a>, a Danish drama with an absolutely monstrous female gallery director.

And if the answer is yes, I don\u2019t do it \u2013 we\u2019ve done that, so let\u2019s not bother. The thing that\u2019s energising in making theatre is the unknown: trying to make things, inventing, improvising.</p> <p>I always find I get ideas when I\u2019m about to go somewhere, travelling \u2013 often it\u2019s when I\u2019m climbing up the steps into an aeroplane. But it\u2019s always going. Coming back is different and I don\u2019t have any ideas at all. The other place I have ideas is watching other people\u2019s shows, although it\u2019s usually not obviously connected to what I\u2019m watching. I\u2019ll sit for the rest of the show with my fingers crossed, going: \u201cI know there are two or three things I\u2019ve got to remember\u201d.</p> <p>I do a lot of thinking when I\u2019m swimming, especially in the summer, when I go away for a while and I swim all the time. There\u2019s a great big lake in south-west France, near Carcassonne, where I\u2019ve been swimming for 20 years. I just go round and round, up and down, and there\u2019s almost never anybody else there. I go swimming in London too, but not as much as I\u2019d like to. At the right time of year I go up to the Hampstead ponds, but really you can just splash about.</p> <p>I love watching dance at Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2013 the Israeli choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hofesh-shechter\">Hofesh Shechter</a> or avant-garde choreographers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/oct/07/william.forsythe.dance\">William Forsythe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/pinabausch\">Pina Bausch</a>. I think her work is a bit patchy; sometimes, it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve ever seen and sometimes you can\u2019t wait for it to end. But at its best, it\u2019s fantastically interesting.</p> <p>Somewhere not in London that I like very much is the Amsterdam Toneelgroep. There are two theatres next to each other: one was probably built in the late 18th century, the Stadsschouwburg. It\u2019s a beautiful, big, old, rather baroque theatre with a huge stage; to the side of it is the new theatre that Ivo van Hove\u2019s company has built. It\u2019s very plain, very beautifully designed and the work they do there is great.</p> <p>My iPhone is like my sixth finger or my third hand. I use it all the time \u2013 I make notes on it, it\u2019s got my diary on it \u2013 although I can live without and do periodically live without it. If I\u2019m walking down the street I feel I\u2019m not complete if I\u2019m not sending an email or something. I used to say I could do two things at once, having a conversation and doing something with my iPhone, but I\u2019ve discovered that I don\u2019t remember the conversation or what I was doing on the phone. So the truth is that I can\u2019t.</p> <p>Quite often, I\u2019m at the theatre at 8am, 8:30am, and often I don\u2019t leave there until 10pm. So my mornings are about speed: I can get from bed to desk in about 55 minutes. I\u2019ve been doing the same journey for so many years now I can do it really fast. I can generally do it in under an hour; best ever is 50 minutes. That does not include breakfast, just getting there with a reasonable quantity of clothes on.</p> <p><strong>My favourite websites </strong>The <em>Guardian</em>, and this American political website called <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\">Democracy Now!</a> \u2013 they cover stories that very often the other papers don\u2019t, or the papers in this country anyway.</p> <p><strong>I read...</strong> all the time, European history mostly, from the 14th century through until now.

Formerly a curator for Frieze and Studio Voltaire in London, she is renowned for championing young and underrepresented artists.</strong></p> <p>I didn\u2019t really go to a gallery until I was in my late teens; I wasn\u2019t interested in visual arts. It was music that shaped my interest in the arts. When I was younger, I moved around a lot \u2013 I\u2019m a military child \u2013 and by knowing about music I could very quickly find my people, my friends. So in terms of the sort of contemporary art I\u2019m interested in, some of my favourite artists have come from being involved in the subcultures, the music and art scene of their city. For example, in a way, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mark-leckey\">Mark Leckey</a>\u2019s whole practice is born out of a very specific working-class subculture that\u2019s strongly tied to music and the rave scene. The way he talks about it is that music distinguishes different tribes. So to get a quick overview of good music that\u2019s out I read websites like <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/\">Pitchfork</a>, Triple Canopy and <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/\">Fact</a> (like a British version of Pitchfork). A lot of those sites also commission playlists of new music by DJs and musicians, which are a great way of having fresh music to listen to without doing the legwork. I used to buy a lot of new music but I\u2019m now restricted by time and I don\u2019t really go to record shops any more.</p> <p>I read a lot online. The commercial production company <a href=\"http://somesuch.co/\">Somesuch</a> commissions and publishes great writing on its website \u2013 fiction and essays \u2013 from personal pieces about something very tragic to humorous, insightful pieces on people\u2019s work. It\u2019s just published a small book of fiction too. I love it that this company, which makes really high-end adverts for huge brands, has also done that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/18/mike-kelley-nonconformist-whole-life-here\">Mike Kelley: the nonconformist's whole life is here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also religiously follow the journalist Charlie Porter, who has a unique voice \u2013 very funny and opinionated. He comes from a fashion background but is now writing about art and there\u2019s a sense of freedom to what he writes because he\u2019s coming out of left field. Sometimes, people caught up in their own industry forget that they use a particular kind of jargon so when someone comes in from another place it\u2019s really refreshing. Visual art is like anything else \u2013 there\u2019s a whole industry behind it and sometimes you have to fight a little to get through the structures to the good stuff, the meat and potatoes.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to choose one artist who has been my biggest influence but the American artist <a href=\"http://mikekelley.com/\">Mike Kelley</a> is someone I keep coming back to. I think that\u2019s partly because he was a really prolific writer as well. He was able to look at subcultures and write them into stories. One of my interests is in transgressive practices or grotesqueries and Mike wrote a really good book called <em>Foul Perfection</em>.</p> <p>I\u2019m very fond of a group of galleries that work with emerging or under-represented artists in London, such as Studio Voltaire, the <a href=\"http://www.theshowroom.org/\">Showroom</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.chisenhale.org.uk/\">Chisenhale</a>. The recent <a href=\"http://www.studiovoltaire.org/exhibitions/archive/sharon-hayes/\">Sharon Hayes show at Studio Voltaire</a> was superb. Around the country the Hepworth, <a href=\"http://www.dca.org.uk/\">Dundee Contemporary Arts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/\">Baltic</a> are great venues with strong international programmes. In Glasgow, GoMA is being revitalised with a brilliant new curator, though I\u2019m biased because I recently curated a <a href=\"http://glasgowinternational.org/events/cosima-von-bonin/\">Cosima von Bonin</a> exhibition there. And <a href=\"http://www.kinningparkcomplex.org/\">Kinning Park Complex</a> is an amazing multi-use community centre that houses performances, workshops and events of all types. The last thing I saw there was Glasgow-based feminist warriors Fallop\u00e9 and the Tubes.</p> <p>My favourite pub in the world is the Horse Shoe in Glasgow, where they have karaoke upstairs every night. I heard about it from a cabbie who informed me that a high percentage of the clientele had got quite far on <em>The X Factor</em>. I really love karaoke but I\u2019m quite bad at it. It\u2019s embarrassing, but I don\u2019t care. Sometimes, after a few drinks, I get into a bit of a rant about how everyone should have the right to sing. I like it when people surprise you. A friend, a brilliant artist called Stephen Sutcliffe, got up one night and did Elton John\u2019s I Guess That\u2019s Why They Call it the Blues, and it was amazing. The Horse Shoe also has a bit of a community centre feeling sometimes: you\u2019ll see tables of mum, auntie, nan and the kids who are there for two hours before they go off clubbing. It reminds me a bit of the social centre we used to go to with my family and grandparents when I was much younger, of when we used to go \u201cup the club\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Non-arts stuff I enjoy</strong> I have started horseriding again after an 18-year hiatus. When you move out of London your leisure time is freed up; you don\u2019t slip into the pressures of going to five art openings a night and all of that. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed8e130134e77447d53c6d4a2d1c926cc64ab5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed8e130134e77447d53c6d4a2d1c926cc64ab5f4/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kully Thiarai director of National Theatre Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018TED talks allow you to connect with the world from different perspectives\u2019: Kully Thiarai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kully Thiarai: \u2018My favourite cultural venues challenge the norm\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director at National Theatre Wales, Thiarai is only the second woman, and the first Asian director to lead one of Britain\u2019s national theatre companies. Previously she transformed Doncaster\u2019s cultural scene at the helm of new theatre Cast and has led some of Britain\u2019s key theatre venues and producing companies.</strong></p> <p>When I want to be nourished I go to <a href=\"http://www.ysp.co.uk/\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>. It\u2019s a place for contemplation and inspiration \u2013 you never quite know what you\u2019re going to see. Even the most permanent works can shed new light just because the weather looks different or your walk to it has been from somewhere else. It\u2019s calming to be in nature in that way, to see art in the context of the real world.</p> <p>My favourite cultural venues challenge the norm or at least question it, all in different ways. It\u2019s wonderful to go to a big mainstream venue, but it\u2019s a very different experience encountering the new, the rough and ready. What I find interesting is exploring how we refresh our artform, how we find collisions between things rather than specifying this is theatre, this is dance, this is music. <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/\">Theatre in the Mill</a> at Bradford University was very important to me when I was a student there. I saw some extraordinary things. Ruth Mackenzie ran it then and her programme was very inspiring \u2013 shows from the very young <a href=\"http://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/\">Phoenix Dance</a> and the early work of <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/history/companies/gay-sweatshop/\">Gay Sweatshop</a>. She became a real influence. And the venue continues to have work that is surprising and new and emerging. It\u2019s a bit like the <a href=\"http://www.slunglow.org/what-is-the-hub/\">Hub in Leeds</a>, a space that artists use in different ways, often to present work in its early stages. A nice creative conversation goes along with the presenting of work there and I really love that. I\u2019m also a big admirer of <a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\">Contact in Manchester</a>. It\u2019s refreshing to hang out in a venue with so much energy and such a commitment to young people.</p> <p>I\u2019ve recently moved to Cardiff so I\u2019m still discovering lots of places there. It\u2019s got a real vibrancy. A cafe called <a href=\"http://milgicardiff.com/\">Milgi</a> does healthy food and juices and is a lovely place to hang out, with great music. Waterloo Tea in Wyndham Arcade is wonderful and there\u2019s a restaurant called the <a href=\"http://purplepoppadom.com/menu/\">Purple Poppadom</a> \u2013 I love the name, but also it does the most delicious food.</p> <p>I like watching <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks\">TED talks</a> to come across a wide variety of ideas, to connect with the world from different perspectives. They\u2019re short and snappy and you can digest them on the move. The famous <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity\">Ken Robinson talk</a> about creativity and schools is joyous to watch because he explains things brilliantly and it\u2019s a masterclass in how to present ideas.</p> <p>The four questions I always try to ask about new work or projects are: why this, why now, why here and who for? They\u2019re also the questions I ask when I\u2019m watching other people\u2019s things. It feels like how is a separate question once you\u2019ve worked out the why.</p> <p><strong>Best social media </strong>I dip into Twitter a lot. My favourite tweets are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemnsissay?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lemn Sissay\u2019s poems</a>, especially in the mornings. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a69f905b82b021e651fedc046a08921db33f8227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69f905b82b021e651fedc046a08921db33f8227/0_247_5284_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madani Younis, right, with a fellow patron of west London restaurant Ochi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You never know who you are going to meet\u2019: Madani Younis, right, with a fellow patron of west London restaurant Ochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Madani Younis: \u2018I\u2019m trying to reveal what this moment means in our cultural history\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Artistic director at the world-renowned new writing theatre based in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London, and former head of Freedom Studios theatre company in Bradford. When Younis accepted the Bush role in 2012 he became London\u2019s first non\u2011white artistic director.</strong></p> <p>This will probably come as a big surprise, but I\u2019m a huge fan of mixed martial arts, otherwise known as cage fighting, which is an unfortunate expression. The female fighters in mixed martial arts are the most exciting part of the sport. I watched boxing as a kid and found it a bit brutal, but reading Ernest Hemingway made me appreciate it and now mixed martial arts, in a very different way. He writes about it as a balletic art. For him, it\u2019s about the human condition: you enter the ring and you take your destiny, your dreams, with you. Last year, I directed a boxing play entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/29/the-royale-review-bush-theatre-powerful-punch\"><em>The Royale</em></a>, about Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight boxing champion of the world. I\u2019ve waited my whole career to direct a sports play. So, yes, I love mixed martial arts and I love the <a href=\"http://www.mmafighting.com/\">mmafighting.com</a> app.</p> <p>My mother has been a huge influence on me. She introduced me to the writers who really inspired me early on, people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\">James Baldwin</a>, Derek Walcott, Ralph Ellison, Bell Hooks. When I read Derek Walcott\u2019s play <em>Dream on Monkey Mountain</em>, aged 16, it just blew my mind. In the same way, reading Baldwin writing about Harlem in the 60s, there was a resonance: I thought, yes, I know what that feels like.</p> <p>I always loved words. I think it was only when I was about 17 that I really fell in love with theatre: I went to the Old Red Lion in Islington, north London, and saw a play about the Troubles in Northern Ireland by Seamus Finnegan. That was the moment. I felt that that artistic communion couldn\u2019t be replicated in any other medium.</p> <p>These days, going to a monthly spoken-word night at the Forge in Camden, called <a href=\"http://www.outspokenldn.com/outspokenlive/\">Out-Spoken</a>, makes me feel like I did when I was 17. I\u2019ve seen some amazing artists there and there\u2019s no censorship, no notes, no separation between me and the artist on stage \u2013 just words from their mouth to your ears, unadulterated. It\u2019s a beautiful kind of communion. Out-Spoken is run by the artist Anthony Anaxagorou and the venue only seats about 100-120 people, but it\u2019s always a great mix of people \u2013 City types, younger men and women.</p> <p>I\u2019m also a huge fan of the <a href=\"http://bcaheritage.tumblr.com/\">Black Cultural Archives</a> in Brixton. It\u2019s a beautifully conceived building. For me, it holds up against any of our other great museums and galleries in the city; I always take visitors there. It\u2019s a reminder of a great lineage of men and women and the impact they\u2019ve had on both our city and our sense of being as a country.</p> <p>There\u2019s a West Indian restaurant/takeaway in Uxbridge Road called <a href=\"http://www.ochitakeaway.co.uk/\">Ochi</a> that I love because it\u2019s been there probably since the 60s/70s and it\u2019s an absolute staple of the community in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Because of the music venues in the area, such as the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, now known as the O2, Ochi has this really inspiring wall of fame, with shots of people that have been there to eat, like Bob Marley, Amy Winehouse and Lauryn Hill. The food is amazing and it\u2019s a beautiful place to hang out; you never know who you are going to meet or what you\u2019re going to end up talking about. The other place I like is <a href=\"http://www.bushhalldining.co.uk/\">Bush Hall Dining Rooms</a>, an independent restaurant in Uxbridge Road. The food is really great and it has a cool vibe.</p> <p>The questions I always ask about new ideas are: what is it that this piece is trying to reveal about the world? And: from what vantage point are they trying to do that? More specifically, as a new writing theatre in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, one of London\u2019s most diverse areas, I always ask: how does this speak to London today? In a way I\u2019m trying to reveal \u2013 not in a touristy way \u2013 what this moment means in our cultural history, however uncomfortable or inspiring. If Charles Dickens were alive now, this version of London would be amazing to him.</p> <p><strong>My favourite websites</strong> <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/\">Media Diversified</a> gives me another version of the news. It\u2019s a response to the lack of black and minority ethnic journalists writing in our mainstream papers and it covers news, culture, sport and comment. It\u2019s great seeing young journalists quickly develop their voice in that space. I\u2019ve also really been taken by Vice News in the two years since it launched, particularly its global perspective and the level of investigative journalism.</p> <p><strong>Unmissable TV </strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80018294\"><em>Daredevil</em></a><em> </em>on Netflix. It\u2019s based on a Marvel comic book and the writing is really muscular. The other one is <em>House of Cards</em>; my wife and I are addicted to it. What an amazing insight into what politics really is all about. <strong>IC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90a98b2af9fceaed2214c67b0a9f506b6ca56be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90a98b2af9fceaed2214c67b0a9f506b6ca56be8/609_567_2391_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Baker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every night I set a new tune to wake me up\u2019: Tom Baker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolina Faruolo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tom Baker: \u2018Being in a teenage band gave me a great foundation\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Founder of </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/13/field-day-festival-review-skepta-deerhunter-james-blake-pj-harvey\"><strong>Field Day</strong></a><strong> festival in east London and the live music booking agency Eat Your Own Ears, Baker is often described as London\u2019s best promoter.

It\u2019s an old working men\u2019s club with a great sound system.

I\u2019ve seen all the obvious ones. I\u2019ve been really enjoying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders\"><em>Peaky Blinders</em></a> recently.</p> <p>I was five when I went to my first Glastonbury with my parents and then I went every year until I was 12. I started going again when I was 17 with friends. It\u2019s such a magical place I think it definitely inspired me. As a teenager, I was in a band and just embracing so much music \u2013 everything from Miles Davis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/dec/24/miles-davis-bitches-brew\"><em>Bitches Brew</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung\">Neil Young </a>to minimal classical music. It was all very physical \u2013 sharing CDs, you\u2019d work your way through a pile of 10 CDs, whole albums, not just a single track. That gave me a great foundation. I absorbed a lot.</p> <p><strong>I normally have my best ideas... </strong>When I\u2019m at an event and think, oh that\u2019s a good way to do it or I\u2019ll wake up the next day and suddenly, ahhh, how about that? <strong>IC</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the beginning, mythology told stories about events or experiences that would otherwise leave us mystified \u2013 how the world was created, what happens after we die. The first myths were mostly optimistic fictions, but our ancestors longed to believe in them: that\u2019s how religion established its hold.</p> <p>The original myth-makers expected us to take literally God\u2019s fabulations about heaven and hell and to obey his bullying commandments. Today, less credulous, we think religion itself is a myth, by which we mean a consoling lie. In common usage, \u201cmyth\u201d is at best the word we use to refer to amusingly preposterous urban legends \u2013 tales about <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/critters/lurkers/gator.asp\" title=\"\">albino alligators in the Manhattan sewers</a> or the Holy Grail\u2019s hiding place under the floor of a Paris shopping mall.</p> <p>In our society, it is publicists, spin doctors and advertisers who devise the myths. Sometimes the aim is to exalt an imperfect human being: celebrities and even politicians need to possess \u201ccharisma\u201d, a word that originally vouched for a believer\u2019s direct contact with a divine source. Myth also invests manufactured objects with a supernatural grace or glory. In the 1950s, Citro\u00ebn\u2019s DS car came to be known as the D\u00e9esse \u2013 a goddess of sleek metal and smooth leather, so curvaceously aerodynamic that it seemed, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/12/roland-barthes-happy-100th-birthday-centenary-birth\" title=\"\">Roland Barthes\u2019s</a> description in <em>Mythologies</em>, to have \u201cdescended from the sky\u201d, not driven up the highway.

Or could the plane be mimicking the athletic mystique of the shoe? On its white, shiny fuselage, the proud slogan UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is underlined by a blue stripe, a counterpart to the Nike flash, which pays streamlined homage to the Greek goddess of victory. More than a means of transport, Air Force One is a propaganda tool, and its effectiveness&#xa0;depends on the implied presence of a deity.</p> <p>So long as the doctrine of American isolation prevailed, the presidency was a desk job, tethered to Washington DC. But when the US acquired global power after 1945, the president took to the air, travelling in a plane that has come to represent the ubiquity and intimidating might of this ultimate empire. Equipped with surveillance systems that eavesdrop on the lowly world it overflies, allegedly able to fire missiles and to withstand a nuclear blast, Air Force One is evidence of dominance. Even if we don\u2019t accept American superiority, we bow down before American immensity: the customised 747 currently in use is as tall as a six-storey building and as long as a football field.</p> <p>On the ground, the president travels in a black Cadillac nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d, ready to repel assailants with rocket-propelled grenades, pump-action shotguns and tear-gas cannon. Soaring aloft, he exchanges a beast for a bird: Air Force One is America with wings, a mechanised version of the beaked, pinioned eagle \u2013 a predator that clutches in its claws twin bundles of peacemaking olive branches and spiky, militarised arrows \u2013 that appears on the country\u2019s Great Seal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56a2c208567b263cdd19c1ae016a87644b2bfc8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56a2c208567b263cdd19c1ae016a87644b2bfc8a/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first President Bush, who took delivery of the current double-decker Air Force One to replace the humbler 707 he inherited from Ronald Reagan, remarked that it embodies America\u2019s \u201cmajesty\u201d. A Freudian slip, surely \u2013 republics should be unmajestic and the USA was meant to be the paradise of the common man \u2013 but not inaccurate. Air Force One is a triumphal chariot, a steroid-boosted equivalent to the golden coaches and slow-motion Bentleys in which the Queen sedately trundles along. For extra effect, Lyndon Johnson installed a hydraulic \u201cking chair\u201d on board his Air Force One, which enabled him to hover in midair as he harangued the congressmen he invited into his cabin.</p> <p>Like the country whose head of state it carries, Air Force One is exceptional \u2013 and exceptions are always made for it by air-traffic controllers, who suspend other operations to give it instant clearance. The numeral in the plane\u2019s call sign is exclusive, monopolistic, not the inception of a series; it brags of being one of a kind, rather than a first among equals. In fact that solitary integer is misleading: here is the first of the myth\u2019s little fibs. Air Force One has a duplicate that, like the vice-president, is a useful safeguard against mishaps. But to preserve the myth of American primacy, the second plane is never referred to as Air Force Two and whichever of them carries the incumbent becomes Air Force One for the duration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nuclear-football-donald-trump\">The \u2018nuclear football\u2019 - the deadly briefcase that never leaves the president\u2019s side</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George W Bush may be the only president to have used both planes on a single journey. At Thanksgiving in 2003, he flew to Baghdad, where he spent a couple of hours posing for photographs as he dished out portions of festive turkey to the troops who were fighting his war. To ensure that the trip remained secret, he retreated to his ranch in Texas for the holiday, then travelled back to Washington on the first Air Force One \u2013 though it couldn\u2019t officially be called that because he was pretending not to be on board: the trip was logged as routine maintenance. The second plane was waiting in a hangar, fuelled and provisioned for the onward flight to Iraq. With a baseball cap as his camouflage, Bush entered it by the back stairs, which no president ever uses. That skulking between planes was an odd manoeuvre, very unlike his customary strutting. Bush was playing hide and seek with his twin Air Force Ones, and duplication hints at duplicity, a cultivation of double meanings that dodges, as myth always does, between truth and falsehood.</p> <p>The plane borrows America\u2019s attributes \u2013 its size, its might, its technological supremacy \u2013 but can any president dare borrow those attributes from the plane? Although Americans proverbially describe their nation\u2019s CEO as \u201cthe most powerful man in the world\u201d, it\u2019s a hollow boast, since the only way of making that power manifest is by opening the suitcase of nuclear codes chained to the arm of the military aide who accompanies the president everywhere. Power is meaningless unless it\u2019s displayed, enacted: hence Vladimir Putin\u2019s bare-chested preening or his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/putin-judo-book-russian-schoolchildren\" title=\"\">sessions of bone-crushing judo</a>.

In 1975 in rainy Salzburg the notoriously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlz0he9rtKw\" title=\"\">clumsy Gerald Ford slipped on the wet bottom step</a> as he deplaned and tumbled on to the tarmac, forcing his wife to shield him with an umbrella as an official tugged him upright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5040e31af859e96dd78138e9283ceb085642be6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5040e31af859e96dd78138e9283ceb085642be6f/0_0_3513_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For once avoiding risks, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination last year he relied on a gilded escalator in his New York headquarters to deposit him in the lobby where the photographers were gathered. Stairs require effort, which may be unavailing or self-defeating; an escalator \u2013 or so Trump hoped \u2013 allowed him to waft down smoothly from on high like a golden-maned angel of deliverance.</p> <p>In one respect, America\u2019s aeronautical myth has to wheedle its way around a flagrant contradiction: Air Force One carries the commander-in-chief, but he is not in command of the plane. When Barack Obama came on board for the first time, he shook the hand of the pilot and complimented him for looking the part, \u201clike Sam Shepard in <em>The Right Stuff</em>\u201d. In the film of Tom Wolfe\u2019s book about Nasa\u2019s astronauts, Shepard as Chuck Yeager breaks the sound barrier while remaining laconic, nonchalant, metaphorically down to earth. Actually, the pilot who flies Air Force One is nicknamed Top Gun during his tenure in the cockpit; it\u2019s lucky that Obama was greeted by a laidback Shepard lookalike rather than a clone of Tom Cruise, who played the hepped-up hotshot naval aviator known as Maverick in Tony Scott\u2019s film <em>Top Gun</em>.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s charmingly deferential remark joked about his own unfitness \u2013 physically at least \u2013 for the office. Americans want their head of state to be both a warlord and a saviour and these impossible expectations have turned the presidency into a myth \u2013 a starring role for an action hero rather than an exhaustingly intricate job for a fixer schooled in the art of compromise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYnVOIfNiU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jPYnVOIfNiU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYnVOIfNiU\">Watch Harrison Ford as President James Marshall in the 1997 film Air Force One.<br></a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump, when asked last December which president he most admires, did not pay the usual unctuous tribute to Lincoln, Kennedy or Reagan, but said that his role model was James Marshall. He was referring, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/12/12/donald-trump-harrison-ford-and-the-pre-911-politics-of-air-force-one/#3aa68d0651ff\" title=\"\">he explained, to \u201cHarrison Ford on the plane\u201d</a>: in Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s 1997 film <em>Air Force One</em>, Ford plays a president whose name suggests martial prowess as well as anticipating the air marshals who, after 9/11, began to travel on civilian flights, weapons at the ready. Marshall\u2019s backstory alludes to his time piloting combat choppers in Vietnam, when he received the Medal of Honor for valour in battle from one of his predecessors. He is therefore well prepared to beat up or gun down the terrorists from Kazakhstan who take over Air Force One after a summit meeting in Moscow; in an emergency he can even fly the plane himself.</p> <p>Harrison Ford\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s accolade was scornful, sad and a little anxious. \u201cDonald,\u201d he groaned, \u201cit was a movie! It\u2019s not like this in real life \u2013 but how would you know?\u201d Undeterred by protests about his infringement of copyright, Trump uses Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s embattled but rousingly brassy music from the film to underscore his campaign appearances, and when he arrived in Cleveland for the Republican convention in July he was greeted by the fanfares that accompany Ford\u2019s gung-ho bouts of fisticuffs with the hijackers. All he did was step out of his name-tagged helicopter, but Goldsmith\u2019s theme lent that act an air of unearned grandiosity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1ac364548256b0c4fbed012afd4ecb2446567be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ac364548256b0c4fbed012afd4ecb2446567be/0_0_1227_1877/654.jpg\" alt=\"The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Mcneely/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump\u2019s enthusiasm is easy to understand: as <em>Air Force One </em>begins, Marshall plays the kind of president any of us might fancy being, a man for whom the executive branch and its perks are a licence to daydream. Returning to the airport in wintry Moscow, he suggests a whimsical detour on the way home: \u201cLet\u2019s go to Barbados.\u201d Here, in theory, is true power, unhindered by responsibility; the plane is a magic carpet. But once he forfeits control of Air Force One, Marshall is suddenly disempowered. Hiding from the terrorists in the luggage compartment, he finds a mobile phone with which he tries to alert the cabinet to his plight. He has to go through the White House switchboard and when he identifies himself to the woman on duty she refuses to put him through because he sounds like a crackpot fantasist. That, a year ago, is how everyone viewed Trump; real life, we now know, is not quite as reasonable or as immune to delusion as Harrison Ford hoped.</p> <p>Whatever frenzy or folly it is that impels Trump, his motive can hardly be the desire to survey the world from inside Air Force One. He already has a plane, a secondhand 757 branded with his surname along its fuselage and his cross-country trips in it have made him look prematurely presidential. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, began her campaign in April 2015 with a road trip, a reprise of the mythically intrepid expeditions of the pioneers in their horsedrawn wagons: she travelled from New York to Iowa in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/hillary-clinton-iowa-road-trip-scooby-doo-van\" title=\"\">a chauffeured and prudently armoured Chevrolet camper, </a>emerging to be photographed at fast-food outlets along the way.</p> <p>Days after she set out, Obama teased Hillary\u2019s mock-modesty at a dinner for White House correspondents. Reflecting on the economy\u2019s ups and downs, he said: \u201cI have a friend who used to make millions a year. Now she\u2019s living out of a van in Iowa.\u201d But this July he invited Hillary back on to Air Force One to fly with him to an electoral rally in North Carolina. In a tweet, Trump railed against this partisan misuse of the plane and claimed that Hillary\u2019s free trip cost taxpayers half a million dollars. Obama\u2019s gesture indeed had a solemn constitutional significance. Never before had an incumbent offered a ride to a candidate for the succession who wasn\u2019t already the vice-president; it meant, as one commentator pointed out, that Obama was \u201cready to hand over the keys to Air Force One\u201d. Perhaps that transfer should be part of the ceremony at the inauguration next January.</p> <p>Guarded by snipers and sniffer dogs in a hangar that is described as a \u201csanctuary\u201d, debarred to anyone without security clearance, Air Force One is a symptom of the privileged exclusivity that Trump the populist pretends to despise. With his customary shrewdness, he has maintained an advantage by symbolically opening his private jet to all, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74\" title=\"\">a video tour posted on YouTube.</a></p> <p>As hostess \u2013 a throwback to the days when flight attendants were described that way \u2013 he has appointed Amanda Miller, his gatekeeper in the reality show <em>The Apprentice</em>. (She first came to Trump\u2019s attention as a 15-year-old waitress at one of his golf clubs and after she graduated from college with a degree in fashion merchandising he hired her as a corporate marketer.) With one hand propped on her hip like a starlet posing on a red carpet, Miller purringly extols the plane\u2019s luxuries: seat belts plated in 24-carat gold, head rests on which the Trump family\u2019s spurious crest is embroidered, silk-clad walls for the boss\u2019s bedroom, Ultrasuede ceiling panels, mahogany cabinets, a shower cubicle. We are supposed to slaver enviously at this ostentation; if we don\u2019t, we condemn ourselves as losers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UZq3iCn2y74?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a guided tour of Donald Trump\u2019s 757.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s plane does without the emergency medical facilities secreted on Air Force One, which has an operating table discreetly stowed in a wall like a fold-up bed. Instead, Miller recommends a bouncy mohair divan (she pronounces it \u201cdive-in\u201d) in the guest bedroom. To conclude the tour she curls up on a sofa, tosses gobbets of popcorn into her mouth and relaxes with a film from Trump\u2019s on-board <em>cin\u00e9math\u00e8que</em> of a thousand movies. We hear only noises \u2013 a burst of gunfire and the clatter of broken glass: she could be watching Harrison Ford fight back against the hijackers in Petersen\u2019s <em>Air Force One</em>.</p> <p>That would not be my choice for in-flight entertainment, since the film\u2019s climax is a plane crash. With failing engines, ruptured fuel tanks and a damaged rudder, Air Force One finally lunges into the Caspian Sea and breaks apart; just in time, Ford is safely yanked on to a hovering Hercules turboprop, which, as its pilot beamingly announces while the theme appropriated by Trump blares out one last time, at once becomes Air Force One. This is how the succession works in the supposedly unmonarchical United States: the plane is dead, long live the plane.</p> <p>Obama, asked in 2012 what he might miss if he weren\u2019t re-elected, said: \u201cThe plane is really nice, it really is. It\u2019s a great plane.\u201d Now that he\u2019ll soon lose his right to it, he must dread having to take commercial flights again \u2013 a crash landing for the executive ego. Of course there are consolation prizes. When Bill Clinton left the White House, he swapped Air Force One for an aerial pleasure palace, a Boeing 757 owned by his fun-loving billionaire buddy Ron Burkle, a venture capitalist who, according to <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/bill-clinton-health-trump-and-hillary\" title=\"\">a recent article in <em>GQ,</em></a> paid Clinton $15m for his schmoozy aid in recruiting international clients; the in-flight services available on Burkle\u2019s jolly jet prompted the tycoon\u2019s employees to call it \u201cAir Fuck One\u201d. Absolute power, as Trump understands, can mean uninhibited self-indulgence.</p> <p>As Americans prepare to elect another president, a new presidential plane is on order. Last year, the air force secretary, Deborah Lee James, announced that the Boeing VC25-A currently in use would be replaced by a Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, which \u201cwhen fully missionised\u2026 will meet the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission, while reflecting the office of the president of the United States of America consistent with the national public interest\u201d.</p> <p>That sentence, which mixes aggression with evangelism by placing an execution between two missions, packs in all the contradictions of the myth that sustains the country and supplies its Messiah-like sense of purpose. But will a technological upgrade to the plane solve the problems of the presidency, which, thanks to props like Air Force One, has an aura of insuperable power, even though in practice it is limited or even enfeebled by partisan feuds and the rapid disillusionment of an electorate that wants its wishes instantly&#xa0;gratified?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2d96c3bbfb0b03a121bcde35f4d8cb7a1948d0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2d96c3bbfb0b03a121bcde35f4d8cb7a1948d0a/0_0_2009_2700/744.jpg\" alt=\"George W.

That\u2019s a military precaution, a response to the prospect of nuclear war or some other annihilating catastrophe on the ground. In the first <em>Independence Day</em> film, an extraterrestrial death ray incinerates the White House; Bill Pullman, playing President Whitmore, escapes in Air Force One, suits up as a fighter pilot at a base in Nevada a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj16vfbsM9A\" title=\"\">nd leads an attack to wipe out the aliens</a>. Reality flails and flounders, unable to match the myth. After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, President Bush spent the rest of the day flying to and fro between Florida and Nebraska in a sky that had been emptied of all other traffic. Secure in the \u201cmobile command centre\u201d of Air Force One, he issued no coherent commands, later shiftily explaining that he remained aloft because he didn\u2019t want to give \u201cthe bad guys\u201d the satisfaction of killing him. Air Force One keeps the president out of harm\u2019s way, but it also ensures that he remains out of touch. The shining seas and purple mountains celebrated in the patriotic hymn are far below and actual Americans remain invisible.</p> <p>\u201cThe presidential aircraft,\u201d James insisted, \u201cis one of the most visible symbols of the United States at home and abroad.\u201d True, but a plane is an odd or ominous symbol for a country, which surely consists of terrain, not airspace. Thunderous, scarily propulsive, bristling with weaponry, Air Force One encourages effusions of the wrong kind about American greatness; what\u2019s worse is that Petersen\u2019s film has made it an arena for crazed feats of derring-do by a superhero \u2013 or, with luck, by a superheroine in a nattily tailored trouser suit. The overlapping of politics and fiction is absurd, but that\u2019s no reason not to find it alarming. The very irrationality of myth makes it irresistible in a time of unease or trauma like the present: we are all at risk of being blown away by the rhetorical jet exhaust that Air Force One leaves behind it.</p> <p><em>Peter Conrad\u2019s Mythomania: Tales of Our Times, from Apple to Isis, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson next month. </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mythomania.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for the special price of \u00a315.94</em></a></p>",

The nine young Bushmen, or San, had been hunting antelope to feed their families, when the chopper flew towards them.</p> <p>There was a burst of gunfire from the air and the young men dropped their meat and skins and fled. Largely through luck, no one was hit, but within minutes armed troops arrived in a jeep and the nine were arrested, stripped naked, beaten and then detained for several days for poaching in a nature reserve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/28/reindeer-conservation-threatens-ruination-mongolia-dukha\">'We have nothing but our reindeer': conservation threatens ruination for Mongolia's Dukha | Marine Gauthier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Welcome to 21st-century life in the vast Central Kalahari game park, an ancient hunting ground for the San, but now off-limits to the people who forged their history there. The brutal incident took place last week, just days after Botswana\u2019s wildlife minister Tshekedi Khama, the brother of President Ian Khama, announced a shoot-on-sight policy on poachers.</p> <p>Khama claims the policy, which is supported by conservation groups, will deter poaching and the illegal wildlife trade, which is widely seen by Europe and the US as disastrous for biodiversity. But there are no rare or endangered species such as elephants or rhinos in the areas where the bushmen hunt. Sending a<strong> </strong>helicopter gunship and armed guards to arraign the hunters looks rather like an escalation of the low-grade war that Botswana has waged for years on one of the most vulnerable indigenous groups in the world.</p> <p>For the past 20 years, the San have been systematically stripped of their homes, land and culture. In a series of heavy-handed evictions, houses have been burned, schools and health centres closed, and water supplies cut off. Now these people live, dispossessed, on the edge of the huge game park, forbidden to hunt in or enter the land they have lived on sustainably for centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1360d8de5c5de45ffd201bf46cb1a620a0237d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1360d8de5c5de45ffd201bf46cb1a620a0237d80/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San men preparing for hunting in the Living Museum of the Ju?Hoansi-San, Grashoek, NamibiaG1C8X4 San men preparing for hunting in the Living Museum of the Ju?Hoansi-San, Grashoek, Namibia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San men preparing for hunting in Grashoek, Namibia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, one of the largest diamond mines in the world has been allowed to open in the park, and wealthy big game hunters from abroad are welcomed to newly constructed state-of-the-art game lodges. Is this conservation, or something more akin to bullying of the weak and exploitation of the land in the interests of the powerful?</p> <p>What has happened in Botswana is happening all over the world, according to an increasingly vocal group of campaigners, academics and environmentalists. They claim that indigenous peoples are being appallingly treated and abused, all in the name of a conservation philosophy that carries a heavy human cost. In order to make room for wildlife, tourism and industry, governments are using conservation as a pretext to drive the world\u2019s most endangered peoples away from the lands and animals they have lived with for generations.</p> <p>This week, the issue will be raised in Hawaii at the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s congress. \u201cThe world\u2019s most vulnerable people are paying the price for today\u2019s conservation,\u201d says Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. She has already sounded the alarm at the UN over the impact that conservation is having on tribal peoples in Kenya, Uganda, Bangladesh, Namibia, Botswana, Ethiopia, South Africa, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador.</p> <p>Tauli-Corpuz will tell the congress that nature conservation is not working for people or for wildlife. \u201cHouses are still being burned down, and people are being displaced violently. Protected areas continue to expand, yet threats against them are also increasing,\u201d she will say. Vulnerable tribal peoples are being removed by force from India\u2019s tiger reserves and forests; tribal groups such as the Ogiek and Sengwer, the San, Maasai and Baka are being forced out of forests and wildlife-rich plains in Africa; and from Thailand to Ecuador, Cameroon to Bangladesh, ethnic groups are being dispossessed in the name of protecting nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56653831c0dce42e0c4d2b1992faab954fcf6fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56653831c0dce42e0c4d2b1992faab954fcf6fd4/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Group of Baka pygmy women\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Group of Baka pygmy women</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is happening all over Asia and Africa. We can agree with the goals of conservation, but if these protected areas are then being overrun by mining companies, what is the point of conservation?\u201d Tauli-Corpuz said.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, human rights groups claim, governments are accessing wealthy conservation groups based in the US and Europe to take advantage of the billions of pounds of conservation money being offered by global banks, northern governments and foundations for climate change and biodiversity protection. The international money duly flows in, but recipient governments are not abiding by international laws to protect communities.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments like conservation because there is a lot of money in it. It brings money from the Global Environment Facility and elsewhere. But when your economic priority is to generate money from conservation, you want to get rid of people from these protected areas. That is what is now happening,\u201d Tauli-Corpuz told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Most of the world\u2019s 6,000 national parks and 100,000 protected places have been created by the removal of tribal peoples. Hundreds more parks are being created every year as countries commit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-united-nations\">meeting the UN\u2019s goal</a> to protect 17% of land by 2020. And the human toll is rising accordingly. \u201cEviction numbers are declining,\u201d says Rosaleen Duffy, a political ecologist at Sheffield University. \u201cThere are still large-scale, violent evictions, generally in national parks, but they are less common now. But much more common is the everyday form of exclusion [of tribal groups] which makes it impossible for anyone to live in protected areas.\u201d</p> <p>Gonzalo Oviedo is head of social policy at the IUCN. He told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cConservation has changed a lot. Governments are more likely now to restrict the rights of people who live in protected areas. They may ban hunting, or farming, the cutting down of trees or fishing. The effect is to force people to move.</p> <p>\u201cThey are more careful now about evictions. But in practice they are reducing access to resources and reducing people\u2019s ability to live in protected areas. People in reserves may not be allowed to do anything. They are often poorer than they were before, and the impact can be bigger than if they are moved out,\u201d said Oviedo.</p> <p>Simon Counsell, director of the UK\u2019s Rainforest Foundation, agrees: \u201cMuch conservation is still in the mindset of being in opposition to people. The \u2018conservation v people\u2019 approach to protecting wildlife has worsened the lives of thousands of native people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f64d8a685f861ff503481ff267b60a92f6234f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f64d8a685f861ff503481ff267b60a92f6234f9/0_168_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman from the San tribe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman from the San tribe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foundation this year documented dozens of cases of human rights abuses in central Africa, where up to $500m has been spent in the last decade by the US, EU and other western donors to protect the world\u2019s second largest swath of rainforest.</p> <p>The irony is that \u201canti-people\u201d conservation doesn\u2019t appear to be having a beneficial effect on wildlife and may in fact be self-defeating. Analysis this year of 34 large protected areas in Congo DRC, Cameroon, Gabon, the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo found that conservation had displaced villages and led to conflict and multiple human rights abuses \u2013 and that animals including elephants, gorillas and chimps were still declining at alarming rates anyway.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/news/november-2014/are-national-parks-in-the-congo-basin-rainforest-failing-biodiversity-and-people\">Conservation is clearly not working</a>,\u201d said Counsell. \u201cDespite billions of dollars being poured into protected areas over this period and in spite of legally binding commitments to respect people\u2019s rights, there was evidence that local indigenous and local communities across the world continue to pay a heavy price for protected areas,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cA new model of saving nature is urgently needed because the anti-people agenda now being practised by many countries is not working and undermines attempts to protect nature. Not only is the present anti-people model which is being practised unjust. It marginalises the very people who have protected forests for millennia and who represent one of our best hopes for doing so in the future.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/04/life-for-the-baka-pygmies-of-central-african-republic\">Life for the Baka Pygmies of Central African Republic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, tension is mounting between human rights groups who seek to protect people and conservationists who are paid to effectively run protected areas for government. The ill-feeling came to a head this year when the WWF was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/wwf-accused-of-facilitating-human-rights-abuses-of-tribal-people-in-cameroon\">accused by tribal defence group Survival International</a> of funding and logistically aiding anti-poaching eco-guards in Equatorial Africa. The guards were allegedly victimising pygmy groups in the region.</p> <p>According to a 228-page complaint made to the OECD, the Baka people in Cameroon had been forbidden to enter many of their traditional hunting areas, despite the fact that their hunting is reported to have minimal impact on the environment.</p> <p>The WWF responded that it provides human rights training for the eco-guards, and that it was working in a complex area overrun with military groups. Adjudication by the OECD on that row is expected shortly.</p> <p>According to Duffy: \u201cSome groups are in danger of becoming complicit in government wrongdoing. They rely on national governments to allow access. Some have very significant links with corporates and corporate sponsorship, and tend not to be very critical of what is going on. It can be difficult for them to talk out of turn. Some facilitate the process.\u201d</p> <p>The IUCN\u2019s Gonzalez believes conservation groups and western governments need to monitor what is happening on the ground far more closely. \u201cA lot has changed in the big groups but there is still a lot to be done. Countries often impose no conditions on money for conservation. EU countries give money but do not have sufficient safeguards on how it is used. They don\u2019t care what is going on. But multilateral groups like the World Bank have social safeguards and are more careful now. Why don\u2019t governments have the same safeguards? Foundations and private money also do not care much about the impact of their spending,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Kristen Walker at Conservation international\u2019s Policy Center for Environment and Peace, the big conservation groups are attempting to adapt to often difficult dilemmas and relationships. \u201cWe can find ourselves in tricky situations. We are invited guests in countries, but we also try to advocate and support communities, too. There are countries we have pulled out of because we felt we could not work there, and in some places people expect us to be more outspoken advocates.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments sometimes look at the short term. We have adopted a rights-based approach and we are guided by an indigenous advice group. There has been a lot of change in conservation in 10 years. But how do you make sure governments are not shortsighted? How do you make sure communities are recognised? These are challenges,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The lobby in favour of returning more protected land to the original \u201cowners\u201d is growing. <a href=\"http://blog.cifor.org/3918/including-indigenous-peoples-and-traditional-knowledge-in-forest-management-key-to-redd-success?fnl=en\">Studies by the Centre for International Forestry Research</a> and the World Bank have found that when traditional communities are given full legal rights to their land, they protect the environment efficiently and cheaply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00483b1346df443a29bdea458b5d31d0af61666f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00483b1346df443a29bdea458b5d31d0af61666f/0_114_3425_2055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apatani Village, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apatani Village, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AGF/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn India, tribal peoples face arrest and beatings, harassment, threats and trickery and feel forced to \u2018agree\u2019 to leave their forest homes. But the evidence proves that tribal peoples are better at looking after their environment than anyone else\u201d, says Sophie Grig of Survival.</p> <p>\u201cIn the BRT tiger reserve in southern India where tribal people have been allowed to stay, tiger numbers have increased at above the national average. There is no reason to believe that evicting tribes helps tigers. In fact, it\u2019s harming conservation.\u201d</p> <p>In Hawaii this week, Tauli-Corpuz will make the same argument. She will tell delegates that indigenous-owned lands are effective at resisting deforestation in Brazil; that in Namibia, community-based wildlife management has resulted in significant growth in wildlife populations; and in the US and Australia, indigenous peoples manage protected areas effectively. \u201cStudies have demonstrated that the territories of indigenous peoples who have been given land rights have been significantly better conserved than the adjacent lands\u201d.</p> <p>Leading environmentalists and human rights advocates, including Noam Chomsky, Jonathon Porritt and Ghillean Prance, agree. Last year they appealed to conservationists to protect endangered tribes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/tribal-peoples-crucial-role-in-global-conservation\">In a letter to the <em>Guardian</em>,</a> they stated: \u201cTribal peoples have managed their lands sustainably for generations. Forcibly removing them usually results in environmental damage. Such removals are a violation of human rights. The cheapest and quickest way to conserve areas of high biodiversity is to respect tribal peoples\u2019 rights. The world can no longer afford a conservation model that destroys tribal peoples: it damages human diversity as well as the environment.\u201d</p> <p>The argument is still a long way from being won. But could 2016 be the year that some of the world\u2019s most ancient tribes began to return to the land of their ancestors?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"829fa0c789ab4f39299f19bacb71ced2b393ac84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/829fa0c789ab4f39299f19bacb71ced2b393ac84/11_229_5710_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maasai warriors wearing brightly coloured clothing perform traditional dance, Ngorongoro Crater Conservation Area Tanzania\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maasai warriors</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Design Pics Inc/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7ef884e4d5cd12f59c07be57a9f9569cb22bf3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ef884e4d5cd12f59c07be57a9f9569cb22bf3c5/0_123_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baka pymy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baka pymy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c557fb5b6587503462394e082da51999af64857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c557fb5b6587503462394e082da51999af64857/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bushmen girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bushmen girl</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Fern?ndez/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8ad3836fb8f7639defe49b1b7bda07199c02a6b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ad3836fb8f7639defe49b1b7bda07199c02a6b4/0_91_5459_3275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duhkha\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duhkha</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>MAASAI </h2> <p>Thousands of pastoralist Maasai groups in Tanzania have been evicted from a 1,500 sq km area close to the Serengeti, Maasai Mara and Ngorongoro national parks. The government has tried to remove them to establish exclusive game-hunting in the area. In 2009, a mass eviction left more than 200 homes burned and 3,000 people homeless.</p> <h2>BAIGA </h2> <p>Thousands of these tribespeople in India are being forcibly evicted from Kanha tiger reserve, though they do not hunt tigers and have lived in the forests with the animals for centuries. Many other <em>adivasi</em>, or tribal groups, are under notice to leave their forest homes to make way for tourism and tiger conservation. The Baiga have now set up a project to \u201csave the forest from the forest department\u201d.</p> <h2>BAKA</h2> <p>The indigenous forest pygmy tribe which lives near Nki national park in south-east Cameroon, and the Bagyeli ethnic group of South Kribi have been forced out of their forests or massively restricted in what they hunt and fish. The groups says that they have become squatters on their own land, with entry into the forest restricted.</p> <h2>HMONG</h2> <p>Thousands of ethnic Hmong and Karen hill tribes groups in northern Thailand have been displaced from their forests after they were designated national parks or protected areas. The groups have been classed as \u201cillegal occupants\u201d or \u201csquatters\u201d even though they have been living there for more than 100 years. The Hmong and Karen are routinely blamed for resource degradation but say their traditions protect nature.</p> <h2>BARMAN </h2> <p>These tribespeople, who have lived in the forests of central Bangladesh for centuries with other ethnic groups, have been evicted or prevented from living in traditional lands rezoned by the government as protected reserves in the 1980s. They are now restricted in where they live, move, and what they grow.</p> <h2>SENGWER </h2> <p>Kenya Forest Service guards have for years harassed and tried to evict Sengwer indigenous people from the western highlands. The 5,000 hunter gatherers were barred from their ancestral forests in 1964 but continue to return. Many now live in makeshift homes, camped out on roadsides.</p> <h2>SAN </h2> <p>The San, or Bushmen, peoples of the Kalahari desert in Botswana have been outlawed from their traditional lands to make way for tourism and mining. Even though they have lived in the desert for generations, they are considered a threat to wildlife. In a series of evictions, they have had their homes destroyed and water cut off and have been restricted from hunting. In 2006 the high court granted the Bushmen the right to return to their land, but the government has continued to enforce a permit system.</p> <h2>OGIEK </h2> <p>The Kenyan government has long been seeking to drive the Ogiek and others from the Mau forest to protect national water supplies and wildlife. The forest has been severely degraded after an influx of logging companies and illegal settlers, but the Ogiek, who have lived there for centuries, say they are not responsible and are resisting eviction. Many communities have had their homes burned but continue to fight to return.</p> <h2>DUKHA </h2> <p>The nomadic reindeer-herding Dukha tribe of northern Mongolia are struggling to survive after being banned from hunting in the name of conservation. Their traditional land was declared a protected area in 2013 and they face prison and restrictions on where they migrate to and hunt. The Dukha have hunted sustainably for generations, with their own strict rules governing the number of animals they can kill, and when and where they can hunt.</p> <h2>LICKAN ANTAY </h2> <p>The Lickan Antay indigenous people from the Atacama desert in northern Chile live in a state-protected reserve but have been overwhelmed by tourism and conservation which leaves them little water and restricts them from access to many places. \u201cBefore the creation of the reserve there wasn\u2019t a single tourist, and suddenly they\u2019re everywhere. Our existence is now a constant battle,\u201d says one member of the community.</p> <h2>WANNIYALA-AETTO</h2> <p>The \u201cforest people\u201d of Sri Lanka were evicted from their homeland in what is now the Maduru Oya national park. Until recently, they hunted deer and wild boar, and collected honey, fruit and nuts. Today, they live outside their forest with small plots of land to grow rice and vegetables. They need a permit to enter the forest and those caught hunting risk arrest and violence.</p>",
  "<p>A football field and a grove of mango trees lie between Bongwe and its neighbouring village. On one side live the family of 33-year-old Subira Mwangole, shot dead by gunmen while watching television with friends one evening in May. On the other live his alleged murderers.</p> <p>The two villages, 30km south of the port city of Mombasa on Kenya\u2019s coast, are almost identical: three-room houses with rusting tin or thatch roofs, a ramshackle primary school, a government office, a small mosque with white walls stained by rain, a crossroads where two tracks meet, a well, small plots of tall corn plants.</p> <p>Yet, despite their placid appearances, the villages lie on the invisible frontline of a brutal, low-level, three-way war pitting security agencies against the Islamic extremist network al-Shabaab, and the militants against the local community. It is a war carried out by small groups of armed men who shoot first and ask few questions.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very anxious, frightened. He knew he could die at any moment. We all know we could be next,\u201d said Ibrahim, a former al-Shabaab fighter and a close relative of Mwangole.</p> <p>There is a steady beat of violence. The extremists murder those they see as a threat. Local human rights groups say the police do the same thing. Both sets of killers know that the fear they provoke brings impunity.</p> <p>Mwangole was particularly hated by al-Shabaab for his role in convincing veterans of the movement to take advantage of an amnesty offered by the Kenyan ministry of the interior last year. The shopkeeper and father of two was himself a defector from the group, which has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2006 and has expanded across the porous border into Kenya.</p> <p>Mwangole was shot in the head by a group of men dressed as policemen but identified by family members as local members of al-Shabaab. His death was swiftly followed by the murder, in similar circumstances, <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Fear-grips-Kwale-as-three-Nyumba-Kumi-officials-are-killed-/-/1056/3224602/-/tkptij/-/index.html\" title=\"\">of three community leaders in Bongwe</a>. All were involved in government \u201canti-radicalisation\u201d schemes.</p> <p>Hundreds have died at the hands of Islamic militants in Kenya in recent decades. A first wave of violence between 1998 and 2002 was directed by al-Qaida against foreign targets, including US embassies and Israeli tourists. It had ebbed by the middle of the last decade.</p> <p>But radicalism was growing among Kenya\u2019s Muslim minority, fuelled by a sense of marginalisation, extremist clerics, the impact of the US-led \u201cwar on terror\u201d and a shift away from traditional moderate Islamic practices to more rigorous versions of the faith influenced by countries in the Gulf.</p> <p>In 2013 gunmen from al-Shabaab <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24191606\" title=\"\">stormed a shopping mall in Nairobi,</a> Kenya\u2019s capital, killing 67 people. Last year 148 people were shot dead at a university in Kenya\u2019s north-east. Both attacks were launched from Somalia, where Kenyan troops are fighting the extremists as part of an African Union force, but focused attention on support networks within Kenya itself.</p> <p>Investigators found that young men from villages such as Bongwe in Kwale county had been travelling to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab for over a decade. Authorities launched a major crackdown and, officials say, a comprehensive \u201canti-radicalisation\u201d strategy. One element was the amnesty announced last year. By this spring, 70 al-Shabaab veterans \u2013 or returnees \u2013 had made a clean breast of their militant past to authorities, receiving an assurance that they would not be prosecuted in return.</p> <p>According to local journalists and former al-Shabaab fighter Sami, who worked closely with Mwangole and was a friend, two amnestied returnees have since been killed, as have six other al-Shabaab veterans.</p> <p>\u201cWe trusted the government. We thought we could live a better life, in peace, and put our past behind us,\u201d Sami said.</p> <p>Many amnestied veterans receive constant threats from militants, while also facing harassment from police. \u201cThe government issued an amnesty that was not anchored in law,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.hakiafrica.or.ke/index.php/en/\" title=\"\">Hussein Khaled, of Haki-Africa, a human rights monitoring group in Mombasa.</a></p> <p>The identity of the alleged killers of Mwangole and the three community leaders reveals how, despite the extremist rhetoric of \u201cglobal jihad\u201d, the conflict being fought out in Kwale is very intimate.</p> <p>In interviews with the <em>Observer</em>, Mwangole\u2019s relatives and friends blamed a band of a dozen young men from the neighbouring village for the murders in Bongwe. Most are in their 20s and only recently recruited to al-Shabaab. They include several relatives of the victims. Well before the four murders in May, the group had already made a series of threats to amnestied veterans, accusing them of treachery and spying for the government.</p> <p>Sami, who returned from a stint in Somalia with al-Shabaab six years ago, said: \u201cWe went to the police. We identified those threatening us, but they did nothing. Sometimes I think they wanted Mwangole to be killed \u2013 that\u2019s why they gave him no protection.\u201d</p> <p>In June, police detained 10 men for the killings, including three of those named by Mwangole\u2019s relatives. They say they are confident they have now broken up the network. This has inspired little confidence in Bongwe, however, where the authorities are as feared as al-Shabaab. Campaigners claim systematic human rights abuses by the police, including 70 extrajudicial \u201cexecutions\u201d or disappearances in the past year alone in and around Mombasa.</p> <p>Many such killings and disappearances involve former members of al-Shabaab, or individuals alleged to be extremists. At least three alleged members of al-Shabaab in Kwale have been shot dead by police in recent months.</p> <p>One, named as Omar Hesbon Matheka, died on 4 June when he was <a href=\"http://%20http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000204058/mother-cries-foul-as-police-insist-slain-man-was-a-terror-suspect\" title=\"\">\u201crunning while shooting at the police\u201d, according to officials,</a> who claimed a grenade had been found among the dead man\u2019s possessions. Witnesses said Matheka was killed by officers while sitting in a rickshaw. His mother told local newspapers that the 24-year-old was looking for work.</p> <p>\u201cTerrorism is the worst form of human rights violation. We want to eradicate terrorism \u2026 [but] it seems that the [government] strategy is simply using firepower. There is nothing about community resilience, addressing underlying problems or rule of law,\u201d said human rights activist Khaled.</p> <p>Maalim Mohammed, the police commissioner of Mombasa, denied any human rights abuses by Kenyan security agencies. \u201cThese allegations are baseless, malicious and unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cOur constitution and laws are very clear and we always respect the process. You cannot use coercive means to win against terrorism. You need to win hearts and minds. We get a lot of information from the community.\u201d</p> <p>The police crackdown has had a significant impact \u2013 at least in the short term. Analysts say the al-Shabaab support network on the coast and elsewhere is much weaker than it was, and has been eradicated in Mombasa.</p> <p>The British and US governments recently lifted <a href=\"http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/11/17/us-uk-tourists-flock-to-kenya-after-travel-warnings-lifted_c1243184\" title=\"\">travel warnings</a> applied two years ago to almost all of Kenya\u2019s Indian Ocean coastline, giving the crucial tourist industry a much-needed boost. \u201cWe can assure all visitors that they will be entirely safe here on the coast of Kenya,\u201d Mohammed said.</p> <p>But there are still frequent cross-border incidents. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-attacks-idUSKCN0Z60SE\" title=\"\">Five policemen were recently killed by suspected al-Shabaab fighters</a> near the border with Somalia. There is also continuing recruitment, according to villagers. Several Kwale county residents, who did not want to be named, added that some women are also attracted by the extremist ideology, and marry al-Shabaab veterans in the area.</p> <p>Last weekend Bongwe and its neighbouring village were calm. Both were full of women wearing flowing robes. Young children, cows and chickens wandered between the trees. A dozen youths wearing old T-shirts played on the football pitch.</p> <p>\u201cI left one war behind me in Somalia when I returned,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cBut now I am in the middle of another one.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Gawker, mightiest and most scabrous of websites, died last week, aged 13. Verdict: death by legal misadventure, with $140m damages attached. But the obsequies of its founder and staff on the site\u2019s last day live on \u2013 indeed, provide a perfect commentary on these sour, threshing media times. Exit the libertarian bad boys of online journalism. Enter a great and good supervised era of cowed self-regulation as big-beast lawyers roam the earth?</p> <p>Our \u201cweb-literate journalists picked up more story ideas from anonymous email tips, obscure web forums or hacker data dumps than they did from interviews or parties\u201d, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/how-things-work-1785604699\" title=\"\">wrote the founder of Gawker</a>, Nick Denton, an <em>FT</em> Brit in New York who had a great idea. \u201cThey scorned access. To get an article massaged or fixed, there was nobody behind the scenes to call. Gawker was an island \u2026 uncompromised and uncompromising\u201d.</p> <p>Blogging, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/what-was-gawker-1785565897\" title=\"\">explained Hamilton Nolan</a>, one of the site\u2019s main feature writers, \u201cis not a real job. Construction is a real job \u2026 Blogging is something you get to do. It is a quirky form of daily journalism, falling somewhere between live TV news and magazine writing, calling for sharp news judgment, an irrational taste for argument, and a complete absence of high standards.\u201d</p> <p>And Choire Sicha, once a co-editor, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/mission-demolished-1785569525\" title=\"\">weighed in with a hymn to web mortality</a>. \u201cWhatever it is you love now, from the daring to the harebrained, from the dodo \u2026 to the Daily Beast to the Awl to Upworthy to the <em>Guardian</em> to the <em>New York Times,</em> you\u2019ll discover that they\u2019ll each seem far more lovely to you when they\u2019re gone. Now this place passes into a prolonged nostalgia \u2026 The moment will come soon enough when you need a Gawker, and you\u2019ll be furious that you no longer have one.\u201d</p> <p>All of which, briskly interpreted, means that Gawker never did and never could play by some regulatory rulebook. It was news and gossip \u2013 often Big Apple media gossip \u2013 with an anarchic edge. If you liked your journalism raw or extra spicy, it was a site of first resort. But if you thought journalism a more constrained and modulated profession, then Gawker was a cowboy construct beyond the pale. No wonder, as Denton\u2019s legions disappear, that covert sighs of relief echo from behind the arras.</p> <p>Should respectable editors make common cause with Alexander Pope over this \u201cchild of dirt that stinks and stings\u201d? Should there be great lamentation over a site gone missing because it included moments of graphic video detail about Hulk Hogan\u2019s philandering outside the wrestling ring? Does it matter that a Silicon Valley tycoon, Peter Thiel, handed lawyers $10m to drive Gawker into bankruptcy?</p> <p>Questions perhaps best answered by reaching for last week\u2019s <em>Sunday Times</em> magazine and turning to an interview with Mark Thompson, BBC director general turned publisher of the <em>New York Times</em>. Thompson is recalling an early visit he made to the <em>Times\u2019s </em>page one conference on the day the Democratic candidate for New York mayor was caught sending photos of his penis to various young women. \u201cAnd there\u2019s this long debate: \u2018Is it really a page one story? Is it too salacious?\u2019 It got a very small mention on the front page and the editors agreed strictly no double entendres.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the great and good <em>Times</em> in action. Huge agonising over a tale that clearly had to be told. Cross-ref to page 97. And Gawker scoffed at such solemn portent. Gawker was needed somewhere on the spectrum because it wasn\u2019t part of what we would currently call the elite, the establishment.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that the <em>New York Times </em>isn\u2019t needed \u2013 just like a great deal of journalism that implicitly says \u201cyou can trust me because I have ethical boundaries\u201d. But it also means that \u2013 in print as well as online \u2013 voices with \u201ca complete absence of high standards\u201d have a role too. That\u2019s something we in Britain should recognise because our own journalism, over centuries, has been formed by maverick pamphleteers, lone crusaders and vivid polemicists. Think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/08/biography.features1\" title=\"\">William Hone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/oct/16/books.guardianreview\" title=\"\">William Stead</a> for starters.

Last Tuesday, under cover of daunting detail, the Press Recognition Panel, charged with endorsing and patrolling the royal charter version of Lord Justice Leveson\u2019s proposals, met to rule on the application of the Impress project to be Britain\u2019s first statutorily underpinned press regulator (with prospective powers to render non-joiners subject to exemplary damages in libel cases they lose and saddled with all costs even when they win). The potential hammer of Gawker made official by parliamentary decree.</p> <p>Doomsday deferred, as it happened. Some last-minute correspondence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/aug/23/impresss-charter-recognition-deferred-after-publishers-objections\" title=\"\">added 20 days\u2019 extra brooding</a>. But still the fundamental message of the spectacle seemed immediate enough. Here was a panel run by a former founding member of the Legal Services Board, with the chief executive of the Professional Standards Authority, a former communications director to deputy PM Clegg and a former founding partner of Ofcom (among former others) preparing to decide on the application of the Impress board led by a former chief of the Financial Ombudsman Service, chosen by an appointments commission which included the first, now former, chief executive of the Legal Services Board.</p> <p>All a little heavy on professional regulators, lawyers and media academics, you may think. A closed circle of \u201cindependence\u201d. And Impress intends to regulate websites, too. <a href=\"http://impress.press/news/draft-standards-code.html\" title=\"\">Its new code</a> \u201cis designed with the challenges of digital publication in mind. It will apply to publications regulated by Impress regardless of medium or platform\u201d. That means the Canary as well as the <em>Sun</em>, Heat Street as well as the <em>Mirror</em>. And that, in turn, means the deferred threat of extreme legal sanctions spread far wider.</p> <p>Gawker wouldn\u2019t have lasted three months, let alone 13 years, under such a regime. Signing up would have killed it. <em>Private Eye</em>, always resolute against outside regulation, would be smack in the firing line. Such sanctions \u2013 however earnestly evolved \u2013 don\u2019t ensure a free press. And they don\u2019t make sense in an era of constant flux.</p> <p>Leveson didn\u2019t have an answer to the international digital explosion. There are no answers to this day. Impress, to be sure, may attend to individual bloggers in local disputes: but now hear the crude crunch of global litigation bent on obliteration, not arbitration. Trump issues writs as heedlessly as he massages statistics: 1,900 of them filed already. Silicon Valley is flexing its muscles.</p> <p>I know many readers here still see press freedom through a Murdoch prism. I know that Leveson\u2019s followers hold his words as holy writ. But the internet \u2013 instantaneously, inevitably \u2013 gives news a different dimension. It isn\u2019t just another great-and-good opportunity for the regulatory classes.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/technology/gawkers-gone-long-live-gawker.html?_r=0\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times</em> itself admits</a>: \u201cEven if you avoided Gawker.com, you can\u2019t escape its influence.

Most central bankers are well aware that their black bag of monetary medicine is running short of remedies to overcome the continuing aftershocks of the 2008 crash.</p> <p>Brexit is the latest seismic convulsion. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\" title=\"\">And the Bank of England duly handed out</a> the financial equivalent of blue, yellow and pink pills to soothe the&#xa0;fevered brows of consumers and businesses alike.</p> <p>It\u2019s true, as Brexiters contend, that the dire warnings of the International Monetary Fund and George Osborne\u2019s Treasury that Britain\u2019s economy would fall off a cliff in the event of a vote to leave the European Union have been proved wrong.</p> <p>It was always unlikely the vote would trigger a repeat of 2008, which was a global financial collapse that dragged the entire developed world down with it. Remainers might want to put their head in the sand, but the vote itself has not caused a 20% drop in property prices or most of the other&#xa0;scary things on the roster of gloomy predictions.</p> <p>But it is also true that the bounceback in consumer spending and business activity has only recovered some of the ground lost over the preceding six months. More than that, the recovery is largely a result of the devalued pound and the Bank of England\u2019s promise to stimulate the economy with another adrenaline shot.</p> <p>In the same vein as European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s \u201cready to do whatever it takes\u201d speech in the summer of 2012, which soothed the nerves of eurozone investors as Athens burned, the Bank of England made it clear in February, as soon as the vote was called by David Cameron, that it stood ready to give the economy a boost, and duly delivered on 4 August.</p> <p>A cut in the base rate to 0.25%, an extra \u00a360bn of quantitative easing and \u00a3100bn of cheap loans for banks to offset the squeeze from low interest rates was heavily trailed by the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney, albeit in the vaguest terms, giving a measure of comfort that a repeat of 2008 could be avoided.</p> <p>The real problem for Carney is that Brexit hasn\u2019t happened yet. And while David Davis and Liam Fox may yet carve out trade deals for the UK that boost trade, the betting is that in an era of globalisation and the domination of powerful trading blocs, the UK is going to struggle to attract international businesses bringing new jobs.</p> <p>Most forecasts have reduced the average growth rate over the next four years from above 2% to below 2%. If that turns out to be true, the UK will need a bit more stimulus to help it through. What does the Bank of England have to offer? What about negative interest rates?</p> <p>Neither the UK or US have allowed their central bank to charge customers \u2013 mostly commercial banks \u2013 to keep funds on deposit in the way that the ECB and Bank of Japan already do.</p> <p>Adam Posen, the former Bank interest-rate setter who is now in charge at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, has urged his former colleagues and the Fed to put aside their reluctance and adopt negative rates.</p> <p>In his defence Carney can cite warnings from the central bankers\u2019 club, the Geneva-based Bank of International Settlements, which worries that negative interest rates will hit commercial bank profits hard and undermine their ability to make loans.</p> <p>Robert Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton and head of the Sonecon consultancy in Washington, says the only reason the Fed is considering an increase in rates is to regain some firepower before the next recession. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had three quarters of annual growth at around 1%, inflation is low and productivity is around 1% when it should be above 2%, there is still more work to do,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Like many, he wants governments to use low interest rates to fund infrastructure spending and investments in schools and training. He despairs at Hillary Clinton\u2019s $275bn investment plan, which is fully funded from tax rises and savings in government spending. This money should be borrowed at the current ultra-cheap rates \u2013 not least because a policy of ever-cheaper credit is not going to raise productivity. Only an injection of new, freshly minted funds that add to the sum of money in circulation, invested wisely, can do that.</p> <p>Carney and Draghi have argued this case, only for politicians to take a step back. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/fischer-signals-2016-rate-hike-with-economy-nearing-fed-goals\" title=\"\">Stanley Fischer, deputy Fed chief, made the same point</a> before this weekend\u2019s meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p> <p>Unfortunately, month by month, the situation is getting more desperate. Three business confidence surveys do not make a trend, but the pessimism registered by Belgian, French and German firms last week could force the ECB to consider further action before its 8 September meeting.</p> <p>The Bank of England may need to follow suit, however reluctantly, as the post-Brexit fall in sterling pushes up inflation while wages remain stagnant, cutting living standards and growth.</p> <p>The final nail in the coffin would be a rise in US rates, triggering a rush of funds across the Atlantic, forcing the pound down further and inflation higher. Carney would be forced to switch tack, raising rates to stem the flow. Then he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the colour of his remedy pills: just the looming recession he will surely be blamed for.</p>",
  "<p>With a ready grin, greying stubble and the frame of a man who samples his own produce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/15/how-to-cook-perfect-steak\">Richard Turner</a> looks like someone you\u2019d be happy to buy a steak off. This is no accident. In fact, if you have eaten serious meat in London in the past 10 years, you probably have. Between his restaurants \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\">Hawksmoor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/12/jay-rayner-restaurant-pitt-cue\">Pitt Cue Co</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/08/blacklock-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Blacklock</a> \u2013 his butcher\u2019s Turner &amp; George, and cookbooks, Turner has good claim to be the capital\u2019s most influential meat man.</p> <p>In a restaurant scene increasingly dominated by young people with vans and bold business plans, Turner, 49, has had a more old-fashioned, but still unusual, route to the top. The son of an Essex banker father and housewife mother \u2013 \u201can amazing cook, one of the first people in the country to get into avocados\u201d \u2013 Turner \u201cfound his way\u201d into a military boarding school in Surrey. At 17 he enlisted, and spent seven happy years in the Paras before leaving around the time of the first Gulf War.</p> <p>\u201cThe army was brilliant until people started shooting at me,\u201d he says, sitting in the August sunshine outside Pitt Cue\u2019s spacious new premises by Liverpool Street station. \u201cBut I had fun. You have to grow up somehow. For some people it\u2019s university; for me it was the army.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He joined the army boxing team because they were given steak for breakfast</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boarding school and the army taught him to love food, mainly in large quantities. He joined the army boxing team because they were given steak for breakfast, and has fond memories of the \u201cbig chunks of meat\u201d in British army curry. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a lot of tofu,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>After leaving the army in 1991 he worked in private security, providing close protection to wealthy clients. This opened his palate to a different sort of catering.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the clients were having lunch I would eat in the same restaurant at a different table,\u201d he says. \u201cWe went to Le Gavroche maybe once a week, and it was a revelation. I started badgering the Roux brothers to let me work in the kitchen. I wanted to know how to cook like that because it was almost miraculous \u2013 dishes like Le Caneton Gavroche, where you eat the whole duck over two courses, with vegetables and a horseradish sauce. They don\u2019t cook like that any more; proper old-fashioned French cooking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaca62140649d4186b9d945c2c7629ec26eaf788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaca62140649d4186b9d945c2c7629ec26eaf788/0_787_3260_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three of a kind: at Hawksmoor restaurant, with owners  Huw Gott (left) and Will Beckett.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three of a kind: at Hawksmoor restaurant, with owners Huw Gott (left) and Will Beckett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually he was let loose in the kitchen as a commis chef. Stints at Harveys and La Tante Claire with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/20/pierre-koffmann-chef-interview\">Pierre Koffmann</a> and Marco Pierre White in Wandsworth, south London, all followed. His training served him well. \u201cThey were hard, brutal, exhausting places \u2013 some of the toughest kitchens in the world. You got shouted at and more, and you\u2019d see big, strong boys crying. But it was normal after the army. The kitchens of the 90s were fairly similar to the Paras.\u201d</p> <p>His second epiphany came at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/14/foodanddrink.restaurants\">St John</a> in the late 90s. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is amazing!\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/17/st-john-restaurant-of-my-dreams-anthony-bourdain\">Fergus Henderson</a> is a genius: the way he cooks with bags of flavour and wallop, somewhere between an old English matron and a man\u2019s man.\u201d Turner moved away from fine dining and took over a pub in Islington, The Albion, where he added business acumen to his kitchen skills.</p> <p>\u201cThe profit margin is very small in restaurants and if you get it wrong you easily slip into losses. Labour and wastage are the big costs: you have to learn not to buy too much meat or keep it too long, not to burn things or overcook them. I learned how to make kitchens work properly.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, after travelling back and forth to America and seeing the quality of steakhouses there, Turner had the idea for a new kind of restaurant in London. \u201cIt was a no-brainer: all we had at the time was Aberdeen Angus. But Hawksmoor beat me to it, so instead I joined them as head chef and changed the menu to what my vision was.\u201d His idea was simple: to take the best meat he could buy, \u201chappy animals, slow-grown, not killed too young, seasoned with salt and cooked over charcoal. It\u2019s not rocket science. Then the clever stuff can happen around the outside.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I arrived the spinach side dish was just spinach and leeks in a b\u00e9chamel sauce. I took out the leeks, chopped the spinach more finely, and infused the cream with anchovies, rosemary and cayenne. They all create umami, so the sauce had an intense flavour, and when you ate it with the steak you understood it.\u201d</p> <p>His other innovation was commercial: he bought a computer-controlled Thermodyne oven that allowed them to double the number of covers. Profits jumped and Hawksmoor expanded to new sites. Now they are preparing to take their concept \u2013 an American steakhouse with a British twist \u2013 back to the motherland, with a huge 450-seater restaurant in the World Trade Center. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly scary,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great steak in America for years. London has caught up.\u201d</p> <p>He will move to New York for six months to oversee the launch, but these days Hawksmoor is only part of his empire. After sampling their wares when they were at the van and plan stage, he helped Pitt Cue founders Jamie Berger and Tom Adams find their first site off Carnaby Street, as well as the new one. More are planned. In Soho, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/08/blacklock-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Blacklock</a> is still full of people scoffing piles of chops. Through Turner &amp; George, he is the only UK supplier of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/raising-the-steaks-meet-the-elderly-spanish-cows-destined-for-dinner-plates\">Galician beef</a>, the unusually aged cows that have become the boeuf du jour in acclaimed restaurants like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/20/kitty-fishers-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Kitty Fisher\u2019s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/02/lurra-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Lurra</a>. He also supplies some of the meat to Hawksmoor and Pitt Cue.</p> <p>More immediately he has the fourth UK iteration of Meatopia, the meat-based festival started in the US by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/06/josh-ozersky-award-winning-food-writer-and-meat-fanatic-dies-aged-47\">Josh Ozersky</a> and brought over by Turner, initially as a PR boost for the butcher\u2019s. Chefs from around the world assemble to prepare one meaty dish each for visitors to test, all washed down with gallons of booze to the sound of live bands. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite weekend of the year,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Despite all the meaty love, and finding himself at the right end of a new concern with sourcing and ethics, Turner knows the tide could turn. \u201cVegetables are going to come around,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all eat too much meat. If we had to pay the real price, rather than supermarket prices, we\u2019d eat less and enjoy it more. We are omnivores but 70% of our diet should be vegetables and it isn\u2019t. The plant-based diet, with small amounts of meat, is going to come round soon. But I have a vegetable restaurant planned out in my head. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d \u2022</p> <p><em>Richard Turner is co-founder of Meatopia UK, 2-4 September 2016 </em><a href=\"http://www.meatopia.co.uk/\"><em>(meatopia.co.uk)</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Perhaps it\u2019s all those Olympic medals, but our small preview of Fairtrade gold wedding bands from Argos several weeks ago has led to a rush of queries about clean gold.

So could local gold offer a third way? According to consortium Scotgold, there is gold in them there hills, more precisely in the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, where they are hoping for 400-600 ounces of gold in the next six months.</p> <p>Ethical jewellers in Scotland such as Vivien Johnston of <a href=\"http://www.fifibijoux.com/\">fifibijoux.com</a> are excited because, although there\u2019s no such thing as a zero-impact mine, this represents an unbelievably short supply chain, creates local jobs and uses gravity and flotation to recover the gold instead of mercury or cyanide.</p> <h2>The big picture: seal and Alex Mustard</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fa39d8f9caa85299111c69d555fe1caed0edd55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa39d8f9caa85299111c69d555fe1caed0edd55/0_30_4629_2778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signed, sealed and delivered: Alex Mustard with a young friend who is a seal in the North Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signed, sealed and delivered: Alex Mustard with a young friend in the North Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Mustard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not every day you get to take a selfie with a seal.

  "<p>The BBC Reith Lectures in 1967 were given by Edmund Leach, a Cambridge social anthropologist. \u201cMen have become like gods,\u201d Leach began. \u201cIsn\u2019t it about time that we understood our divinity? Science offers us total mastery over our environment and over our destiny, yet instead of rejoicing we feel deeply afraid.\u201d</p> <p>That was nearly half a century ago, and yet Leach\u2019s opening lines could easily apply to today. He was speaking before the internet had been built and long before the human genome had been decoded, and so his claim about men becoming \u201clike gods\u201d seems relatively modest compared with the capabilities that molecular biology and computing have subsequently bestowed upon us. Our science-based culture is the most powerful in history, and it is ceaselessly researching, exploring, developing and growing. But in recent times it seems to have also become plagued with existential angst as the implications of human ingenuity begin to be (dimly) glimpsed.</p> <p>The title that Leach chose for his Reith Lecture \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h3xy8\" title=\"\"><em> A Runaway World</em></a> \u2013 captures our zeitgeist too. At any rate, we are also increasingly fretful about a world that seems to be running out of control, largely (but not solely) because of information technology and what the life sciences are making possible. But we seek consolation in the thought that \u201cit was always thus\u201d: people felt alarmed about steam in George Eliot\u2019s time and got worked up about electricity, the telegraph and the telephone as they arrived on the scene. The reassuring implication is that we weathered those technological storms, and so we will weather this one too. Humankind will muddle through.</p> <p>But in the last five years or so even that cautious, pragmatic optimism has begun to erode. There are several reasons for this loss of confidence. One is the sheer vertiginous pace of technological change. Another is that the new forces at loose in our society \u2013 particularly information technology and the life sciences \u2013 are potentially more far-reaching in their implications than steam or electricity ever were. And, thirdly, we have begun to see startling advances in these fields that have forced us to recalibrate our expectations.</p> <p>A classic example is the field of artificial intelligence (AI), defined as the quest to enable machines to do things that would require intelligence if performed by a human. For as long as most of us can remember, AI in that sense was always 20 years away from the date of prediction. Maybe it still is. But in the last few years we have seen that the combination of machine learning, powerful algorithms, vast processing power and so-called \u201cBig Data\u201d can enable machines to do very impressive things \u2013 real-time language translation, for example, or driving cars safely through complex urban environments \u2013 that seemed implausible even a decade ago.</p> <p>And this, in turn, has led to a renewal of excited speculation about the possibility \u2013 and the existential risks \u2013 of the \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d that would be caused by inventing a machine that was capable of recursive self-improvement. This possibility was first raised in 1965 by the British cryptographer IJ Good, who famously wrote: \u201cThe first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.\u201d Fifty years later, we find contemporary thinkers like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/12/nick-bostrom-artificial-intelligence-machine\" title=\"\">Nick Bostrom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30296999\" title=\"\">Murray Shanahan</a> taking the idea seriously.</p> <p>There\u2019s a sense, therefore, that we are approaching another \u201cend of history\u201d moment \u2013 but with a difference. In his famous 1989 article, the political scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/bring-back-ideology-fukuyama-end-history-25-years-on\" title=\"\">Francis Fukuyama</a> argued that the collapse of the Soviet empire meant the end of the great ideological battle between east and west and the \u201cuniversalisation of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government\u201d. This was a bold, but not implausible, claim at the time. What Fukuyama could not have known is that a new challenge to liberal democracy would eventually materialise, and that its primary roots would lie not in ideology but in bioscience and information technology.</p> <p>For that, in a nutshell, is the central argument of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yuval-noah-harari\" title=\"\">Yuval Noah Harari</a>\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/24/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari-review\" title=\"\"><em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em></a>. In a way, it\u2019s a logical extension of his previous book, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</em>, which chronicled the entire span of human history, from the evolution of Homo sapiens up to the political and technological revolutions of the 21st century, and deservedly became a world bestseller.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities. Those left behind face extinction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most writers on the implications of new technology focus too much on the technology and too little on society\u2019s role in shaping it. That\u2019s partly because those who are interested in these things are (like the engineers who create the stuff) determinists: they believe that technology drives history. And, at heart, Harari is a determinist too. \u201cIn the early 21st century,\u201d he writes in a striking passage, \u201cthe train of progress is again pulling out of the station \u2013 and this will probably be the last train ever to leave the station called <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Those who miss this train will never get a second chance. In order to get a seat on it, you need to understand 21st century technology, and in particular the powers of biotechnology and computer algorithms.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201c These powers are far more potent than steam and the telegraph, and they will not be used mainly for the production of food, textiles, vehicles and weapons. The main products of the 21st century will be bodies, brains and minds, and the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains and those who do not will be wider than the gap between Dickens\u2019s Britain and the Madhi\u2019s Sudan. Indeed, it will be bigger than the gap between Sapiens and Neanderthals. In the 21st century, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction, while those left behind will face extinction.\u201d</p> <p>This looks like determinism on steroids. What saves it from ridicule is that Harari sets the scientific and technological story within an historically informed analysis of how liberal democracy evolved. And he provides a plausible account of how the defining features of the liberal democratic order might indeed be upended by the astonishing knowledge and tools that we have produced in the last half-century. So while one might, in the end, disagree with his conclusions, one can at least see how he reached them.</p> <p>In a way, it\u2019s a story about the evolution and nature of modernity. For most of human history, Harari argues, humans believed in a cosmic order. Their world was ruled by omnipotent gods who exercised their power in capricious and incomprehensible ways. The best one could do was to try to placate these terrifying powers and obey (and pay taxes to) the priesthoods who claimed to be the anointed intermediaries between mere humans and gods. It may have been a dog\u2019s life but at least you knew where you stood, and in that sense belief in a transcendental order gave meaning to human lives.</p> <p>But then came science. Harari argues that the history of modernity is best told as a struggle between science and religion. In theory, both were interested in truth \u2013 but in different kinds of truth. Religion was primarily interested in order, whereas science, as it evolved, was primarily interested in power \u2013 the power that comes from understanding why and how things happen, and enables us to cure diseases, fight wars and produce food, among other things.</p> <p>In the end, in some parts of the world at least, science triumphed: belief in a transcendental order was relegated to the sidelines \u2013 or even to the dustbin of history. As science progressed, we did indeed start to acquire powers that in pre-modern times were supposed to be possessed only by gods (Edmund Leach\u2019s point). But if God was dead, as Nietzsche famously said, where would humans find meaning? \u201cThe modern world,\u201d writes Harari, \u201cpromised us unprecedented power \u2013 and the promise has been kept. Now what about the price? In exchange for power, the modern deal expects us to give up on meaning. How did humans handle this chilling demand? ... How did morality, beauty and even compassion survive in a world of gods, of heaven or hell?\u201d</p> <p>The answer, he argues, was in a new kind of religion: humanism \u2013 a belief system that \u201csanctifies the life, happiness and power of <em>Homo sapiens</em>\u201d. So the deal that defined modern society was a covenant between humanism and science in which the latter provided the means for achieving the ends specified by the former.</p> <p>And our looming existential crisis, as Harari sees it, comes from the fact that this covenant is destined to fall apart in this century. For one of the inescapable implications of bioscience and information technology (he argues) is that they will undermine and ultimately destroy the foundations on which humanism is built. And since liberal democracy is constructed on the worship of humanist goals (\u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d by citizens who are \u201ccreated equal\u201d, as the American founders put it), then our new powers are going to tear liberal democracy apart.</p> <p>How come? Well, modern society is organised round a combination of individualism, human rights, democracy and the free market. And each of these foundations is being eaten away by 21st-century science and technology. The life sciences are undermining the individualism so celebrated by the humanist tradition with research suggesting that \u201cthe free individual is just a fictional tale concocted by an assembly of biochemical algorithms\u201d. Similarly with the idea that we have free will. People may have freedom to choose between alternatives but the range of possibilities is determined elsewhere. And that range is increasingly determined by external algorithms as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/google-microsoft-pact-antitrust-surveillance-capitalism\" title=\"\">surveillance capitalism</a>\u201d practised by Google, Amazon and co becomes ubiquitous \u2013 to the point where internet companies will eventually know what your desires are before you do. And so on.</p> <p>Here Harari ventures into the kind of dystopian territory that Aldous Huxley would recognise. He sees three broad directions.</p> <p>1. Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, and the economic system will stop attaching much value to them.</p> <p>2. The system will still find value in humans collectively but not in unique individuals.</p> <p>3. The system <em>will</em>, however, find value in some unique individuals, \u201cbut these will be a new race of upgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population\u201d. By \u201csystem\u201d, he means the new kind of society that will evolve as bioscience and information technology progress at their current breakneck pace. As before, this society will be based on a deal between religion and science but this time humanism will be displaced by what Harari calls \u201cdataism\u201d \u2013 a belief that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any entity or phenomenon is determined by its contribution to data processing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We require machines that are super-intelligent: intelligence is necessary; consciousness is an optional extra</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Personally, I\u2019m not convinced by his dataism idea: the technocratic ideology underpinning our current obsession with \u201cBig Data\u201d will eventually collapse under the weight of its own absurdity. But in two other areas, Harari is exceedingly perceptive. The first is that our confident belief that we cannot be superseded by machines \u2013 because we have consciousness and they cannot have it \u2013 may be naive. Not because machine consciousness will be possible but because for Harari\u2019s dystopia to arrive, consciousness is not required. We require machines that are super-intelligent: intelligence is necessary; consciousness is an optional extra which in most cases would simply be a nuisance. And it\u2019s therefore not a showstopper for AI development.</p> <p>The second is that I\u2019m sure that his reading of the potential of bioscience is accurate. Even the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21704791-science-getting-grips-ways-slow-ageing-rejoice-long-side-effects-can-be\" title=\"\"><em>Economist</em> magazine recently ran a cover story</a> entitled: \u201cCheating death: the science that can extend your lifespan.\u201d But the exciting new possibilities offered by genetic technology will be expensive and available only to elites. So the long century in which medicine had a \u201clevelling up\u201d effect on human populations, bringing good healthcare within the reach of most people, has come to an end. Even today, rich people live longer and healthier lives. In a couple of decades, that gap will widen into a chasm.</p> <p><em>Homo Deus</em> is a remarkable book, full of insights and thoughtful reinterpretations of what we thought we knew about ourselves and our history. In some cases it seems (to me) to be naive about the potential of information technology. But what\u2019s really valuable about it is the way it grounds speculation about sci-tech in the context of how liberal democracy evolved.</p> <p>One measure of Harari\u2019s achievement is that one has to look a long way back \u2013 to 1934, in fact, the year when Lewis Mumford\u2019s <em>Technics and Civilization</em> was published \u2013 for a book with comparable ambition and scope. Not bad going for a young historian.</p>",
  "<p>For almost six decades the <a href=\"http://www.roseoftralee.ie/\">Rose of Tralee </a>\u2013 a pageant \u201cwhich brings young women of Irish descent from around the world to County Kerry, Ireland for a global celebration of Irish culture\u201d \u2013 has managed to avoid anything more political than expressing a desire to help the less well off. </p> <p>That cozy consensus changed this week, when the Sydney entrant to the competition, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SydneyRoseofTralee/\">Brianna Parkins</a>, told presenter D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 S\u00e9, live on television: \u201cI think we can do better here in Ireland.
