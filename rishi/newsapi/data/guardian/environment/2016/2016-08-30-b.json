  "<p>British consumers have recovered some of their swagger after a run of better than expected economic figures calmed nerves following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A leading poll of consumers found that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\">panic in the aftermath</a> of the EU referendum, causing the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/brexit-vote-batters-consumer-confidence-slide-gfk-yougov-regions\">biggest fall in confidence</a> for 21 years, was partially reversed in August.</p> <p>Official figures showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">strong high street sales</a> in July and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">an increase in employment</a>, coupled with a soaring stock market, helped bolster the outlook for the coming year, according to the GfK consumer confidence index.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">A package of measures</a> announced by the Bank of England earlier this month, including an interest rate cut to 0.25%, was widely seen as an important safety net for households and businesses, offsetting warnings of an impending recession and rising joblessness.</p> <p>The GfK index climbed to -7.5, after slumping to -9.2 in July from -1.2 in June ahead of the referendum. </p> <p>Joe Staton, a spokesman for GfK, said consumers had settled into a new \u201cwait and see reality of a post-Brexit [vote], pre-exit UK\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe uptick in confidence is driven by good news from hard data, the combination of historic low interest rates matched with falling prices and high levels of employment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Consumers said the outlook for the economy and their personal finances had improved, the survey reported.</p> <p>Staton said it was significant that the major purchase index, which monitors the demand for cars and other expensive items, had leapt by nine points to +7, while the savings index fell by 16 points.</p> <p>\u201cWe Brits are clearly determined to carry on shopping for today, rather than saving for tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, consumers remain nervous about the future, according to Bank data released on Tuesday, which showed a slowdown after previously strong growth in borrowing on credit cards and bank loans.</p> <p>Net consumer credit went up by \u00a31.2bn in July, according to the Bank, the smallest increase since August 2015 and well below analysts\u2019 expectations of a rise of \u00a31.7bn. </p> <p>The rate of consumer credit growth also slowed for the first time since December 2014, rising by 10.1% year on year in July, compared with year-on-year growth of 10.3% in June.</p> <p>Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the long-term outlook for consumers was muted.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAugust may see some recovery, in line with other economic indicators and aided by further declines in borrowing costs. But longer term, a less benign environment for consumers, reflecting a rise in unemployment and the squeeze on incomes from higher inflation, suggests that households\u2019 appetite to borrow will stay relatively subdued.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Credit card lending was broadly unchanged in July, but personal loans almost halved from \u00a31.3bn to \u00a3700m, consistent with a slowdown in purchases of big-ticket items such as cars. </p> <p>Scott Bowman, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the Bank lending figures showed that the Brexit vote had dented households\u2019 appetite for debt. </p> <p>\u201cThe latest figures suggest households\u2019 debt appetite has taken a bit of a hit post- referendum. But support from policymakers should prevent household borrowing from slowing too much,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The interest rate cut would prevent the UK economy from slipping into reverse, he said. \u201cAccordingly, we think consumer spending will ensure GDP growth falls to around zero in the second half of this year, rather than turning significantly negative.\u201d </p> <p>Announcing the rate cut, the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said the economic outlook for Britain had changed markedly. But several economic indicators suggested that the UK economy has so far absorbed the shock of the referendum result. This month, the Office for National Statistics reported that retail sales volumes rose by 1.4% month on month and 5.9% year on year in July.</p> <p>The good economic news continued when the ONS said the jobless benefit claimant count fell by 8,600 to 763,600 in July. Last week, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/business-issues/the-economy/business-surveys/distributive-trades-survey/\">CBI distributive trades survey</a>, a monthly healthcheck for retailers and wholesalers, found that they had enjoyed their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/cbi-retail-sales-growth-expected-to-slow-after-summer-bounce\">best month in August</a> for half a year as shoppers bagged summer clothing bargains.</p>",
  "<p>The pay packets of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/03/australias-top-ceos-earn-72-more-than-declared-research-shows\">ASX100 chief executives</a> are shrinking and are now at pre-2008 levels, with the median fixed pay for 2015 financial year at $1.7m, according to a report published by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cTo be clear, the shrinking of fixed pay is certainly not due to incumbent CEOs taking pay cuts, though they are receiving minimal pay rises,\u201d the council\u2019s CEO, Louise Davidson, wrote in the report\u2019s foreword. \u201cIt\u2019s down to boards taking the opportunity to pay the replacements of departing CEOs less.\u201d</p> <p>Between 2001 and 2008, median fixed pay for Australian CEOs rose 120%, she wrote, from $780,975 to $1.7m. But, after the global financial crisis, fixed pay had come down, she said.</p> <p>The council says this has occurred in part because of the federal government\u2019s \u201ctwo strikes\u201d law, which came into effect in 2011 and which dictates that if the remuneration report of a firm is rejected by 25% or more of shareholders for two consecutive years, the entire board of directors may face re-election.</p> <p>\u201cYear by year, we\u2019ve since seen fixed pay come down,\u201d Davidson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/03/australias-top-ceos-earn-72-more-than-declared-research-shows\">Australia's top CEOs earn 72% more than declared, research shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIndependent company directors should be acutely aware that the community believes CEO pay is out of step, representing as it does many multiples of ordinary people\u2019s wages, and that boards risk an investor backlash if they do not keep a tight leash on management rewards.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time, the report also examined bonuses and found more CEOs are getting them. Of the 86 ASX100 CEOs surveyed in 2015, 93% received a bonus. The median was 76% of the maximum available bonus. </p> <p>Receiving bonuses had become normal, raising questions about whether the criteria for being awarded bonuses was set too low, Davidson told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe bonuses don\u2019t completely offset the reduction in pay, so it\u2019s not like bonuses are being shifted from one part of the pay packet to another,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t expect 93% of CEOs to be receiving a bonus, my expectation would be closer to 50%. That says to me there is something out-of-kilter here. You would only receive a high bonus in an exceptional year and they should only be used to reward exceptional performance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/06/more-men-named-peter-at-the-helm-of-asx200-companies-than-women\">ASX100 companies</a> needed to be more transparent about their bonus criteria and incentives, she said. While companies argue this would reveal their strategy to competitors, Davidson said this information could be provided to shareholders retrospectively.</p> <p>The report also examined the ASX100 CEOs who earned the highest realised pay \u2013 that is, their pay including the value of shares received during the financial year. The highest-paid CEOs on a realised pay basis were the co-CEOs of Westfield Corp, Steven and Peter Lowy, who realised $24.7m against reported pay of $21.7m.</p> <p>They were followed by Seek CEO Andrew Bassat, who realised $19.39m, and Scentre Group CEO, Peter Allen, with a realised pay of $17.9m. There were no women in the highest 10 paid CEOs list, with only five of the ASX100 CEOs women.</p>",
  "<p>Unconscious bias towards \u201cpeople like us\u201d is something we\u2019re all guilty of. We feel more comfortable among those whose race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, accent, even sense of humour, mirror our own. It explains why, with the best intentions in the world, even governments and companies aware of inclusion have, for example, far fewer women than men in management.</p> <p>This is something Jeffrey Siminoff, the vice-president for inclusion and diversity at Twitter, is trying to change \u2013 within his company and on the company\u2019s platform in a sort of symbiosis. </p> <p>Twitter has 3,860 employees worldwide and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/26/twitter-quarterly-report-slow-growth\">313m active users a month</a>, according to its corporate website. \u201cTwitter is the place where inclusion lives,\u201d Siminoff says, with a rhythmic familiarity that suggests he\u2019s said it once or twice before. \u201cWhat I mean by that is a democratisation of voices. We have a platform where people come together with no barriers to entry, to feel included and to feel a sense of belonging. The platform is designed to form communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/24/steve-wozniak-the-status-quo-doesnt-have-to-exist-we-can-come-up-with-solutions\">Steve Wozniak: The status quo doesn't have to exist. We can come up with solutions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s inherent in the business, it\u2019s imperative for this company to live up to the promise of inclusion in its own workplace, too. When those two things meet and fuse, when your employees are marching lockstep with the mission of the platform itself, you create something rich.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not talking about positive discrimination, which is a form of discrimination in itself. \u201cWe don\u2019t favour one group over another,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople spend a lot of time at work and we\u2019re focused on creating an environment where people thrive, not despite their differences but because<em> </em>of their differences.\u201d </p> <p>At Twitter, this means thinking carefully about who is approached to join the company or to be promoted. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to mandate a specific result,\u201d he says of the positive discrimination his company doesn\u2019t practice, \u201cit\u2019s another thing to mandate a diverse pool of candidates.\u201d</p> <p>The global program Twitter is implementing is a form of mindfulness training for all employees: teaching them to reflect on the unconscious stereotypes we all have because of the way we\u2019ve been brought up, or because of external influences such as culture and media. The idea is to run a \u201csystem check\u201d in real time against those inborn tribal biases when creating and then surveying the pool of applicants, as well as when making an appointment.</p> <p>It\u2019s ironic that when Siminoff was appointed to the diversity role, critics in the media were ferocious about a middle-aged white male getting the job. But he has long been intensely and personally aware of the issues. When he was younger, he struggled with his identity as a gay man. As an employment lawyer at Morgan Stanley, he saw many cases of discrimination on all sorts of grounds, and jumped at the chance to organise an LGBTIQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and questioning] resource within the company as an extracurricular role.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a transformative experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt much more present, much more connected and much more alive in my work.\u201d When he was asked to step out of his lawyer role to lead the company\u2019s diversity program, he embraced it, he says. He later took those skills to Apple and then to Twitter, where his job includes helping the platform enable equality and diversity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/the-grattan-institute-is-wrong-we-need-more-science-students-not-fewer\">The Grattan Institute is wrong.

Similarly partnerships with business clients have emphasised equality and inclusion. For instance, Twitter worked with ANZ to create a rainbow-coloured \u201chashflag\u201d to accompany the company\u2019s tweets supporting Mardi Gras and LGBTI rights in general. </p> <p>Yet Siminoff insists the platform itself remains politically neutral. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are active on it, for example, and,<strong> </strong>given the extent of trolling of women, particularly women in tech, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not fudging when he says the company doesn\u2019t practise censorship. Some might say it doesn\u2019t practise enough of it.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the most powerful hashtags often arise organically. He uses the hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter, as an example: it has spread from the US to the UK and Australia, among other countries, and has created a powerful field of solidarity, despite the backlash hashtags such as All, or White, Lives Matter.</p> <p>His formula for his own job could be a formula for how he\u2019d like users to approach Twitter, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s critical for success in a role like this is an ability to listen and to learn, assume [something] because your own life experiences have walked you down a certain road and not presume that your good intentions are necessarily going to carry the day.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If bookmakers are to be believed, the evolution of Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team will come at an immediate cost. With a month to go until Darren Clarke oversees the defence of the trophy at Hazeltine the USA are heavily odds-on to win.</p> <p>The hosts\u2019 price shortened further on Tuesday as confirmation of Clarke\u2019s full team arrived. With Thomas Pieters afforded his most high-profile chance to shine, six from 12 of the European contingent will be making Ryder Cup debuts. That represents the highest rookie contingent for an away match since 1999, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/01/from-the-vault-europe-capitulated-brookline-1999-ryder-cup\">the US triumphed with much leaping around and gnashing of teeth at Brookline</a>. The home side is unlikely to feature more than two debutants and, in Brooks Koepka, may have only one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/thomas-pieters-impresses-tiger-woods-darren-clarke-europe-ryder-cup\">Thomas Pieters impresses me as much as Tiger Woods did, says Darren Clarke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke did not adopt a woe is us approach or play on the sense of underdog when discussing his dozen. Europe\u2019s captain was at his most bullish yet with regards to the additions of Pieters, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer. He explained his choices with reason and assuredness. \u201cWe have six rookies, one of them [Danny Willett] is the Masters champion,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThe other guys have won tournaments all over the world.</p> <p>\u201cWho would you have picked for experience? Who is in form? If I\u2019m going to add experience to it, I need to have form. I need to see guys that are playing well. Unfortunately, the two guys that would have fallen into that category, Graeme McDowell and Luke Donald, are not quite playing the way we know they can play.</p> <p>\u201cI would have loved them to be playing a little bit better to give me a bigger headache but it didn\u2019t happen. My options of adding to the team with strength then came back to rookies again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased with Martin and Lee adding to the team because they bring a balance which we have always talked about. The last pick was always going to be the difficult one.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we have six rookies. I\u2019ve got all the trust in the world in them. They have got themselves in this position. It\u2019s not just a straightforward case; if it was, you would go straight down off the world rankings. That\u2019s not the European way. That\u2019s not what we do.</p> <p>\u201cI have a massive amount of belief in the rookies that we have. To put two together, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it but, if I did do that, then I would have confidence in them going out there and delivering a point.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke is right to point to Willett\u2019s status, although the Yorkshireman has been routinely out of sorts since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/danny-willett-masterrs-2016-jordan-spieth-lee-westood\">his win at Augusta National in April</a>. Questions, too, hover over the current touch of Andy Sullivan, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Chris Wood.</p> <p>\u201cI was part of that Brookline team and the rookies that we have now play more in America,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect to the guys that didn\u2019t play until Sunday at Brookline, but the guys are global players nowadays. Those guys did play considerably around the world but it\u2019s different now. The rookies that we have now are more comfortable in America because they have been playing more over there, so it\u2019s somewhat different to what it was back then.\u201d</p> <p>Westwood was similarly upbeat. \u201cI see them not as rookies,\u201d said the 43-year-old. \u201cI look at a lot of the players\u2019 characters and I think they can take it. They can take a fight and a bit of stick.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed this wave of debutants is not necessarily a disaster for Europe. Quite obviously the core of a team that included McDowell, Donald and Ian Poulter for years would change at some point. That Westwood \u2013 who will compete in his 10th Ryder Cup and, with 21 points, is four behind Nick Faldo\u2019s record total \u2013 Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson are on hand to assist with the transition is a benefit to Clarke, himself immersed in the biennial event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/ryder-cup-darren-clarke-wildcards\">Ryder Cup 2016: Westwood, Kaymer and Pieters selected as wildcard picks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The USA have players returning to familiar surroundings but the scar tissue associated with defeat upon defeat can hardly be deemed advantageous.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like any other tournament,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something totally different but the experienced guys will do what we do in the European way by looking after the first-time guys. Making picks is not just about stats. It\u2019s not just about form, which is important, but it\u2019s about the whole team dynamic, what goes on behind the scenes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve consulted over this past couple of days with lots of previous Ryder Cup captains to try and just gain a little bit more of an insight and to see what they were thinking whenever they were making picks, in case I was doing anything that might not have fitted in, but every one of them was 100% behind me and very, very helpful.</p> <p>\u201cTheir thoughts on their picks were exactly the same as mine; you\u2019re adding to not just the playing, the playing bit is important, but you need more. Team is more important and the European team ethos is what has enabled us to be as successful as we have. With this team, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do and take this forward.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke batted away fitness fears regarding Stenson, who withdrew after one round of The Barclays Championship in New York last week with the recurrence of a knee problem. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Henrik two or three times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was purely precautionary; he is OK. I think he has a slight issue but it\u2019s not going to stop him playing.\u201d</p> <p>The overwhelming issue in Europe\u2019s favour is pressure; namely the barrowload of it placed on the USA. A miserable recent run \u2013 they have lost six of the past seven \u2013 triggered a task force, the inclusion of Tiger Woods as a vice\u2011captain and the apparent acceptance of the complaints so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/28/phil-mickelson-tom-watson-ryder-cup\">vociferously aired by Phil Mickelson at Gleneagles two years ago</a>. Quite where the PGA of America would turn to in event of another defeat is anybody\u2019s guess.</p> <p>For now Davis Love has to decide on four picks with some big names in Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar and Jim Furyk having failed to qualify automatically. Love will name three of his four on 12 September as he seeks to halt what would be an unprecedented fourth victory in a row for Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThankfully one of my hard parts of the job is over and done with but Davis has that ahead of him,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cHe\u2019s been there before and I\u2019m sure he will make very, very solid choices.</p> <p>\u201cI know he\u2019s going to have a tough decision to make. There are some big names not on that American team and they are going to consult with everybody, with members of the task force, to see what they are going to do. They have got to try and get the right mix on the team as well.\u201d</p> <p>None of which is Clarke\u2019s concern. On Tuesday,he exuded a level of confidence which, if transferred to Europe\u2019s players, offers a decent antidote to betting markets.</p> <h2>The 12 players who will aim to retain the Ryder Cup for Europe</h2> <h2>Rory McIlroy (Northern Ireland)</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>27 <strong>World ranking </strong>5 <strong>Ryder Cups</strong> 3 (2010, 12, 14) <strong>This season\u2019s earnings </strong>$2,700,835 <strong>Majors </strong>4</p> <p>Having once dismissed the Ryder Cup as \u201can exhibition\u201d McIlroy has now been on the winning team in all three of his appearances.

  "<p>Welcome to the baffling world of multinational corporate taxation. The European commission\u2019s ground-breaking ruling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Apple owes Ireland \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back-taxes</a> after enjoying a quarter-century of illegal state-aid has exposed at least three oddities, or examples of plain old hypocrisy.</p> <p>First, there is the bizarre spectacle of the Irish government saying it would rather not have a cash windfall that would fund its health service for a year. Even after the years of austerity, Dublin would rather fight commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s ruling.</p> <p>Second, US politicians are performing gymnastics. A US Senate committee in 2013 accused Apple of being \u201camong America\u2019s largest tax avoiders\u201d by exploiting Ireland\u2019s generous tax breaks. Yet, now that Vestager &amp; co have taken a shot at those same Irish inducements, the US political establishment is furious.</p> <p>Third, there is a mystery of why Brussels has taken so long to act. One of Apple\u2019s contentious deals with the Irish revenue authority dates to 1991, for heaven\u2019s sake. Or perhaps no detective work is required. Deals between multinational and tax authorities are officially confidential. In practice, that is merely a polite fiction to allow regulators and legislators to do nothing until public anger reaches boiling point. That is what has happened with taxation of multinationals. Vestager deserves congratulation for reading the mood.</p> <p>In the other corner, Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, takes the prize for misplaced indignation. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/order-back-taxes-overturned-apple-shareholders\">\u201cmessage to the Apple community in Europe\u201d</a> was a masterclass in missing the bleedin\u2019 obvious. Cook grumbled about how the commission had \u201claunched an effort to rewrite Apple\u2019s history in Europe, ignore Ireland\u2019s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process\u201d. He warned \u2013 or threatened \u2013 that jobs and investment in Europe would be at risk. Yet he failed to address the wider picture, or see the basic point that Apple has been paying so little tax in Europe that a confrontation was inevitable eventually.</p> <p>Yes, we all understand that the intellectual development takes place in California. But that does not equate to a licence to reduce the tax bill to tiny sums in territories in which the actual sales of products take place. Vestager had it right: \u201cIf my tax bill was 0.05%, falling to 0.005%, I would think I need to have a second look.\u201d</p> <p>Cook should indeed rethink. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/aug/30/ireland-gets-an-apple-windfall-but-tackling-tax-avoidance-just-got-harde\">The tax system for multinationals is in a fine old mess</a>, but a company like Apple ought to be able to recognise a few basic principles. Number one: forget the 1990s, or even the 2000s, and know when your tax-planning is just too aggressive for your customers\u2019 tastes.</p> <h2>ARM and Britain\u2019s \u2018industrial strategy\u2019</h2> <p>A landslide was always on the cards. By a majority of 95%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/arm-shareholders-softbank-takeover-tech-lord-myners\">the shareholders of ARM Holdings voted on Tuesday for their company to be sold to SoftBank of Japan for \u00a324bn</a>, a price equivalent to 43% more than the old share price. The result was never in doubt.</p> <p>Less predictable, however, has been the lack of serious fuss elsewhere about a foreign takeover of the biggest and best technology company to have come out of the UK in the past 20 years. Chancellor Philip Hammond set the tone on day one with his silly comment that the deal showed that, after the UK\u2019s vote for Brexit, the country had lost \u201cnone of its allure to global investors\u201d. Nonsense. ARM, as a firm that sells and licenses its microchips around the globe, can afford to be indifferent about the UK\u2019s membership of the EU.</p> <p>The real Brexit angle was only this: SoftBank got its offer on the table before Theresa May\u2019s government could decide whether its commitment to \u201ca proper industrial strategy\u201d should mean bids like the one for ARM should undergo a national interest test.</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s lack of concern is more alarming the more one considers how little, apart from a pay-day for ARM shareholders, SoftBank brings to the table. The Japanese firm\u2019s promise to double the workforce in the UK over the next five years commits it doing only what ARM would almost certainly have achieved under its own steam.</p> <p>At least SoftBank founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son shares ARM\u2019s management\u2019s enthusiasm for the opportunities offered by the chip-heavy \u201cinternet of things,\u201d it could be argued. Yes, but it\u2019s hard to see why ownership from Japan is an improvement on a set-up that has served ARM well.</p> <p>As a highly successful public company, ARM has never struggled to get its investment plans approved by shareholders. SoftBank, by contrast, carries a mountain of debt, has no experience in the microchip business, and has competing claims on its capital, not least a US mobile telephone business facing stiff competition.</p> <p>\u201cA proper industrial strategy wouldn\u2019t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain,\u201d said May in her one and only speech in the campaign to win the Tory leadership. The reference was to Pfizer\u2019s failed tilt at AstaZeneca in 2014. Is the UK technology industry, with ARM at its head, different? Perhaps it is, but a UK government ought to be able to explain why.</p>",

Apple wasn\u2019t headquartered in Cork for the weather.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We barely even have a language to describe this realm, let alone a way of conducting politics within and around it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the past year Amazon, bowing to political pressure, has stopped booking sales to UK customers in Luxembourg. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jan/23/osborne-google-tax-deal-vindicates-government-approach-video\" title=\"\">Google struck a deal worth \u00a3130m with the British government</a>, ostensibly to atone for years of channelling revenue through complex structures that bypassed the exchequer. No one outside the company, with the exception of George Osborne, thought the sum amounted to reasonable amends. One lesson may be that a Europe-wide regulator can twist corporate arms harder than national governments can.</p> <p>Few government agencies apply pressure harder than the FBI. Yet it failed to make Apple comply with a February 2016 court order that would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple\" title=\"\">forced it to unlock the iPhone</a> belonging to a suspected terrorist in a mass shooting. Apple refused to carve a back door into its encryptions, arguing that such a route could be used by bad guys too. Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter mumbled cautious agreement with Apple\u2019s position.</p> <p>Back on this side of the Atlantic, parliament\u2019s home affairs committee last week <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d608f40-6a16-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c.html#axzz4IppkMoMk\" title=\"\">published a report accusing online media companies</a> of \u201cconsciously failing\u201d to act against terrorist propaganda. YouTube (a subsidiary of Google), Facebook and Twitter were singled out for reluctance to expunge material venerating the likes of Islamic State. Since UK authorities have no power to demand compliance, the government is reduced to urging tech companies to behave as responsible global citizens. The companies want to help, of course, but not if it means a creeping acquisition of duties as the internet\u2019s content police.</p> <p>Whether the point of contention is political bias, porn, abuse, fraud, tax avoidance or incitement to murder, the corporations that control the new means of mass communication do not see themselves as curators of a public space. Why should they, when they are private companies? Their business is making money, not promoting social hygiene and peace on Earth. But the national authorities that are expected to enforce good behaviour within specific borders have no workable method for extending that mandate into fuzzy online jurisdictions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, users experience services provided by those private companies as public goods. No one sees a Google search as a commercial transaction, although in reality your query is a kind of payment to the company in data about the stuff that interests you and that advertisers like to know.</p> <p>Our phones are material extensions of ourselves, repositories for memories and secrets. A generation is growing up indigenous to social media, with ideas of community, belonging \u2013 their very identities \u2013 shaped by technology in ways that their parents, the befuddled digital immigrants, scarcely comprehend. <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/\" title=\"\">Facebook has 1.71 billion active monthly users</a>, many of whom treat it as their main source of news and their principle portal for communication with friends and family. That isn\u2019t a company: it\u2019s a territory more populous than any nation state. We barely even have a language to describe this realm, let alone a way of conducting politics within and around it.</p> <p>The solution probably doesn\u2019t begin with unilateral separation from the one regulatory regime in our part of the world \u2013 the EU \u2013 of a scale to command deference from multinational giants. But hunting wayward tax revenues, gratifying though it may be for the self-esteem of analogue authorities, doesn\u2019t begin to grapple with the challenge. When states manage to claw back a few dollars, or make security demands from the borderless companies that host the social lives of their citizens, they are not seriously reclaiming power. They are pleading for relevance.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who witnessed the almost unbearable drama of Heather Watson coming within <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/jul/03/serena-williams-v-heather-watson-wimbledon-2015-live\" title=\"\">two points of beating Serena Williams at Wimbledon last year</a> would struggle to recognise her as the same player who went out of the US Open in straight sets here on day two to Richel Hogenkamp, a 24-year-old Dutch qualifier ranked 135 in the world.</p> <p>There were extenuating circumstances. Watson\u2019s back looked to give up on her and Hogenkamp raised her game to a level she had rarely hit before in her career to win 6-2, 7-5. This was her first win in the main draw of a big tournament.</p> <p>The biggest win of her career, by far, was over the former slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in more than four hours in a Fed Cup match this year, the longest in the history of the competition. If that was an earthquake, this was at least an earth tremor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/johanna-konta-starts-us-open-campaign-with-victory-over-bethanie-mattek-sands\">Johanna Konta starts US Open campaign with victory over Bethanie Mattek-Sands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watson was a break down within 10 minutes on the wide open Court Four on another hot, slow-wind day, the thermometer hitting 26C (80F) before noon, and humidity rising to 59%. This is their workplace, but it is not an easy environment.</p> <p>It was getting increasingly grim for Watson; within 20 minutes she trailed 1-4, unable to get her serve clicking and hitting one sloppy forehand after another. When Hogenkamp went 5-2 up, Watson went to her chair on the changeover and dropped her head into her hands. The Guernsey player thereafter could not get going in attack, hitting a single winner in the first set, and seemed at a loss to handle the all-round competence of Hogenkamp.</p> <p>As the sun beat relentlessly on their heads, Watson took a long while at the end of the first set sitting under an umbrella held over her by a patient ballkid, as Hogenkamp idled her time away nearby with an ice pack on her head: elite tennis at its most brutal.</p> <p>With anxious staff hovering, Watson spoke at length with two medical attendants, and seemed to indicate she was having trouble moving her torso. The tears began to flow as they counselled her, and she asked to lie down on court as the physio manipulated her left side.</p> <p>After about 10 minutes, Watson went to the service line to start the second set. The best rally of the match ensued, as she chased down one clever angled shot after another, before finishing the point with one of her own, for 15-all. Whatever ailed her seemed to have passed. It was an illusion.</p> <p>Hogenkamp let her off the hook on break point and Watson held, grateful for any favours. The irony was the Dutch player, who showed no signs of distress, had at this point hit twice as many unforced errors as her stricken foe, and twice as many winners \u2013 so clearly was playing with freedom.</p> <p>Hogenkamp had lost only two points on her first serve after just under an hour of stop-start tennis. Watson was finding it tough to get a break. The British player had spoken earlier of the advantage of coming into the main draw through the qualifying tournament, and certainly Hogenkamp was moving with confidence, sure in the shot and, despite her inexperience at the highest level, playing without fear.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s movement \u2013 normally snappy and athletic \u2013 was sluggish by comparison. Every game since she had held serve at the start of the match, she found herself in a dogfight of her own making just to hold, and she was broken again in the third game. She doubled up in distress on her chair again at the changeover.</p> <p>Watson had held just twice in the match and had to red-line through deuce to get to 2-3. She then seemed to get a burst of energy from nowhere and was grateful for a Hogenkamp double-fault to gift her the break and parity in the sixth game. However, a double fault and a couple of sloppy errors handed the break back.</p> <p>This was slow, sweaty torture for Watson, but she broke back immediately when her forehand clipped the net and trickled over.</p> <p>True to script, Watson served a double fault and an ace to hold, and the pressure shifted across the net for the first time in the match as Hogenkamp stepped up to stay in the set. She served just her second ace of the match for deuce, then Watson failed to cash in on a weak second serve and the chance passed.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s suspect back seized up again in the 11th game, at precisely the wrong moment of her brief fightback. Clearly in pain, with her serve barely of club-player speed, she handed Hogenkamp three break points, two of which the Dutch player squandered before going 6-5 up in what turned out to be the longest game of the match.</p> <p>Hogenkamp could hardly believe it when Watson did not chase down a regulation return in midcourt, and was relieved when the British player put her final forehand long.</p> <p>Watson was wrecked, physically and spiritually, as she dragged herself off court in tears, and on to the treatment table.</p>",

And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that.

The company\u2019s board <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/tech-giant-arm-holdings-sold-to-japanese-firm-for-24bn\">accepted SoftBank\u2019s cash offer </a>on 18 July. The \u00a317 a share offer represents a premium of more than 40% on ARM\u2019s record closing price. The deal is expected to be completed next Monday.</p> <p>However, Lord Myners, the former City minister, said the takeover was a further example of shareholders selling out for a high price but with little regard for the long-term health of British industry. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt was a high valuation \u2026 but this is one of Britain\u2019s last wholly owned UK-based technology companies. Decisions will no longer be made in the UK and Cambridge. This is evidence of the City\u2019s predilection for selling at a [high] price and getting out.\u201d</p> <p>To secure the deal, SoftBank made legal commitments to keep ARM\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge and at least double the UK workforce from 1,600 in the next five years. The pledges helped win the approval of the government, which hailed the deal as a post-EU referendum vote of confidence in the UK.</p> <p>ARM chairman Stuart Chambers said that SoftBank\u2019s guarantees on jobs and investment were legal commitments, not merely \u201cnice ideas and promises and intents\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the post-offer undertakings that SoftBank has made, they are extremely strong, they are virtually unprecedented,\u201d he said after the shareholder meeting.</p> <p>Chief executive Simon Segars, who will stay with the company, said that SoftBank shared ARM\u2019s long-term view on investment, including retaining and developing the engineers who were essential to ARM\u2019s success. \u201cWe are not going anywhere, we are still going to be at the heart of British technology. We are growing globally because we are a global business.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis represents an exciting new chapter for ARM, and an ability to really grow and do everything we were doing and do more and do it faster.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/18/philip-hammond-softbank-takeover-arm-holdings-overseas-investors\">The chancellor's reaction to SoftBank's takeover of ARM was ludicrous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Myners told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that if ARM \u2013 which designs microchips for smartphones including the iPhone \u2013 was an American, German, French or Japanese company it would not be allowed to sell itself in 60 days and there would be a review of whether a nationally significant company should be sold.</p> <p>Myners was a minister in the Labour government during the banking crisis and as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer helped repel Sir Philip Green\u2019s attempt to buy the company in 2004. His comments echoed the views of Hermann Hauser, who helped launch ARM in 1990.</p> <p>On the day the deal was announced, Hauser said: \u201cThis is a sad day for ARM and a sad day for technology in the UK. There will now be strategic decisions taken in Japan that may or may not help ARM in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>He urged the British prime minister, Theresa May, to try to stop the takeover if she was serious about reviving the idea of an industrial strategy. SoftBank\u2019s offer has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/19/shares-in-arm-buyer-softbank-fall-10-percent\">raised concerns among Japanese investors that the company, which has $113bn (\u00a386bn) of debt, was overstretching itself</a>.</p> <p>SoftBank has said it is buying Cambridge-based ARM to get ahead in the \u201cinternet of things\u201d that connects everyday devices such as fridges to the web.</p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

The internet is an important part of the British economy but it is not necessarily where and how you gain power. In the 2015 general election, Labour\u2019s hubristic reliance on the social media echo chamber was one of the reasons it believed it was on course to win. It was wrong \u2014 and the team of Ed Miliband, Mr Corbyn\u2019s predecessor, was humiliated.</p> <p>There is no evidence that this has changed in the past year, and Mr Corbyn\u2019s promise to run \u201cthe most visible general election campaign ever\u201d confirms he does not have a strategy to counter the party\u2019s electioneering failures.

One of the proposals in his <em>Digital Democracy Manifesto</em> would be to end \u201cunjustified surveillance by CCTV\u201d, he said. Those of us who got the reference to Richard Branson\u2019s use of footage from CCTV on a Virgin train to attack the Labour leader could only applaud inwardly. Or would have done if the live video stream from the event hadn\u2019t gone down. </p> <p>I, for one, admire Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to restore the glory days of Windows 95, when the internet was swashbuckling and free and people spelled online with a hyphen. I share his vision of the information superhighway, based on high-speed dial-up for all.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist sits on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s council of economic advisers and he said that Scotland should consider having its own currency if it opts for independence. Before the 2014 referendum the Scottish government\u2019s fiscal commission working group (part of the council of economic advisers) proposed an independent Scotland having a currency union with the rest of the UK. But this may have been a mistake, Stiglitz said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They wanted the smoothest transition possible. They wanted to say that we could move from the current economic arrangement to another one while keeping our currency and keeping other forms of institutions. I think, in hindsight, that may have been a mistake. </p> <p>It would be a mistake to join the euro, by the way, so what they would have needed to do, perhaps, was resurrect the Scottish pound and let it float. </p> <p>Small countries can have their own currency. The reason that Iceland, which had one of the deepest downturns in 2008, had one of the strongest recoveries was because it had its own currency.</p> <p>If there was a Scottish pound floating, you could help stimulate the Scottish economy. The deficit would come down to make it acceptable to joining the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p>Countries that join the EU - as an SNP-led independent Scotland would want to do, if by then the UK had left - are meant to commit to joining the euro. But Stiglitz said he thought the EU could make an exception to this rule for Scotland.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there\u2019s going to be, going forward, a greater willingness - I hope there is a greater willingness - within Europe for countries to be a member of the EU but not have the euro.

This investment could be funded at minimal cost to the taxpayer and with the most rapid deployment possible, using the National Investment Bank and relying on all-time low government borrowing costs. The provision of a valuable national asset would produce significant returns over time, both in economic growth and additional tax revenues arising from growth, far outweighing the initial investment.

He said that, provided the EU were \u201crational\u201d about it, Britain could do \u201cvery well\u201d on its own.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you can negotiate a reasonable deal, and what that means is if Europe is rational and says \u2018Okay, the people of the UK have spoken, we believe in economic integration, political integration, let\u2019s do the best we can within the constraints of what has been reflected by the people in the UK\u2019 - that would mean close trade ties, closer than the WTO, other forms of economic arrangement - I think it could do very well. And that\u2019s a little bit reflected on where the markets are today. </p> </blockquote> <p>He said that the US and Canada enjoyed \u201creal shared prosperity\u201d even though they had different currencies and no shared migration. The UK and the EU could develop a similar relationship, he suggested.</p> <p>Stiglitz also said he backed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/29/brussels-ruling-could-hit-apple-with-billions-of-euros-in-back-taxes\"> the European commission\u2019s expected decision to rule against Apple\u2019s low-tax deal with the Irish government.</a> It was \u201cgreat\u201d that the EU was showing that big multinationals could not evade their tax responsibilities, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To me this is a real example of a moral depravity, if you want to think about it that way. These companies often talk about corporate responsibility. To my mind, the first corporate responsibility is paying your fair share of taxes. Unfortunately, the mindset of a lot of corporate CEOs is how do I minimise my taxes, no matter what benefits I get from the countries in which I operate.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Stiglitz also said that <a href=\"http://press.labour.org.uk/post/129975218774/labour-announces-new-economic-advisory-committee\">Labour\u2019s economic advisory committee,</a> which he sits on, has been \u201cput into suspension\u201d until the leadership contest is over.

That's practically American tradition | James Nevius</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They are, at their heart, an unresolved argument about the world as the 43rd president defined it: for worse, for much worse, and then for better.</p> <p>If you\u2019re the kind of person \u2013 on the left or right \u2013 who cannot hear the name George W Bush without foaming at the mouth, you should leave your comment or post your tweet right now. Because it\u2019s time to take a sober look at a presidency bookended by the spectacular mass murder on 11 September 2001, and the spectacular financial meltdown of 2008.</p> <p>From the rise of Isis to mass surveillance; from tax cuts for the wealthy to immigration reform; from the excesses of Wall Street to the struggles of Main Street; this election is taking place in a country that is still torn apart by the Bush years.</p> <p>Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s hyperkinetic first chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Revival-Struggle-Survival-Inside-Obama/dp/0307717429\">liked to say</a> that President Bush had left them a ribbon-wrapped gift of a shit sandwich: two wars, the worst recession in living memory and a disastrous international reputation.</p> <p>But Bush also left them a path out from his own colossal disasters: the massive government bailout of the financial sector, and a Federal Reserve prepared to take unprecedented measures to bankroll the global economy. A drone war to kill terrorist targets without boots on the ground, and a more stable Iraq that could allow for a US withdrawal.</p> <p>While Obama got to work on his special sandwich, Bush\u2019s Republican party is still stuck in the middle of it all. For the GOP can no more find its way out of the Bush debates than Britain\u2019s Labour party can decide how to deal with the legacy of Tony Blair.</p> <p>The single most contentious issue riling the Republican party is immigration: an issue that derailed Bush\u2019s presidency. After winning a second term, President Bush declared he enjoyed a considerable amount of political capital and would spend it on a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>He failed, mostly thanks to the vocal, nativist opposition of far-right talk radio hosts and their equivalent in the House of Representatives. It was the revival of those reform efforts that Donald Trump skewered so effectively in the GOP primaries, as he demolished his three biggest foes: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and, yes, Bush\u2019s brother, Jeb.</p> <p>George W<strong> </strong>Bush \u2013 along with every other sane Republican \u2013 realized long ago that the Republican party had no future as a nativist rump, hostile to the fastest-growing demographic bloc of voters in the country.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s new management team can move their candidate into this space. Despite their half-hearted spin, Trump left the indelible impression that he would deploy a deportation force against all undocumented immigrants, especially the \u201cmurderers and rapists\u201d he claimed Mexico was exporting to the US.</p> <p>The second most contentious issue of this election: how to treat Muslims and Arabs, and particularly Muslim Americans. In this area, Bush\u2019s approach was vastly more enlightened than Trump\u2019s, although it\u2019s fair to say that Genghis Khan also crossed this low bar.</p> <p>Bush visited a mosque in Washington less than a week after the 9/11 attacks to declare that \u201cIslam is peace\u201d and that Muslim Americans \u201cneed to be treated with respect\u201d. He added: \u201cWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes.\u201d (In those days it was hard to imagine a European country banning a burkini.)</p> <p>But you could also make the case that Bush stoked the politics of fear \u2013 especially in the 2002 and 2004 elections \u2013 that led directly to this point of peak Islamophobia. It was under Bush\u2019s watch, just one year after his second inauguration, that the fever took over. </p> <p>And it\u2019s outlasted the war on terror, although Trump is doing his best to revive both. His party refuses to disown him for trashing a Muslim American family who lost a son in Iraq, or for wanting to close US borders to a billion Muslims. It cannot or will not condemn him for proposing to torture detainees, in direct breach of international laws of war.<br></p> <p>Republicans cannot say where they stand on the Bush spectrum of the war on terror. Trump naturally hates it, pretending to have opposed the war in Iraq, as well as Bush\u2019s hostile turn against Russia. And the Republican foreign policy establishment hates Trump for all that and more.</p> <p>Before the Democrats feel too smug about the Bush conundrum, they should consider their own internal struggles. Much of the Clinton-Sanders battle was defined by the singular question of how to treat Wall Street: whether the bailout was justified and whether bank regulation went far enough. Many Sanders supporters remain opposed to Clinton because of her hawkish views on the Middle East.</p> <p>And for all their hatred of all things Bush, Democrats in Congress voted overwhelmingly with Republicans to stop President Obama from closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>After eight years of an economic turnaround, we have yet to resolve the debate about rescuing Wall Street. After eight years of troop withdrawals, we are considering sending troops back to Iraq and maintain what looks like a lot like a permanent force in Afghanistan.</p> <p>After eight years of Obama, we have not escaped the legacy of George W Bush. And no matter who wins, we are unlikely to do so any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Geopolitics is really starting to mess with my autumn/winter wardrobe. While the UN conveniently sits in silence, government officials around the world can\u2019t seem to shut up about what women should or shouldn\u2019t wear. </p> <p>India\u2019s tourism minister, for example, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/india-female-tourists-skirts-safety-advice\">just advised</a> that foreign women shouldn\u2019t wear skirts \u201cfor their own safety\u201d. Meanwhile a number of French mayors are nobly continuing to ban the burkini even after France\u2019s highest administrative court ruled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/french-mayors-burkini-ban-court-ruling\">ban illegal</a>.

Is a sarong just as wrong?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And I certainly don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful. I think it\u2019s great that politicians understand that women\u2019s rights are often simply a matter of the right sort of clothing. It\u2019s laudable that so many men are encouraging us to exercise sartorial safety. But here\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019re going to become the fashion police you need to take your policing a little more seriously. All of this advice is very confusing, occasionally conflicting and doesn\u2019t seem terribly well thought out. Is a skort as dangerous as a skirt, for example? Is a sarong just as wrong? And can we have an official verdict on the burkini already before burkini season is over?</p> <p>I\u2019m sure a lot of women are as concerned about inadvertently dressing inappropriately as I am. So while we wait for the UN to get their act together and sort out some sort of official female dress code we can all abide by, I\u2019ve put together some pointers on dressing while female. Please note, of course, that these are only guidelines and you should always double-check your outfit with a man. </p> <h2><strong>Bikinis in Israel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"689562ddd21c6390812a2094a2d076737fc10ada\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/689562ddd21c6390812a2094a2d076737fc10ada/0_178_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muslim women wear hijabs in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea as people play on the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel on 22 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muslim women wear hijabs in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea as people play on the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel, on 22 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the French are saying <em>non</em> to burkinis, their sluttier sister, the bikini, appears equally out of fashion in Israel.

Looking something like a kindly Little League coach, the creator of Chicago house\u2019s most psychedelically elastic basslines is joined by Peter Kay/Scarface cross Mr White, who delivers sermons on the mic.

Nearly everyone, from polymorphous UK selectors such as Ben UFO and Pearson Sound to midwesterners such as Kyle Hall, and the Afrobeat contingent, play the aluminium twang of the 808\u2019s cowbell or its parched claps and snares. Is the snobbery around preset digital sound paradoxically sending people back to the presets of an earlier era? Or, perhaps the 808 is simply the Fender Strat of the house scene. Even if there is a whiff of \u201cgood ol\u2019 days\u201d conservatism, it\u2019s conservatism that still elevates. The novelty of a Croatian festival may have worn off, but Dimensions is still paradise for anyone in thrall to a pulse.</p>",

  "<p>A teenager who was sexually assaulted at a New England prep school has spoken out about her experience and the high-profile criminal trial that followed, publicly identifying herself for the first time.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two years now since the whole ordeal, and I feel ready to stand up and own what happened to me,\u201d Chessy Prout said about why she had decided to discuss the attack. \u201cI am going to make sure other people, other girls, other boys, that they can own it, too, that they don\u2019t have to be ashamed either.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian does not usually identify victims of sexual assault, but Prout has spoken publicly about her experience. </p> <p>Prout, 17, spoke about the assault in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.today.com/news/chessy-prout-st-paul-s-school-assault-survivor-sheds-anonymity-t102326\">an interview with NBC\u2019s Today show</a> that aired on Tuesday. Prout was a 15-year-old freshman at New Hampshire\u2019s St Paul\u2019s school when her fellow student, then senior Owen Labrie, asked her on a date.

Prout said on Today that she and her family had been willing to accept a letter from apology from Labrie before proceeding with the criminal charges.</p> <p>Labrie, now 20, was found not guilty of a felony rape charge, although a jury did find him guilty of misdemeanor sexual assault. Prout said she was frustrated by the jury\u2019s decision not to convict Labrie on three aggravated rape charges.</p> <p>\u201cThey said that they didn\u2019t believe that he did it knowingly,\u201d she told Today. \u201cThat frustrated me a lot because he definitely did do it knowingly. And the fact that he was still able to pull the wool over a group of people\u2019s eyes bothered me a lot and just disgusted me in some way.\u201d</p> <p>After the trial, Labrie had been free while appealing against his conviction before a judge sent him to jail for violating the conditions of his bail. He is serving a one-year sentence.

  "<p>Apple has warned that future investment by multinationals in Europe could be hit after it was ordered to pay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest company was presented with the huge bill after the European commission ruled that a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid.</p> <p>The commission said the deal allowed Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at just 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%.</p> <p>\u201cMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules,\u201d said the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, whose investigation of Apple\u2019s complex tax dealings has taken three years.</p> <p>Vestager\u2019s ruling prompted an angry response from Apple and from Ireland and is likely to spark a political row between the US and the EU. The US Treasury said the ruling threatened to damage \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to customers, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, claimed the ruling could deal a blow to big companies investing in Europe: \u201cBeyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed.\u201d</p> <p>The commission said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements</a> with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. </p> <p>The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multi-billion euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\" data-alt=\"Corporation tax rates in Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\">Corporation tax rates in Europe</a> <figcaption>Corporation tax rates in Europe.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple and Ireland said they intend to appeal against the ruling. </p> <p>The figure of \u20ac13bn plus interest is 40 times the previous record for such a case and the equivalent of the annual budget for Ireland\u2019s health service. Irish campaigners called for the windfall to be invested in public housing. </p> <p>The taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe did not correspond to economic reality, the commission said. </p> <p>Vestager said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.\u201d<br></p> <p>Vestager suggested other countries, including the US, might now examine how Apple did business within their borders. These other jurisdictions might then claim a share of the unpaid tax from Apple for the same period. This would reduce the bill owed to Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"648ddfa547ec7e92af423759831b0d05a3ea67e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/648ddfa547ec7e92af423759831b0d05a3ea67e2/0_0_2041_3000/680.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook, Apple CEO.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook, Apple CEO.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ie/customer-letter/\">said the commission was rewriting Apple\u2019s record in Ireland</a>, overriding Irish law and disrupting the international tax system. He said Apple chose the Irish city of Cork as its European base 30 years ago and had expanded from 60 workers to almost 6,000 in Ireland. </p> <p>He said Apple would appeal and that he was confident of winning.</p> <p>Cook said: \u201cWe never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid.\u201d</p> <p>The commission\u2019s decision is a rebuff to US efforts to persuade it to drop the case after warnings of retaliation from Washington.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Apple, which changed its tax arrangements with Ireland in 2015, should easily be able to pay the huge tax bill because it has a cash mountain of more than $230bn (\u00a3176bn) of cash and securities, mostly held outside the US. The tech group keeps the money outside the US because it would be forced to pay US tax charges if it repatriated the money.</p> <p>The \u20ac13bn figure covers only the 10 years before the commission first requested information in 2013. The commission, which does not have the authority to go back any further, said it was up to Ireland to collect the tax from Apple.</p> <p>The Irish government, however,<strong> </strong>wants the ruling reversed because it wants to preserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/ireland-attracts-soaring-level-of-us-investment\">its status as a low-tax base for overseas companies</a>.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin would appeal against the ruling. He said: \u201cThe decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.\u201d</p> <p>A cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin on Wednesday to discuss the fallout from the ruling.<strong> </strong>At the heart of the Fine Gael-led administration\u2019s objections is that it would cause Ireland reputational damage in the eyes of other mainly US multinationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic.</p> <p>Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the low-tax regime for multinationals because it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/aug/30/nine-ways-ireland-could-spend-apple-13bn-payback\">A tunnel to Wales or a gallery full of Gauguins: how Ireland could spend Apple\u2019s money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner and a professor in international political economy at City University in London, said: \u201cThis is a great day for the sovereignty of the EU\u2019s nations when it comes to tax. They will now be able to choose their own tax policies knowing another state should not be consciously undermining them when doing so. The Irish state has for too long been committed to tax abuse, unfair competition and secrecy, all of which are designed to undermine fair competition and increase inequality.\u201d<br></p> <p>Prof Louise Gracia of Warwick University business school said: \u201cThis ruling is a serious attempt at curtailing the power large multinationals have in avoiding their tax liabilities, and sends a warning to countries that facilitate hard-edged corporate tax minimisation strategies.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt also shines a spotlight on the paltry levels of corporate tax that large multinationals are actually paying. Even if we accept the job and wealth creation arguments put forward by multinationals as mitigation against tax liability, this has to be within reason.\u201d</p> <p>Toby Quantrill, Christian Aid\u2019s principal adviser on economic justice, said: \u201cThe staggering amount of money at stake here suggests that millions of citizens are paying a painfully high price for multinationals\u2019 cosy tax deals with certain governments.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a one-off situation \u2013 it is part of a damaging race to the bottom in which governments are competing on who can offer multinationals the lowest tax bill. It\u2019s time to get multinationals\u2019 tax affairs out in the open, so we can all see how much they are actually contributing to the rest of society.\u201d </p> <p>In the US Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, said it was not yet clear which side would ultimately prevail, but that the ruling was a watershed moment. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling whether the verdict will stand on appeal, but we know that the landscape is changing for US corporations in the EU.\u201d </p> <p>He described Vestager\u2019s ruling as \u201cjust the tip of the spear \u2013 an enormously important ruling\u201d because US-based companies \u201chave traditionally used the EU as a way of circumventing a higher US corporate tax code.\u201d</p> <p>Apple\u2019s share price, however, was largely unmoved.

  "<p>New diesel cars are still emitting many times the official limit for polluting nitrogen oxides when driven on the road, almost a year after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-criminal-evidence\">Volkswagen emissions scandal</a> broke.</p> <p>Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Mazda and Hyundai have all launched diesel models in 2016 with NOx emissions that are far higher than the official lab-based test when driven in real-world conditions, according to <a href=\"http://equa.emissionsanalytics.com/equa-air-quality-index/\">tests by Emissions Analytics</a> (EA), a company whose data is used by the manufacturers of most cars sold in Europe.</p> <p>Ironically, the only new model to meet the limit when on the road was a Volkswagen Tiguan.</p> <p>Diesel cars must pass lab-based tests for NOx emissions but most cars perform far worse in the real world and in 2015 Volkswagen was caught using software to cheat the tests. Previous EA analysis showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions\">97% of diesels launched since 2009 exceeded the lab limit</a>.</p> <p>NOx pollution is a serious public health problem, causing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/13/government-passing-the-buck-air-pollution-campaigners\">early deaths of 23,500 people a year</a> in the UK alone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/uk-air-quality-shows-little-improvement-past-20-years-says-study\">New research</a> presented on Tuesday suggests the air pollution crisis in UK cities has not been tackled because politicians prioritise economic growth and road safety instead.</p> <p>The EU has tightened emissions regulations and, from September 2017, diesels that emit more than double the lab limit for NOx on the road will be banned from sale.</p> <p>The Emissions Analytics\u2019 road test is very similar to the new test the EU is implementing and it found that 2016 Renault Megane (1.5l engine) and Espace (1.6l) diesel models emitted more than 12 times the NOx lab limit in real-world driving. </p> <p>A Mercedes Benz CLA (2.1l) diesel emitted 8-12 times the limit on the road, while a Mazda 3 (1.5l) and Hyundai Sante Fe (2.2l) emitted 6-8 times the limit. Until the testing regime changes in 2017, it is legal to sell such high emitters. In contrast to the other vehicles, the road emissions of the Volkswagen Tiguan (2.0l) met the lab limit for new cars.</p> <p>\u201cDiesels can be clean,\u201d said Nick Molden, the EA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is about getting a [regulatory] system that forces deployment of the technology.\u201d </p> <p>Molden said the continued sale of highly polluting diesels reflected the struggle of some manufacturers to catch up and implement the emissions-reducing technology. Other carmakers, he said, have the technology in their cars already but are calibrating their engines to maximise fuel efficiency, at the expense of high NOx emissions. </p> <p>But some, such as VW, had already delivered on the most recent standard, called Euro 6, Molden said. \u201cThere is a massive irony, given that VW are the ones that have been caught. But their Euro 6 cars from the get-go have been very clean and they came in before \u2018dieselgate\u2019 blew. It is an even bigger irony than it first looks - they had already cleaned themselves up before they got found out.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Poliscanova, from the campaign group Transport and Environment, said: \u201cThe current regulatory climate in Europe sees testing authorities protecting carmakers and allowing polluting vehicles to be sold, even after dieselgate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNew on-road tests after 2017 will help and are the only way to measure accurate real-world emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut more action is necessary. In the short term governments must stand up for their citizens\u2019 health and order mandatory recalls to bring illegally dirty cars in compliance. </p> <p>\u201cIn the long term, more independent oversight, transparency and robust testing over vehicles\u2019 lifetimes are necessary for Europeans to finally enjoy the cleaner air promised to them almost 10 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Tamzen Isacsson, from the UK trade body The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on results from non-official tests where the robustness or methodology is unclear. However, SMMT and industry acknowledge the need for reform of the EU test process.</p> <p>\u201cWe support the introduction next year of a more onerous lab test that better reflects real world driving, together with an on-road Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test. This will be the world\u2019s toughest emissions testing regime.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Hyundai said: \u201cHyundai Motor vehicles on sale in the UK meet all the current regulatory standards. New Euro 6 cars are built using the best available technology and they produce less NOx emissions than their predecessors. </p> <p>\u201cHyundai Motor takes environmental compliance extremely seriously and is committed to meeting forthcoming new targets and to significantly improving the environmental performance of its vehicles.\u201d</p> <p>Spokesmen for Mercedes-Benz and Mazda said they were unable to comment on unofficial tests. The spokesman for Mazda added: \u201cIn compliance with the law, Mazda works hard to ensure that every petrol and diesel engine it makes fully complies with the regulations of the countries in which they are sold.\u201d </p> <p>Renault did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Molden said the new regime in 2017 would probably mean diesels at the smaller end of the range would no longer be sold: \u201cSome of these cars will be discontinued because the after-treatment system will just be too expensive as a proportion of the total price to work commercially. But from mid-sized cars upwards it can be done. We are talking about adding hundreds of pounds per [car], not thousands.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Consumers and collectors want sturgeon<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>caviar, snakeskin bags, shark meat and fins, wild snowdrop bulbs, precious rosewood furniture, and quality agarwood oil, as well as rare birds, reptiles, cacti and orchids. But they rarely stop to think about their origins. There are now over seven billion people consuming biodiversity every day in the form of medicines, food, clothing, furniture, perfumes and luxury goods. Demand for products drawn from nature is increasing, and with it pressure is growing on some of our wildlife species.</p> <p>Our capacity to harvest from the wild has no limits, and modern transport has no frontiers. There are 1.1 billion international tourist arrivals a year, 100,000 flights every day, and 500 million containers are shipped a year, allowing wildlife products to reach the four corners of the earth, legally or illegally. The tensions between boosting global trade, promoting development and conserving wildlife persist, in what sometimes seems like a set of objectives that are pulling in opposite directions.</p> <p>But we can also see examples where competing demands have been reconciled, such as through well-regulated trade, under the CITES treaty, of wild animals and plants, such as in the wool of the vicu\u00f1a, made into fine suits; meat of the queen conch, eaten as a delicacy; the skin of the alligator, made into watch straps; or the bark of the African cherry, turned into prostate medicine. Each has benefited both the species and local communities and their development.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Illegal trade, worth up to $20bn a year, is now at an industrial scale, driven by transnational organised criminals</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wildlife-based tourism has also greatly benefited from these strict trade controls by ensuring that the wildlife that underpins this lucrative and expanding industry is protected. The mountain gorilla is a wonderful example, where enhanced enforcement and well-managed tourism has seen gorilla numbers climbing.</p> <p>In the right circumstances, trade can be an incentive for managing wildlife sustainably. It can provide positive economic benefits for local communities, as we have seen with the vicu\u00f1a, where the numbers of wild animals have risen from 6,000 in the late 60s to more than 400,000 today. Close to 1,000 people in one Peruvian village alone are employed in the trade of its fine wool. But it can also be a threat to wild populations of animals and plants and their ecosystems if it is not sufficiently regulated or controlled, poorly monitored and managed, or conducted at unsustainable levels. </p> <p>Illegal trade, worth up to $20bn a year, is now happening at an industrial scale, driven by transnational organised criminals. It robs local people of livelihoods and countries of revenue, as well as of their natural and cultural heritage and the associated tourism potential. It can also become intertwined with legal trade, as we have seen with python skins, posing challenges for authorities and consumers in determining legal origin. It is pushing many species towards extinction.</p> <p>We also know that great conservation gains of the past can come under renewed threats, as is the case with the rhino in South Africa. Rhino poaching there was stable at about 10 a year in the decade to 2007 and rhino numbers were increasing. But then poaching increased sharply to around 1,200 last year, putting these hard-won gains at risk. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e3034cbc260bfcc9527afc3c586b1594f566f8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e3034cbc260bfcc9527afc3c586b1594f566f8d/0_119_3626_2176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black rhinoceros\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhino numbers were increasing, but over the last decade poaching has intensified.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the same period we have <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/some_positive_signs_african_elephants_continue_face_serious_threats_280716\">seen a surge in the illegal killing of the African elephant and trade in its ivory</a>, which peaked in 2011 with an estimated 30,000 elephants being slaughtered for their ivory, putting certain populations at imminent risk of extinction.</p> <p>How do we approach the legal and sustainable utilisation of wildlife in an increasingly crowded and interconnected world, where transnational organised criminals target high-value species, and where there are differing perspectives over how wildlife is utilised?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/why-the-guardian-is-spending-a-year-reporting-on-the-plight-of-the-worlds-elephant-population\">Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contemporary solutions do exist. The international community has a legally binding agreement responsible for monitoring and responding to unsustainable levels of trade in wild animals and plants and to illegal wildlife trade. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora - CITES - deals specifically with individual species that are, or may become threatened through illegal or unsustainable international trade, including listed timber, marine and aquatic species, by strictly regulating such trade; we now record over 1,000,000 trade transactions annually. Commercial trade may also be prohibited, as is necessary, such as for elephant ivory and rhino horn, and from 2017 illegal trade will also be annually reported. </p> <p>CITES has been greatly assisted by the <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), which not only first promoted the need for such a treaty back in 1963, but which has continuously provided sound scientific assessments into its decision making processes.</p> <p>Yet the world has changed a lot since CITES was adopted. In that time we have witnessed growing prosperity, changing consumption and production patterns, vastly enhanced scientific knowledge, phenomenal advances in technology and, above all, exponential growth in global trade. Since 1975 the world\u2019s population has grown from four to well over seven billion people \u2013 an additional three billion potential consumers of wildlife and wildlife products.</p> <p>And while we are fortunate to live in an interconnected world, legitimate forms of transport are exploited by transnational criminals to shift their contraband and by travellers purchasing illegal or unsustainably sourced wildlife products.</p> <p>In response, CITES has continually evolved. Emerging technologies for tracing and identifying wildlife in trade are being developed and utilised, and cooperative implementation and enforcement efforts are actively promoted and strengthened, such as though the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/prog/iccwc.php\">International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b9ba12f397dab1ad4b519d0d203706f1c177ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b9ba12f397dab1ad4b519d0d203706f1c177ff5/0_0_2180_1429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manta ray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manta rays are now being brought under CITES trade controls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Pitts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New marine species, including hammerhead sharks and manta rays, and timber species such as rosewood, are being brought under CITES trade controls, and well-targeted programmes to support parties implement these listings are in place. </p> <p>September will see the <a href=\"https://cites.org/cop17\">17th World Wildlife Conference</a>, or CoP17, convene in Johannesburg, South Africa.

The tidy two-storey brick units where many have lived for decades will be torn down because of massive levels of lead and arsenic contamination in the soil, deceptively masked by lush green grass and clumps of flowers.</p> <p>There have been concerns about lead contamination for decades, and tests by the US Environmental Protection Agency a decade ago found hot spots of serious contamination. But federal and state officials had concluded residents were not at risk until the May release of comprehensive soil test results, which showed more than half the project\u2019s yards exceeded lead levels that would trigger emergency cleanup, and many also had high levels of arsenic.</p> <p>Many residents say they were unaware of the situation until they received letters in July from the city\u2019s mayor, Anthony Copeland, noting the findings and stating: \u201cWe feel it is in your best interest to temporarily relocate your household.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d95a7275caf8c72942ca9145c5a11ce204ce745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d95a7275caf8c72942ca9145c5a11ce204ce745/0_173_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"indiana lead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lush green grass surrounding the West Calumet housing complex masks the dangerous soil contamination underneath.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kari Lydersen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, local children and adults have been getting blood tests. Many have come back showing serious levels of lead; others are awaiting their results, and still others have gotten results that are considered safe. But people who have lost all trust in official sources don\u2019t believe them.</p> <p>Parents and grandparents say they are torn between competing impulses: anxious to move out of an environment that may be causing children irreversible harm, but wary of shattering a community home to many extended families and lifelong friends.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very tight-knit,\u201d said Milton Ross, a wiry 62-year-old construction worker who lives with his mother in the complex. \u201cWhen I first heard, my heart told Jesus: \u2018Wherever we all go, I hope there are a lot of events where we can come back and get together.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>A crisis 30 years in the making</h2> <p>There have been concerns about lead contamination in the soil here since at least 1985, when a nearby lead smelter shut down. In soil tests released in 2006, the EPA found seriously elevated lead levels in some areas. Those spots were cleaned up, and in 2009 the site was added to the Superfund National Priorities List. The federal government oversaw blood tests of local children. But in 2011 a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released<a href=\"https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/424321.pdf\"> a report</a> saying that declining numbers of children with elevated blood lead levels led them to conclude the contamination did not pose a public health threat.</p> <p>The EPA cited this finding as the reason it did not more aggressively continue to test the soil, at least not until it had to develop a cleanup plan under <a href=\"https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0501433\">an agreement </a>with the companies responsible for polluting the area, the DuPont chemical company and Atlantic Richfield Company.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/in/west-calumet-housing-complex-east-chicago-ind\">The results</a> released in May showed soil in the majority of yards above the EPA\u2019s 1,200 parts per million standard for emergency cleanup. </p> <p>The EPA maintains it could remediate the soil in yards and residents could continue living there. But city officials said they think the lead stirred up during remediation would be a risk to residents. And since the city had already decided the complex would be demolished in coming years, officials decided it wouldn\u2019t make sense to remediate it.</p> <p>Now residents are getting Housing Choice Vouchers that subsidize rental units. But there are ceilings on how much rent the voucher will cover, and many prospective renters struggle to find landlords who will accept the vouchers.</p> <p>City attorney Carla Morgan said that officials are scrambling to find new homes for the 357 families who live in the West Calumet project.</p> <p>While the West Calumet housing complex will be evacuated and torn down, the EPA is testing soil across the rest of the<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/superfund/ussmelter-lead-refinery\"> USS Lead Superfund site</a>, filled with single-family homes, small businesses, multiple churches and a relatively new but now vacant elementary school. The agency has estimated 723 of 1,271 parcels in the area will need to be cleaned up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m praying,\u201d said Jennifer Sims, 57, who lives in her childhood home a few blocks from the housing project. Sims grew up playing in the housing project, and remembers that \u201cmothers and families lived on the gardens\u201d growing vegetables in the tainted soil. \u201cWhy did they do this to us?\u201d</p> <p>The impacts of longstanding lead contamination in West Calumet could also stretch to surrounding areas, where many people who grew up there have dispersed.</p> <p>Tyra Taylor, 45, raised her three kids in West Calumet. Her daughter, now 25, has epilepsy and cervical cancer, she said. And Taylor suffers from a long list of health problems including neuropathy, glaucoma and a disorder which causes her to faint frequently. Now living in a rental unit a block away, she thinks the lead and arsenic contamination explain a lot about the family\u2019s health.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the lead!\u201d she says, throwing her arms wide.</p> <p>Like many residents, she is angry that the housing authority and EPA continued to allow residents to live in the project after contamination was suspected and then confirmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee15c178162ca5398bf82229daadeb4b47c7c16c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee15c178162ca5398bf82229daadeb4b47c7c16c/0_49_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Calumet residents in East Chicago, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyra Taylor, her son, and friend Anthony Abbey in East Chicago near her home and the West Calumet housing project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kari Lydersen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Residents said they never would have moved here if they knew about the contamination, but they said they were left in the dark until just recently.</p> <p>Robert Kaplan, the EPA Region 5 acting administrator, noted that over the years there have been multiple public comment periods, meetings hosted in local libraries and postcards sent out about the soil testing and cleanup plans.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that there are newer residents and people moving in and out, so outreach can be difficult,\u201d Kaplan said, but \u201cunder the usual Superfund process, everything is public notice ...

Knowing there are hundreds of other people waiting to run with you in your local park can be a big help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"481e2fb8fb9cf1dde4c9619ae10198bb49878758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/481e2fb8fb9cf1dde4c9619ae10198bb49878758/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There\u2019s something about being in a group that seems to make running easier.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s something about being in a group that seems to make running easier.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/\">Parkrun</a> is a phenomenon. More than 1 million people in the UK have taken part in one at some point. Every Saturday at 9am, in 414 parks across the country, people of all ages, shapes and sizes run together over a three-mile course.</p> <p>My nearest one is the aptly named Parke parkrun in Devon. I\u2019ve been meaning to go for months. Finally, on Saturday, I took the plunge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f16a9a4f949b2842cb9de40cbb859aea13329c32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f16a9a4f949b2842cb9de40cbb859aea13329c32/606_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Adharanand Finn picks up a sweat.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adharanand Finn picks up a sweat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For beginners, joining a race or running with others can be intimidating. But parkrun is set up to cater for British awkwardness. While it\u2019s all very welcoming, if you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone, you don\u2019t have to. The whole thing is a template for simple efficiency. Register online, print out a barcode (which you hand in at the end), and turn up in time for the start, where volunteers will explain the route and how everything works. It\u2019s also completely free.</p> <p>Parke parkrun is in a country park and, it being August, there are lots of holidaymakers joining it. It\u2019s that much fun you\u2019ll even want to do it when you\u2019re on holiday.</p> <p>I usually plough a lonely furrow around the lanes near my house on a Saturday morning, but now I\u2019m suddenly in the excited throng, milling around, limbering up. Proper running. Once we start, everything passes in a mad blur as we dash off through the woods. There\u2019s something about being in a group that seems to make running easier \u2013 the movement of the other runners, the sense of being carried along in this flow of bodies, of being part of the charge.</p> <p>Be warned, though, you may end up running faster than you intended. I had planned to enjoy the run at a nice gentle pace but, halfway around, my competitiveness got the better of me and I started trying to pass as many people as possible. The organisers say, pointedly, that parkrun is a run, not a race, but I\u2019m not listening. I\u2019m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mo-farah\">Mo Farah</a>, making my move up the field. In the end, I finish in 4th place \u2013 just outside the medals. <strong>Adharanand Finn</strong></p> <h2><strong>Nordic walking, Edinburgh</strong><br></h2> <p>First things first: the weather is lovely. Rich, gold evening light, bone-dry grass, and \u2013 OK, you can\u2019t have everything \u2013 a naughty August wind careering through the flat expanse of Edinburgh\u2019s Inverleith park. Still, we\u2019re talking about an outdoor fitness class in Scotland. The fact that the wind isn\u2019t studding my face with a hundred tiny needles of rain makes it a resounding success before I have even strapped my poles to my hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47410b5150dc15904ef0ae1a180e3a8cc56852ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47410b5150dc15904ef0ae1a180e3a8cc56852ef/0_26_5287_3172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Making strides ... the beginners go Nordic in Inverleith park with her instructor Trevor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making strides ... the beginners go Nordic in Inverleith park with her instructor Trevor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ah, yes, the poles. I am <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Nordic-Walking-Edinburgh/\">Nordic walking</a>, which is about as inoffensive as outdoor fitness gets. It looks a bit like cross-country skiing without the skis. But if you don\u2019t like Nordic walking, you don\u2019t like life. It is a wholesome, unintimidating, cheery activity \u2013 the kind I imagine allotment owners going in for \u2013 and it uses 46% more calories than normal walking and 90% of working muscles. Also, it\u2019s Scandinavian, so it must be good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/15/sweatworking-like-networking-but-sweatier\">Sweatworking: like networking but sweatier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One woman in our group \u2013 a four-week beginners\u2019 course \u2013 is on crutches and is Nordic walking to strengthen her leg. In another weekly class at Portobello beach, two of the walkers are in their 80s. Most Nordic walkers are women. As for me, I have never done an outdoor fitness class in my life and I am usually the person walking their dog past the uptempo group doing star jumps on a Tuesday morning, pondering the point of all this hands-in-the-air bootcampery.</p> <p>But, by the time we are striding across the park with our poles softly patting the ground in our wake, I am having a blast. Dogs come and sniff our pole tips when we stop for a quick debrief. The sun dips lower in the sky. There is birdsong, laughter, the warm glow of smugness that all exercise induces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb481664c783db86db4585adc31329f70bc10d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb481664c783db86db4585adc31329f70bc10d6/0_1144_3840_3366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018 It is a wholesome, unintimidating, cheery activity.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"877\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is a wholesome, unintimidating, cheery activity.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trevor, Edinburgh\u2019s only Nordic walking instructor, took it up four years ago and is an excellent advert for its benefits: kind, chipper, slim. He talks us through the technique, which is harder than it looks; I keep \u201cspotty-dogging\u201d (when your arms go out of synch with your legs and you look like a tool). No one minds. Nordic walking is about embracing your inner spotty dog. We head for a distant corner of the park and Nordic walk up and down a precipitous hill that I would never have otherwise attempted. Beside us, another group sprints up and down the verge. I suddenly become aware that Inverleith park \u2013 a typically genteel Edinburgh green space, with its painterly views of the castle, and pond used by model boat clubs \u2013 is teeming with outdoor fitness classes. Boot camps, football games, jogging groups, buggy runs; half of the city seems to be here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/27/my-workout-gemma-louise-stevenson-wheelchair-dancer\">My workout: Gemma-Louise Stevenson, 30, wheelchair dancer \u2013 \u2018I get as sweaty as possible\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such an environment, it\u2019s hardly surprising that no one finds our merry band of Nordic walkers annoying. Rather, people smile at us fondly as they might if we were a hi-vis group of nursery children holding hands.

Their classes start at a time I am as likely to stay up until as get up for, and put a twist on your typical outdoor exercise class: along with all the running and burpees, there are frequent hugs, high-fives and, er, bum slaps. There\u2019s also chanting, cake-eating and more hugs. Did I mention the hugs? There are a lot of hugs.</p> <p>Things kick off with a minute\u2019s litter picking (the hilltop is a mess of broken glass and lager cans at 6am) before the 50 or so attendees begin a running circuit that involves various touchy-feely exercises such as joint one-legged squats. If this all seems daunting for a newcomer, the Project Awesome team ensure that it is not \u2013 newbies are made to feel especially welcome right up until the end when I am forced inside the centre of a massive group \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 hug.

The surreal atmosphere means that the workout is far less painful than it could be and several people tell me how they had previously been spending around \u00a360 a month on outdoor exercise courses before they found Project Awesome (which promises it will never charge).</p> <p>Yet, despite what seems to be an altruistic project that encourages friendship as much as fitness, Project Awesome is currently at the centre of controversy. Locals are up in arms that the \u201cspiritual\u201d atmosphere of Primrose Hill at 6am has been broken by chanting, Lycra-clad \u201chipsters\u201d and have been trying to get the class shut down. One <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/15/primrose-hill-residents-at-war-with-hipster-fitness-fanatics-who/\">report</a> said the situation had become so serious that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/liam-gallagher\">Liam Gallagher</a> had been forced to stop running there. Won\u2019t anyone think of the poor Britpop frontmen?</p> <p>It all seems pretty daft to me \u2013 the noise is minimal, local cafes get a boost (post-workout coffee is encouraged) and the place gets tidied up for free; surely the people leaving broken glass lying around would make better targets for ire? Besides, I wouldn\u2019t fancy trying to repress the enthusiastic types behind Project Awesome. \u201cSee you next week!\u201d my newly acquired exercise buddies shout as I head off. Little do they know that I don\u2019t get out of bed before 9am for anything less than a Guardian byline. Still, I spend the next 12 hours feeling pumped up and high as a kite. Awesome, in fact. <strong>Tim Jonze</strong></p> <h2><strong>British Military Fitness, Brighton and Hove</strong><br></h2> <p>The other writers on this page are going to say that their fitness classes were tough, but they will be wrong.

But it\u2019s not boot camp. We don\u2019t bawl in people\u2019s faces.\u201d Lisa, Matt and Jason will be the instructors. All are current or ex-military. There are about 30 of us civilians, an even mix of men and women. David, 50, has been coming with his wife for two years to complete his weight-loss programme. Jilly, 36, likes being outdoors and hates gyms. \u201cIt\u2019s all poncing around in there.\u201d</p> <p>We take numbered bibs from a bucket, coloured blue through red up to green to denote our fitness level. After years of football, I fancy myself a red, but there is only a blue 14 left. It turns out to suit me. We begin with a quick jog, followed by some team games passing heavy bags around and doing squat thrusts, sit-ups, press-ups, burpees (a kind of jumping squat thrust) and bastardos (I was tired by then, I forget). Afterwards, Matt takes the green group and the rest go with Jason and Lisa. We run uphill with the bags (\u201cyour injured mate\u201d). We form ranks and teams and compete to do our squat thrusts and press-ups and so on faster than each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53bd32a7452b06a38b598973a05ba292555d7c7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53bd32a7452b06a38b598973a05ba292555d7c7b/2158_0_1950_2136/913.jpg\" alt=\"A real planker ...

Leo Benedictus is pushed to the limit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is what I didn\u2019t expect: there are literally no breaks at all. We never rest. Even while the rules of a new game are explained, we have to hold ourselves in the plank position, or do more squats or lunges or something. The reward for finishing each task is the next one. We are always behind, always struggling, always being kindly but loudly told to work harder, as we grunt through the weed smoke and bemused stares of passersby. I can stop if I feel I can\u2019t go on. I\u2019ve been told that. But it isn\u2019t made easy. That\u2019s why BMF is different: you find you\u2019re more or less forced to do it.</p> <p>Some of the compulsion comes from comradeship. Working in teams, or even in a pair, makes me want to find another press-up from somewhere, because my mate just did. The rest comes from friendly shouting and punishment, for losing or for doing the wrong thing. Shattered, when I put my hands on my hips to rest, Lisa makes the whole group do three burpees, \u201ccourtesy of number 14\u201d. When David breaks another rule by telling me what I did wrong, we have to do three more. Sometimes the prize for winning is choosing the punishment for the losers. \u201cWe beast them,\u201d Lisa chuckles afterwards, \u201cbut there\u2019s always a bit of humour.\u201d I think BMF is fantastic \u2013 now it\u2019s over. I may well come back. <strong>Leo Benedictus</strong></p> <h2><strong>Our Parks, London </strong><br></h2> <p>It\u2019s somewhere in the middle of my second plank exercise that the trees stop helping to distract me. So far I have star-jumped until I was red in the face, done three rounds of sit-ups \u2013 twisting and turning like a fish on a line \u2013 and lunged across the black tarmac of the multiuse court for so long my thighs felt like they might burst into flame. Through it all, my teacher has been patient and gently encouraging. But it was the novelty of staring at the blue sky instead of a speckled ceiling tile or the horrors of a gym mirror that kept me going.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e14aa09b3cf4f8c72190751edc026bcb6d3a344\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e14aa09b3cf4f8c72190751edc026bcb6d3a344/0_367_5511_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Limbering up ...

  "<p>When we look at the rise of artificial intelligence, it\u2019s easy to get carried away with dystopian visions of sentient machines that rebel against their human creators.

Someone building a self-driving car might instruct it never to go through a red light, but the machine might then hack into the traffic light control system so that all of the lights are changed to green. In this case the car would be obeying orders but in a way that humans didn\u2019t expect or intend. Similarly, an artificially intelligent hedge fund designed to maximize the value of its portfolio could be incentivized to short consumer stocks, buy long on defence stocks and then start a war \u2013 as suggested by Elon Musk in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-film-lessons\">Werner Herzog\u2019s latest documentary</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEven when you think you\u2019ve put fences around what an AI system can do it will tend to find loopholes just as we do with our tax laws.

You make machines that are incredibly competent at achieving objectives and they will cause accidents in trying to achieve those objectives.\u201d</p> <p>To address this, Russell and his colleagues at the center propose making AI systems that observe human behavior and try to work out what the human\u2019s objective is, then behave accordingly and learn from mistakes. So instead of trying to give the machine a long list of rules to follow, the machine is told that its main objective is to do what the human wants them to do. </p> <p>It sounds simple, but it\u2019s not how engineers have been building systems for the past 50 years.</p> <p>But if AI systems can be designed to learn from humans in this way, it should ensure that they remain under human control even when they develop capabilities that exceed our own.</p> <p>In addition to watching humans directly using cameras and other sensors, robots can learn about us by reading history books, legal documents, novels, newspaper stories as well as by watching videos and movies. From this they can start to build up an understanding of human values.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be easy for machines. \u201cPeople are irrational, inconsistent, weak-willed, computationally limited, heterogenous and sometimes downright evil,\u201d Russell said.</p> <p>\u201cSome are vegetarians and some really like a nice juicy steak. And the fact that we don\u2019t behave anything close to perfectly is a serious difficulty.\u201d</p>",

As a committed global citizen, I had informed myself of the horrors of Australia\u2019s detention of those most vulnerable, of our government\u2019s rejection of humanitarian law and principles, and of the consistent denial by government ministers of the ongoing abuses perpetrated by the policies of our government.</p> <p>It is a tragedy for our nation and for those who continue to suffer.</p> <p>As an Australian, it brought me great pride to read the Weekly Review in the same edition, outlining the tireless work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/01/the-doctor-who-beat-big-tobacco\" title=\"\">Dr Bronwyn King</a>, who works against the tobacco giants to reduce the continuing havoc wreaked by the industry on vulnerable communities.

We are also brave, courageous and intelligent, capable of taking on the giants who wage war against those most vulnerable. And some of us are those children, seeking a kinder world, with hopes of peaceful lives \u2013 that can be shared with those who seek safety and security and peace.</p> <p>The Australian people are not always represented by government policies. We will not be defeated. But we must continue to act for the sake of our common humanity.<br><strong>Christine Kerr</strong><br>Marrickville, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Thank you for batting \u201cFair Australia\u201d right out of the ball park. Since 2001, the cruel trajectory of what was done to the Tampa refugees and others who followed in the so-called Pacific Solution has trashed Australia\u2019s reputation for decency and fairness. Outsourcing the care and protection of vulnerable men, women and children who legally crossed Australia\u2019s borders to claim protection, and outsourcing it to the mendicant, failing neighbouring states of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, was never going to comply with Australia\u2019s obligations under international law.</p> <p>Volunteers like me have supported refugees who set foot on Australian soil after years of suffering on Nauru, and accompanied them in their life in limbo on a temporary visa before family reunion and permanent settlement happened.</p> <p>Charities, community groups and individuals struggle to counter the debilitating despair among the \u201cboat people\u201d, and flail at the politicians and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media for perpetuating the untruths and myths about asylum seekers, who are not to be confused with illegal immigrants threatening our borders.</p> <p>A majority of Australians have a poor comprehension of refugee persecution. Nor do they understand refugee law \u2013 the human right to seek protection from persecution.<br><strong>Frederika E Steen </strong><br>Chapel Hill, Queensland, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Regarding your cover story about the appalling level of abuse at the Nauru detention centre: a humane government would surely send an independent task force immediately. It would oversee the care of asylum seekers, and establish new processes and practices to ensure the abuse will cease until an internationally acceptable alternative to offshore detention is agreed. Bickering about setting up a ponderous inquiry is unacceptable. Asylum seekers can\u2019t&#xa0;wait.<br><strong>Hannah Morrow</strong><br>Cambridge, UK</p> <p>\u2022 Australia\u2019s offshore refugee gulags, with their potent appeal to xenophobic populism, but minus the public backlash, are exactly what the politicians intended.</p> <p>Despite their reverence for fiscal rectitude, our leaders are untroubled by the huge cost of imprisoning fewer than 1,800 innocent detainees. They also seem determined to defy the UN Refugee Convention. In this they are blessed by Australia\u2019s luck in being a democracy unfettered by either a bill or charter of rights. In the right\u2019s hands, this is priceless.<br><strong>John Hayward</strong><br>Weegena, Tasmania, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Are Indigenous Australians wishing they had been able to take all arrivals from Britain and expel them to Nauru? After all, the British settlers, whether convicts or free men, decided to take over all the fertile land.

The desire for publicity ranks very high in these strategies, and however well-intentioned the decision of Le Monde and other leading French newspapers not to publish photos of those who carry out terrorist attacks may be, the attackers have a much bigger reach through social media than through print.</p> <p>The issue, as Burke sees it, is that those with an interest in these new martyrs do not look for them in the well-established print media, but have ready access to so much social media that the martyrs have also gained considerable promotion through the print media itself.</p> <p>What is needed is a deep study on how democracy in practice, in keeping with its values, can keep a watchful eye on the influence of social media through the \u201cextraordinary freedom and power of the digital revolution\u201d.</p> <p>Burke\u2019s analysis of the situation is a reminder of the reality of the media today, and what needs to be done.

  "<p>The reasons I chose to help solve problems abroad rather than at home are selfish and selfless. </p> <p> Anyone who has worked in development, humanitarianism or a social enterprise knows that the appeal of helping others is at least partially rooted in self-gratification.

My cousin pointed out a shabby desk and a few pencils as her most prized possessions, as something of which she was extremely proud. That moment was humbling in the face of the consumer culture that was already normal to me at age eight. That afternoon, I started to dream about levelling the global playing field and creating a world in which my cousins would have as much opportunity as me.</p> <p>As I grew up, I saw the irony of understanding the danger of extreme income inequality through a visit abroad. While my cousin was struggling to survive, so too were thousands of people who grew up in a 30-mile radius of me. I don\u2019t know if my lack of neighbourly empathy was a wilful ignorance coated in my own narcissism, or if it was something more rudimentary \u2013 I was treated horribly growing up. A female, a person of colour, a tomboy, non-Christian \u2013 the insults were as plentiful as the number of impoverished people in my school.

The expression \u201cgiving a voice to the voiceless\u201d seemed so trite until I realised I didn\u2019t have a voice growing up. People who looked like me were not on TV or in the media; issues facing my ethnic community were not discussed in any significant way on the national stage; the markers I associated as part of my identity were vilified as evil. The problems I faced were not deemed problems to my nation and so, I found myself gravitating away from my nation entirely. <br></p> <p>Instead, I found it easier to get lost in the problems abroad. In other countries, I was not this or that; I was simply me. I was simply there to help. I was simply appreciated. If I was questioned about who I was or the decisions I made, I always had the option to leave. At home, I understood the reasons why I, based on my background, might not be accepted.

The ruling found that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Dublin afforded Apple illegal state aid</a>, allowing the US tech company to pay as little as 1% corporate tax rate on two-thirds of its global earnings, and levies a heavier fine than expected.

The EU never obstructed the vital structural changes to the British investment and innovation ecosystem that had to be made, in or out. Now we have to deliver those reforms beset by the disastrous uncertainty of leaving the world\u2019s greatest trading bloc ... Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s current economic editor, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\">upbeat about Brexit</a>.

This clarity can only be achieved by excluding a privileged trade agreement with the UK ... The century-old British strategy remains the same, ie to weaken the forces that can make Europe stronger. The UK can achieve this by insisting on a special deal whereby the UK maintains the benefits of the union while not sharing in the costs. Such a deal would signal to other member countries that by exiting, they can continue to enjoy the benefits of the union without the costs. Such a prospect would fatally weaken the European Union.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/08/top-10-reasons-brexit-isnt-working-according-brexiteers\">New Statesman, Ian Leslie has a light-hearted but actually fairly accurate sounding guide to the top 10 reasons why Brexit isn\u2019t working \u2013 according, of course, to Brexiters</a> (sabotage by Whitehall, remainers talking down the country, untrustworthy experts, EU bureaucrats, etc etc):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the next few years, it is likely that the economy will shrink, the entire government will be consumed by trade negotiations, and EU leaders will use their considerable negotiation advantages to theatrically screw us. As this unpretty story unfolds, those who argued confidently for Brexit, in parliament and in the press, will feel compelled to maintain that they were right, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for some other impossible-to-foresee factor everything would be going splendidly. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>The obvious silver lining?

  "<p>The European commission has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">ordered Apple to pay back the Irish state up to \u20ac13bn in taxes</a> in a landmark ruling. Apple paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005% and 1%, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm. The US technology group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for countries and companies across Europe. </p> <h2>Why has the European commission ordered Ireland to claw back up to \u20ac13bn in tax from Apple?</h2> <p>The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart tax ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, saving the iPhone-maker huge sums in taxes over many years. The ruling was not only generous but gave Apple special tax treatment unavailable to competitors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules.</a> The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax.</p> <h2>Are other companies in the line of fire?</h2> <p>Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-tax-deals-with-eu-nations-ruled-unlawful\">granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively</a> \u2013 have already been found unlawful. In both cases the companies are appealing against the commission\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, competition regulators are also investigating a tax deal from Luxembourg awarded to both McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691352\"            data-video-name=\"Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5a5a9e4b04fe839bc4fcd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/30/160830applexplainerFINAL_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/30/160830applexplainerFINAL.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/30/160830applexplainerFINAL_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\">Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Will EU taxpayers benefit and will multinationals become more transparent with tax?</h2> <p>If the commission\u2019s decision is not overturned on appeal, then Ireland will have to recalculate years of back taxes and send Apple a large bill. That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations.<br></p> <h2>Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals?</h2> <p>Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">is being phased out</a>. However, Ireland has made sure it has other replacement tax breaks to keep multinationals from moving elsewhere. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/30/reports-to-offer-latest-clues-on-brex--business-live\">EU orders Apple to pay up to \u20ac13bn in Irish taxes - business live</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Will this make US multinationals bring their cash piles home?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/us-corporations-14-trillion-hidden-tax-havens-oxfam\">The last place American multinationals want to move profits is back home to the US</a>, where the 35% headline tax rate is one of the highest in the world. While many big firms worry that Brussels may try to chase these huge cash reserves, they would prefer to be taxed in Europe than America so are unlikely to repatriate funds.</p> <h2>Can Apple afford to pay back \u20ac13bn?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/02/apple-cash-mountain-grows\">Yes it can. </a>The technology group \u2013 valued at $570bn on the stock market \u2013 has a cash stockpile of more than $230bn, of which more than 90% is kept outside the US so that it does not attract US tax. Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. </p> <p>The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539.</p> <h2>What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland?</h2> <p>It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn.</p> <p>It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population.</p> <h2>Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals?</h2> <p>Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/03/george-osborne-looks-at-corporation-tax-cut-to-attract-overseas-investors\">The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax</a>. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK. That said, such moves could leave Britain looking more and more like a tax haven, and could hamper the willingness of other countries to trade openly with the UK.<br></p>",
  "<p>Soothing acoustic music drifted through the clinical, high-tech ward. As the professional musician brought the gentle sounds of her African harp to patients\u2019 bedsides, I witnessed the warming responses of relatives, staff and patients themselves. This was the most poignant, privileged and rewarding day I\u2019d experienced in more than 25 years of voluntary work.</p> <p>This was the first time live music had been played in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Manchester Royal Infirmary. I had volunteered with the charity <a href=\"http://www.musicinhospitals.org.uk/\">Music in Hospitals</a> for seven years and, after my own experience of ICU, had become convinced that the therapeutic benefits of live performance could be brought not only to patients on general wards, but to those who were critically ill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b800602c0f5d8fc4d35fbc4bed288132d1f6de2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b800602c0f5d8fc4d35fbc4bed288132d1f6de2f/0_86_360_450/360.jpg\" alt=\"Holly Marland from Music in Hospitals with her African harp\" width=\"360\" height=\"450\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holly Marland from Music in Hospitals with her African harp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Music in Hospitals</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The charity has almost 70 years\u2019 experience of providing music sessions for hospitals and other care venues. The musicians are adept at entering a ward or care home with empathy and flexibility and adjust their musical repertoire to the context. Care staff are able to continue with their duties as the musicians play, often reporting that they, too, have benefited from the relaxing and calming mood the music engenders. </p> <p>I had started to think that high-quality, live, therapeutic music could help critically-ill patients after I was an ICU patient myself in 2015 following unexpected surgery. Thanks to the devotion of the clinical teams, I survived. I have spent every day since expressing gratitude for being alive, though I never anticipated that recovering my pre-illness life and livelihood was going to be as tough as it has been. </p> <p>One abiding memory of the ICU is constant, frightening noise. Imagine lying on a bed, unable to move, blink, speak or control your own pain relief. You may just about be conscious and aware of high levels of activity around your bed, around the clock. The whirring of machines and the ringing of alarms, bleeps and phones are part of the aural landscape, 24 hours a day. Hearing appears to be the only sense that still works. </p> <p>When I was moved off the ICU on to a high-dependency unit, I briefly heard singing from a television \u2013 beautiful, harmonious, melodic. The calming music temporarily blocked out the hospital noise and brought me into the present, reminding me I had a life to go back to. After hospital discharge, I\u2019d wake up in the night with the unnerving noises of ICU going round in my head. I learned to focus instead on remembering that one lovely sound \u2013 the singing. This aided my recovery. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/jul/07/tweet-foodbank-twitter\">My first tweet was for custard, then tinned potatoes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through attending a Manchester patient support group, I met Natalie Mason, critical care followup lead at the royal infirmary ICU. I learned of her enthusiasm to bring live music to the unit, in conjunction with a new project to reduce stressful noise levels on the unit. That was it. I was determined it would happen. Thankfully, Music in Hospitals endorsed the idea and named it ICU-hear.</p> <p>It was a pilot \u2013 there is currently no research evidence of music therapy on adult in ICUs in the UK \u2013 but one that worked gratifyingly well. There were smiles and tears from relatives as their loved ones responded. One patient surprised everyone by opening his eyes and singing along with the harp player, Holly Marland. His relatives were overcome. An otherwise stressful environment was momentarily transformed.</p> <p>I spoke to relatives afterwards. Their feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Far from feeling it inappropriate to have had a music performance in an environment where their relatives were gravely ill, they thought it had been a welcome and heartening respite. </p> <p>More hospitals are now interested in the ICU-hear project, which is being fully evaluated. I\u2019ve been able to contribute to making a difference to people\u2019s lives, in a way that has never been possible in my remunerated working life. That has improved my own wellbeing.

  "<p>In the sleepy hillside town in al-Balqa, not far from the Jordan Valley, a grand project is taking shape. The Middle East\u2019s new particle accelerator \u2013 the Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications, or Sesame \u2013 is being built. </p> <p>In a region racked by violence, extremism and the disintegration of nation states, Sesame feels a world apart; the meditative peace of the surrounding countryside belying the advanced stages of construction inside the site, which is due to be formally inaugurated next spring, with the first experiments taking place as early as this autumn.</p> <p>It\u2019s a miracle it got off the ground in the first place. Sesame\u2019s members are Iran, Pakistan, Israel, Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Bahrain. Iran and Pakistan do not recognise Israel, nor does Turkey recognise Cyprus, and everyone has their myriad diplomatic spats.</p> <p>Iran, for example, continues to participate despite two of its scientists who were involved in the project, quantum physicist Masoud Alimohammadi and nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari, being assassinated in operations blamed on Israel\u2019s Mossad. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re cooperating very well together,\u201d said Giorgio Paolucci, the scientific director of Sesame. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many places there are where all these governments have representatives who have the opportunity to come and talk to each other,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In council meetings, representatives of governments meet and discuss technical issues, and come to agreements, the talks untainted by the perpetual enmity outside the conference halls.</p> <p>At 130 metres in diameter, Sesame\u2019s particle accelerator is dwarfed by the Large Hadron Collider, the immense structure in Switzerland that last year detected the \u201cGod particle\u201d, otherwise known as the Higgs Boson, an elementary particle that gives other fundamental particles their mass. But the project is sophisticated and could have many applications and offer research opportunities for a region that has long grappled with funding shortfalls and lack of political will in the advancement of science.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many applications that actually we are somehow limited by our fantasy,\u201d said Paolucci. \u201cYou can study almost anything. Here we can study everything from isolated atoms to human beings and everything which is in between these two extremes is allowed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ffcc320890831ddd7d2a1ae9c3e04a77d848dd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ffcc320890831ddd7d2a1ae9c3e04a77d848dd4/0_228_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker looks at research data at the Sesame facility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker looks at research data at the Sesame facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kareem Shaheen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sesame is a synchrotron \u2013 a large device that accelerates electrons around a circular tube, guided by magnets and other equipment, close to the speed of light. This generates radiation which is filtered and flows down beamlines \u2013 essentially long pipes in which instruments are placed to collect the radiation and perform the various experiments.</p> <p>Sesame\u2019s scientists plan to open the synchrotron with three main beamlines, though the project can house up to 20. The first is an X-ray beam which scientists say can be used to analyse soil samples and air particles, identifying contaminants in the environment, as well as, potentially, their sources, in a region suffering from high levels of pollution.</p> <p>The second will be an infrared beamline, which will allow researchers to study living cells and tissue. Some preliminary tests at the centre have focused on studying the evolution of breast cancer cells, potentially opening avenues that would help with much earlier detection.</p> <p>The last beamline, currently under construction, will be used in protein crystallography, a technique that would allow scientists, among other applications, to study in more depth the structure of viruses and develop drugs that are better able to target them.</p> <p>Paolucci also hopes to add an imaging beamline \u2013 which has a range of uses, from allowing researchers to study archaeological artefacts with more precision and without having to transport them outside the region, to photographing things as subtle as the muscular movements of a fly. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIKl_JMrYuE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yIKl_JMrYuE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Imaging technology captures the movements of a fly</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Archaeologists in Italy have used imaging beamlines in projects as intricate as the study of burnt manuscripts buried in the city of Herculaneum after the legendary eruption of Mount Vesuvius, allowing them to identify the Greek letters in the manuscripts without having to unfold them and risk their disintegration.</p> <p>Beyond that, Sesame\u2019s creators hope it will spur scientific progress in a region long beset by conflict and strife, offering access to resources that are plentiful in the west but limited in the Middle East, allowing scientists, whether from Israel or Iran, to come together to study the fundamental elements of nature.</p> <p>Member states also hope to limit some of the region\u2019s brain drain, which is driving young people to research facilities abroad, as well as profit from the expertise they gain from the experiments that will take place. </p> <p>Those working on the project, which costs over a $100m (\u00a375m), have not lost sight of the big picture either.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go to any university in the region you see more students than any university in Europe,\u201d said Paolucci. \u201cClearly there is a need there to have a centre like this, and with time it will also be beneficial from an economic point of view.\u201d</p> <p>As Paolucci walked around the massive hall housing the particle accelerator, he stopped to survey the intricate equipment and the machine taking shape before his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing the things you can do,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>On our fourth day of walking, the forest grew sparser and the trees themselves shrank to dwarf birches and then to clumps of shrub willow in the sheltered parts of the valley. We entered a world of rock and water, thin grasses and lichen, in which nothing moved but the wind, which was never still. The simplicity of the landscape was overwhelming and I surrendered to it completely. Cold, hunger and fatigue were the only distractions on offer, but none remained very pressing for long. Just walking among the <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/LsU2FE\" title=\"\">mountains of the Swedish Arctic</a> filled my senses for the next eight days, and sharpened them until I could see and smell and even hear the world around me properly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/20/scandanavia-adventure-holidays-norway-sweden-denmark-iceland\">Wild Scandinavia: adventure without breaking the bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last night of the journey was spent on the shore of an enormous <a href=\"http://energy.gov/eere/water/types-hydropower-plants\" title=\"\">hydroelectric plant</a>. There was still no electricity, no noise and no running water, but we could see in the twilight electric lights in the far distance on the other shore.</p> <p>But the sight of <a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html\" title=\"\">machine civilisation</a> had no effect on my wilderness perceptions, any more than looking at photographs of the wilderness in a busy office can restore the quality of attention that you have when inside it.</p> <p>The first thing I stopped noticing after we left the wilderness and disembarked was the ground beneath my feet. We were on a tarmac road, and every step landed on exactly the same surface as the one before. There was no need to place my feet. The focus of attention shifted. Now there were things to read in the environment \u2013 a rusting van from which all the wheels had been removed rested by the side of the road, with a logo still painted on its side for \u201cAll wheel drive\u201d.</p> <p>Within the hostel I stopped thinking about light. It was something that came on with a switch. Once I had power over it, I stopped noticing anything remarkable about it. Water was no longer a substance with weight that had to be hauled up from the rivers, but just a convenience. One less thing to think about. Instead, my attention moved to blocking people out. There were so many of them. There might have been 20 at any one time in the front parts of the hostel and this was five or six times as many strangers as I had grown used to. It made for a lot of other people\u2019s conversations to tune out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The night train brought me down to Stockholm, where my shield of inattention grew very much thicker and heavier</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Within 24 hours we had reached a small, quiet town and my reawakening skill of not noticing things, of coping with constant distractions, was put to a real test. It failed. I found I could not stand restaurants with any kind of piped music. It wasn\u2019t the volume: the noise of a train pulling into the station was much louder but not disturbing. Nor was it necessarily the music. It was the demand that I listen to it while thinking about something else, even if that was only whether to order the smoked reindeer hash.</p> <p>The night train brought me down to Stockholm, where my shield of inattention grew very much thicker and heavier. After a couple of days there I felt like a lobster, armoured all over against the world around me. I no longer smelled the traffic fumes. I couldn\u2019t hear music in restaurants. I could sit on a plane with 120 other people and notice them only as obstacles in the gangway.</p> <p>In London the transformation to everyday urban reality is complete. The only way I can write this piece is by clamping a pair of headphones on and putting on music to which I will half listen \u2013 paying it just enough attention that it blanks out all the other sounds of the office while not appearing as anything distinct itself. The only stimulations I can notice are oversized or unnatural ones. But I find that I crave these. Even lobsters want to be tickled.</p> <p>In a few more days, all this will seem entirely natural. It\u2019s a process one goes through at the end of every restorative holiday. But the ability to function in a constantly distracting world is bought at a real price. Distraction becomes the whole of the environment. Reflective thought becomes almost impossible. It\u2019s harder to solve difficult problems and after a while harder even to recognise them. The world becomes simpler and full of frustration. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNi2x3cwxOQ\" title=\"\">Welcome to the working week</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The NHS is faced with a rising tide of demand for care combined with a tight rein on both NHS and social care finances. The impact of these pressures is seen across the health and care system. It manifests itself obviously in delayed transfers out of hospitals.<br></p> <p>Year on year these delays are rising, with more people staying in hospital when they don\u2019t need to be there. It has an impact on the care of some of the frailest and most vulnerable people and is the subject of continued attention from the media, healthcare regulators and politicians.</p> <p>When media and commentators discuss this issue it\u2019s only a matter of time before a certain horrible term is used \u2013 \u201cbed blocker\u201d. </p> <p>The phrase \u201cblocked bed\u201d originated in the UK in the late 50s, driven by hospital clinicians\u2019 concerns about a lack of beds. Its use grew between 1961 and 1967, when the elderly population increased by 14% while bed numbers remained static. In 1986 \u201cbed blocking\u201d made its first appearance in a British Medical Journal headline. Although it was not accepted as a medical term, by the 90s it was being widely used by health economists as a marker of inefficiency.</p> <p>The term persists to this day, despite many efforts to move away from it, such as the Department of Health\u2019s redefinition of delayed discharge and delayed transfer in April 2001.</p> <p>Surely the time has come to remember to whom bed blocking is referring. These \u201cblockers\u201d are often older people, who are frail and vulnerable and who would like nothing more than to return home to their families. The phrase \u201cbed blocker\u201d puts all the emphasis, and blame, on the individual. The reality is that it is the system that has failed to move quickly enough to put together the right package of care to enable the person in the bed to return home.</p> <p>Language matters. How we talk about people reflects how we treat them and, in the health service, how we engage them in the care they receive. When we stop talking about people as people and instead use the language of the system (units, targets, blockers) we risk undermining the compassionate care the health service was created for and has delivered for almost 70 years.</p> <p>I rarely hear anyone who works in the health and care sector use this phrase. Those working with and caring for people see the individual. They know their individual stories and what matters to them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/apr/08/english-language-requirements-foreign-doctors-not-fit-purpose\">English language requirements for foreign doctors are not fit for purpose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a quiet revolution under way in the NHS. It\u2019s increasingly recognised that people should no longer be seen as passive recipients of their care but as participants in both the decision making process and the care they experience.</p> <p>This is the right thing to do and what people want. But it is also a response to people\u2019s changing health needs. With more and more people managing long-term conditions, sometimes more than one at a time, the old \u201cpatch \u2018em up, ship \u2018em out\u201d approach is a thing of the past. The health service needs to work with people to manage their own care, and this means understanding their individual circumstances, wants and needs. To do this well also means looking beyond the health service towards their family life and other institutions like local government, schools and community groups.</p> <p>The NHS Confederation brought together experts from across health and care to form a commission on improving urgent care for older people. In Sheffield, new processes discharge many more patients home, to be assessed there rather than in a mock environment in the ward. A saving of more than 30,000 bed days was recorded there over the first year and people report better experiences of care.</p> <p>North east London foundation trust and the London Ambulance Service have together provided a home-based emergency assessment and care package for people who fall, resulting in only one in 20 recipients being admitted to hospital within 48 hours. There are similar examples in Derbyshire, Oldham, Greater Manchester, Norfolk, Aintree and right across the country. </p> <p>The NHS has a way to go in making sure these examples make up a default approach. But the term \u201cbed blocking\u201d is unhelpful and arguably one of the most inappropriate terms in the healthcare lexicon. Let\u2019s consign it to the dustbin and focus on what we know works both for the individual and the health and care system.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s clearly doing something right\u2019 </em><em>- </em>Canary Wharf Jazz Festival</h2> <p>The Canary Wharf Jazz Festival is a free two day jazz music event held each August in Canada Square Park in London\u2019s Docklands. The performers, many of whom have received music industry awards, are all UK based. The festival feels local with the audience travelling in each day. I went with my partner and 14-year-old daughter. Julia Biel was the performer we enjoyed seeing most this year. </p> <p>The environment is very family friendly. The organisers even hand out picnic mats to people who haven\u2019t brought their own. One year when it started to rain, they offered everyone plastic ponchos. This year was the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival\u2019s tenth anniversary and it was very well attended, so it\u2019s clearly doing something right. I\u2019ll certainly be back next year. <em><strong>Alex Flynn</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d7d0f81c14a0ea05abb26d45beab850878b2f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d7d0f81c14a0ea05abb26d45beab850878b2f6/0_0_1200_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supremely talented jazz vocalist Julia Biel and band smile and play on as strong winds force open the back curtains and blow across the stage at the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival, London 20 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supremely talented jazz vocalist Julia Biel and band smile and play on as strong winds force open the back curtains and blow across the stage at the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival, London 20 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AlexFlynn/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018The festival has stolen my heart\u2019 - </em>Sunflowerfest 2016, Northern Ireland<br></h2> <p>I lived in London for 25 years but moved to Northern Ireland five years ago. I\u2019ve been going to Sunflowerfest every summer since. The festival is very well organised with different sections for family camping, singles camping, rowdy camping, showers utilising compost for energy and various activities for kids.</p> <p>The festival focuses mainly on local musicians, but a few fairly big name bands always headline the event. There\u2019s always a great atmosphere, with the bands enjoying themselves around the festival when they\u2019re not performing. My favourite performers were the band The Twisted Sisters - an irreverent bunch who sing songs about Guinness, potatoes and big knickers! Apart from the headliners they attract the biggest crowd. I also really enjoy a singer called Amanda St John who has a big band soul and jazz sound. The harpist Ursula Burns was great too. I used to go to the festivals in England such as Reading every summer. I loved them but Sunflowerfest, although being a lot smaller and a completely different kettle of fish, has stolen my heart and will always be my favourite festival experience. <strong><em>Debbie Deboo</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caff5ce0c85a29f5e1f54259790756d7a7247da3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caff5ce0c85a29f5e1f54259790756d7a7247da3/0_0_1182_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunflowerfest 2016 - \u2018it will always be my favourite summer festival experience\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"882\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunflowerfest 2016 - \u2018it will always be my favourite summer festival experience\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Debbie Deboo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018The whole crew is like a giant family\u2019 -</em> Eisteddfod, Wales</h2> <p>I\u2019m from a village just a few miles away from Llangollen in north-east Wales, where the Eisteddfod festival is held every year. I haven\u2019t missed a festival since I was born, so I\u2019ve been to 20 of them. 21 If you count when Mum was five months pregnant with me. </p> <p>I was working there this year. I\u2019m part of the sound crew on the main stage, which I\u2019ve continued to do every year since I did it for Year 10 work experience. The festival is generally well organised, although it had a few hiccups as with any event of its scale. People come for the wide variety of competitions during the daytime. Others come for the evening concerts that are the main attractions. This year the biggest names were Collabro, Bryn Terfel and Jools Holland. Others just come onto the field for the stalls, performances on the outside stages or the general buzz of all the international competitors. </p> <p>The best experience is definitely working with the rest of the sound and backstage crew during the week, and doing so on such a unique festival just a few miles from my home in a gorgeous setting. The whole crew is like a giant family. In addition meeting people from so many different countries and creating friendships over the week is brilliant. I\u2019ll be doing it again without a doubt! <strong><em>Eluned Ashwood</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"870d98a66904507e5be8846dd7acea01232a134e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/870d98a66904507e5be8846dd7acea01232a134e/0_0_640_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eluned Ashwood/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s a perfect way to discover more of my country\u2019s diverse culture\u2019 - </em>Sinulog, Philippines</h2> <p>I\u2019m originally from Cebu, Philippines. Sinulog is a yearly event in the city, where dancers from the different provinces in the Philippines perform. That\u2019s the main attraction. Every contingent of dancers will have their different custom themes and usually surprise and stun the audience in equal measure with their performances. This year I went with a colleague. There\u2019s always a plethora of people there, more or less three million, and I wish more would be done about crowd control. </p> <p>Sinulog is a cultural fiesta and is a perfect way for me and others to witness and discover more of my country\u2019s diverse culture. I\u2019m a history buff and anything that is cultural for me is great. It\u2019s a busy street parade and you have to do a lot of walking. Commuting is very hard at that time. Each year more and more contingents are joining, not only in the Visayas region but also in Mindanao \u2013 a region that\u2019s very rich in culture and where tribal traditions are still evident. I\u2019ll definitely go again. <strong><em>Jennin Bartolata</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5deae46a6722bfc22fea15da4812d3d6e86312bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5deae46a6722bfc22fea15da4812d3d6e86312bb/0_0_1856_1233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dancers at Sinulog - an annual cultural and religious festival held in Cebu, Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancers at Sinulog - an annual cultural and religious festival held in Cebu, Philippines</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennin Bartolata</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><em>You do need to enjoy a party</em><strong><em>\u2019 - </em>The Berlin Carnival</strong><br></h2> <p>This was my first time in Berlin, but I joined my sister who has been many times. A group of 18 of us travelled. We met more Londoners once we were there. The festival was very well organised. It all started with a J\u2019Ouvert party, where festival goers cover each other in paint and power. This was swiftly followed by a fire fete, boat party, roof top party, beach party, glow party, the actual carnival day and a closing party. There was no trouble, no problems, and plenty of rum. You do need to enjoy a party though! <br></p> <p>Ricardo Drue, Patrice Roberts and Lyrical were headlining the event, but I think most people were really looking forward to the selection of DJs who had flown in from around the world. These included Private Ryan from Trinidad and Tobago, American DJ Stephen and DJ Tate and Triple M from the UK. Flying home on a Tuesday with a hangover was tough but worth it. <strong><em>Katrina Frazer</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"add770f5fb186f355e2c23566969bfc56e62d558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/add770f5fb186f355e2c23566969bfc56e62d558/0_0_1200_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berlin Carnival Beach Party 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berlin Carnival Beach Party 2016</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katrina Frazer/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s a a wonderful piece of popular Andalusian culture\u2019 -</em> Sherry Festival, Spain</h2> <p>This summer I was at the<strong> </strong>Sherry Festival in the Spanish town of Sanlucar. We were staying in Cadiz and had hoped that there may be a festival in the region somewhere. We\u2019d had such a great time a couple of years before at a festival in Cordoba. The festival was very well organised with a cabaret and music tent, various sherry producers with outlets and a fairground. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of popular Andalusian culture with a lovely, warm atmosphere.

Thousands of Brits head to the sleepy island of Pag in Croatia every summer to see the best DJs on the planet. As the focus is on dance music, it felt like lots of people had come to enjoy the vibe and the parties, rather than to see one specific act. Then again, Craig David was a highlight for me and plenty of others! </p> <p>The festival was really well organised. The combination of the beach and guaranteed sunshine made for a great experience. I thought it was a shame it was nearly all Brits attending. I\u2019d hoped it might feel a little more international. Rather than going to this one again, I\u2019d prefer to check out some other festivals around Croatia in the future. There are plenty of new ones to discover every year.</p> <p>My favourite ever summer festival experience was seeing Stevie Wonder at British Summer Time in Hyde Park a few years ago. I remember the sun was just setting as he played \u201cYou Are The Sunshine Of My Life\u201d.

With such a variety of music on offer it attracted different crowds, and I was able to enjoy each night as a kind of stand alone mini festival. <br></p> <p>Sigur Ros were incredible. The arching shape of the venue amphitheatre just seemed to lock the sound in with us, under the stars, by the waters edge. And the photo I took of Catfish and the Bottlemen was how the music felt to me. They really did get great feedback from the crowd. The venue space was limited, but it was really well organised. It was obvious the organisers had picked bands that would fit the space well. <strong><em>Colin Moody</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8380fb00b53714c9fa4d3625e8d922e391209566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8380fb00b53714c9fa4d3625e8d922e391209566/0_0_1200_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This space is normally just a concrete no where space and then they set up this festival - Bristol Summer Series - and wow.

Many English festivals have horrendous problems with stage times overrunning, but this one was very well organised. Everything ran like clockwork and you could guarantee everything would be on time.<br></p> <p>As a keen photographer it was the opportunity to photograph big name acts that appealed to me. Muse were a highlight, however the likes of Chemical Brother and Massive Attack provided some pretty spectacular live shows.</p> <p>The weather itself was both the best and the worst thing. The hot weather was great. You could spend most of the day at the beach before the music started. The temperatures dropped a little in the evening which was perfect, and waking up every morning to a cold shower to get rid the heat, with the backdrop of the mountain range in the background, was very special. <strong><em>Lewis Evans</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6e5dc6dcaafbc9bfc3d2a8283c73245c1d389f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e5dc6dcaafbc9bfc3d2a8283c73245c1d389f9/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muse at this year\u2019s Benicassim Festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muse at this year\u2019s Benicassim Festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewis Evans/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em><strong>\u2018I</strong>t was an occasion of sheer joy\u2019 - </em>Halifax Pride Festival, Canada</h2> <p>I\u2019m originally from Palestine and had my first experience of the Halifax Pride Festival in Nova Scotia this year.

Bands like Suede, The xx, Placebo, The National, Foals, Kasabian, The 1975, John Newman, The Vaccines, Hurts, The Chemical Brothers, Years &amp; Years and The Neighbourhood have all played great sets over the years.

I was sitting underneath a gigantic crimson statue of a robot when I met him. We talked effortlessly for a few minutes and learned that we lived a thousand miles apart. We were both college students, his focus in philosophy and mine in education. He taught me about Friedrich Nietzsche and I taught him about blue whales. He asked if he\u2019d see me again tomorrow, to which I replied: \u201cYou can try.\u201d</p> <p>We met again at Coachella last April under a cluster of flowers that spelled out \u201cBESAME MUCHO.\u201d On the last day we ran after a gigantic beach ball that bounced across three crowds until it lay deflated and crumpled on the ground. We draped it around us like a cape and called ourselves King and Queen. </p> <p>I got a second job scooping ice cream this summer so that I can afford to go visit him. I leave in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ll take turns doing that for a while until we can really be together. It seems illogical that two people who have only met twice in their lives can plan a future together, but as Nietzsche most eloquently puts it; \u201cThere is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.\u201d<strong><em> Rosie Burnham</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>\u201cWhat I miss about old Hollywood,\u201d says Blake Lively, \u201cis that back then you got to watch movie stars and imagine they <em>were</em> that person.

She glides into this Cannes hotel at 2pm in stilettos and floor-length gold velveteen gown, with drop sapphire earrings and waves of blond hair that would make Hitchcock weep.</p> <p>Lively is the epitome of the palatably popular modern movie star. She is married to another of them \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-reynolds\">Ryan Reynolds</a> \u2013 and, like him, is a big hit with both genders. She posts on Instagram (cakes, frocks, lols with the makeup lady) but keeps it classy, and ringfences her private life. She commands huge advertising contracts (L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Gucci), yet somehow makes her commitment to even the biggest brands feel organic. Her stock-in-trade is approachable but aspirational.</p> <p>The surprise this season has been that she also happens to be pretty good at acting. Having cut her teeth on a six-year TV show (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/dec/11/gossip-girl-box-set\">Gossip Girl</a>) and broken into cinema via 2005 teen product <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/aug/26/2\">The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants</a>, Lively long seemed a little vanilla. But just as Reynolds turned round his career by showing off his chops in a one-person-in-peril movie (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/30/buried-film-review\">Buried</a>), so too has his wife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c1bd197e4d70265feda0ce1a2cdcc0fc1e9fc3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c1bd197e4d70265feda0ce1a2cdcc0fc1e9fc3a/4_34_4934_2960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surprise hit \u2026 Blake Lively in The Shallows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surprise hit \u2026 Blake Lively in The Shallows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/the-shallows-review-blake-lively-shark-thriller-jaume-collet-serra\">The Shallows</a> was this summer\u2019s surprise breakout hit, hauling five times its budget and showing Lively could carry a film single-handed. She spends almost 90 minutes battling a shark, on a remote rock, in a bikini, with just an injured seagull for company. She looks fantastic, but that\u2019s not the reason you can\u2019t take your eyes off her.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so emotionally demanding,\u201d she says. \u201cWith those isolation movies, there\u2019s no one to talk to and you\u2019re often not speaking much. You do 16-minute takes of going from happy to watching someone die, to screaming, to pain, to fighting. So you\u2019re just physically drained at the end of the day.\u201d Plus there was all the swimming, \u201ca ton of underwater work\u201d, no stunt double until the last two weeks \u2013 and then mostly because her second pregnancy was starting to show.</p> <p>She will shortly be appearing in Marc Forster\u2019s new thriller <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4486986/\">All I See Is You</a>, as a blind woman who regains her sight. And this Friday sees the release of Caf\u00e9 Society, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen\u2019s latest</a>, in which she\u2019s out-of-the-blue captivating: breezy, funny and touching as a divorcee socialite in 1930s Hollywood who catches the eye of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jesse-eisenberg\">Jesse Eisenberg</a>.</p> <p>Shooting Caf\u00e9 Society was like a wonderful dream, she says, more like being in a play than a film. \u201cThe movie you see is often very different from the movie you shoot. The magic comes together in post-production. But when you\u2019re on a Woody Allen set, you look around and think: \u2018We\u2019re making a Woody Allen movie!\u2019 He creates the environment around you.

Hollywood in the 30s \u201cwas a very domineering industry. They decided who people would date, the movies they would do, and they would block people\u2019s careers if they wanted to promote someone else.\u201d Plus, women like the one she plays could only be free for a certain time before getting shackled to the sink. \u201cIt was a very patriarchal society and women were meant to stay at home and raise the kids. You hoped to find a loving and successful husband, because men were the ones who were able to be breadwinners. Now women can exist in both worlds. There\u2019s still a vast amount of inequality but it\u2019s better.\u201d</p> <p>While Allen and Eisenberg share with the film a disdain for name-dropping and star worship, Lively, careful to accommodate the average Joe, says encountering famous people is something that \u201cgeeks me out but I\u2019m also intimidated by it\u201d. She tells a tale about being snapped next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> at the Met Ball. \u201cThe <em>first</em> thing I want to do,\u201d she says, \u201cis find that picture online and say, \u2018Beyonce knows my name!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Caf\u00e9 Society is out in the UK on 2 September.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot shorter in real life than I thought!\u201d says the teenager in front of me, grinning nervously. \u201cWell, YouTube makes me look bigger than I am!\u201d I shoot back. It\u2019s a terrible line, and given how many times my viewers have enthused about my small height, I should really have thought of a better reply by now. But it\u2019s difficult to be sharp when you\u2019re into the third hour of signing autographs, smiling for selfies and trying to hear what people are saying over the pounding music coming from a nearby gaming booth. I\u2019m at Insomnia 58, a video games convention that has grown tremendously in the past couple of years. Previously, it was held in one hall of Coventry\u2019s Ricoh Arena, before it spilled out into the adjoining football pitch, and now, Insomnia 58 has taken over the Birmingham NEC and is to get even bigger.</p> <p>Originally, Insomnia was a convention where PC gamers could bring their own PCs and hook them up together in order to play multiplayer video games throughout the night \u2013 hence the name. But as Insomnia grew, it started hosting competitive video gaming tournaments, where teams could win big money playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/07/counter-strike-global-offensive-preview\">Counter Strike</a>, Call of Duty and StarCraft 2. Now the four-day event has expanded to include Minecraft mini-games, cosplay competitions, merchandise booths, tabletop gaming, video game booths, stage shows and meet and greets with YouTubers such as Syndicate, AmyLee33, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/31/the-diamond-minecart-pewdiepie-youtube-minecraft\">The Diamond Minecart</a>, NettyPlays and The Creatures. </p> <p>Incidentally, hello! I\u2019m <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/yogscastkim\">Yogscast Kim</a>, a YouTuber \u2013 Yogscast was originally founded by my friends and colleagues, Simon and Lewis, who found their fame making videos on World of Warcraft eight years ago. Since then, their channel and popularity skyrocketed, allowing them to expand their network to include several more personalities, each with their own YouTube channel. I\u2019m a relatively new addition, and my channel currently has 750,000 subscribers and over 141m views. My speciality is playing horror games while hiding behind my fingers, raging out at multiplayer titles like Mario Kart, and using the wrong tools in Minecraft.</p> <p>Insomnia has become a great place for YouTubers to meet their audience. It\u2019s given the Yogscast the space for our own signing booth, where I spent this weekend, sat behind a table, next to my pile of Sharpies. Friday\u2019s queue ran to a three-hour wait, a fact that boggles my mind. But despite the wait, everyone I met was super happy, with a fair few squeals of excitement and nerves as they\u2019ve put something in front of me to sign. </p> <p>Today, I\u2019ve signed posters, T-shirts, phone covers, baseball caps, tickets and three people\u2019s arms; one of which was in plaster cast. The weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever signed has to be a ziplock bag of Tabasco sauce that was oddly warm to the touch. I\u2019ll be honest, that bag still haunts me to this day, as does the knowing grin of the teenager who proudly put it down in front of me. </p> <p>Professionally, it\u2019s great to meet the fans at events like these; to get a chance to see who exactly it is that watches our videos and ask them why on earth they dedicate hours of their lives to do so. And it\u2019s always a surprisingly diverse turnout. Shy four-year-olds who give me toothy grins and have to be gently nudged by bemused mums. Teenage boys who stare and forget their words. Excited couples who\u2019ve dressed up as my Minecraft character. Amazingly talented cosplayers who enthuse about my videos, while I enthuse at their stunning costumes. Mildly bewildered parents who aren\u2019t entirely sure why they\u2019ve queued up for hours to meet this table full of nerds. Highly excited teenage girls who giggle nervously and thank me for showing that girls can in fact play video games. One of my favourite conversations is with a Dad who said that he felt like I was a part of his family, because his sons would always play my videos at the dinner table. I apologised to him profusely. Regardless, it\u2019s this wonderful mix of people that makes the endless hours of signing, of smiling at cameras until my cheeks cramp up, of repeating my lame come back about my height ... it\u2019s what makes it worthwhile. </p> <p>I still cannot get over the hundreds of lovely people we meet, even though I\u2019ve been coming to these events for a couple of years now. It is a humbling experience, and one I still struggle to get my head around. I\u2019m just a girl who makes very silly videos playing games with my friends. But to our audience, we\u2019re worth travelling from across the globe to meet. Just today, I met people who journeyed from Denmark, France, California and Australia. I\u2019ve heard humbling stories from people who\u2019ve thanked me for getting them through darker times, for being their support during exam stresses, messy break ups, serious mental health issues and bullying. I\u2019ve even been visited by a young soldier who thanked me for keeping him sane during his service in Iraq. I still have no idea how to properly reply to these human stories, and trying to comfort a young girl who\u2019s started crying out of nerves is not easy when the robots in the Robot Wars booth behind us have fired up again. </p> <p>I\u2019m five feet tall, so YouTube really does make me look bigger than I am in real life. And one day, I\u2019ll think of a better reply for the fans who\u2019ve queued up three hours to tell me so. Or just find a box to stand on. </p>",

  "<p>Amid the summer lull, it\u2019s time for a little speculative takeover talk.</p> <p>Analysts at RBC have been looking as satellite communication specialist <strong>Inmarsat</strong> and run the rule over the business as a possible bid target. In a new note, RBC\u2019s Wilton Fry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given Inmarsat\u2019s lower share price (especially in US dollar terms), rapid evolution of the industry\u2019s competitive landscape, and historical precedents (e.g., Sky Terra approach in 2009), we believe it is appropriate to consider potential M&amp;A activity. In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat. </p> <p>Echostar and its sister company Dish Network have recently raised financing and Echostar now has around $3bn in cash on its balance sheet. This money is most likely to be used to fund new satellites at Echostar. However, there is a possibility, in our view, that Echostar or Dish may consider approaching Inmarsat given the compelling strategic and operational logic of a combination; as such, we believe this is a valid topic for investor debate. </p> <p>A bid for Inmarsat could help solve the jigsaw puzzle: We see a number of interlocking situations: (a) Dish has a lot of US spectrum but needs terrestrial deployment; (b) Echostar and Inmarsat both own European S band that could be used for mobile; (c) Mobile needs spectrum given data growth; (d) Deutsche Telekom is involved with Inmarsat\u2019s S-band project and owns T Mobile USA; (e) Inmarsat is global but needs needs more Ka-band; and (f) Echostar has Ka-band but wants to expand globally...</p> <p>We think combining a regional/deep operator like Echostar with a global/ shallow operator like Inmarsat would fulfill Echostar\u2019s global aspirations and help Inmarsat\u2019s need to add capacity in dense areas. We also think it could protect Echostar\u2019s Hughes business, enhance in-flight opportunities, and confront ViaSat\u2019s aspirations whilst simultaneously yielding substantial operational savings from combined satellite control functions. </p> <p>Despite Inmarsat\u2019s larger size ($5.0bn versus $3.6bn) and rating (around 10 times versus 5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA), Echostar has plenty of cash ($3bn) and lower leverage. As an illustration, a 37% premium (12.5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA) with 30% cash/70% equity structure would result in NewCo leverage of 3.2 times net debt/ EBITDA pre- synergies, in line with Inmarsat\u2019s current leverage. </p> </blockquote> <p>RBC has a target price of \u00a311.50 a share on Inmarsat. The company\u2019s shares are currently down 1p at 805.5p.</p>",

The company, along with Crossrail and London Underground, have made more progress on this issue than many other train companies, partly because they\u2019ve needed to hire a lot more train drivers to accommodate the growth of transport links in the capital.<br></p> <p>But they\u2019ve also targeted their recruitment. Ambassadors from London Overground, Austin says, have gone into schools to give careers advice and promote train-driving as a viable career choice for girls. Crossrail, which will employ more than 400 drivers when fully operational, made a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/149584358\">video featuring female train drivers</a> discussing the benefits of the role for them, and teamed up with websites such as <a href=\"http://www.workingmums.co.uk/\">workingmums.co.uk</a> to create female-friendly adverts.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/may/15/being-a-woman-isnt-a-barrier-to-working-in-the-rail-industry\">'Being a woman isn\u2019t a barrier to working in the rail industry'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other companies have made sporadic progress. <a href=\"http://www.aslef.org.uk/information/100011/102619/133274/on_track_with_diversity/\">On track with diversity</a>, an independent report commissioned by Aslef in 2012, highlighted good practice among train operating companies. Northern Rail, for example, placed job adverts in the fitting rooms of New Look branches in Manchester and Leeds. The company also worked on its image: one ad depicted a pile of pink shoe boxes with employee benefits written on them and a strapline saying \u201ca girl can never have too many\u201d.<br></p> <p>The union used the report to put pressure on train companies to recruit more women and ethnic minorities. It urged them to place job adverts where women are likely to read them, hold open days that target women and ensure interview panels are trained in preventing bias.<br></p> <p>Far from feeling like they\u2019re imposing on a male environment, female train drivers think the job is ideal for women. One of the biggest plus points is the salary. Georgiana Oana, who has been driving for London Overground for just over a year, earns more than \u00a355,000 a year \u2013 and has just managed to put down a mortgage on a property without her partner\u2019s input. Cassidy, meanwhile, a single mother, can easily afford childcare while she\u2019s at work.<br></p> <p>Oana, 33, was an internal recruit: after moving to the UK from Romania, she did some agency work, including cleaning and other operational roles for the railway. She spent a few years improving her English so that she\u2019d be able to apply for a driving position.<br></p> <p>What attracted her were the employee benefits. As well as free or heavily discounted rail travel, drivers get long holidays, flexible working hours and decent pensions and maternity packages. Although the job is intense and requires a lot of concentration, train drivers never take any work home with them. It\u2019s shift work \u2013 but for Oana, that means more time off during the day to see her young children, who are two and eight years old. Every month she gets a seven-day break.<br></p> <p>She sees no reason why women shouldn\u2019t apply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that I need help from a man to do in this job,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The number of areas where badgers will be culled to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis is to more than triple under licences issued by the government on Tuesday.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Licensed shooters could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/23/badger-cull-protesters-change-tactics-in-response-to-expansion\">begin killing badgers within days in Herefordshire, Cornwall and Devon</a>, which have been added to the culling already taking place in recent years in Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset.</p> <p>Ministers say the culling is essential to stop the spread of bovine TB to cattle, which cost the taxpayer \u00a3100m in 2015 to compensate farmers for slaughtered cattle. But experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/badger-cull-expansion-flies-in-face-of-scientific-evidence\">have said</a> the culls \u201cfly in the face of scientific evidence\u201d and could even make the problem worse.</p> <p>George Eustice, the farming minister, said the cull\u2019s expansion was vital to tackle the \u201creservoir\u201d of the disease in badgers. \u201cOur comprehensive strategy to eradicate bovine TB in England is delivering results, with more than half the country on track to be free of the disease by the end of this parliament.\u201d</p> <p>In total, 10 areas have now been licensed for culling, up from three areas previously. Ministers also announced the provision of more information and advice on cattle movements and biosecurity measures and a consultation on the use of more sensitive tests.</p> <p>The National Farmers Union welcomed the move. Meurig Raymond, the NFU president, said: \u201cFarmers facing a daily battle against bTB in those areas that have been granted licences for badger control operations this year will welcome the news that finally action is being taken to tackle the reservoir of disease in wildlife in these areas. </p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement means that badger control will now be taking place in 10% of the area where cattle are at the highest risk of contracting bTB.\u201d</p> <p>But scientists, Labour and animal welfare groups condemned the expansion and said it would not stop the disease. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, at the Institute of Biology in London, said: \u201cThis is a huge disappointment for evidence-based policy making. The scale of the rollout is huge: farmers will be required to kill almost 10,000 badgers at a minimum before the end of November. And yet the government has released no evidence that farmer-led culling is helping to control cattle TB.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Maskell, shadow environment secretary, said: \u201cThe decision to extend the badger cull flies in the face of the government\u2019s own evidence that shows the killing of thousands of badgers has not reduced the number of cattle contracting bovine TB. The government promised when they embarked on the cull that it would be an evidence based approach, yet they are failing to take any notice of the facts.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, CEO of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cDefra statistics show that despite killing thousands of badgers the number of cattle slaughtered for TB continues to rise in and around the cull zones. We could kill ever badger in Britain but bovine TB would continue to spread in cattle herds, due to inaccurate TB testing, excessive numbers of cattle movements and poor bio security controls.</p> <p>\u201cThe badger is being used as a scapegoat for failures in the modern livestock industry. The badger cull has failed on scientific, humaneness and cost grounds. For Andrea Leadsom to extend the badger cull to seven new areas defies belief and is a national disgrace,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Chris Pitt, deputy director of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \u201cIt is ludicrous that given all the evidence collated over the last four years, the government plan to roll out their misguided badger cull even further. Killing badgers is not only disastrous for badgers, but it\u2019s also calamitous for cattle and a dead end for farmers, because all the unbiased scientific opinion suggests that we\u2019ll never get rid of bovine TB this way.\u201d<br></p> <p>Claire Bass, executive director of the Human Society International UK, said: \u201cIt is both shocking and sad that the government is expanding this cruel \u2018pilot\u2019 policy to three new counties.\u201d</p> <p>The cost to taxpayers for the cull, described as \u201cindustry-led\u201d by the government, was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-government-badger-control-costs-2015\">\u00a317.6m for the three years from 2013 to 2015</a>, including \u00a36.7m on policing and \u00a36.6m on independent monitoring of effectiveness and humaneness. The lmonitoring, which found the first year of culls <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/28/badger-cull-humaneness-test-tb-cattle\">were not effective or humane</a>, has been discontinued. The expenditure is equivalent to many thousands of pounds for each badger killed.</p> <p>The government funding needed for each new culling area is estimated at \u00a31.2m a year, meaning the seven news areas will cost a total of \u00a333.6m in total over the planned four years of culling. </p> <p>The government\u2019s original value-for-money assessment of the badger culls showed they would cost more than they saved in TB reduction. But a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/548748/badger-control-policy-value-for-money-160824.pdf\">new assessment from the government</a> finds that the benefit of future culls will exceed the costs, due to \u201cto more cost-effective monitoring and policing\u201d.</p> <p>The government expects policing costs to \u201cdisappear\u201d over time, \u201cfollowing further successful badger control operations without security incident\u201d, but protesters say they intend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/23/badger-cull-protesters-change-tactics-in-response-to-expansion\">take direct action to drive up policing costs</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/bovine-tb-not-passed-on-through-direct-contact-with-badgers-research-shows\">Recent research</a> showed that bovine TB is not passed through direct contact between badgers and cattle, but through contaminated pasture and dung.</p>",
  "<p>This Thursday, 1 September, marks <a href=\"https://dolphinproject.net/japan-dolphins-day-2016/\" title=\"\">Japan Dolphins Day</a>. Anyone following social media may well sigh. Isn\u2019t there always a something-or-other day? Perhaps so, but with 100 demonstrations planned outside Japanese embassies and consulates worldwide, this event has a bitter and serious urgency: the soon-to-be continued slaughter of wild dolphins in the infamous inlet at Taiji, subject of Oscar-winning documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uBfafEcqGU&amp;app=desktop\" title=\"\">The Cove</a>.</p> <p>Between September and April, up to 2,000 dolphins will be driven inland and killed for their meat. Cynically, those that look the prettiest and jump the highest to evade the butchers\u2019 knives will be saved \u2013 to sell to oceanariums around the world. Those bloody waters, and the sight of sentient cetaceans leaping for their lives, should be enough to stir even the most cynical out of their complacency.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the activist star of The Cove, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/arts/japan-cove-director-deported-1.3435659\" title=\"\">Ric O\u2019Barry</a>, was detained by the Japanese authorities for two weeks. O\u2019Barry was the original trainer for the Flipper TV series, capturing the five dolphins used for the show. But in 1970 he changed course and formed the <a href=\"https://dolphinproject.net/\" title=\"\">Dolphin Project</a>, fighting to free captive cetaceans and, in particular, to stop the Taiji cull.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been operating out of guilt,\u201d O\u2019Barry tells me from his Miami home, as he prepares to leave for the London demonstration, \u201cI helped create this industry.\u201d Before 1959, when the Taiji cull began, there was no market for captive dolphins. Now oceanariums in China, Turkey, Russia, the Middle East and even the Caribbean will pay <a href=\"http://us.whales.org/faqs/dolphin-hunts\" title=\"\">up to $150,000 per animal</a>. Japan itself has 52 dolphinariums. O\u2019Barry says that London is the key to changing the situation. \u201cIf we can get <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/London-against-the-Dolphin-Massacre-Superpod-Taiji-Japan/212520505611738\" title=\"\">10,000 people outside the Japanese embassy on Thursday</a>, that will make the Japanese government take notice.\u201d He notes that with the next Olympics to be held in Japan, the country will be keen to avoid adverse publicity. \u201cIf we can do that in London on 1 September, it will end this story once and for all.\u201d Most especially, O\u2019Barry is appealing to animal welfare organisations to pool resources and alert their members to attend.</p> <p>The Taiji cull follows the resumption of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/protesters-film-slaughter-hundreds-whales-faroe-islands\" title=\"\">Faroe Islands\u2019 annual hunting of pilot whales in July</a>, known as the grind.

Last Friday, a third grind saw <a href=\"http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/third-pilot-whales-grind-in-the-faroe-islands\" title=\"\">another 40 whales rounded up and nine killed</a>. This is despite warnings from the Faroe Islands government that, like the dolphins hunted in Japan, the high amounts of heavy metals in their meat can cause impacted immune systems, fertility problems, and premature dementia.

In it, the authors establish that for the first time it can be proved that the evolution of a species other than Homo sapiens has been affected by cultural change. <a href=\"http://www.parley.tv/updates/2016/8/11/the-sentient-sea\" title=\"\">This has been demonstrated in orca, or killer whales</a> \u2013 the largest of the dolphin family, which are subject, like their cousins, to captive status in US, Europe, and Asia.</p> <p>New Scientist magazine which, along with Nature, was one of the few publications to give the report prominence, explained that killer whale populations have different hunting strategies: \u201cSome herd fish, while others pick on seals. Biologists consider this a form of culture. New research reveals these cultural groups are genetically distinct, meaning culture has shaped their evolution. It\u2019s the first time this has been seen in other animals. Killer whales are intelligent, long-lived, and social like us. Culture is one more reason to set them free.\u201d</p> <p>What is remarkable about this statement is the unusual undertow of unscientific emotion it expresses.

  "<p>A smartphone app that logs data on fish catches is giving small-scale fishers in South Africa hope they can persuade the government to allocate them more of what they regard as their traditional fishing rights.</p> <p>Abalobi, the app which is named for the isiXhosa phrase <em>abalobi bentlanzi, </em>meaning \u201csomeone who fishes\u201d, aims to give small-scale fishers the data to empower themselves and convince others.</p> <p>Co-produced by the University of Cape Town, traditional fishers and the new small-scale fisheries unit in the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the app lets fishers log their catches. They can record what they caught, when, where, using what method and how much they sold the fish for, among other things.</p> <p>The hope from local traditional fishers is that more accurate data will demonstrate that fish populations can withstand their harvesting.</p> <p>Currently, the government refuses to allocate rights to fish for mullet on parts of the country\u2019s west coast because of concerns it will harm fish stocks. Hendrik Bantom, a 48-year-old fisher in the small seaside town of Struisbaai, says that consequences for him and his community are dire: \u201cThey are our life source in the long winter months when it is too dangerous to line fish far out at sea.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/18/new-online-trawler-tracking-tool-aims-to-help-end-overfishing\">New online trawler tracking tool aims to help end overfishing</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>Thanks to Abalobi, Bantom has Struisbaai data to add to the assessments of mullet, location-specific data, which he says DAFF lacks. \u201cI have never seen a scientist from DAFF come to determine the mullet stocks in Struisbaai in the past 15 years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can now use the fish catch data on Abalobi phones to show DAFF that there is enough mullet here to feed the community on a sustainable basis.\u201d</p> <p>The assessment of mullet stock is critical for the Struisbaai community, but the consequences of using Abalobi go much further. For decades, the government has found itself in conflict with about 30,000 traditional or artisanal fishers along its coastline, people who make their living from the sea, straddling the divide between commercial and subsistence fishing.</p> <p>When fishing rights were divided among commercial fishing operations, traditional fishers \u2013 crucial employers and sources of revenue in often poor coastal towns \u2013 were simply not recognised. A 2007 equality court judgment found that both the apartheid- and democratic-governments had marginalised these fishers, and ordered the government to include this sector in its rights allocations.</p> <p>But if stocks cannot support fishing, that order is impossible to implement. government scientists say that mullet stocks are low and consequently no fishing rights are being allocated for their species.</p> <p>How those scientists reached that conclusion is a matter of contention, complicated by deep distrust of government scientists (and the government in general) after years of acrimonious litigation and subsequent inaction.</p> <p>David Shoshola, a traditional fisher in Lamberts Bay, which is about 440km up the coast from Struisbaai, says the scientists come once a year to make a stock assessment in an area. They do not, he says, include information from traditional fishers\u2019 catches.</p> <p>\u201cGovernment has no way of knowing what the catch per unit effort is of these fishers, because they have very little data,\u201d says Serge Raemaekers, a University of Cape Town academic who has been a key figure in driving the Abalobi project. \u201cThey have a little information from the monitors [government employees who are based and the harbour and take note of the fishers\u2019 catches], but that\u2019s a small percentage of what\u2019s actually going on out there.\u201d</p> <p>The government agrees there is a data gap and some uncertainties. Abongile Ngqongwa, the deputy director of DAFF\u2019s small-scale fisheries management unit, says, \u201cFrom the simple sample that we have done [as part of the pilot programme], the majority of the resource ... is not even recorded.\u201d</p> <p>Kim Prochazka, who heads up the government\u2019s fisheries resource research, says that they would be open to using any data that is \u201crelevant and of sufficient quality and quantity\u201d in order to be statistically relevant. \u201cWe are hopeful that Abalobi will not only provide data that can be used in stock assessments, but that this will result in an improvement in current data collection models.\u201d</p> <p>However, collecting a critical mass of data may take a while. Abalobi is growing \u201corganically form the pilots into the neighbouring communities\u201d, Raemaekers says. \u201cIf we had it across the sector, we\u2019d have a much better case.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The human urge to help others is a laudable aspect of our nature as social animals. In an era of crowd-funding platforms and electronic transfers, appeals can rapidly tap into the spirit of human generosity and sponsor any number of excellent endeavours. But this generous spirit can be quite easily abused, especially when it comes to fundraising for healthcare. </p> <p>Given the prevalence of cancer, it\u2019s not surprising that those affected are frequently the target of <a href=\"http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2013/09/13/miracle-cancer-cures-ask-for-evidence/\">outlandish and costly false cures</a>. Wallace F.

These \u201ccures\u201d can be worse than merely useless; in some instances these interventions can be actively damaging or deadly.

In the decades since the clinic was established, precisely <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/antineoplastons-pdq#section/all\">no reproducible results have emerged</a>. There are many problems with the research conducted by Burzynski\u2019s clinic; Professor David Gorski provides <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.csicop.org/si/show/stanislaw_burzynski_four_decades_of_an_unproven_cancer_cure\">an excellent overview of some of these</a>. </p> <p>Yet despite the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/juUyHJ\">numerous FDA warnings</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.csicop.org/si/show/skeptic_activists_fighting_for_burzynskis_cancer_patients\">scientific criticisms</a> and myriad legal cases, Burzynski\u2019s clinic is still a beacon of hope for many desperate people. The clinic has heavily promoted itself as capable of miraculous deeds, for which it charges a hefty fee - the American Cancer Institute warns that treatments at the clinic can cost upwards of US $7,500-10,000 a month (\u00a35,600-\u00a37580)<em tabindex=\"-1\">.</em><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sick people, their families and communities frequently raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for treatment there. The story of British toddler Amelia S is just one such <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theotherburzynskipatientgroup.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/burzynski-patient-amelia-s-s-story-3/\">heart-breaking account</a>. Amelia was three years old when diagnosed with a brain tumour. The prognosis was bleak, and, understandably, her family looked for any hope they could find. Despite pleas from concerned sceptics, Amelia\u2019s family began fundraising for her treatment, and aided by uncritical media coverage collected over \u00a3200,000. Initially, Amelia\u2019s family were encouraged by the apparent improvement they witnessed in their daughter\u2019s condition, and the clinic wasted no time in promoting the toddler as a success story. Her story even featured in filmmaker Eric Mercola\u2019s uncritical documentary <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632703/\">Burzynski: Cancer is a Serious Business</a>. Swayed by the coverage, several other parents of sick children raised large sums of money for ANP treatment.</p> <p>Sadly, Amelia\u2019s improvement was illusory, and her condition deteriorated steadily until she passed away in 2013. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theotherburzynskipatientgroup.wordpress.com/\">Other Burzynski patient group</a> records many similar instances. No-one disputes that patients do, sadly, sometimes die, but but that they should be peddled false hope whilst being heavily burdened financially strikes opponents of the clinic as unforgivable. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Autism is another condition that attracts <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/jul/15/autism-how-unorthodox-treatments-can-exploit-the-vulnerable\">bogus treatments and dubious elixirs</a>. \u201cTreatments\u201d range from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/expert-answers/autism-treatment/faq-20057933\">unnecessary chelation therapy</a> to what are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/parents-bleaching-their-kids-in-ireland-733\">essentially bleach enemas</a>. The human protein<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34326801\"> GcMaf</a> is often marketed as a miracle cure, and can set patients back somewhere in the region of \u20ac5000 (\u00a34270) a month. It may also come with considerable risk, especially if patients have abandoned conventional treatment: in 2014, five patients died having undergone the protocol at First Immune Switzerland. The clinic <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rts.ch/info/regions/vaud/6881799-une-clinique-privee-vaudoise-sous-enquete-apres-la-mort-de-5-patients.html\">was closed pending an investigation</a> and remains closed, although the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://immunocentre.eu/\">company\u2019s website</a> reassures potential patients that \u201cwe have closed our clinic to replace it with a better one\u201d.</p> <p>But perhaps the most pernicious treatments are those designed as interventions for syndromes that are not medically recognised. These include Electromagnetic Hyper-sensitivity (EHS), where sufferers believe they are adversely affected by electro-magnetic radiation.  While EHS is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/feb/17/electromagnetic-radiation-doesnt-make-you-ill-or-give-you-cancer-heres-why\">psychological rather than physiological</a>, the profound discomfort experienced by sufferers is very real. And because such afflictions are not medically recognised, hawkers appear to offer desperate sufferers the chance to relief or cure, offering everything from juicers to ludicrously implausible electro-magnetic shields.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Of all these maladies, Chronic Lyme Disease (CLD) is one that is currently attracting attention. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/\">Lyme disease</a> is a common infection passed from ticks to human, and is usually easy to treat with a course of antibiotics. Generally, it quickly clears up, though in rare instances symptoms can persist for a few weeks after treatment, a situation referred to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/postlds/index.html\">post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome</a> (PTLDS). CLD sufferers claim that a range of varied and often debilitating symptoms can manifest after infection. Yet the symptoms of CLD are entirely subjective, and completely inconsistent - in many instances, there is no evidence that the sufferers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease_controversy]\">ever had Lyme infection in the first instance</a>. A 2011 New England Journal of Medicine review <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra072023\">dismissed the existence of CLD</a> alongside other discredited \u201cillnesses\u201d such as chronic candida syndrome and chronic Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection.</p> <p>Understandably, this dismissal by the medical establishment is rejected by illness advocacy groups, who in their determination to have a diagnostic label for their complaints can be somewhat militant. Indeed, the co-discover of Lyme disease, Prof Allen Steere, has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/17/magazine/17LYMEDISEASE.html?pagewanted=all\">stalked, threatened and abused</a> for refusing to substantiate self-diagnosed CLD, in addition to his refusal to endorse long-term antibiotic therapy - a treatment course <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1505425\">shown to lack efficacy</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/aug/08/the-online-tool-that-helps-the-public-decode-health-research\">The online tool that helps the public decode health research</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unsurprisingly perhaps, the evanescent nature of a CLD diagnosis is a haven for snake-oil sellers, keen to dole out a diagnosis and supply lucrative alternative treatments. The lack of medical evidence for the very existence of the condition is, paradoxically, something of a boon for alternative practioners, who are therefore able to attribute practically any perceived malaise or symptom to CLD, and push any manner of dodgy cure.</p> <p>These treatments can command a staggering price-tag; a recent campaign to raise \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385400) for a CLD treatment was <a href=\"http://goo.gl/AV2cXH\">heavily covered in the Irish media</a>, urging at least 10,000 people to donate \u20ac10 to save a life. Along with Prof David Colquhoun, a pharmacologist and fellow of University College London, I queried this particular case. We asked some questions regarding where the treatment was going to be carried out (ie. <a href=\"https://storify.com/drg1985/from-good-intentions-spring-roads-to-hell\">where the money was going</a>) and discovered the clinic in question was the <a href=\"http://www.sophiahi.com/about-us/\">Sophia Health Institute in Seattle</a>. </p> <p>Further investigation revealed that this is not the first appeal to raise huge sums for CLD treatment, with many other similar appeals on numerous crowd-funding platforms. That any clinic would offer expensive treatment for an unrecognised ailment is a red flag. However, the situation becomes murkier still when one considers that the Sophia Health Institute is a naturopathic centre run under the auspices of Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt, a man whose medical reputation has been called into question by many sceptics and health bloggers, and whose <a href=\"http://www.klinghardtacademy.com/images/stories/Lyme_Disease/Lyme_protocol_Jan06.pdf\">Lyme disease treatment protocol</a> makes for frankly worrying reading.<br></p> <p>So why do these unproven treatments still find ready patients? Part of the problem is <a href=\"https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/\">survivorship bias</a>, where people are more inclined to focus on apparent success stories whilst overlooking failures. Dubious clinics exploit this effect, showcasing their apparent miracles whilst downplaying the much more informative failure statistics, creating an aura of effectiveness where there is none. But crucially, these clinics have commoditized hope. At its worst, this is naked abuse of desperate people.<br></p> <p>Faced with this desperation, raising questions about the clinics or their methods, can trigger extreme reactions, even if compassionately meant. It is all too easy for patients and their supporters to interpret concern as contempt for the sufferer. The siege mentality has the effect of insulating clinics from criticism- precisely the environment in which exploitation thrives. <br></p> <p>The depressing conclusion is that although the urge to help those suffering is laudable, the truth is that promises of miracle cures should be viewed with extreme scepticism. Raising money for such causes does not help sufferers one iota \u2013 it benefits only those with the audacity to push false hope at great expense.<br></p>",

For the last week or so, I\u2019ve been watching developments inside the Coalition on the Racial Discrimination Act closely. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">In a story I published last night</a>, I noted the Liberal senator <strong>Cory Bernardi</strong> had been seen stalking the corridors yesterday collecting signatures for his private member\u2019s bill, which aims to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the RDA.<br><br>His effort seems to be progressing well. The bush mail inside the Coalition informs me <strong>he\u2019s signed up every backbencher in the upper house in the Liberal and National parties with the exception of Jane Hume, a new Liberal from Victoria</strong>. The bill now could have support from as many as 20 senators, if we throw in the crossbench. That\u2019s obviously a sizeable minority of senators, a minority that will be pretty hard for the prime minister to ignore, which is presumably why <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> has recently switched his line from no, we are not overhauling the RDA, to we are not overhauling the RDA \u201cyet.\u201d Bernardi won\u2019t confirm he has 20 but he\u2019s told me he\u2019s \u201cheartened by the level of support I\u2019ve received\u201d.</p> <p>Back to you Gabrielle Chan.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:49:07.251Z\">at 12.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4c4b4e4b0655f72768985\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:27:59.850Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> thanked <strong>Tina Brown</strong> and the <strong>Wedgetails</strong> for the welcome to country.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australians most certainly want this 45th parliament to be capable of rising above self-seeking, narrow sectional interests.

Brandis is a supporter of marriage equality.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s instructive that after the shadow cabinet meeting this morning, the Labor party, although critical of the plebiscite process, in fact stopped short of saying that it would vote against the plebiscite legislation, which the government is determined to proceed with. I very much hope that the Labor party gets out of the way on this and <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> doesn\u2019t succumb to the temptation to play politics with the issue because, I can tell you that <strong>people in the gay community in particular with whom I have been speaking are sick to death of being treated as pawns in some kind of political game. </strong></p> </blockquote> <p>This last point is very true. Except both sides have a history of playing games on this. Remember the plebiscite itself was originally introduced by <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> as a delaying tactic.

The Coalition and Labor have pretty well got all their committee positions sorted and already, outliers are organising their various sorties to cut across the more organised agendas. Think 18c, think marriage equality. </p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s business is the budget omnibus bill, now fully briefed out to the Coalition backbenchers, Labor and some senators. This was the bill that raps all the government\u2019s budget savings into one, including the measures that Labor included in its pre-election savings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">Murpharoo has fleshed it out here.</a></p> <p>Post-election, Labor has resisted agreeing to the bill until they saw the fine print.

One more measure has been added and the final savings total has changed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has lied about the contents of this bill ... the bill that has now emerged is different to what the government has said it would be.</p> </blockquote> <p>I shall have the Newspoll results for you in a moment.

Institutions, too, have to focus on \u201cemployability\u201d, usually reduced to the proportion of their students who find \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs. In the looming Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) this will be a key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/21/higher-education-student-debt-teaching-excellence-framework-tef-jo-johnson\">indicator of their performance</a>.</p> <p>Whole nations now justify public investment in higher education almost entirely in terms of enhancing the skills of graduate workers, as well as more \u201cimpactful\u201d research. Competition in the global knowledge economy is the new Olympian struggle, with growth rates and gross national product substituting for medals.</p> <p>But just because over the past two decades the growth in the proportion of \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs roughly kept pace with the increasing production of graduates there is no guarantee this will happen in future. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/18/gap-between-graduate-and-non-graduate-wages-shows-signs-of-waning\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> report found that the \u201cgraduate premium\u201d, the extra earnings graduates can expect compared with non-graduates, has held up \u2013 so far. It offered no reassurances about the future.</p> <p>Because older non-graduates are retiring and being replaced by graduates, the proportion of graduates in the workforce will go on increasing even if there is no growth in student numbers (and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service has reported a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/19/ucas-considers-radical-changes-as-clearing-rates-rise-sharply\">4% increase in first years </a>this autumn).</p> <p>There is already alarming anecdotal evidence that the increase in \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs is failing to keep pace. Lots of graduates end up in the Uber economy. In any case, the \u201cgraduate premium\u201d has always been uneven \u2013 high for Oxbridge graduates heading for the City, wafer-thin for those from less prestigious universities working in the public sector (especially if they are women or from ethnic minorities).</p> <p>Ministers will be tempted to heap blame on these less prestigious universities, naming and shaming them and penalising them in the TEF in the name of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/09/lamentable-teaching-damaging-higher-education-jo-johnson-minister-warns\">driving up standards</a>\u201d. But that will be pointless and deeply unfair if the \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs don\u2019t exist in sufficient quantity. It is worth remembering that the growth in such jobs in the past was fuelled by incorporating the education of most healthcare and primary school teachers into the graduate economy.</p> <p>The anecdotal evidence that the explosion of \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs may be over is already there. The scientific evidence is slowly becoming available, notably in a paper by Stephen Kemp-King, The Graduate Premium: manna, myth or plain mis-selling?, published by the <a href=\"http://www.if.org.uk/archives/8403/the-graduate-premium-manna-myth-or-plain-mis-selling\">Intergenerational Foundation</a>. There are lots of reasons. Top of the list is the government\u2019s refusal to embrace a high-skill industrial strategy, preferring the quick fix of a liberalised, and lower-wage, workforce.</p> <p>Another reason is that many of the \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs generated in management and financial services, even though they are filled by graduates from our now ubiquitous \u201ctop\u201d universities, are rather \u201csoft\u201d. They may \u2013 may \u2013 demand those sometimes over-hyped problem-solving and inter-personal skills. But they often don\u2019t need high-level expert and technical skills. Not really very \u201cgraduate\u201d on one reading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/03/less-than-half-of-students-confident-their-degree-will-pay-for-itself\">Less than half of students confident their degree will pay for itself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there are longer-term structural reasons. Some fear high-skill jobs are being hollowed out, as the need for truly advanced skills is becoming more and more concentrated in a few very high-tech sectors (often abroad). Others suggest our existing advanced technologies are becoming mature, and may cease to devour graduates in the way they once did.</p> <p>If the graduate job market does falter, there are two responses. The first, and much the most likely from government, is to increase the pressure on universities, insisting that the fit between higher education and employment becomes even more exact. That is probably a battle that can never be won.</p> <p>The second is to recognise that a higher education is about more than jobs. It is about self worth and citizenship too. So even if the supply of \u201cgraduate\u201d jobs does fail to keep up with the production of graduates, there is no need to panic. A good society is more than just an ever-expanding economy.</p>",

This is an Indian supply ship sailing between the British coast and UK offshore oil rigs and wind farms. Despite this, their foreign owners need not pay the UK minimum wage: rates are often a third less than for British sailors.</p> <p>The trade union <a href=\"http://www.nautilusint.org\">Nautilus International</a>,which often helps stranded crews, has stepped in, calling in the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency\">Maritime and Coastguard Agency</a> (MCA). This means the ship is officially prevented from leaving port until the men are paid.</p> <p>Its sister ship Malaviya Seven has been similarly<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-36539265\"> holed up in Aberdeen</a>. This crew were owed a total of $380,000 (\u00a3290,000) in June: some has been paid following MCA intervention, but Paul Keenan of Nautilus says $200,000 is still owing. The ship, worth millions, could be sold off to pay its debts.</p> <p>The shipping industry is a prime example of what an unfettered free market does to a workforce, of globalisation at its reddest in tooth and claw. Flying flags of convenience, British shipping has been allowed to register in low-pay, low-regulation countries. That exodus took off in the wicked 1980s when the number of British merchant navy officers was cut by two-thirds, replaced by cheaper foreign staff. Now only a third of British-owned shipping is registered under a British flag.</p> <p>Can Britain rule its own waves again after Brexit, restoring its ships to the UK flag with decent pay and safety conditions?

Once outside the EU, don\u2019t expect welfare, wages and working conditions to be high among their priorities as they attempt to strike new trade deals.

Others may leave because they need an EU base: Stena Line warned immediately after the referendum that it might <a href=\"http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/stena-line-may-reflag-uk-vessels-following-brexit\">re-flag its UK vessels</a>.</p> <p>A manning directive to ensure that ships sailing between EU states are paid and regulated under EU law has failed to gain approval in Brussels for years, defeated by ship owners wanting to hire cheaper non-EU crews.</p> <p>Compare this with how the US protects its industry: all ships working between US ports must be US-built and crewed. Many countries do likewise. But in Britain and the EU it\u2019s a global free-for-all, where the cheapest contract wins. The result is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jan/16/theobserver.observerbusiness20\">collapse in the British-registered shipping industry</a>, now only 0.8% of the total worldwide. Why would owners pay British wages when they can hire crews elsewhere for much less?</p> <p>There has been a steep drop in training British mariners: companies are obliged to train some cadets, but then rarely take them on. More than 10 keen, well-qualified young people apply for every merchant navy training place; but despite promising good apprenticeships, the government has just cut funding for maritime training. <a href=\"http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/194643/govt-asked-to-increase-funds-for-uk-maritime-workforce/\">Numbers are falling fast</a>, though thousands of experienced officers are needed onshore as harbourmasters and marine pilots.</p> <p>The City employs 15,000 of these trained officers in marine insurance, who arbitrate in causes of accidents and other shipping specialisms. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/maritime-growth-study\">government report</a> last year dodged all the real issues, but it did warn of the urgent need \u201cto replenish and develop the skills needed to maintain our position as a world-leading maritime centre\u201d. The 90,000 UK seafarers of 40 years ago have now become only 19,000.</p> <p>In Britain, few employees are as brutally undercut as these. Ship owners fly foreign flags of convenience that allow them to fire British crews and hire others from the poorest countries, paying the lowest rates in a race to the bottom. Meanwhile the government turns a blind eye.</p> <p>The sea has ebbed in the national consciousness, though it matters as much as ever to an island. Its romance still draws keen recruits, but it\u2019s a dangerous workplace, with climate change causing more violent storms. Britain depends for everything on this buccaneering industry, yet wages are undercut and jobs lost through aggressive globalisation. As with the equally essential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/industrial-failure-uk-lorry-trade-truck-driver-squalor-low-pay-no-unions\">road transport industry</a>, the state steps back where it should step up.</p> <p>Two days ago Malaviya Twenty\u2019s owners paid off some of the crew, who are flying home \u2013 though the ship will be detained until all wages are fully paid. And as the Nautilus union protests: \u201cThe exploitation of these crews directly undermines our own shipping industry with unfair competition.\u201d</p> <p>British politics focuses too little on the reality of working lives. Many who voted Brexit overestimated the impact of migration on their own low pay, or the lack of housing and public services. But here\u2019s a case of crude, obvious labour-market abuse by employers substituting cheaper foreign staff.</p> <p>If one company does it and undercuts the rest, then all must follow suit in bidding for contracts. Only government intervention can prevent a race to the bottom that is eroding established working rights in so many sectors.</p>",

Once used by the council, it had long fallen into disrepair. Weeds thrust knee-high out of the paving and the paint on the railings was peeling. On opening day the gates were flung open, a bouncy castle was put up in the garden and some food was served up. The women, who are from neighbouring Wallasey, didn\u2019t know what to expect. Then by the end of the first morning, the garden began to overflow with stuff: footballs, a racket ball set, climbing kit.</p> <p>Neighbours who wouldn\u2019t even say hello to each other were bringing over their kids\u2019 playthings.

The entire place is run on a philosophy of someone-will-know-someone. When I looked around, there were tyres cut in half to serve as planters, kit donated by schools, cafe tables and chairs given by a local Tesco. In an economy in which so many institutions have withered away or been useless, Wilkes and Doherty have led residents into building their own. Now volunteers lay on ukulele and art lessons upstairs for the kids, and the adults teach each other how to cook good-value filling meals.

He \u2013 or, less often, she \u2013 is an elected local official who counts heads, settles feuds, and finds cats.</p> <p>On the night of 15 July, Can Cumurcu, the <em>muhtar</em> of the affluent neighbourhood of \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, on the Asian shore of Istanbul, led the defence of his manor against soldiers who had joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/military-coup-was-well-planned-and-very-nearly-succeeded-say-turkish-officials\">military coup</a> to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u00c7engelk\u00f6y was the scene of a thrilling people\u2019s defence against the rebels. Cumurcu was shot just above the hip; now he\u2019s reckoned a <em>gazi</em>, or holy warrior.</p> <p>When I met him a couple of weeks after the coup failed, Cumurcu was propped up on the sofa in his flat in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. His amiable face darkened when he mentioned his dead nephew, who had been cut down by army bullets during the coup \u2013 but the resolve in his voice, and his references to the \u201cesteemed\u201d president, the \u201csacred\u201d national flag, and God, made it clear that he felt that he had done his duty as a Turk and a Muslim.</p> <p>\u201cI got home at around 10pm that night,\u201d he remembered, wincing from his sore side, \u201cand my neighbours told me there were tanks on the Bosphorus Bridge.\u201d Cumurcu went down to the coastal road, where people were discussing the announcement on TV that the army had taken over the country. Then he saw an army captain entering \u00c7engelk\u00f6y on foot, firing his gun into the air.</p> <p>\u201cThe captain saw me and said, \u2018get these people inside!\u2019 I said sharply, \u2018Have you been drinking? Are you all right in the head?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The captain retreated but Cumurcu guessed he would come back with reinforcements to clear the road. The <em>muhtar</em> arranged for a barricade of vehicles to be formed, and more locals were roused using social media. Some were armed; so were the handful of pro-Erdo\u011fan duty officers at \u00c7engelk\u00f6y\u2019s small police station. Shortly after midnight, the soldiers stormed back into the neighbourhood with a burst of automatic fire. Cumurcu was flung into the air by a slug that passed through his side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/16/welcome-to-demokrasi-how-erdogan-got-more-popular-than-ever-podcast\">Welcome to demokrasi: how Erdo\u011fan got more popular than ever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stricken <em>muhtar</em> was rushed to a nearby hospital \u2013 which would receive 60 dead and wounded over the course of the night. Back in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, the putschists had seized the police station but were unable to advance further. They took hostages and forced them to their knees in the road. According to media reports, one officer shouted, \u201cYou dogs! Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s only one God? Your God is Erdo\u011fan. Let him come and save you now.\u201d</p> <p>All the accounts of the coup \u2013 even allowing for the fact that they have since been tidied into a seamless epic \u2013 agree that the president did indeed have a decisive effect on events. Erdo\u011fan had been holidaying in the southern resort of Marmaris; he was still there at 24 minutes past midnight, when he issued a televised appeal for Turks to come into the streets and defend the regime, for, as he put it, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a force stronger than the people.\u201d</p> <p>The number of civilians resisting the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y suddenly leaped from a few score to thousands, a pattern replicated outside the Istanbul mayoralty, the Ankara parliament, and other flashpoints across the country. When Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plane landed at Istanbul airport at around 3am, he was met by huge crowds of supporters; three hours later, when news arrived that the Bosphorus Bridge had been liberated, the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y turned tail. The coup was over.</p> <p>For the next few days, following the example of the loyalist media, the people of Turkey doused themselves in anger, pride, grief and exhilaration. The putschists had killed some 240 civilians, 18 of them in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. Parliament had been bombed by F-16s. But democracy had won.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live - at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What followed, however, looked less like a democratic victory than an authoritarian purge. In six weeks, more than 80,000 soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and private sector employees have been arrested, sacked or suspended. Not all of those who have been targeted appear to be connected to the movement led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen</a>, the influential US-based preacher and educationalist whom Erdo\u011fan has accused of masterminding the coup. Scores of journalists have been detained, and around 100 media outlets have been forcibly shut down. Amnesty International has raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ie/latest/stories/2016/07/28/turkey-taking-big-step-backwards-human-rights/\">\u201cmass repression, torture and arbitrary detention\u201d</a> under the cover of the state of emergency that Erdo\u011fan declared on 20 July.</p> <p>For onlookers in the west, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s clampdown confirms his well-established tendency to regard his own popularity as a mandate to crush opponents. The spontaneous civilian uprising against the military coup may have represented the ultimate affirmation of the popular will \u2013 but the events that followed have deepened the contradiction between Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestionable democratic legitimacy and his equally indisputable authoritarian rule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdogan\u2019s demokrasi may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The immediate reaction to the coup from American and European politicians provided evidence of their unease: both John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, issued warnings to the Turks demanding that Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/european-leaders-urge-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law-after-failed-coup\">respect democracy and the rule of law</a>. The clear implication, for listeners inside Turkey, was that Europe and America were more concerned for the thugs who had tried to seize the state than they were for its democratically elected leaders. In response, Erdo\u011fan excoriated the west for \u201csiding with the putchists\u201d.</p> <p>Words often change meaning when they change language. If Erdo\u011fan is correct to suspect that the US and EU would not have mourned his overthrow, this is because he now presides over a bespoke form of government that western leaders do not understand or appreciate. Erdogan\u2019s <em>demokrasi</em> may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will \u2013 a blunt majoritarian riposte to an imagined democratic gold standard that in reality no longer exists.</p> <p>Turkey under Erdo\u011fan may be compared with Putin\u2019s Russia, Modi\u2019s India and Netanyahu\u2019s Israel. In all these places the forms of democracy have been suborned by majoritarian nationalism, bolstered to varying degrees by the security state. In fact, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s programme does not look very different to the prospectus unveiled by France\u2019s would-be strongman, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose campaign for the presidency looks likely to be defined by his promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nicolas-sarkozy-declares-candidacy-french-presidential-election\">enforce majority prejudice over minority interests</a>. (His support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\">burkini ban</a> is a case in point.) Of course, Erdo\u011fan is an Islamist \u2013 while the others are anti-Islamists. But the new wave of elected authoritarians are nothing if not indulgent of many different varieties of nationalist phobia.</p> <p>From this perspective, Erdo\u011fan is less an aberration than the vanguard of a global trend: the dissolution of the supposedly universal democratic ideal into many indigenised \u201cversions\u201d of democracy. What makes Kerry and Mogherini\u2019s lectures even harder for Erdo\u011fan to stomach is that Europe and America are hardly exceptions to this tendency. Under the state of emergency that France\u2019s government introduced after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks, the rights of French citizens to freedom of movement and association have been formally suspended. (Turkey\u2019s government did the same following the coup.) Xenophobia has once more become a widely accepted electoral tool: consider the loud and deceitful warnings of leading Brexit campaigners that Britain would soon be swamped by millions of Turkish migrants if the UK remained inside the EU. As for the paternalistic American pluralism preached by John Kerry, this could soon be washed away by a demagogue whose conception of democracy consists of a soapbox and a baseball bat.</p> <p>It is unsurprising that Erdo\u011fan views the west\u2019s stated concern for democracy as nothing but a cynical tool of foreign policy: after all, these same countries mutely acquiesced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/egypt-revolution-coup-military-intervention-analysis\">military overthrow</a> of his friend Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, only three years ago.</p> <p>For all Erdo\u011fan\u2019s democratic shortcomings, furthermore, his country isn\u2019t a dictatorship and he isn\u2019t a fascist. Turkey\u2019s president has neither stolen elections nor launched pogroms against the country\u2019s minority Kurdish or Alevi communities. The awkward fact for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics is that his popularity has not been hurt by his authoritarianism; if anything, his legitimacy has been further enhanced. Two years after he ascended from the prime minister\u2019s office to the presidency, his electoral record is almost peerless: after leading his party to victory in one presidential election and five general elections, he is arguably the world\u2019s most successful democratic politician.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e/0_23_3480_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During his 13 years in power, Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have presided over a transformation in Turkey\u2019s fortunes: on the back of strong and stable leadership and a raft of liberalising political and economic reforms, Europe\u2019s basket case became a major economic power and a candidate for EU membership. The impetus for this transformation dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when Turkish Islamists of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s generation were a numerical majority, and yet in political and social terms a repressed minority. The country\u2019s ruling establishment was exclusively peopled by secular-minded Kemalists, named after the founder of the Turkish republic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/08/ataturk-turkey-photography-ersoy-emin\">Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk</a>; the Kemalist army repeatedly intervened to prevent governments from reflecting the wishes of a mostly devout, intermittently anti-western electorate.</p> <p>Such was the Turkey I came to know after 1996, when I went to live in Ankara as the Economist\u2019s correspondent. Atat\u00fcrk and his successors had designed their new capital in the 1920s and 1930s to be a secular, republican contrast to Istanbul, the old imperial capital and former seat of the caliphate. Three-quarters of a century later, the Kemalist regime remained militaristic and unliberalised: one constantly saw staff officers being driven from one gaunt military building to another in ancient Turkish-made Fiats. Looking back from the big hill in the south of the city, with the Sheraton blocking your view of the only major mosque, it was possible to survey the capital of one of the world\u2019s biggest Muslim countries without seeing a single minaret.</p> <p>I was struck by the hatred with which the secular elite regarded their devout compatriots. \u201cReactionary\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d were the kinder adjectives that bureaucrats, army officers and newspaper editors attached to members of banned Islamic brotherhoods or people who sent their children to religious schools. A physical revulsion seemed to come over my emancipated female friends at the rare sight of a woman wearing the long, black body covering known in Turkey as the <em>\u00e7ar\u015faf</em>; they called these women \u201ctwo-legged cockroaches\u201d. At night, the secularists drank raki toasts to their hero Atat\u00fcrk and chain-smoked Samsun cigarettes in a line of fish restaurants in the centre of town.</p> <p>Each day, in and out of the ministry buildings went clean-shaven men in ties and women in skirts. Beards or head coverings were banned for public servants, and the only scarf one saw was on the head of the tea lady. Even after Erdo\u011fan became prime minister, in 2003, the arch-Kemalist President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to invite the covered Mrs Erdo\u011fan to attend Republic Day celebrations; when a reporter asked what he felt about this, Erdo\u011fan replied, \u201cput yourselves in my wife\u2019s place and decide for yourself\u201d.</p> <p>The only time I had a strong impression of being in a Muslim city was while driving to Ankara airport, past slums that were home to migrants from rural Turkey. Here, the women were covered and the men bearded; spindly minarets rose like Anatolian poplars against the sky.</p> <p>Kemalism was a big institutional fantasy according to which Turkey was a kind of warm-water Sweden. In the troubled 1990s, the country\u2019s secular establishment was associated with economic instability (inflation averaged 70%), a pitiless war against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), and a spiteful policy that banned girls in headscarves from public universities. Turkey\u2019s allies in Nato and the EU were alive to these failures; in a country whose politicians constantly solicited the affirmation of the west, the eventual rejection of Kemalism could only take place with outside approval.</p> <p>The big winner from the west\u2019s growing disenchantment with Kemalism was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 a ferry captain\u2019s son with roots in the conservative Black Sea region, who had served as a popular mayor of Istanbul since 1994. Rather than impose Islamic law on Turkey\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, as the secularists had predicted he would, Erdo\u011fan had devoted himself to improving the city\u2019s transport system, water supply, and air quality.</p> <p>When I met Erdo\u011fan in the spring of 1997, he was quick to point to the many ways in which Istanbullus\u2019 lives had got better since he became mayor. His account was hard to fault; even his secularist critics concurred that this sclerotic, corrupt old wreck of a place finally had a competent, hard-working mayor who wasn\u2019t on the take. We met on the terrace of an imperial Ottoman house that he had had restored and then opened to the public. The house itself was a symbol of his departure from the ruling order; the secularists were so disdainful of the defunct empire that they had let most of these relics crumble.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan came out on to the terrace where I was sitting with one of his aides; he was athletic and youthful and looked good in a dark suit. We were brought superb early strawberries and ate them while admiring the Bosphorus view. He smiled often as we talked, without any of the glowering pompousness he now displays regularly \u2013 but even then, I sensed a wariness that was more than the usual politician\u2019s caution; he knew that the west was still making up its mind about him.</p> <p>He flashed one of his smiles when I reminded him of the Kemalists\u2019 criticism of his decision not to allow booze in this and other municipal establishments. \u201cWhen I became mayor they said I would ban alcohol in Istanbul, but anyone who wants to drink may do so.\u201d He seemed to be saying, \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>The doubts that many in Turkey felt towards him concerned his intentions; the previous year he had caused outrage by describing democracy as a \u201ctram ... it goes as far as we want it to go, and then we get off\u201d. That evening I upset my Turkish friends by defending too fervently a man they continued to regard as a theocrat in disguise.</p> <p>The following year, Erdo\u011fan was sentenced to 10 months in jail on risible charges of inciting a religious insurrection (he ended up serving four). He had recited some lines of martial poetry by an early Turkish nationalist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziya_G%C3%B6kalp\">Ziya G\u00f6kalp</a>. The US consul in Istanbul came to the mayoralty to commiserate; the case, she said, would \u201cweaken confidence in Turkish democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b/0_57_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer / Reuter/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Four years after he was released from prison, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rise to prime minister in 2003 was applauded not only by conservative Turks but also by western politicians and academics who hoped that his democratic Islamism would provide an alternative path to the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d that many regarded as inevitable in the wake of 9/11. Erdo\u011fan was praised for his commitment to something called \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam, although he bridled at the term, as most Muslims would; Islam is a God-given truth and in no need of improving qualifiers. His domestic opponents continued to accuse him of hiding his true beliefs until he had purged Kemalist institutions like the army and the judiciary.</p> <p>In its first few years in power, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP introduced a slew of liberalising and democratic reforms. The notorious state security courts were scrapped, torture was curtailed, and the government put out feelers aimed at a political settlement with the Kurds. Political stability and fiscal discipline helped to cut inflation, while in pious central Anatolia \u2013 the AKP\u2019s heartland \u2013 ambitious family-run firms invested in future growth. Between 2002 and 2013 the economy expanded by an average of 5% per annum: the government used the proceeds of that growth to invest in housing, health, and education. The slums I used to drive past on the road to Ankara airport in the 1990s were replaced with smart modern flats.</p> <p>The high water mark for Erdo\u011fan and the west was 2005, when the EU and Turkey opened accession negotiations. At the time, Erdo\u011fan expressed a worldview that was notably open and optimistic. \u201cCountries on their own,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not mean \u2026 much any more. They can achieve a lot more in solidarity with their friends.\u201d</p> <p>By making himself and Turkey indispensable to the west \u2013 there was, the veteran US diplomat Richard Holbrooke declared, \u201cno country in the world of more strategic importance\u201d \u2013 Erdo\u011fan was also protecting himself against his Kemalist foes. The wisdom of this approach was demonstrated in 2007, when the general staff threatened a coup if he went ahead with plans to elevate his AKP confrere Abdullah G\u00fcl to the presidency. Instead, the EU and the US weighed in with statements of support for the elected government, Erdo\u011fan called the generals\u2019 bluff by holding early elections which he resoundingly won, and G\u00fcl moved into the presidential palace \u2013 along with his covered wife.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan was now strong enough to accelerate a process that had begun years earlier, changing the ethos of the army, which had earlier toppled three governments. Kemalist officers were retired, and Islamists brought in. In this endeavour, Erdo\u011fan was assisted by the followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen \u2013 the secretive Islamist movement that was allied with the AKP against the secular establishment for a decade until a dramatic split in 2013.</p> <p>It is likely that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vulnerability in the early stages of his premiership made it easier for him to make friendly gestures to Kurds and liberals \u2013 constituencies well beyond the typical ambit of the Turkish Islamist. In 2004, a ban on teaching in the Kurdish language was lifted, and the prime minister repeatedly overruled plans by the military to attack PKK camps in northern Iraq; some Kurds, particularly the conscientious Muslim ones, rewarded him with their votes.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising, in the mid-2000s Turkey gained the most vocal feminist, environmentalist and LGBT movements in the Muslim Middle East. The organisers of Istanbul\u2019s annual gay pride march called it the biggest in the Muslim world. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/police-use-teargas-against-lgbt-activists-in-istanbul\">This year\u2019s march was banned</a> by the authorities in Istanbul, however, citing security concerns after nationalist groups warned they would not allow it to take place.) For a while \u2013 with the exception of Turkey\u2019s roughly 15 million Alevis, whom many in the Sunni mainstream regard as renegade Muslims \u2013 Erdo\u011fan could claim to be a leader for all Turkey.</p> <p>The tragedy of modern Turkey is that all of these relationships that had begun to blossom under Erdo\u011fan \u2013 with the Kurds, with Turkish liberals, with the EU and the US \u2013 have now fallen apart again under his leadership, which only becomes more authoritarian and isolated with the crumbling of each alliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444/0_30_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a proud man, sensitive to slights. He turned decisively against his old friend Bashar al-Assad when the latter rejected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s appeal for leniency towards the Syrians who began protesting against the dictator in the spring of 2011. (It has also been reported that Mrs Assad made rude remarks about the Erdo\u011fans after the two couples holidayed together, which were intercepted by Turkish intelligence.)</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s support for Syrian opposition fighters reflected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s one-time hope that a Sunni-dominated Syria would become a loyal Turkish client. Instead, the Turks have seen an influx of millions of Syrian refugees, and watched helplessly while the Syrian Kurdish allies of the PKK, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organisation, have set up autonomous cantons across the border. When Turkey bowed to American pressure and joined the coalition against Islamic State in 2014, the jihadis responded with a string of suicide attacks inside Turkey \u2013 the most recent of which, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/several-dead-in-suspected-terrorist-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey\">southern city of Gaziantep</a>, on 20 August, killed 50 people.</p> <p>In the summer of 2013, weeks of protests initially sparked by the government\u2019s plans to bulldoze an Istanbul park decisively snapped whatever understanding still remained between Erdo\u011fan and Turkish liberals, millions of whom came out to demonstrate against the AKP\u2019s growing authoritarianism. (As if to prove their point, the protests were harshly put down, injuring thousands.) Finally, last summer, amid the ruins of his Syria policy, Erdo\u011fan launched a new round of fighting against the PKK that has so far cost some 1,800 lives and devastated towns across Turkish Kurdistan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turkey\u2019s unresolved application for EU membership has arguably been the most painful reverse of all. Even back in 2005, it was clear that there was a strong chance that Austria, France or Germany would block Turkey\u2019s membership because the country is too big and too Muslim. Since then, various pretexts have been found to slow the accession process to a crawl. It is now clear that Turkey will not join, but formally ending negotiations would cause yet more ill-will and jeopardise what cooperation there is, particularly on Syrian refugees.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a bully who has insulted his political opponents and locked up critical journalists. His reflexive response to criticism is to demand, in public: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d (At the end of July, he directed this question at General Joseph Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, who suggested that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s purge of military officers would damage the ongoing campaign against Islamic State.) Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation, including one against a German comic who recited a poem about him copulating with a goat.</p> <p>Even now, after 13 years of uninterrupted power and the accumulation of untold wealth, Turkey\u2019s ruling Islamists seem still to be responding to humiliations that were meted out to them by the superior, snobby, Europeanised Kemalists. Erdo\u011fan has not got where he is by taking fancy degrees or showing off his restaurant French (he is defiantly monolingual) \u2013 but through straightforward piety and political nous. Just as the Kemalists used to disparage the \u201cprimitive\u201d ways of Turkey\u2019s Islamists, so too does Erdo\u011fan deplore liberal freedoms that he regards as obstacles to development and virtue. He has compared abortions to mass murder and derides all drinkers as alcoholics; environmentalists, he has said, should move to a forest.</p> <p>During Erdo\u011fan\u2019s honeymoon with the west, foreign journalists used to remark that his rough edges had been smoothed in office; his trips abroad as prime minister, it was implied, had been the making of him. But these pats on the head reflected their wishes rather than his: in the contemptuous words of a Turkish opposition leader, Erdo\u011fan still had the style of a <em>maganda</em> \u2013 a boorish lout. (Erdo\u011fan promptly sued.)</p> <p>The liberals protesting against Erdo\u011fan in the summer of 2013 enjoyed mocking the monstrous <em>maganda</em> palace he was building for himself in Ankara \u2013 which ended up costing more than $600m and was built in brazen violation of a court ruling that it was illegal. Last October Erdo\u011fan castigated opposition leaders who dared to criticise the palace for trying to weaken a \u201cdemocratically-elected president\u201d. For Erdo\u011fan, what justifies his contempt for both the opposition and the law is the fact that he wins elections. In this view, the defeat of the attempted coup was the biggest election of all, and his most decisive victory. It was a huge and spontaneous plebiscite, and Turkey will probably never hear the end of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626/426_922_4081_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For the past few years \u2013 but especially in the past six weeks \u2013 Erdo\u011fan has redefined Turkish democracy to give himself a mandate to interpret and even anticipate the will of the majority while absolving himself of the responsibility to protect minorities.</p> <p>In his obvious aspiration to personify the nation, there is only one man who can rival him: Atat\u00fcrk. Until the final defeat of the Kemalist establishment in the late-2000s, Atat\u00fcrk was everywhere: his handsome features on the TV screens, his aphorisms emblazoned in bus stations, his name intoned in every speech. Erdo\u011fan now is as visible as Atat\u00fcrk was then \u2013 and equally protected from criticism. \u201cWith your elevated permission,\u201d the TV interviewers tiptoe, as they nervously pose their questions.</p> <p>The events of this summer have taken his popularity to a new level: a poll taken several weeks after the coup found that 68% of Turks approve of his handling of the situation. This is a lot more than the 52% of voters who propelled him to the presidency in 2014, when it seemed that the blush might be coming off the Erdo\u011fan bloom. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ad hoc supporters include Kurds \u2013 Kurdish nationalists have been sorely mistreated by G\u00fclenist policemen and judiciary officials \u2013 as well as secularists who despise the G\u00fclen movement\u2019s secretive, cultish character.</p> <p>The president\u2019s standing was not harmed by the fact that he seems to have faced considerable personal danger on the night of the coup. He escaped capture in Marmaris by a matter of minutes and the presidential jet was buzzed mid-air by rebel F-16s on its way to Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport; it could only land once the control tower had been liberated from the putschists. Erdo\u011fan is a bruiser from a hardscrabble Istanbul neighbourhood, whose legendary stare of disapproval has been known to terrify grown men; few Turks would have been surprised to hear that his sang-froid did not falter even when it looked as if the coup might succeed.</p> <p>When Erdo\u011fan played semi-professional football as a young man \u2013 he declined to turn pro because his father disapproved \u2013 he was known for warning his teammates about the perils of drinking and looking at girls. Now, at 62, he is Turkey\u2019s own severe father, who refuses to let the country\u2019s honour be soiled.</p> <p>His brilliance as a communicator \u2013 an aspect that tends to be ignored by his critics \u2013 is shown to best effect when he addresses his supporters directly. But none of his speeches that I have seen can compare in intensity and sophistication to the address he delivered nine days after the coup, praising the \u201cmartyrs\u201d who lost their lives defending the nation against the coup.</p> <p>The setting was a vertiginous conference hall attached to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ostentatious new palace in Ankara. Among the crowd were the families of the martyrs, some holding framed photos of a husband or son. Some of the heroes of the resistance were also present \u2013 one on a stretcher. The president took to the stage in a dark suit and purple tie. Soon he was feeling expertly for the limits of his voice, alternating between hoarse denunciations of the coup, and low confiding riffs on the sanctity of death in the service of a holy cause.</p> <p>\u201cAfter prophethood,\u201d he said, \u201cmartyrdom is the next highest station\u201d; he confessed that he envied those who had fallen on the night of the coup. Then, he attacked the credulous G\u00fclenists, \u201cpoor fools\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d who had deluded themselves into believing that their leader was touched by divinity; for as Erdo\u011fan remonstrated sternly, \u201cwe are the slaves only of our God \u2026 only in prayer, in God\u2019s presence, do we genuflect.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely in Ankara \u2013 Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s citadel of secularism \u2013 can a speech by a politician have been so suffused with ideas of faith and infidelity. But for all his religiosity, Erdo\u011fan is arguably more of a nationalist than he is an Islamist: he is too much of a Turkish patriot to subscribe to a pan-Islamist ideology that would dissolve borders of land and ethnicity. His speech was as much about the pain and ecstasy of Turkishness as it was about God, and he quoted many stanzas of patriotic poetry \u2013 he has an excellent memory for verse and a fine delivery.</p> <p>\u201cThe martyrs\u2019 graveyard is not empty,\u201d the president declaimed, \u201cthe heroes await the earth, and the flag awaits the breeze to flutter.\u201d Returning the obvious adoration of his audience, he interrupted himself wonderingly: \u201cWhat a happy, what a blessed people we are \u2026 nowhere in the world can your equal be found.\u201d</p> <p>Of course a nation is nothing without enemies, and in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s depiction the failed coup exposed not one, but many. Referring to the mealy-mouthed reaction of Turkey\u2019s erstwhile western allies, he asked, \u201cAre we surprised?\u201d and then answered his own question with a no. \u201cAre we saddened? Yes, we are human.\u201d But what he called the \u201crebirth\u201d of 15 July had shown the Turks, he continued, that \u201cwe can expect neither justice, nor help, nor support, nor understanding from anyone \u2026 whatever we do, we\u2019ll do it ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, uniting the themes of faith, nation and death, the president piped his followers to a state of weeping, cheering helplessness. In their front rooms, at \u201cdemocracy vigils\u201d in main squares across the country, millions more watched him on screen. The following day, in conversations with ordinary Istanbullus, I heard many of them repeat phrases borrowed from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech \u2013 the sentiments of the leader, absorbed among the people as if by osmosis.</p> <p>The president\u2019s habit of referring to \u201cmy people\u201d; his promise to remake the Turkish state \u201croot and branch\u201d to undo the damage done by the G\u00fclenists; the economic objectives he has set for 2023, the centenary of the republic\u2019s founding \u2013 nothing here suggests a man who expects to become irrelevant. Erdo\u011fan has hollowed out the country\u2019s institutions \u2013 including the military, at long last \u2013 and has made himself even more indispensable. No problem is not of his making, and no solution possible without him.</p> <p>The constitution allows the president two five-year terms, which would take Erdo\u011fan to 2024 \u2013 21 years after he first became prime minister. But constitutions can change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872/0_84_1579_1721/917.jpg\" alt=\"The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows ioff his football skills to the Queen, in 2008\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows off his football skills to the Queen, in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Firat Yurdakul/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The world\u2019s growing ranks of elected authoritarians may be refashioning democracy in their own image, but they still face considerable obstacles to out-and-out despotism. These regimes are defined in part by their proud disregard for the views of the minority \u2013 but an unrelenting majoritarianism hardens the opposition of the excluded.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan still operates under significant political constraints. The country\u2019s Kurdish, Alevi, and secularist communities, who distrust him intensely, add up to roughly half of Turkey\u2019s population of 75 million. For all the AKP\u2019s status as Turkey\u2019s unrivalled party of government, under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestioned dominance, he has not been able to compel parliament to give him the enhanced powers of the executive presidency he covets.</p> <p>Nor does Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority as an embodiment of Turkish Sunni conservatism mean that he is about to turn on those who do not embrace this identity; it is doubtful that he would have the support of his base to do so. A recent privately commissioned poll to which I have had access shows that while a majority of Turkish voters want a ban on alcohol and almost half would support the use of illegal means in the fight against terrorism, there is also wide support for abstract notions such as liberty and freedom of expression.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan trumpets his adherence to the will of his people, but he does not blindly pursue its whims. Having oscillated between Europhilia and Islamic fervour, universalism and isolationism, war and peace, it is clear that his political trajectory is that of a pragmatist who likes to keep his options open. His failure to pursue a ban on alcohol, despite the fact that it would please the base, is another instance of his pragmatism. That he regards secularism as useful \u2013 perhaps as a means of averting sectarian conflict \u2013 was demonstrated when he urged Mohamed Morsi to build a secular state after coming to power in Egypt in 2011.</p> <p>Even amid the purges, Erdo\u011fan has withdrawn all the suits he brought for insulting him \u2013 with the exception of the German comic, that is. He has also suspended hostilities with the main opposition party, the Alevi- and secularist-dominated Republican People\u2019s party (CHP). The CHP leader, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, himself an Alevi, was Erdo\u011fan\u2019s guest at a huge rally in Istanbul on 7 August, which allowed the president to stress the broad nature of the coalition against the coup, including people \u201cfrom all roots and of all spirits\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey is now trying to back out of its Syrian dead-end, and softening its opposition to the idea that Assad might retain a role in the postwar transition. Last week, the Turkish army joined the United States in a major cross-border offensive against Islamic State \u2013 with the additional aim of preventing the Syrian Kurds from establishing their own state on Turkey\u2019s southern border. To the north, the PKK may be preparing for a possible return to negotiations with Erdo\u011fan, having denounced the coup and announcing its readiness to help \u201cbuild a democratic Turkey\u201d.</p> <p>What that might look like is anyone\u2019s guess. The reign of Erdo\u011fan and other leaders in his mould is a clear sign that there is no longer a single model of democracy, stamped with EU or US approval, to which all countries aspire. It has long been common to contrast the emphasis laid by emerging non-western democracies on the will of the majority with the care taken by \u201cmature\u201d democracies to protect minority rights. But this flattering distinction may no longer be valid. The picture from France, the United States, and to an extent Britain suggests that a brazen majoritarianism has emerged from the crises and upheavals of the past decade. Erdo\u011fan may not resemble our stated democratic ideals, but he may be their future.

  "<p>On the New Airport road<em> </em>in the west Indian city of Pune, five Vodafone billboards are doing more to help the drought-hit village of Pimpri Sandas than the local government. The billboards, fitted with tanks, are harvesting rainwater. When the tanks are full, a text message sounds on the mobile phones of a 24/7 collection team and within hours red trucks roll in to collect the water and deliver it to Pimpri Sandas about an hour\u2019s drive away.

If he wins this tournament, it will be the third time in his career that he has won three Grand Slam titles in a calendar year - Only Roger Federer has done the same.<br></p> <p>From a physical standpoint, a major factor to watch out for is his left wrist, which has been an issue since the Olympic Games in Rio (lost in the first round) and forced him to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters. Despite the fact that Djokovic is a righty, the 29-year-old Serbian relies on his left hand for his two-handed backhand so it will be interesting to see just how much it bothers him. Janowicz, a 2013 Wimbledon semi-finalist, has issues of his own as a serious knee injury limited him to just six matches this year.<br></p> <p>Janowicz is a giant of a man - standing tall at 6\u20198\u201d - so Djokovic\u2019s strategy will surely be to test that knee and keep him away from the net. Janowicz\u2019s obvious other weapon is his serve (his fastest was recorded at 156mph in 2012) so Djokovic will have a lot of work to do if he hopes to break in this match.</p> </div>   </div>",

The images include one that appears to have been sent by Weiner in which his young son, asleep, is visible in the background.</p> <p>As his mayoral bid collapsed, Abedin, already anticipating Clinton\u2019s presidential run, appeared alongside Weiner and expressed support for him. She did not appear at a concession speech he gave at the end of the campaign.

She was dominant, serving particularly well throughout.\u201d</p> <p>In a sparsely populated but impressive new stadium (Phil Collins had pulled in a full house at nearby Arthur Ashe <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/djokovic-nadal-phil-collins-kick-off-us-open-040843517--ten.html\">to inaugurate the opening of the new roof</a> there ahead of Novak Djokovic\u2019s match against Jerzy Janowicz), they had to generate their own energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/john-isner-frances-tiafoe-us-open-cici-bellis\">John Isner beats Frances Tiafoe in battle of US tennis's present and future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They\u2019re used to it, though, as are all players who have had to slog their way through the backblocks of their sport. Mattek-Sands played her part by dressing as if she was <a href=\"http://madmaxcostumes.com/mad-max-fury-road/\">an extra from Mad Max: Fury Road</a> \u2013 with headband, top knot, flounced skirt and long black socks \u2013 although a touch of deep, dark eye makeup would have completed the look.</p> <p>Konta played it straight in violet and white. Enough of the fashion show \u2013 the tennis was clinical, most of the good stuff in the first set coming from the British No1, who stuck to her uncluttered strategy of big serve, deep ground strokes and energetic defence. It was good enough for her to wrap up the first set in 38 minutes. She took two of her break chances, hit the spot on first serve a semi-respectable 14 out of 24 times and, like her opponent, kept her unforced errors down to 10.</p> <p>The level dipped a little in the second, although one glorious Konta lob in the fourth game lit up the echoing arena with the simplicity of its execution, leaving the American stranded at the net. Mattek-Sands, rattled, pushed a concluding backhand wide and Konta led 3-1.</p> <p>Sticking to her regimented archer\u2019s serve \u2013 each bounce plopped with care, the ball toss cutting a recurring arc and the racket smacking its target flat and hard \u2013 was enough to take her further clear.</p> <p>Mattek-Sands, who partnered Jack Sock to beat Konta and Jamie Murray on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espnw/culture/the-buzz/article/17310933/despite-winning-olympic-gold-medal-bethanie-mattek-sands-called-right-name\">their way to gold in the mixed doubles in Rio</a>, fought hard to stay in the contest, mixing up her ground strokes to stretch her opponent laterally.</p> <p>In the seventh game, she was heartened to see Konta land her third double fault, but the Archer got back in a groove to save five break points. Mattek-Sands tried all her tricks, from outrageous moon balls to viciously sliced backhands, and dragged her opponent into a five-deuce struggle before succumbing to Konta\u2019s all-round power in the longest duel of the match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/lukas-rosol-plays-down-history-andy-murray-us-open\">Lukas Rosol plays down history before meeting Andy Murray in US Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Serving to stay in the tournament at 2-5, Mattek-Sands established a 30-love cushion but within moments she was saving her first match point. She overcame the anxiety of keeping the ball in play in several tough rallies, and held.</p> <p>The match, though, was decided by Konta\u2019s metronomic racket, and she made short work of serving out to love for an impressive win. It might have lacked the drama of earlier contests on day one, but the final backhand winner down the line did the job.</p> <p>Later, sipping on a recovery drink in her prized Team GB mug from Rio, she seemed barely out of breath. Konta\u2019s conditioning is spot-on, as is her mindset. Nothing disturbs her commitment to living \u201cin the moment\u201d.</p> <p>Even though she has advanced considerably since her debut here last year, Konta refuses to be carried away by a single win at the start of a fortnight she hopes to finish.</p> <p>\u201cI was happy with how I was able to deal with things on my side, separating myself from the situation. Every first round, you have to find your feet and get into the rhythm of the tournament. With Bethanie, the more emotion, the more tension that comes in a match, the better she plays, the more inspired she plays. That was a big thing for me to do: to make it as businesslike as possible.\u201d</p> <p>It is not a unique approach in modern tennis \u2013 nor in sport in general \u2013 but Konta expresses this almost fierce determination to remain unmoved by circumstance better than most.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the noisy, exciting US Open is her favourite tournament, rather than the restrained confines of the All England Club, where she has not done quite so well yet.</p> <p>\u201cI love the energy of the place,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant to be here for the two-and-a-half or three weeks that I hope for \u2013 but then it is definitely good to leave. I remember being on Ashe last year. There were planes going, there were sirens, there was a train going by, there was honking, there was talking. There was so much going on. It makes the whole vibe very infectious.\u201d</p> <p>While there weren\u2019t many adults there, Konta stayed on to do selfies and autographs with an enthusiastic knot of young fans. Despite her appearance and demeanour of an automated professional, she is a warm character who could establish a wide supporter base if she can break into the top 10 and stay there.</p> <p>Konta, a keen music fan, could just about hear the strains of Phil Collins on nearby Ashe, and said, \u201cI kinda heard him, but not clear enough. Before going on, I heard him warming up, and I thought, oh my God, oh my God, please let us hear him while we\u2019re on Grandstand. I do like him, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>And there\u2019s another anomaly: the regimented and disciplined professional letting just a little bit of emotion seep through at the very moment when her focus was about to switch to her job.</p> <p>Konta next plays the 28-year-old Bulgarian, Tsvetana Pironkova, ranked 71 in the world, who looked strong beating the Frenchwoman Virginie Razzano 6-1, 6-2</p>",
  "<p>In politics, perception is everything. What an elected representative says and the legislation they enact sends a clear message to the community the priorities of the government.</p> <p>If this is true, in New South Wales we have the extraordinary situation where the government appears to place more importance on preventing littering than on the life of a cyclist.</p> <p>ABC radio announcer, James Valentine, who hosts a hugely entertaining afternoon show on 702 Sydney, recently broadcast a series of interviews with <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2016/06/23/4487871.htm\">citizens who had received fines from the Environment Protection Authority for littering</a>. Except these bewildered offenders swear they didn\u2019t do it. On further investigation, super-sleuth Valentine discovered there existed an army of \u201clitter-dobbers\u201d who could report an incident online, and the EPA with no investigation whatsoever and little regard to the tenet of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d, simply issued a fine to the supposed offender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/24/sydney-australia-war-cyclists-fines\">Sydney's 'war on cyclists': 'I got fined $106 for not having a bell'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out this system is open to abuse. Don\u2019t like your neighbour? Simple, dob him in for littering.</p> <p>Listeners were quick to phone Valentine with similar incidents where they had been wrongfully accused and fined. In each case, the onus was on the person receiving the fine to prove their innocence, not on the witness or the agency to verify that the incident did in fact take place. In NSW, littering is taken very seriously. So seriously that natural justice is suspended in the interest of keeping cigarette butts and pie wrappers off our footpaths.</p> <p>Now to cycling. NSW Police <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/number-of-cycle-fines-surge-in-months-after-stiffer-penalties-introduced-in-nsw-20160517-goxld9.html\">recently released the data on fines issued to cyclists </a>for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/24/sydney-australia-war-cyclists-fines\">such offences as riding without a helmet</a>, riding without an appropriate warning device (a bell), and riding on a footpath. The figures showed a huge windfall to the government with revenue increasing seven-fold. This increase is largely due to two factors: stiffer penalties introduced by the Baird government for cycling misdemeanours, and an increased police focus on cyclists. While the NSW government was raking in the cash from cyclists, the new \u201csafe cycling\u201d legislation had led to only four motorists being fined for not passing cyclists at a safe distance.</p> <p>The police and the government, by their actions, have shown that its the cycling fraternity they plan to target rather than motorists who carelessly steer two-tonnes of metal close to a fellow citizen. Some cyclists have fitted digital action cameras to their bikes in the hope of recording the wayward motorists.</p> <p>Recently I was passed dangerously by a vehicle on a road in regional NSW. When I caught up to the motorist at a stop sign, I tapped on his window and asked him if he realised how close he was to hitting me with his vehicle. He shrugged and said, \u201cIf I\u2019ve broken a road rule, tell the police.\u201d</p> <p>So I did. I took the video evidence, recorded on the action camera attached to my bicycle seat-post, to the local police station where a police officer copied the footage, accepted my statement and promised to look into the matter.</p> <p>A month later, I received an email from the police officer advising me that he spoke to the motorist who admitted that he hadn\u2019t seen me until I\u2019d tapped on his window. As the motorist in question had an unblemished record, the police officer \u2013 on advice from his supervisor \u2013 issued a warning, rather than a traffic infringement notice and accompanying fine.</p> <p>This despite the fact that the motorist had virtually admitted he had been paying so little attention to what was in front of him that he hadn\u2019t seen me until I tapped on his window. In my police statement, accompanied by the video evidence, I had verified that on returning to the scene after the incident and aided by the video footage and road markings, I was able to estimate that the distance between the vehicle\u2019s passenger side mirror and my handlebars was between 30 and 50cm \u2013 clearly a breach of the road rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/25/sydney-australia-bike-lane-skeptic-cycling-duncan-gay-cycleways\">Australia's biggest bike-lane sceptic 'wants to destroy cycling in Sydney'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this case, the police erred on the side of the motorist. In my follow-up email to the police officer, I wondered if the police would have been so accommodating if the motorist had admitted to not seeing a stop sign, a pedestrian crossing or a school speed-zone sign?</p> <p>The police officer treated my initial complaint with respect and acted in a thoroughly professional manner. However one could argue that in NSW, the perception of the police going easy on motorists and being quick to charge cyclists remains. My experience does not dispel that this.</p> <p>Could the seven-fold increase in fines to cyclists perhaps have been avoided if the police had simply issued warnings to each offender regarding the recent changes to the road rules?</p> <p>Now the unscrupulous among us may suggest I would have been better served by dobbing the motorist in for \u201clittering\u201d rather than for nearly killing me. The helpful EPA would have issued the motorist with a stern fine, no questions asked.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s illegal to give false evidence. It\u2019s also illegal to overtake a cyclist without allowing a safe passing distance of one metre.</p> <p>In NSW, one could be forgiven for thinking that the safety of a cyclist matters less than a scrap of paper thoughtlessly tossed in the gutter.</p>",
  "<p> Victoria is to introduce a permanent ban on all onshore unconventional gas exploration, including fracking and coal seam gas, becoming the first Australian state to do so.</p> <p>The premier, Daniel Andrews, made the announcement on Tuesday morning and said legislation for the ban would be introduced later this year, making the current moratorium on unconventional gas exploration permanent.</p> <p> A parliamentary inquiry last year into onshore unconventional gas in Victoria received more than 1,600 submissions, most of them opposed to fracking and coal seam gas exploration.</p> <p>A statement from the Department of Premier and Cabinet said: \u201cIt is clear that the Victorian community has spoken. They simply don\u2019t support fracking.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s decision is based on the best available evidence and acknowledges that the risks involved outweigh any potential benefits to Victoria.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/01/court-rules-in-santos-favour-over-coal-seam-gas-water-treatment-plant-in-pilliga\">Court rules in Santos's favour over coal seam gas water treatment plant in Pilliga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government said the move would protect the reputation of Victoria\u2019s agriculture sector, which employs more than 190,000 people; provide certainty to regional communities; and end anxiety felt by farmers about the environmental and health risks associated with fracking.</p> <p>Exemptions to the ban will remain for activities not covered by the current moratorium, such as gas storage, carbon storage research and accessing offshore resources. Exploration and development for offshore gas will also continue.</p> <p>The Greens energy spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, welcomed the news, describing it as \u201ca relief to communities that have fought the threat of fracking for years\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis decision proves the power of grassroots advocacy,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividuals have won over powerful and influential mining companies, and the Greens are proud to have led the political campaign which forced the government to support a permanent ban.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s disappointing the government is leaving the door open to conventional gas drilling after the next state election. We won\u2019t stop fighting until all onshore gas drilling is banned.\u201d<br></p> <p>A dairy farmer in the Victorian coastal town of Seaspray, Julie Boulton, said the threat of unconventional gas mining had been hanging over farmers\u2019 heads for years. \u201cIt has been so heart-wrenching at times, when we thought the drill rigs were coming and there was nothing we could do,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/11/fossil-fuel-register-shows-more-than-a-third-of-australia-earmarked-for-coal-or-gas\">Fossil fuel register shows more than a third of Australia earmarked for coal or gas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut we pulled together as a community and decided to fight this threat to our farmland, water and health and today\u2019s decision is just fantastic \u2013 we are ecstatic.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past five years the Lock the Gate coalition of rural communities, environmental groups and farmers has fought unconventional gas exploration.</p> <p>Chloe Aldenhoven, coordinator for Lock the Gate, said about 1.4m hectares of Victoria was threatened by some form of onshore gas mining, which included coal seam gas, tight gas, shale gas and underground coal gasification. \u201cLabor has shown real leadership by listening to community concerns,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is good news for every Victorian, but for the farming communities that have been fighting to stop this industry for over five years now, this is a wonderful day. This decision gives them certainty to move forward, and this decision protects Victoria\u2019s vital clean and green image.\u201d </p> <p> Principal Adviser at The Australia Institute, Mark Ogge, praised the ban as \u201csound economic and energy policy\u201d.<br> He said that Queensland\u2019s experiment in unconventional gas had demonstrated that the economic benefits promised by the gas industry had largely failed to materialise, while negatively impacting other industries. Research had found that for every 10 new gas jobs, 18 agricultural jobs were lost, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe manufacturing industry has been one of the biggest losers with LNG exports allowing gas suppliers to drive up prices to Australian users, and suppliers exercising their market power keep Australian prices high even as global prices collapsed,\u201d Ogge said.</p> <p>\u201cWe now have the ridiculous situation that Australian gas is now cheaper in Korea than it is in Australia. That\u2019s a double-disaster for local manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat benefits there are, have gone almost entirely to the overseas owners of global oil and gas companies licensed to export Australian gas, largely at the expense of Australian businesses and local jobs.\u201d</p>"
