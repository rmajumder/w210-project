  "<p>When it comes to running Olympic rings around everyone else there has never been a dream team like Fiji\u2019s glorious rugby men. This has already been a momentous week for the sport of union, perhaps its most significant in history in terms of attracting new fans, and there could be no more inspirational champions. Fiji\u2019s long wait for a gold medal is over and the celebrations in the Pacific islands will last for months, if not longer.</p> <p>For GB\u2019s gallant silver medallists there can be no disgrace in losing against a squad of such athletic, powerful genius. Simon Amor\u2019s players will return home with their own rich haul of Brazilian memories, having beaten New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa en route to a final few expected them to reach. When it came to the final, though, they found themselves confronting opponents who, in every respect, were several classes apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/12/how-fiji-manhandled-team-gb-to-claim-first-rugby-sevens-olympic-gold\">How Fiji manhandled Team GB to claim first rugby sevens Olympic gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All too often it was gallant red men against rampaging white giants. How ironic, then, that the master coach who has brought order and rigour to the Harlem Globetrotters creative chaos is an Englishman. Ben Ryan fetched up in Fiji only after becoming disillusioned with Twickenham politics and being repeatedly overlooked for the Premiership club jobs his intelligence and ability should have demanded. When they make the feelgood Hollywood movie about Fiji\u2019s golden generation, as they probably should, the role played by the flame-haired Ryan will be key. Damian Lewis should keep his phone on.</p> <p>As with Australia in the women\u2019s final, Fiji also saved their best until last. There were five galloping tries in the first half alone, the traffic entirely one way. The only time GB made it into their opponents\u2019 half, unfortunate to report, was during the pre-match anthems. In sevens the scoring team kick off again and even the repeated restarts seemed to mostly end up in Fijian paws.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/fijians-celebrate-the-countrys-first-ever-olympic-medal-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qgcq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2649536\"            data-video-name=\"Fijians celebrate the country's first ever Olympic medal - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Fijian Government\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ad6e84e4b0fe7550975063\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/12/160812fiji_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/12/160812fiji.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/12/160812fiji_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/fijians-celebrate-the-countrys-first-ever-olympic-medal-video\">Fijians celebrate the country\u2019s first ever Olympic medal</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It helps to some extent that the Gilbert ball used in sevens is designed slightly differently to the 15-a-side version. Extra pimples, according to the manufacturer, make it a bit easier to catch but harder to kick accurately. This may just explain GB\u2019s and Argentina\u2019s drop-goal issues in the quarter-final but when a Fijian is holding it a different type of physics seems to apply. In terms of offloads \u2013 front, back, reverse, overhead \u2013 there is no more sublime team on the planet, in sevens or 15s, when they are in the mood. Occasionally they do something ridiculously daft but the overall effect is frequently stunning.</p> <p>Josua Tuisova, among the standout players of the tournament, is a 21-year-old force of nature but it was no coincidence the massively impressive Fiji captain Osea Kolinisau scored his side\u2019s opening try. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible role model,\u201d Ryan said beforehand. \u201cHe\u2019s teetotal and religious but in my first tournament in charge the selectors told me not to pick him because he was a troublemaker. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive the three years I\u2019ve had in Fiji without him.\u201d</p> <p>In truth, though, Ryan has had untold riches at his disposal. Fiji had shown signs of genuine intent in the semi-final when they brushed aside Japan 20-5 but Ryan, who is now stepping down with his mission accomplished, had made it clear that anything less than gold would be unacceptable. He also insisted his side would relish the pressure because it brought the best out of them, and so it proved. By the time the former Glasgow lock Leone Nakarawa had stormed away for his team\u2019s fourth try the outcome was long since settled, with the ever-present Semi Kunatani instrumental at least half of Fiji\u2019s seven touchdowns.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/britain-take-silver-rugby-sevens-phelps-wins-again-olympics-rio-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qg88\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2649410\"            data-video-name=\"Britain take silver in rugby sevens as Phelps wins again in Rio \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ad6111e4b024cdec3d6c7f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/12/160812olympics_KP-28701470_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/12/160812olympics_KP-28701470.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/12/160812olympics_KP-28701470_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/britain-take-silver-rugby-sevens-phelps-wins-again-olympics-rio-video-highlights\">Britain take silver in rugby sevens as Phelps wins again in Rio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Dan Norton, outstanding en route to the final along with James Davies, Dan Bibby and Tom Mitchell, did manage one consolation score, converted by Marcus Watson, but the only numbers that really mattered were Fijian ones. This result is a massive deal for a country shattered by tropical cyclone Winston in February, which killed 44 people and caused millions of pounds in damage; experts estimate the economy will now benefit to the tune of 500 million Fiji dollars (\u00a3161 million) in additional tourism and investment revenue generated by more people wanting to visit the place where rugby magic happens.</p> <p>This has also been a big week for everyone with a stake in rugby\u2019s future global health. Japan, 500-1 outsiders for the title before the Games, could not quite claim a bronze medal, losing 54-14 against South Africa in the medal playoff, but there is now guaranteed to be a clamour for tickets when the Olympics come to Tokyo in 2020, the year after Japan are also due to host the next 15-a-side Rugby World Cup.</p> <p>Bill Beaumont, the World Rugby chairman, is also optimistic that the IOC will already be tempted to confirm sevens as a core sport beyond 2020 at its next general assembly in Lima next October. \u201cNobody in World Rugby is conceited enough to think we have a divine right to be here but hopefully we have earned the right to be a permanent sport. All the people I have spoken to have been nothing but encouraging. To be a part of it is just fantastic. In rugby you tend to think you know it all. Then you come to events that are far bigger than anything we normally stage.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca2134b350894e6c4004e952174406fb9a83f5aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca2134b350894e6c4004e952174406fb9a83f5aa/419_281_4943_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vatemo Ravouvou breaks through to score one of Fiji\u2019s seven tries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vatemo Ravouvou breaks through to score one of Fiji\u2019s seven tries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any IOC member who imagines the Games would be better off without Fiji\u2019s rugby team, in particular, needs his or her head examining.

  "<p>Fatoumatah Bah is cornered. Sitting in front of a tinsel-ringed mirror in Miskaa Salon, her head is bent forward, two women at work braiding twists into her hair. She will be stuck in the chair for at least three hours.</p> <p>It is a good moment to pounce. Fatoumatah Kamara, 20, an apprentice hairdresser in a matching skirt and blouse and glinting cherry earrings, sidles up to Bah. She starts to make conversation.</p> <p>At first, it is the usual hairdresser chatter. What rain we\u2019ve been having, eh? Where are you from? What are you up to this weekend? This is the 20-year-old accountancy student\u2019s second visit to the salon in Guinea\u2019s capital, Conakry.</p> <p>Soon Kamara\u2019s questions become more personal. Does Bah have a husband? A boyfriend? Then she goes in for the kill. Does she know there are ways of avoiding getting pregnant?</p> <p>With every manicure, pedicure and hairdo at the Miskaa Salon, clients receive a free treatment: a great deal of contraceptive advice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive\">Contraception and family planning around the world \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five salons across Conakry have been dispensing family planning advice since 2012, and they have been so successful that the project \u2013 the brainchild of <a href=\"https://www.jhpiego.org/\">Jhpiego</a>, a health organisation associated with Johns Hopkins University in the US \u2013 is about to be extended to salons in Guinea\u2019s seven major cities.</p> <p>In Guinea, which has one of the lowest rates of modern contraceptive use in the world, women have an average of five children. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive\">UN figures</a>, in 2015 only 7.5% of married or cohabiting women use some form of contraception.</p> <p>A lot of effort has gone into teaching women in rural Guinea about family planning, but not so much in urban areas. A salon is an excellent place to reach them, so long as it is the right kind of salon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to go where they do braids because that\u2019s what women traditionally want,\u201d says Yolande Hyjazi, Jhpiego\u2019s director in Guinea. \u201cA woman who\u2019s straightening or washing her hair has more money and more access to information.\u201d</p> <p>Across town from Miskaa, Jumelle Coiffure is trying to turn around clients as fast as possible, largely because the room is impossibly cramped. Jumelle is owned by 32-year-old twins Tata Sylla, wearing a short black and bright green wig, and her sister Mbalia, with long, heavy braids.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of young women getting pregnant around here when they didn\u2019t want to, with lots of kids running after them, and I thought it would be good to teach them how to avoid that. Even my apprentices were getting pregnant,\u201d says Mbalia, making up Aminata Kouma\u2019s face just inside the salon door. Outside, a dozen girls huddle under the dripping overhang of the salon\u2019s tin roof, filing fingernails and tugging at each other\u2019s hair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"302fe655c9bb3a56b3286e02e66788d8fd29aa41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/302fe655c9bb3a56b3286e02e66788d8fd29aa41/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An apprentice hairdresser at the Jumelle salon in Conakry shows a client different family planning methods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An apprentice hairdresser at the Jumelle salon in Conakry shows a client different family planning methods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kouma, 35, says she first heard about family planning at Jumelle.</p> <p>\u201cI never knew about this before coming here \u2013 they taught me how,\u201d she said. \u201cI got the injection, and since then I\u2019ve been able to control the number of children I have. I already have four and I don\u2019t want any more. My husband can\u2019t afford it, school fees are so high. There\u2019s too much suffering here. I\u2019m a housemaid, but I\u2019m out of work.\u201d</p> <p>Each salon has an army of apprentices, some of whom have worked in them for years, to cope with the intensity of the work and the number of clients. Jhpiego deliberately chose very popular salons to reach as many people as possible, and trained some of their apprentices as community health workers, to explain how to use exclusive breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy, talk about implants, sell pills and write referrals. They earn half the sale price for any pills and condoms they sell.</p> <p>The trial started in 2013, but everything had to stop for the Ebola outbreak. Like all health organisations, Jhpiego had to turn its efforts to fighting Ebola. In any case, women were not going to the salon.</p> <p>It is now back in full swing, though, and tailors\u2019 shops are the next target. \u201cThere are women that wait around all day for their dresses, trying them on,\u201d Hyjazi said. \u201cPeople are being social, hanging around. But in the tailors\u2019 shops we also have a lot of young men. Reaching men is important.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is that clients of both establishments will talk to their friends, and word will spread.</p> <p>At Miskaa, a large wedding party is getting ready.</p> <p>Apprentice hairdressers cluster around each client, carefully painting on long, black eyebrows, blow-drying hair straight, and making minute adjustments to towering, shiny headwraps.</p> <p>Kamara, pointing at her laminated booklet, has just finished explaining how to use a string of beads to track fertility. But it isn\u2019t new to Bah.</p> <p>\u201cI go on Google, I go on YouTube, I find information,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not everybody is a student like me.\u201d</p> <p>She knew about condoms and pills, but not the other methods Kamara talks about. Young people have far more access to information than previous generations, and sex is slowly becoming something that is more talked about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295c820aa05c9e111175a709f78a898c0d849c14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295c820aa05c9e111175a709f78a898c0d849c14/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young men who have come to Conakry\u2019s Miskaa Salon for cut price condoms are shown how to use them correctly by apprentice hairdresser Nene Diakit\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young men who have come to Miskaa Salon for cut price condoms are shown how to use them correctly by apprentice hairdresser Nene Diakit\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Traditionally, a Guinean woman would space out her children by leaving her husband and going back to her mother\u2019s house for a few years, every time she had a baby.</p> <p>\u201cNow no one is using abstinence, so everyone is using contraceptives, but no one is talking about it,\u201d Hyjazi says. \u201cMany people think that if a women is using contraceptives, it\u2019s because she has another partner. There\u2019s not a lot of open communication \u2013 even between a husband and wife using them. Many women will use the pill without telling their husbands.\u201d</p> <p>One thing is unlikely to change, though, and according to Hyjazi, it is skewing the statistics, because people doing surveys do not always do them in private. \u201cIf a woman is asked if she\u2019s using contraceptives and her mother or mother-in-law is there, she\u2019ll never say yes.\u201d</p> <p>The wedding party is almost ready. Kamara looks over each woman carefully before opening the door for them. In a few hours, they have become more glamorous and, thanks to Kamara, more contraceptive-savvy.</p> <p>\u201cI like making women beautiful \u2013 that\u2019s why I work here,\u201d says Kamara, already looking around for her next quarry.</p>",

  "<p><em>Update: Facebook and Adblock have taken turns unblocking and reblocking ads on the social network. This is likely to continue until one of them cries uncle. Check back with us in a month or two for more updates. (Just kidding.)</em><br></p> <p>Two days ago, Facebook announced it had implemented changes to its site <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/09/facebook-adblockers-desktop-browser\">that would thwart ad blockers</a>. Users who wanted to enjoy the world\u2019s largest social network would continue to pay by seeing ads keyed to their Likes and web-browsing habits. </p> <p>Now popular browser plugin Adblock Plus has returned fire, issuing a filter update that restores its commercial-killing powers to the world of Zuckerberg. </p> <p>Game on.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/a-new-way-to-control-the-ads-you-see-on-facebook-and-an-update-on-ad-blocking/\">a blog post dated 9 August,</a> Facebook vice-president Andrew Bosworth announced that ad blockers would no longer make \u201csponsored posts\u201d disappear on desktop and laptop computers. However, in an apparently magnanimous gesture, Facebook would allow users <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences\">more control over the types of ads</a> they would see. </p> <p>Said Bosworth:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If you don\u2019t want to see ads about a certain interest like travel or cats, you can remove the interest from your ad preferences. We also heard that people want to be able to stop seeing ads from businesses or organizations who have added them to their customer lists, and so we are adding tools that allow people to do this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adblock Plus vowed its community of ad-loathing users would not take those changes sitting down. In a blog post on Thursday, it announced <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/fb-reblock-ad-blocking-community-finds-workaround-to-facebook\">an update to its filters that would restore the plugin\u2019s ad-blocking powers</a> to the world\u2019s biggest social network. Users can either update the plug in by clicking a button or manually add the filter code to the software.</p> <p>According to the Adblock blog:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As many of you know, the filter lists that \u2018tell\u2019 Adblock Plus what to block are in fact the product of a global community of web citizens. This time that community seems to have gotten the better of even a giant like Facebook.</p> </blockquote> <p>Facebook claims the Adblock plugin also blocks non-advertising posts from users\u2019 friends. <br></p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that ad blocking companies are punishing people on Facebook as these new attempts don\u2019t just block ads but also posts from friends and Pages,\u201d says a Facebook spokesperson. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue. Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we\u2019ve instead focused on building tools like ad preferences to put control in people\u2019s hands.\u201d </p> <p>The social network also takes exception to Adblock\u2019s policy of taking money from some of the web\u2019s largest advertisers \u2013 including Google \u2013 to \u201cwhitelist\u201d adverts that follow its guidelines for \u201cacceptable ads\u201d. (This setting is turned on by default, but can be changed by people who wish to see no ads at all.)</p> <p>One of the rules advertisers must follow is that \u201cads must not disrupt the user\u2019s natural reading flow\u201d, and be placed to the side, above or below the \u201cprimary content\u201d. Another is that ads can be clearly distinguished from non-ad content. </p> <p>Sponsored content features prominently in the center of Facebook\u2019s newsfeed, which would hamper the network\u2019s ability to adhere to those guidelines, if it chose to.</p> <p>An estimated <a href=\"https://pagefair.com/blog/2015/ad-blocking-report/\">198 million netizens use some form of ad blocker</a>, according to Page Fair.

Smith says he does not need to be a mind reader because Corbyn had opposed the EU for 30 years.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During the referendum you seemed to have undergone a Damascene conversion.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gender equality</h2> <p>Labour have just selected four men as candidates for regional mayoral elections next May and both candidates were quizzed on what the party could do to ensure greater gender equality. </p> <p>Particularly, both were asked if there should have been some all women shortlists for the mayoral selection processes. </p> <p>Corbyn says he believes it was not the leader\u2019s job to decide on AWS for regional mayors, which should be up to the local party.</p> <p>Smith, however, said he as party leader would have insisted on at least one all women shortlist. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party leader should have insist on one of those [mayoralties], at least, being an all woman shortlist.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Leadership</h2> <p>Smith\u2019s key argument in areas where both men seemed to agree in principle was about leadership and the electibility of the party. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All of the policies we want to put in place all of the principles we hold dear are worth nought because we will not be able to translate any of that into power.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn, whose team have launched a rebuttal website this evening to challenge claims he is not successful electorally, said Smith was ignoring the huge surge in membership under his leadership. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Owen, our party is a strong party, our party is a big party, our campaigning abilities are immense if we work together on those campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Smith said the current tactics were reminiscent of the time the party was out of power for 18 years. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve had mass rallies, we\u2019ve had a big party and we\u2019ve lost successive elections. We know how this one ends, Jeremy, and it doesn\u2019t end well for the working people of Britain. It\u2019s not about the t-shirts we wear and the badges on our lapels.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI think people should wear the t-shirs they want to,\u201d responded Corbyn, calmly.</p> <h2>Defence</h2> <p>Corbyn says we must have a foreign policy \u201cbased on human rights, international law, so we become known as a force that is determined to make sure the universal declaration is enforced in all places\u201d.</p> <p>He says he would aim to eventually lower defence spending, below the 2% of GDP that Nato asks its members to spend. Later, in a discussion about whether he would ever support military action, Corbyn said he would never rule out the possibility, but said there had to be better checks and balances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chilcott report makes pretty sobering reading.. how we ended up in a war we knew was questionably legal.. We have to have a different, less aggressive foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith says he would maintain 2%. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We live in a more volatile world... when I see the prospect of Donald Trump in power in America, when I see Vladimir Putin in charge in Russia, I don\u2019t think now is a time for Britain to shirk its responsibilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me tonight, thank you for reading and for your comments. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57acdc48e4b0fe7550974ec5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T20:17:45.525Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Frances Perraudin has been chatting to supporters and audience members both before and after the debate.

  "<p>It\u2019s been rapturously greeted by just about every strata of Australian sport: Tim Cahill, the prodigal son, our legend, \u201cour Timmy\u201d, has finally deemed the Australian domestic league worthy of his footballing presence. Whatever it was that the A-League didn\u2019t have in February, it has now. And even you can\u2019t help but read his statements in those monotone, UK-translated voices from bad Champions League magazine shows, he\u2019s saying the right things and we\u2019re very lucky to have him, it seems.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s what the relationship balance feels like, anyway. The A-League as the nervous teen, trying to find the right way to look and the right things to say, forever making clumsy overtures to the most attractive person in class. They grew up together but the A-League never felt good enough. Some muscles then appeared and the object of desire faded from the social heights they once straddled. The boy finally, inexplicably, gets the girl. Now what?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/11/tim-cahill-will-play-in-a-league-after-signing-for-melbourne-city\">Tim Cahill will play in A-League after signing for Melbourne City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One only need witness the broad indifference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">Manchester United\u2019s \u00a393.2m payment for Paul Pogba</a> to understand that footballing punters don\u2019t particularly care how these things come about anymore. Transfers are strange and complicated and besides, it\u2019s not our money anyway. Just get the shiny player and let\u2019s get on with the football.</p> <p> However unlike Manchester United, a club with huge, independent pools of cash from which to draw, Cahill\u2019s return is being subsidised in part by the A-League. Under the guest player rule<em> </em>(also known as the Tim Cahill rule), the league can add $1m to the contracts of big-time players. Importantly, all clubs have agreed to this rule, presumably convinced that such measures are ultimately in their collective interests. Why the A-League compels itself to tip in $1m to Cahill\u2019s contract when his employers, the City Football Group, just paid \u00a347.5m for Everton\u2019s John Stones, is worth exploring. You\u2019d hope junior registrations aren\u2019t subsidising Cahill\u2019s contract.</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t matter, because Cahill is here, and we needed him. For the A-League, his arrival represents critical sizzle ahead of crucial broadcast rights negotiations. CEO David Gallop admitted as much. He noted the rule\u2019s potential to improve the standard of A-League play, but also called out the \u201cmarketability and visibility\u201d that the rule offers.</p> <p>Marquee players often deliver a promotional sugar hit, sometimes extraordinary performances, but rarely do they offer both. Cahill\u2019s case is curious: it\u2019s tempting to cast him as a grizzled veteran after one more pay-packet, but this is a guy still banging them in at international level. He has legitimate and reasonable aspirations to play at a fourth World Cup. For Gallop, Cahill\u2019s value is obviously box-office. For Cahill, it\u2019s a little more complicated. A number of his contemporaries \u2013 players from the \u201cgolden generation\u201d \u2013 have attempted the same move, with fairly negligible success. Stadiums will fill regardless of his performance in the short-term, but whether or not they\u2019ll fill in the long-term is directly connected to how dominant he is on the field. With four goals from his 17 starts at his last club, Huangzhou Greentown, corner-flags nationwide watch with bated breath.</p> <p>As ever, celebrity is the currency of success. And for the A-League, the formula seems simple: celebrity means eyeballs, which means sponsors, which means money, which means you can pay celebrities. And so it goes with Tim Cahill. Running deeper, however, is the ongoing sense of validation that Australian domestic football seeks. Does Cahill\u2019s arrival spell credibility for the A-League? And if he struggles, like Harry Kewell did, where to next? </p> <p> For a league looking to gain domestic and international credibility, Cahill\u2019s capture is double-edged. For years, Australian football has endured global condescension for its perceived naivety and an inability to mix it with the heavyweights. Sometimes our own players \u2013 especially those that have made it overseas \u2013 reinforce that perception. The notion the A-League is a step down for Tim Cahill and a step up for the A-League rightly rankles some, and while our most celebrated footballer brings undeniable box office appeal, there\u2019s something satisfying in the knowledge that it is his on-field exploits that will shine the brightest light on how Australian football should view itself.</p>",

The suit demands unspecified compensatory damages.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Phillip \u201cproduced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee cap\u201d during a car trip to check on volunteers in Greenville, South Carolina in February:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Phillip pushed the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee.

May has already taken the diplomatic hit for this, so what\u2019s she got to lose?\u201d</p> <p>Dorfman said a convenient excuse for pulling out of Hinkley could be supplied by problems with the plant\u2019s main backer, France\u2019s EDF, which is committed to using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/flamanville-france-edf-nuclear-reactor-hinkley-point-c\">European pressurised reactor (EPR) technology that is running over budget at sites in France</a> and Finland.</p> <p>\u201cIf government wanted to, it could avoid taking China to task on this by reframing the problem in the context of the failed French EPR reactor, which is three times over-cost and over-time where it\u2019s being built in Finland and France.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38166ebe3a654ac56e6294c327f798cfb078397a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38166ebe3a654ac56e6294c327f798cfb078397a/0_0_665_805/413.jpg\" alt=\"Szuhsiung \u2018Allen\u2019 Ho\" width=\"413\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Szuhsiung \u2018Allen\u2019 Ho is charged by the US government with nuclear espionage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Knox county sheriff's office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/environment/energy\">Energy</a> industry sources also raised questions over how much the former prime minister and chancellor knew about the CGN case in the US. One source said the Tennessee case had been known about in security circles for nearly a year because elements of it had been in the public domain but not highlighted by media.</p> <p>\u201cIt is inconceivable that George Osborne and David Cameron had not been told about the case by the security forces. May \u2013 as former home secretary \u2013 was perhaps willing to listen more intently to what they (MI5) were telling her,\u201d said one.</p> <p>CGN said it could not immediately comment on the scandal but promised it would provide a written statement. Ho\u2019s attorney, Peter Zeidenberg, said his client had been openly engaged in commercial activity involving non-classified information. </p> <p>The UK\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) also declined to discuss the issue or its implications. \u201cThis is a matter for the American authorities. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on a live court case,\u201d said a BEIS spokesperson.</p> <p>Hinkley was meant to be a central part of George Osborne\u2019s bid to usher in a \u201cgolden decade\u201d of closer trade relations with China. Final details of the deal were announced as the former chancellor toured the country last year.</p> <p>In addition to potential security concerns, some in Whitehall had always harboured doubts about whether the vast reactor project was worth the generous subsidies that the government had had to pledge to get an investment agreement. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/hinkley-point-c-case-against-cgn-has-the-feel-of-a-modern-spy-thriller\">Hinkley Point C: case against CGN has the feel of a modern spy thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Osborne was known to be so attached to the project that objections were pushed aside. The former chancellor, who was sacked by May last month in one of her first acts as prime minister, could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p> <p>Greg Clark, the new energy secretary, is known to be keen to scrutinise the financial details before formal approval is given. Downing Street has said a decision will be made next month while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming\">Chinese have already made clear their irritation with the delay</a>.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, shadow energy secretary, expressed concern about the court case being used by ministers as an excuse for dumping Hinkley. \u201cThere are many reasons to criticise the Hinkley C deal: the vast cost; the long subsidy lock-in while other technologies fall in price and the technical feasibility of the project ever being built. These are genuine risks the government ought to have addressed two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe government says it wants to boost international trade. If the government held off the deal because of these allegations, they have jeopardised a relationship with a key future trade partner at a time when we need to be creating new friends and forging new trade alliances.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>For many journalists there is no greater irony than Arianna Huffington, the eponymous publisher of the Huffington Post, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/11/arianna-huffington-to-leave-huffington-post-thrive\">giving up her role</a> in the company she founded 11 years ago to spend more time with a \u201cwellness\u201d start-up focused on telling us all to get more sleep. \u201cHuffPo\u201d built its success on being part of speeding up the 24-hour news cycle, filling pages with unpaid contributions, and generally adding to an environment which fellow publishers found not even slightly relaxing. Even with a special pillow.</p> <p>When the Huffington Post launched on 9 May 2005, it caught the news industry in the middle of a giant collective snooze. Hard as it might be to imagine now, it was a year when mainstream new organisations had reason to believe there would be a future for advertising-funded news websites. The future seemed brighter than at any point in the past five years. Out of nowhere, it seemed, the Huffington Post emerged, bringing with it an approach which pushed digital practice far further than most of the even forward-looking news organisations were prepared to go at the time.</p> <p>At the Guardian we set up our opinion site \u201cComment is Free\u201d in response to the obvious and immediate success of the Huffington Post in breaking the mold for \u201clive\u201d commentary. We even had a picture of Arianna Huffington pinned to the wall to ask, only partially satirically, \u201cwhat would Arianna do?\u201d</p> <p>Huffington opting to spend more time with her earplugs was not the only nostalgic farewell for New York media this week, as the staff of Gawker <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/11/nick-denton-s-end-of-an-era-party-for-gawker-before-it-s-sold.html\">threw a party</a> last night ahead of next Tuesday\u2019s auction which puts the publisher on the block following the well-publicised loss of a libel suit brought by wrestler Hulk Hogan and financed by Silicon Valley billionaire, Peter Thiel.</p> <p>Nick Denton, Gawker\u2019s British founder, is, like Huffington, a key figure in the transformation of modern American journalism. Gawker, founded in 2002, brought an alien sensibility to a New York publishing world that took itself very seriously.</p> <p>There are plenty of those even working in the digital realm who saw both companies pushing the boundaries of publishing in undesirable directions, not least Thiel, whose personal vendetta against Gawker grew from the publication discussing his sexuality. Those critical of Gawker tend to be those most likely to be skewered by its journalism. For the Huffington Post, the critics tended to be those that were skewered by its business model.</p> <p>The founding partners of the Huffington Post, which included Jonah Peretti and Ken Lerer (who also set up BuzzFeed) and, briefly, the deceased rightwing blogger Andrew Breitbart, knew that to reach adequate scale on the web they needed to publish far more, but for a fraction of the cost. As a result, Huffington Post became famous for being the platform which made it OK not to pay writers for their work. Conversely, it highlighted the fact that there were many more people willing to write for little or nothing for \u201cexposure\u201d of a global publisher than there were people who demanded payment.</p> <p>To think of Gawker and Huffington Post as taking wrecking balls to a noble industry which would otherwise have (eventually) found a righteous path of prosperity and good practice through the digital swamp is completely wrong. Had Gawker or Huffington Post not come along when they did, then something else would have. And many arguably better things have emerged subsequently. Energy and investment needed to find its way into digital journalism in the mid-2000s and venerable institutions needed to be pushed further into understanding how to make journalism work in a changed environment.</p> <p>A more testing issue for journalism now is thinking how to sustain a market where the next Dentons or Huffingtons will come from. Thiel has all but closed Gawker, AOL has taken over the Huffington Post; every news business, new and old, is rethinking whether it can exist as a free service in a market where advertising has collapsed. Facebook and Snapchat have more attention from both readers and advertisers than publishers. We are being urged to pay for journalism, rather in the way we are being urged to stop using fossil fuel: the moral case is strong, but the solutions for \u201chow\u201d are sparse and economically unpromising.</p> <p>At least Arianna Huffington need no longer lose sleep over such problems.</p>",

The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, tweeted in response that \u201conly Syrian regime uses [helicopters]\u201d.</p> <p>The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons. Since the US president, Barack Obama, stepped back from enforcing his \u201cred line\u201d on their use, attacks have drawn nothing more than public condemnation from western leaders. </p> <p>Although most recent attacks have been relatively small, the toll of dead and maimed civilians and activists is mounting and experts are concerned that the use of chemical weapons is no longer as shocking as it was a few years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThere is certainly a huge risk of normalising [the use of chemical weapons],\u201d said Richard Guthrie, a British chemical weapons expert who has raised concerns about the wider impacts of Syria\u2019s continued use of toxins as weapons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f7105ead5f30e0a4f7c3377e388a80faca99984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f7105ead5f30e0a4f7c3377e388a80faca99984/0_138_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A damaged vehicle after a Syrian army helicopter belonging hit a residential area in Aleppo with barrel bombs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A damaged vehicle after a Syrian army helicopter belonging hit a residential area in Aleppo with barrel bombs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn recent decades, chemical weapons have slowly been de-legitimised as a currency of power.

When Will Shu launched the food delivery service from his London flat in 2013, the American made deliveries on his scooter for the first eight months, albeit to better understand the business\u2019s complex logistics rather than to pay the bills.</p> <p>The idea was hatched from Shu\u2019s experience working long hours as an investment banker on Wall Street in the early 2000s. At Morgan Stanley he received a $25 dinner allowance to sustain late-night number crunching, which he and his colleagues splurged on takeaways from local restaurants. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-drivers-protest-london-changes-pay-structure\">Deliveroo riders protest in London against changes to pay structure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Getting nice restaurants to deliver to your office proved to be a tougher ask when Shu transferred to the bank\u2019s London office. \u201cI was literally working the same hours as in New York but I had to go to Tesco\u2019s every night ... it just became really depressing,\u201d he told one interviewer. </p> <p>Ready for something new, in 2010 Shu, who was born in Connecticut to Chinese parents, returned to the US to do an MBA. After graduating, he teamed up with his childhood friend Greg Orlowski, who had been working as a software engineer. The pair went on to launch the business in early 2013 with just three restaurants on board, one of whom was the owner of the restaurant Shu lived above on the capital\u2019s upmarket King\u2019s Road in Chelsea. </p> <p>While Shu has been the enthusiastic public face of Deliveroo, Orlowski, a fellow American, has shunned the limelight. According to his modest LinkedIn profile, the 37-year-old was the architect of the Deliveroo logistics system and website. He left the business this year to spend more time with his wife and young family in Chicago. At that time, Shu said: \u201cWithout him, the business would not be what it is today and we remain close friends.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa683abd2b2f853fa2792bc3c00c3b5d590623d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa683abd2b2f853fa2792bc3c00c3b5d590623d2/0_75_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deliveroo riders protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters in London on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deliveroo riders protest outside the company\u2019s headquarters in London on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still just 36, Shu, who is single and lives in London\u2019s trendy Notting Hill, has stayed on to lead Deliveroo\u2019s charge for global domination. While its army of couriers are upset about being shortchanged by plans to replace an hourly wage with commission, investors cannot throw enough money at the company. </p> <p>Last week, Deliveroo revealed it had raised another $275m (\u00a3212m) from investors to fund expansion. It has now raised close to $500m with some analysts saying it is close to joining the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/14/square-ipo-unicorns-silicon-valley-tech-bubble\">unicorn</a>\u201d herd, a label given to tech startups such as Uber and Airbnb judged to be worth more than $1bn. It may yet prove to be hubris, but Shu\u2019s old scooter has been sprayed gold and has pride of place in Deliveroo\u2019s trendy London offices.</p>",
  "<p>A war of words has erupted between groups affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement and pro-Israel commentators over the characterization of Israel in their policy document released last week.</p> <p>The policy <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/platform/\">platform</a> titled A Vision for Black Lives, is a wide-spanning document that was <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/movement-black-lives-platform/494309/\">drafted by</a> more than 50 organizations known as the Movement for Black Lives. It goes beyond criminal justice and touches on many issues including education and economics.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/invest-divest/\">Invest/Divest</a> section of the platform, the group criticizes the US government for providing military aid to Israel.</p> <p>\u201cThe US justifies and advances the global war on terror via its alliance with Israel and is complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people,\u201d the platform says. \u201cIsrael is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people.\u201d</p> <p>This characterization drew ire from pro-Israel commentators, and in the week since its release many have penned op-eds and statements condemning the movement.</p> <p>On his personal <a href=\"https://medium.com/@J0NATHAN_G/eyes-on-the-prize-in-pursuit-of-racial-justice-stick-to-the-facts-and-avoid-the-fiction-5a5486a5cb4e#.tm67on7ma\">Medium</a> page, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt wrote that, while he agreed with the majority of the document, he called the treatment of Israel \u201cone-sided\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe categorically reject the document\u2019s criticism of the United States and Israel,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s repellent and completely inaccurate to label Israel\u2019s policy as \u2018genocide\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Other groups such as the <a href=\"http://truah.org/5-media/general/779-t-ruah-statement-on-black-lives-matter-platform.html\">T\u2019ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.jcrcboston.org/jcrc-statement-regarding-black-lives-matter-platform/\">Boston chapter of the Jewish Community Relations Council</a> expressed \u201cdismay\u201d over the platform. The JCRC said it could no longer support Black Lives Matter and while T\u2019ruah said it will \u201cinsist on standing up for the dignity and safety of both Israelis and Palestinians\u201d.</p> <p>Dream Defenders, one of the groups that wrote the Invest/Divest section, wrote a <a href=\"http://www.dreamdefenders.org/dream_defenders_statement_on_the_condemnation_of_m4bl_platform_by_some_pro_israel_groups\">rebuttal</a> to some of the criticism in which they stood by the platform.

Sari Bashi, Israel and Palestine country director for Human Rights Watch, told the Guardian that, while apartheid does not have a specific legal definition, there are definitely laws that discriminate between Palestinians and Israelis in Israel. This is most prevalent in the West Bank.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that you have completely distinct systems of law that apply to Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Palestinian residents,\u201d Bashi said. \u201cIsraeli settlers have a whole host of rights and privileges that Palestinian residents in the West Bank do not have.\u201d</p> <p>Bashi said that, among other things, Palestinians are subject to military law in the West Bank while Israelis are subject to civil law, which is far more forgiving.</p> <p>The word genocide does have a clear legal meaning and Bashi said it does not apply in the case of Palestine.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to destroy an entire people,\u201d Bashi said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any presentation of how that could apply in Israel. Even if you kill a lot of people, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s genocide.\u201d</p> <p>The platform also drew criticism for its support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. It called for an end to anti-BDS legislation being passed in a number of states.</p> <p>\u201cThis type of legislation not only harms the movement to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but is a threat to the constitutional right to free speech and protest,\u201d the platform said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net\">BDS</a> is a movement started in 2005 that was inspired by the boycott of South Africa for its apartheid policies. It calls for supporters to boycott Israel in various ways, this includes businesses, academics, artists and more. Activists also call on universities to divest stocks and funds from corporations that are involved in selling weapons or profiting from the conflict.</p> <p>The movement has gained traction on college campuses in the US, leading to many critics to decry the organization as antisemitic, and linked to radical Islam. A campaign was started to outlaw BDS, with several legislators putting forth anti-BDS bills, with the backing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/sheldon-adelson-looks-to-stamp-out-growing-us-movement-to-boycott-israel\">prominent lobbyist such as Sheldon Anderson</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://palestinelegal.org/legislation/\">Anti-BDS legislation</a> has now been passed in more than 20 states.</p> <p>Rabbi Dan Dorsch, of Atlanta, outlined his disapproval for the movement in a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.735596\">piece for Haaretz</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe mainstream Jewish community \u2013 not to mention the leaders of the Palestinian government \u2013 reject the BDS movement as harmful to progress, discriminatory and antisemitic,\u201d Dorsch said. </p> <p>The rabbi added that claiming the oppression of black people in America is linked to the struggle of Palestinians is \u201cunquestionably shortsighted and will only undermine the credibility of the movement and the important cause of civil rights in America\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>The BHS scandal is far from over, in fact it may only just be starting. The flagship store on Oxford Street in London is pulling down its shutters for the final time this weekend and the last of the retail chain\u2019s 164 outlets around the country will all be closed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/23/all-bhs-stores-to-shut-down-by-20-august\">following Saturday</a>.</p> <p>However, the news that Jones Day has been brought in to investigate the conduct of BHS\u2019s directors in the run-up to its collapse shows that questions remain unanswered.</p> <p>Jones Day has been brought in by FRP Advisory, the joint administrator to BHS. It is standard practice for an administrator to bring in a law firm to help with an insolvency process, but this appointment stands out for two reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, FRP was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/pension-fund-wants-new-insolvency-experts-to-investigate-bhs-collapse\">only appointed as the second administrator in June</a> because the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 the biggest creditor to BHS \u2013 wanted a second opinion alongside the initial administrator Duff &amp; Phelps. Secondly, Jones Day is a heavyweight US law firm. FRP could have brought in a less prestigious law firm to just help it tick a few boxes, but it has chosen the outfit that is a leading an internal investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/volkswagen-handling-emissions-scandal-shambles-investors-agm-german-carmaker\">diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">parliamentary report into the collapse of BHS</a>, led by the Labour MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, provided an impressive and detailed account of how the 88-year-old retailer was brought to its knees. It heavily criticised Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, accusing him of plundering the company for his own financial gain. Field has subsequently described the billionaire tycoon as \u201cevil\u201d and asked the Serious Fraud Office to look into whether money was illegally moved around to make Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Green, look a credible buyer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/sir-philip-green-told-do-right-thing-bhs-pension-deficit\">Sir Philip Green told to 'do the right thing' and plug BHS pension deficit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green clearly has a moral obligation, potentially a legal one too, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bhs-pension-deficit-sir-philip-green-sort-it\">fill the \u00a3571m blackhole in BHS\u2019s pension scheme. </a> However, Field\u2019s war of words with Green must not stop the mismanagement of BHS under Chappell from being thoroughly investigation.</p> <p>While the SFO and the Insolvency Service, which is also looking into BHS, will inevitably look into Chappell\u2019s acquisition of the retailer for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015, there are more questions about what happened in the following 13 months.</p> <p>These questions include: how did Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions extract at least \u00a317m from BHS while it owned the retailer? Did Retail Acquisitions breach contractual agreements with Green by taking money from the sale of BHS property? Was BHS money used to pay off the mortgage on Chappell\u2019s family home? Why did Chappell move \u00a31.5m from BHS into the unconnected BHS Sweden just days before it collapsed?</p> <p>The appointment of Jones Day will help to find the answers.</p> <h2>Minimum wage</h2> <p>The government on Thursday unveiled its new list of the companies failing to pay the minimum wage by trumpeting it as the \u201clargest ever\u201d. But the naming and shaming of so many offenders should not be celebrated; it is shameful.</p> <p>There are 198 employers on the list, including some recognisable names such as Greene King, Poundstretcher, and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club. </p> <p>Sports Direct is not on the latest list, but founder Mike Ashley has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/sports-direct-agrees-back-pay-deal-with-hmrc-minimum-wage\"> admitted it is under investigation by HMRC </a>for failing to pay staff the minimum wage. </p> <p>The retailer\u2019s latest annual report shows that staff turnover at the company rose to 22% last year. That is three times the national average and means that one in five at Sports Direct left the business in just 12 months.</p> <p>This suggests that staff are prepared to act if they are unhappy with their job. However, not all workers have the option of another job or the confidence to leave their position. </p> <p>The government must do more than simply name-and-shame or fine offenders. Company directors should be made personally responsible for paying their staff properly and face criminal charges if they don\u2019t. It is not difficult to ensure that staff are being paid.</p> <h2>Virgin Media and Southampton</h2> <p>The Premier League football season starts on Saturday after an extraordinary summer of spending, capped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">Manchester United signing Paul Pogba for a world record fee of \u20ac110m (\u00a393.2m)</a> just four years after letting him leave for \u00a3800,000.</p> <p>But in the parallel economic world of the Premier League, an interesting sponsorship agreement has been struck that will hopefully be a blueprint for the future.</p> <p>As part of its deal to sponsor Southampton, Virgin Media will subsidise tickets for away fans travelling to the south coast football club. This means ticket prices will be capped at \u00a320.</p> <p>The move has been welcomed by the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation, which is behind a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/02/twentys-plenty-premier-league-football-supporters-federation-ticket-prices\">\u201cTwenty\u2019s Plenty\u201d</a> campaign to lower football ticket prices for travelling fans.</p> <p>The tie-up between Southampton and Virgin Media is evidence that the vast amounts of money flowing into football can be used to help supporters. Hopefully other companies and football clubs will follow the example.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort in Aberdeenshire has admitted it failed to comply with strict data protection laws after not registering with the UK\u2019s privacy watchdog, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office contacted staff at the \u00a330m resort near Aberdeen, Scotland, after it confirmed it was not registered under the Data Protection Act despite operating an extensive CCTV system and handling data on thousands of golfers and guests, its staff and suppliers.</p> <p>The resort insisted the failure was a \u201cclerical error\u201d, but the ICO is now being urged to launch a full investigation by residents, opposition politicians at Holyrood, and the film-maker Anthony Baxter, who directed You\u2019ve Been Trumped. They claim Trump\u2019s history of conflicts with his opponents raises misgivings about the resort\u2019s failure to comply with the legal requirement to register.</p> <p>The MSP Liam McArthur, justice spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cThere is a strong case for the ICO to look into how the Trump organisation stored and used the data that it holds. </p> <p>\u201cThis is an organisation which has been accused of bullying local people who disagree with it, and these substantive concerns cannot be brushed under the carpet.

The only alternative route was to register through a third party, but it had no information that the company had done so.</p> <p>Businesses that store or use confidential personal data, including bank records, credit card details and mobile phone numbers must register with the ICO, unless they qualify for an exemption.</p> <p>\u201cThe Data Protection Act requires every organisation that processes personal information to register with the ICO, unless it is exempt.

Of three cameras visible in its maintenance compound, one points directly at the access road to the home of David Milne, one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, who lives in a former coastguard station overlooking the course, and his neighbour Susie Munro, another opponent. As of last week, there was no visible sign warning visitors that CCTV was being used.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s critics fear the resort could use its CCTV systems to track their and guests\u2019 movements, even though Scotland\u2019s robust right to roam law entitles the public have a legal right to walk across the resort. Trump\u2019s staff vigorously denied using CCTV covertly. </p> <p>In a statement responding to questions from the Guardian about its use of CCTV cameras and storage of confidential data, Trump International Golf Course Scotland said: \u201cWe take the security of our employees and guests\u2019 personal data very seriously and comply with all aspects of the Data Protection Act. A clerical oversight has just been brought to our attention which is now being rectified.\u201d <br></p> <p>Asked about allegations that CCTV was used to track legitimate activity by the public on or next to the course, the company said: \u201cAs a public facility open to all, Trump International has CCTV cameras located at its entrance and around the public buildings within the estate, for the safety and security of its members, guests and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe company has no need for cameras outwith those areas and has never had any cause to supply CCTV footage in any criminal proceedings.

Their treatment by the police, including being thrown against a car, was featured in the film.</p> <p>A rambler called Rohan Beyts, a retired social worker active in the Tripping Up Trump campaign group, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/12/film-makers-arrested-donald-trump-scottish-golf-resort\">charged</a> under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act for allegedly urinating in the dunes while she was out walking on the course with a fellow campaigner, Sue Edwards, in April.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theferret.scot/woman-charged-peeing-trump-golf-course/\">Beyts was told by police that she had been filmed by Trump staff</a> using their mobile phones ducking down behind a dune. As she and Edwards walked off the course, a photographer believed to work for a local paper jumped out of a car and photographed them.</p> <p>Beyts said prosecutors advised her in a statutory warning letter that the unproven charges would be put on record. She has refused to admit the charges and challenged the decision to issue a warning letter. \u201cI find it very uncomfortable,\u201d she said last week. \u201cWe always thought we were being watched. When they were building the course, every time we set foot on it [there were] security guards there instantly.\u201d</p> <p>Milne said the resort\u2019s failure to register under the DPA was \u201csymptomatic of the [resort\u2019s] entire approach to UK legislation\u201d. It had repeatedly built on the course without getting planning permission, only applying after buildings, walls or two flagpoles were in place.</p> <p>\u201cAn ICO investigation is required because of the track record of the organisation, because of the way it has harassed and attempted to intimidate both those who live on or near the estate and those who walk on to it,\u201d Milne said. \u201cThe ICO needs to investigate because it has done so elsewhere, when similar things have happened. It should be one law for all.\u201d</p> <p>Baxter, who was not prosecuted for allegedly threatening Trump staff during his filming \u2013 a charge he disputed \u2013 said he had made a subject access request under the Data Protection Act asking for all the information the company holds on him.</p> <p>\u201cI have on a number of occasions filmed around and near the Trump links property and am concerned that my image may have been captured on numerous occasions and I am concerned also how these images are being stored and used,\u201d he said. <br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 11 August to replace a picture showing Trump\u2019s other golf course in Scotland.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>In a small, grassy plaza, beneath a beating sun, a crowd of students dance in front of nine hirsute musicians playing Afrobeat and vintage psych-rock. That it is just past midday on a Wednesday does little to subdue anyone: the music onstage is so celebratory few can resist.</p> <p>This is the sound of the Kutiman orchestra, though you would be pushed to recognise which member is Kutiman himself: a brass section has sidled to the front, ahead of two percussionists, two guitarists and a bassist. It is only the occasional signal to his colleagues that confirms Kutiman is the diminutive figure shielded behind a bank of keyboards to the right. In his Israeli homeland, however \u2013 and to the students of Sapir college, 50 miles south of Tel Aviv \u2013 this modest individual is a quiet hero.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDd290xHltE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gDd290xHltE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1V5Oc3hMbc\">Kutiman feat.

Kutiman \u2013 born Ophir Kutiel, or Kuti to his friends \u2013 has never hogged the spotlight.

The documentary has now received more than 2.7m hits, and one of the film\u2019s most unforgettable, moments captures Montgomery\u2019s joyous reaction when she first hears it.</p> <p>Recently, Kutiman reluctantly joined Montgomery to attend international screenings, and they have also collaborated on new songs, but the producer\u2019s biggest concern remains his prospective loss of privacy.

This reminded me that I know how to play piano a little, and then piano wasn\u2019t cool enough. Guitar was cool. So I taught myself guitar.\u201d</p> <p>In his late teens, Kutiman relocated to Tel Aviv to study jazz at Rimon music college (\u201cthe Israeli <a href=\"https://www.berklee.edu/\">Berklee</a>\u201d), but it was a convenience store job that provided his greatest epiphany. \u201cThere was this college radio there, and it played trip-hop and jungle and stuff.

When Laroz encouraged the two to visit Jamaica, they took his advice. The trip proved uncomfortably eye-opening. \u201cWe thought we were going to land and someone was going to bring us a spliff,\u201d Kutiman says, \u201cbut we found ourselves on a farm with just a laptop.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/05/fela-kuti-10-best-songs\">Fela Kuti \u2013 10 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, Kutiman says, \u201cIt really made me. The guy that came from Jamaica and the guy who went to Jamaica is not the same guy.\u201d A meeting with Stephen and Damien Marley may have coloured his perspective, but it was the working methods he developed that really shaped his future: lacking a single instrument, he and Sabbo began cutting and pasting their old recordings. The technique not only gave birth to the Thru You projects, but also to his own, albeit limited, Kutiman releases, on which the multi-instrumentalist loops his own performances, building tracks up before inviting string players and singers to add the final touches.</p> <p>The results are further indebted to a box of albums Sabbo once gave him. \u201cEvery one was a masterpiece,\u201d Kutiman grins. \u201cI take out a CD: \u2018Par-lia-ment!

On the exhilarating 6am, he creates a modern amalgam of African flavoured psychedelic rock that nods historically to exotica, soul, breakbeat and jazz while recalling the diverse likes of contemporaries such as Cinematic Orchestra, Air and Antibalas.</p> <p>As bats emerge from beneath his home\u2019s eaves, zipping into the darkness beyond his porch, Kutiman considers the possibility that his new album might jeopardise his quiet life. In contrast to many of the YouTubers in whose work he regularly immerses himself, he remains circumspect. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that,\u201d he laughs humbly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, it\u2019s psychedelic, but how big can it get? I just want to enjoy playing with my friends. I don\u2019t have this dream to conquer the world at all.\u201d As Princess Shaw might remind him, however, there\u2019s more to success than dreams.</p> <ul> <li>6am by Kutiman is out now on Siyal Music, as is the single She\u2019s a Revolution.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Boiler Room\u2019s recent broadcast from Nigeria \u2013 which we\u2019re revisiting on Guardian Music today \u2013 broke new ground. It was the first time a show had been live-streamed from a Lagos nightclub to the world. With the club\u2019s own Wi-Fi connection offering a flickering, untrustworthy signal, the stream was facilitated by chaining multiple mobile sim cards together, giving enough bandwidth to upload a few hours of high-quality video. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Boiler Room\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\">Boiler Room</a> </figure>  <p>That was apt. Where once it could take days, even months, for a song to travel from being a hit in Lagos to being a hit in Abuja (let alone to travel to being a hit in London or New York), the global spread of the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/the-rise-of-afrobeats\">Afrobeats</a> scene has been helped in huge amount by two things: the increasing speed and availability of broadband in Lagos and the sudden proliferation of smartphone technology, which has brought computing power to the pockets of billions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Giggs\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 100px);&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot; https://boilerroom.tv/recording/giggs-lagos/?embedded=true&amp;minimal=false&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top: 0px;left:0px;width:100%; height:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Giggs performs for Boiler Room in Nigeria </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSocial media is the be all and end all out here,\u201d yells Teni Zaccheaus, over the noise at the <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/gateways-nigeria/\">Boiler Room</a> show. He\u2019s here as manager of DRB, a rising Afrobeats duo who are performing their mix of poppy R&amp;B, deep Nigerian melodies and bass-heavy hip-hop to the admiring home crowd. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last two years, data has become so much more accessible, even on people\u2019s not-so-smart phones. You can buy music, download music, it\u2019s made a big difference. Tweeting, Snapchat, SoundCloud, all of it \u2013 Nigerians are heavy users of the internet. It\u2019s insane how quickly songs can travel now.\u201d</p> <p>To make his point, he pulls out his phone and shows his WhatsApp account. It is constantly popping off with artists sending new music, promoters firing over party invites, and group chats dedicated to who is going where later that evening. \u201cIn Nigeria, WhatsApp is huge, the biggest form of communication. It\u2019s taken over from BlackBerry Messenger. Not everyone has iMessenger but everyone has WhatsApp \u2013 for business, for groups. I used a WhatsApp group to promote this show.

Print media covering the new music scene is nearly nonexistent, and DJs on radio stations such as Beat FM \u2013 Lagos\u2019s current top station for breaking new homegrown talent \u2013 are as likely to hear a new track through a WhatsApp message or on a Snapchat loop as they are through any sort of standard promo campaign. </p> <p>In a country where mobile phones are far more affordable than laptops or tablets, it\u2019s inevitable that new social media, specifically platforms designed for phones, should take hold so quickly. While the story of artists taking control of their careers using social media has become well known in the UK, the speed with which Nigerians have adopted the technology \u2013 and the way this has networked the country\u2019s diaspora \u2013 is already having wider effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"500ee19ac7d5941b8bb75efdff946ae407201f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/500ee19ac7d5941b8bb75efdff946ae407201f05/0_0_2055_3000/685.jpg\" alt=\"Falz at the 2016 BET awards - where he won best new international act.\" width=\"685\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Falz at the 2016 BET awards \u2013 where he won best new international act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Livingston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Teni points out that Nigerian rapper Folarin Falana, otherwise known as Falz, has <a href=\"http://buzznigeria.com/falz-wins-bet-awards/\">just won the 2016 BET award for best new international act</a>. Falz is signed to his own independent label, Bahd Guys Records, and has almost no presence outside Nigeria (until he won the award, at least), and yet he beat, among others, the UK act Section Boyz, who have recently been performing with such American A-listers as Drake and Chris Brown. With the award being decided by a public vote, Falz was able to mobilise a huge Nigerian following via WhatsApp, communicating to the Nigerian diaspora as much as his local fans. It seems unlikely that Falz\u2019s award will be the last time that the influence of this network will be seen. </p> <p>Inevitably, as this increase in mobile technology disseminates Nigerian music to a worldwide audience, it also brings music into Nigeria from around the world \u2013 particularly the US and UK. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/skepta-konnichiwa-review-boy-better-know-album-of-the-week\">Skepta</a> is currently massive in Lagos, as his sellout Christmas show in the city proved, and the clubs are as likely to be playing the latest trap beats from Atlanta as they are anything produced in a local studio. As a result, the sound is hybridising, taking on elements of grime and trap and fusing them into Lagosian styles with a rapidity that had previously been absent. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d concludes Teni. \u201cBut everybody is getting that outside view of what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world. It\u2019s changing the sound here. Everything\u2019s getting very exciting right now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>To the set of the latest Fast &amp; Furious, the multibillion-dollar movie franchise that any psychiatrist will tell you makes Clarkson-era Top Gear look relaxed about the size of its penis. If you have ever wondered <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/10-Best-Fast-Furious-Car-Stunts-Ranked-By-Greatness-70667.html?story_page=9\">what it\u2019s like to jump from one Dubai skyscraper to another in a car</a> \u2013 and more importantly, what it means about your relationship with your mother \u2013 this is the hot metal cinematic experience for you. And, yes, obviously I\u2019ve watched them all.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not important right now, because there is beef on the set of its newest iteration, Fast 8. Chances are your response to that is: \u201cUm, yes? The movie stars Vin Diesel, The Rock, Jason Statham, Ludacris, Scott Eastwood \u2026 Self-evidently there is beef. It is a beef farm. Or rather, a mechanically recovered beef processing plant, where you would probably rather not partake of the wares on offer.\u201d</p> <p>Yet wait \u2013 because I\u2019m not talking about that kind of beef. This is the other beef: aggro beef, conflict beef, the kind of beef where franchise star <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BI25NjMDPWv/\">The Rock posts a late-night, lengthy social media rant</a> this week, and it isn\u2019t just a stream of tenuously coherent hashtags like #30repsaminute #projectburn #justbringit #bloodsweat&amp;respect #crushthefear #betterneverstops #bringonthegreat. (Actually, the last two are the most recent official slogans for Team GB \u2013 I believe they use The Rock\u2019s discarded workout tweets as their official branding agency.)</p> <p>And so to The Rock\u2019s 95 Theses. Beneath a short clip of him throwing some chap against a wall, he began by saluting the movie\u2019s crew and \u201cmy female co-stars\u201d. \u201cMy male co-stars however are a different story,\u201d he went on. \u201cSome conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don\u2019t. The ones that don\u2019t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses.\u201d</p> <p>Oof. As Bismarck once pointed out, those who like sausages and enjoy the Fast &amp; Furious franchise should never see either being made. But there was more, including an insight into The Rock\u2019s process for which Inside the Actors Studio would kill. \u201cWhen you watch this movie next April,\u201d The Rock revealed, \u201cand it seems like I\u2019m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling \u2013 you\u2019re right.\u201d Clearly, cinematic historians will come to view this post as the Hearts of Darkness to Fast 8\u2019s Apocalypse Now. In the meantime, I hope The Rock takes a crumb of comfort from the fact that he is in a line of work where he is able to channel his raging desire to throw people into a wall into the role of a raging man who throws people into a wall.</p> <p>More pressingly, though, what of said co-workers? If anything, the international media have underplayed the outburst, reporting simply that it \u201csent shockwaves round the world\u201d, and declaring that The Rock\u2019s fellow Fast 8 stars were furious that \u201cthey are all suspects\u201d. Quite. There were still several days of filming left. They didn\u2019t know whether it was their ass being watched for signs of candy. I can\u2019t even imagine the strain of living in that type of paranoia-inducing closed environment, let alone shooting a scene where a car has to headbutt a Chinook, and you daren\u2019t even ask what your motivation for screaming NOOOOOOOOOO is, in case you\u2019re being scoped. That set can have been nothing less than the panopticon of candyassery.</p> <p>Consequently, some of The Rock\u2019s co-stars broke early and in ways that were painful to watch. Tyrese Gibson was so anxious not to be identified as the candy ass that he posted a film of The Rock singing to his young daughter <a href=\"https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/fast-8-tyrese-gibson-has-never-had-a-problem-210401130.html\">accompanied by the observation:</a> \u201cA man wouldn\u2019t be singing with his heart and soul to another man\u2019s little angel if he had a problem with her dad.\u201d I literally can\u2019t think of a more candy-assed reaction. But Tyrese didn\u2019t seem to be the candy ass in question.</p> <p>After a couple of days of fevered speculation, reports finally zeroed in on the candy ass in question \u2013 and, would you believe, it is said to be none other than Vin Diesel himself.</p> <p>Clearly, this is a lot to take in. This, after all, is Vin Diesel \u2013 real name Mark Sinclair \u2013 who, from the get-go, selected the pretend surname Diesel over something flashy like Vin Petrol or Vin Gasoline. That sent a humble message. It suggested he was hard-working, might retain his value better over time, but mainly represented a sensible, cheaper choice for the economically minded auteur. And I\u2019d like to think Vin\u2019s canon has borne that out.</p> <p>But now \u2013 well, has there been a higher-camp movie feud in years? On screen, these tattooed hardmen may square up tit-to-tit, a stack-heeled Diesel in the honorary Bruce Willis vest that hasn\u2019t been washed since Die Hard, and The Rock in some sort of wired-up gilet that says: \u201cI\u2019m a law-enforcement operative who understands that sometimes rules have to be broken.\u201d (Incidentally, given the height difference between the two, I\u2019m not sure how the eye-to-eye contact is achieved. In Hollywood days of yore, some short actors used to stand on steps to tower over their female co-stars, but Alan Ladd made the Boy on a Dolphin crew dig a hole for Sophia Loren to stand in. Is Vin on a box or is The Rock in a hole? I\u2019d appreciate someone from the set getting in touch to clarify.) Anyway, off-screen the story is surely different. The pair are \u2013 how to put this kindly? \u2013 actors. The powerful suspicion must be that were Vin and The Rock to have a real-life fight in a pub car park, it would just be two men screaming: \u201cNot the face! NOT THE FACE!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/aug/20/the-rock-is-taking-a-money-spinning-disney-ride-dwayne-johnson\">All aboard! The Rock is taking a money-spinning Disney ride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for where we are now \u2026 The Rock has since posted a wrap message in which he explains: \u201cLike with any team \u2013 that\u2019s a family \u2013 there\u2019s gonna be conflict. Family is gonna have differences of opinion and fundamental core beliefs \u2026 And like any family, we get better from it. At the end of the day me and #F8 co-stars all agree on the most important thing: Delivering an incredible movie to the world.\u201d A moving reminder that, ultimately, it is about the art we leave behind.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s not at all clear whether there has been some kind of formal F8 peace process \u2013 perhaps UN ass inspectors were given access to the set to confirm that no viable candy existed. Perhaps some kind of candy-ass decommissioning process took place, supervised by a retired Canadian general. All we know is that Vin Diesel took instant leave of the set after he wrapped with a valedictory address to the movie\u2019s cast and crew, in which he announced: \u201cDaddy\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>Mmm. As indicated from the start, it is an ongoing scandal that Sigmund Freud isn\u2019t given a pre-title credit in this thing. I believe he was still listed as \u201cAssistant to Mr Diesel\u201d in Fast &amp; Furious 7, but in light of this developing story his estate MUST insist that changes for 8.</p>",
  "<p>A new $50,000 (\u00a338,500) literary prize for international authors, intended to recognise the \u201cspirit of Vladimir Nabokov\u201d and described as \u201ca welcome counterbalance to rampant xenophobia and increasingly jingoistic provincialism\u201d, is being launched in the US.</p> <p>The PEN/Nabokov award, supported by the Vladimir Nabokov Literary Foundation, replaces another award with the same name but a different remit.

PEN America said on Thursday that the prize\u2019s judges would be looking for a writer in the field of nonfiction, poetry, drama or fiction whose body of work \u201cevoke[s] to some measure Nabokov\u2019s brilliant versatility and commitment to literature as a search for the deepest truth and the highest pleasure\u201d.</p> <p>The PEN/Nabokov prize <a href=\"https://pen.org/literature/2006-pennabokov-award\">was previously worth $20,000</a>, and took a less international focus, looking for a \u201cliving author whose body of work, either written in or translated into English, is of enduring originality and consummate craftsmanship\u201d. Its winners included Philip Roth, Mario Vargas Llosa and Cynthia Ozick, but it has not been awarded since 2008.</p> <p>The new version of the award is the first PEN America prize to specifically focus on international writers, said PEN America president Andrew Solomon.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when there is too little dialogue between nations, it will draw attention to outstanding global voices that may be unknown to most US readers,\u201d said Solomon. \u201cIt is a welcome counterbalance to rampant xenophobia and increasingly jingoistic provincialism. In renewing our close collaboration with the Vladimir Nabokov Literary Foundation, PEN America pays tribute to the cross-cultural legacy of one of the most revered multinational PEN members, a master of storytelling: Vladimir Nabokov.\u201d</p> <p> Andrew Wylie, the literary agent who heads the Nabokov foundation, said of the prize\u2019s new focus: \u201cWe wanted to differentiate the PEN/Nabokov award from other PEN awards, and in doing so fill a need. The international influence of Nabokov\u2019s writings seemed to justify it.\u201d</p> <p>Five international writers will select the winner of the annual prize, with the award not open to public nominations.

If anyone is at fault, he said, it is the mayor\u2019s office for not coming up with a proper plan for mixed development on the Olympic park. </p> <p>\u201cOn the face of it, it is a good idea to reintroduce these uses for these sites. It it a rail serviced site, has potential water transport [via the river Lea]. There is an environmental challenge, for sure, but if we expel all industry, it defaults to a suburb on steroids with an economy that is only about sports, high-end services and education,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The LLDC, he said, was to blame for the number of new residents, which was a result of \u201callowing so many residential developments\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a103f9c3dc73f0cde283cb45fff90ca2fbf85d76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a103f9c3dc73f0cde283cb45fff90ca2fbf85d76/0_6_320_474/320.jpg\" alt=\"Olympic park planning notice\" width=\"320\" height=\"474\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Olympic park planning application pinned to a lamppost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa O'Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brearley said much industry had been taken out of the area, and London had to get its cement and concrete from somewhere. \u201cI think one of the biggest failures is the institution of the mayor, who was in charge of it, is that they failed to come up with a plan,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Kahn, said he had no powers to get involved in decision making.</p> <p>The plans will be discussed at an LLDC meeting in September, which will be open to the public, and representations can by made to the corporation via <a href=\"http://planningregister.londonlegacy.co.uk/swift/apas/run/WPHAPPDETAIL.DisplayUrl?theApnID=15/00400/FUL&amp;backURL=%3Ca%20href=wphappcriteria.display?paSearchKey=116153%3ESearch%20Criteria%3C/a%3E%20%3E%20%3Ca%20href=%27wphappsearchres.displayResultsURL?ResultID=233952%26StartIndex=1%26SortOrder=APNID%26DispResultsAs=WPHAPPSEARCHRES%26BackURL=%3Ca%20href=wphappcriteria.display?paSearchKey=116153%3ESearch%20Criteria%3C/a%3E%27%3ESearch%20Results%3C/a%3E\">the planning website</a> or by email. </p>",

  "<p>The Drug Enforcement Agency will not remove marijuana from the Schedule I drugs list, its head Chuck Rosenberg has announced, despite a bipartisan group of state legislators calling for it.</p> <p>Rosenberg\u2019s decision was relied heavily on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/10/489509471/dea-rejects-attempt-to-loosen-federal-restrictions-on-marijuana\">a report</a> by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that marijuana has \u201cno currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\u201d and is subject to abuse \u2013 the standard for<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml\">Schedule I drugs</a> as defined by the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm\">US Controlled Substances Act</a></p> <p>The move came with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/science/obama-administration-set-to-remove-barrier-to-marijuana-research.html?_r=1\">one caveat</a>: the DEA will allow universities to apply to grow marijuana for research purposes. Currently, only the University of Mississippi is licensed to do so, which scientists say limits their ability to research the medical uses of marijuana. The FDA and DEA claimed that the lack of scientific data on medical marijuana motivated their decision not to change marijuana\u2019s Schedule I classification.</p> <p>\u201cIf our understanding of the science changes,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article94998397.html\">said Rosenberg</a>, \u201cthat could very well drive a new decision.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Igor Grant, the director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine \u2013 one of the main recipients of federal funds for cannabis research \u2013 hailed the loosening of one restriction on research. \u201cActions that reduce obstacles to conducting serious, rigorous science regarding the use of cannabis to treat diseases is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is significant evidence that cannabis possesses therapeutic value, and it is worthy of continued, even accelerated, investigation and development.\u201d</p> <p>But marijuana advocates say that the federal government is simply ignoring the results of scientific research performed despite the current limits on growing marijuana for the purpose of studying its medical uses.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Obama always said he would let science \u2013 and not ideology \u2013 dictate policy,\u201d Tom Angell, the chairman on Marijuana Majority, said in a statement. \u201cBut in this case, his administration is upholding a failed drug war approach instead of looking at real, existing evidence that marijuana has medical value.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Armentano, the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (Norml), agreed. \u201cWhile this announcement is a significant step toward better facilitating and expanding clinical investigations into cannabis\u2019 therapeutic efficacy,\u201d he said, \u201c<a href=\"http://norml.org/library/recent-research-on-medical-marijuana\">ample scientific evidence already exists</a> to remove cannabis from its Schedule I classification and to acknowledge its relative safety compared to other scheduled substances, like opioids, and unscheduled substances, such as alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Both men called for congressional action to change the federal regulation of cannabis in a way that would allow states to regulate marijuana as they see fit.</p> <p>The ability of states to legalize marijuana \u2013 for medical or recreational use \u2013 without interference from the federal government is a key issue in many states. Federal law has <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2011/06/30/white-house-overrides-2009-mem\">infamously</a> been used to prosecute marijuana growers and dispensaries in states that legalized cannabis, despite <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/memorandum-selected-united-state-attorneys-investigations-and-prosecutions-states\">a 2009 memo</a> from the Obama justice department suggesting that targeting medical marijuana users and suppliers should be a low priority for law enforcement. (The guidance was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/dag-guidance-2011-for-medical-marijuana-use.pdf\">\u201cclarified\u201d in 2011</a> to suggest that significant marijuana businesses even in states where it was legal were not exempt from criminal scrutiny.) In 2013, the justice department <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/obama-administration-will-not-preempt-state-marijuana-laws--for-now/2013/08/29/b725bfd8-10bd-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html\">announced</a> it would not seek to override recreational use laws in Washington and Colorado by prosecuting all producers and sellers, as long as laws were put into place to prevent the movement of marijuana across state lines and keep it out of the hands of children.</p> <p>But as long as marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug, this guidance can be overturned. And because federal banking laws prohibit financial services companies from doing business with companies engaged in illegal activity \u2013 which the sale of marijuana still is at the federal level \u2013 nothing short of a reclassification can provide more safety and stability for marijuana-related businesses in the long term.</p> <p>That was the thinking behind the <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article94998397.html\"> 2011 petition</a> by Washington state governor Christine Gregoire and then Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee, which the DEA announced on Wednesday that it would deny. And, just hours before that<strong> </strong>announcement, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCLS) adopted a resolution that means the organization will, under its bylaws, \u201clobby the Congress, the White House and federal agencies\u201d to change marijuana\u2019s designation under the law. Schedule I is the strictest designation under the federal law. Among those drugs listed in the less restrictive Schedule II are methamphetamine and opium.</p> <p>Oregon state representative Ann Lininger, who introduced the resolution, explained that, since 25 states plus the District of Columbia and Guam have legalized marijuana under some circumstances \u2013 be it for medical or recreational use \u2013 the continuing classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance creates both risks for businesses in states that have deemed it legal and difficulties for states seeking to regulate a growing industry.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 5,000 legal cannabis businesses in the United States\u201d said Lininger, a Democrat. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have reliable access to banking services.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt creates a public safety risk,\u201d she said, because the classification of marijuana means that banks and other federally regulated financial services companies cannot do business with dispensaries. That, in turn, necessitates that all marijuana businesses operate strictly in cash, which often leads to robberies and muggings. Besides, which, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s an inability to track sales for oversight and regulation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it probably affects tax compliance.\u201d</p> <p>The resolution notes that \u201cthe federal Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations impose substantial administrative and operational burdens, compliance risk and regulatory risk that serve as a barrier\u201d to financial services companies wishing to do business with legal marijuana companies, and that the <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2014-G001.pdf\">2014 \u201cclarification\u201d memo</a> issued by the Department of Treasury\u2019s financial crimes enforcement network \u201cis inadequate to create a regulatory environment as it does not change applicable federal laws, imposes significant compliance burdens and is subject to change at any time\u201d \u2013 including with a new administration in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cStates should have to ability to chart their own way forward on cannabis regulation, outside of federal oversight,\u201d Lininger said, calling it a states\u2019 rights issue that had led many legislators of a more conservative bent on marijuana policy to support the resolution. </p> <p>The National Conference of State Legislatures, which is made up of member state legislatures and legislator participants, serves as both a research and advocacy organization for the interests of state legislatures, as determined by a bipartisan plurality of participants. The resolution process determines the organization\u2019s priorities in <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/aboutus.aspx\">its efforts </a>\u201cto fight unwarranted federal preemption of state laws, unfunded mandates and federal legislation that threatens state authority and autonomy\u201d.</p>",
  "<h2>Protecting the environment </h2> <p>In the village of Mapubi, in the forests of south-west Cameroon, locals have watched as large swaths of their land have been destroyed. </p> <p>Mapubi\u2019s proximity to coastal ports and the increased demand for timber due to population growth in the cities mean the pressure on forests in the area is believed to be at its highest since the colonial period.</p> <p>A similar plight affects many who live in the forests of the Congo basin, whose lands have been depleted by illegal logging, mining, industrial plantations and even by strict conservation activities, which often resulted in large-scale evictions of people from the environments they had populated for generations.</p> <p>In many cases, the problem lies in the fact that these forest lands are largely unmapped, so loggers and farmers can claim they were unoccupied. But another problem lies with reporting \u2013 people who witness illegal activities in the forests might live hundreds of miles from the nearest police station, or even telephone.</p> <p>To address this, the <a href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\">Rainforest Foundation UK</a> is trialling an initiative that equips local communities to report illegal activities in their own forests in real time, using satellite phones and specially designed mapping software.</p> <p>ForestLink, which has funding from the Department for International Development, allows local people who witness illegal behaviour in the forest to report it in a few clicks of a button. The reports, which are geo-tagged, are sent to a centralised database and local partner organisations can then go out and confirm the incident.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/22/us-eu-conservation-funds-failing-to-protect-trees-people-rainforest-foundation-report\">US and EU conservation funds failing to protect trees or people, claims report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The speed of reporting is key, says Rodrigue Ngonzo, from For\u00eats et D\u00e9veloppement Rural (<a href=\"http://www.forest4dev.org/\">Foder</a>) in Cameroon. An oft-cited reason for inaction by authorities is \u201cthe very long time between the observation of illegal activities, verification and receipt of an external independent observation report\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Simon Counsell, the executive director of Rainforest Foundation UK, says the technology could revolutionise forest protection strategies.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s been a very top-down approach. With this new model it\u2019s very much about empowering people from the grassroots upwards, to allow local people to play a much more active role in protecting their forests.\u201d</p> <p>So far the programme has been trialled in Cameroon, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"789236204b1ead310531d734804e6a1080211817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/789236204b1ead310531d734804e6a1080211817/0_239_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue outside a polling station in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to vote in Burkina Faso\u2019s general election.

Its medieval outer walls, which have a circumference of 5km (making them among the longest in Europe), were built to protect salt production at a time when salt, it is often claimed, was more valuable than gold. The production of salt from evaporating sea water in shallow pools remained unchanged for thousands of years. Walking round the walls involved some steep inclines and effort but rewarded us with spectacular views over the unspoilt town and salt pans.

  "<p>Media mogul turned self-help guru Arianna Huffington is to leave the Huffington Post to launch a health-focused startup called Thrive Global to tackle stress and burnout.</p> <p>Eleven years after Huffington co-founded the site that bears her name, and has changed the face of journalism, the site\u2019s editor-in-chief and president, told staff on Thursday that she would be giving up her role at the media company after closing a funding round for Thrive late last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/01/arianna-huffington-uber-directors-huffington-post\">Arianna Huffington: from bedroom to boardroom with the Uber woman | Observer profile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said in a statement: \u201cWhen I decided to create Thrive Global, I thought it would be possible to build a startup and continue as editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post. Today, it\u2019s clear that was an illusion. </p> <p>\u201cAs Thrive Global moved from an idea to a reality, with investors, staff, and offices, it became clear to me that I simply couldn\u2019t do justice to both companies.\u201d</p> <p>In a memo to staff, Huffington said she had \u201cbecome more and more passionate \u2013 okay, obsessed \u2013 with burnout and stress and how we can reduce their impact on our lives\u201d.</p> <p>Her departure comes just over a decade after she founded the Huffington Post with Kenneth Lerer, Jonah Peretti and Andrew Breitbart, who would also go on to be among the most influential media figures of their generation. Peretti founded BuzzFeed and Lerer is its chairman, while Breitbart went on to create the rightwing news site that is named after him.</p> <p>Kate Palmer, editorial director of lifestyle for the Huffington Post, told the Guardian the staff would be hearing about succession plans in an 11am meeting on Thursday. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a bittersweet day, but HuffPo is poised to be an incredible leader in this space, and we\u2019re not gonna miss a beat,\u201d Palmer said.</p> <p>In 2011 Huffington Post was bought for $315m (\u00a3243m) by AOL, which in turn was bought for $4.4bn in 2014 by US mobile operator Verizon. Verizon recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/25/yahoo-to-sell-core-web-business-to-verizon\">added Yahoo</a> to its portfolio, buying the ailing internet giant for $4.83bn (\u00a33.62bn) in July.<br></p> <p>Traffic to HuffPo\u2019s sites has dropped precipitously this year: according to data from web analytics firm comScore, global audience fell 23% from June 2015 to June 2016.</p> <p>Born Ariadn\u0113-Anna Stasinopo\u00falou in Athens in 1950, Huffington rose to prominence in the 1990s as a conservative Republican presence on television, on the radio and in her now ex-husband Michael Huffington\u2019s bid for one of California\u2019s Senate seats in 1994. She appeared in Comedy Central\u2019s coverage of the 1996 US elections as \u201cthe beautiful but evil Arianna Huffington\u201d alongside \u201cthe talented but smug Al Franken\u201d in a segment called Strange Bedfellows. Franken is now a Democratic US senator.</p> <p>But for her namesake enterprise Huffington made a Damascene conversion. The site was tactically liberal from the get-go and originally envisioned as a competitor to conservative links page The Drudge Report. The Huffington Post pioneered a brand of journalism that has come to typify much of the digital news world \u2013 often aggregated from work from other outlets, sometimes without attribution or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/28/cartoonist-the-oatmeal-trolls-huffpo-over-images-published-sans-permission\">permission</a>, with the majority of its original material produced by unpaid contributors, famous or otherwise.<br></p> <p>In a June 2012 piece in the Columbia Journalism Review, Columbia journalism school professor Michael Shapiro <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/six_degrees_of_aggregation.php\">characterized the site\u2019s success</a> as a combination of rapid popularity, low overhead and the level of access afforded to Huffington by her years in politics and on television. The site pitched famous people a popular platform from which they could opine, which was better than money; to its unpaid low-level staffers, it dangled the prestige of appearing in print next to the famous ones.</p> <p>\u201c[I]t was up to Huffington to find the bloggers,\u201d Shapiro wrote. \u201cShe wanted Arthur Schlesinger; he was a friend. So was Larry David. And John Cusack. And Harry Shearer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen somebody writes something for us, we know it\u2019s real, we know they want to write it,\u201d HuffPo UK editor-in-chief Steve Hull told Radio 4 earlier this year, by way of defending the company\u2019s practice of refusing to pay many of its writers. \u201cIt\u2019s not been forced or paid for. I think that\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d</p> <p>After Huffington\u2019s departure announcement, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong said the company remained committed to the Huffington Post, and looked forward to partnering with Thrive. </p> <p>He said: \u201cArianna is a visionary who built the Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform. Today, The Huffington Post is a firmly established and celebrated news source and AOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered.\u201d</p> <p>Though she stayed on as the site\u2019s editor-in-chief and president following Huffington Post\u2019s changes of ownership, Huffington has in recent years spent increasing amounts of time promoting healthy living concepts such as mindfulness and the benefits of getting enough sleep. In her memo to staff she joked she would remain<strong> </strong>HuffPo\u2019s \u201cunofficial Sleep Ombudsman\u201d.</p> <p>Thrive, which shares a name with a book published by Huffington in 2014, promises to offer a range of services and support using \u201cthe latest scientific findings from experts in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, productivity, sports and sleep\u201d.<br></p> <p>The company is backed by a range of venture capital firms and angel investors led by Lerer\u2019s Lerer Hippeau Ventures, and has been running a pilot programme with Accenture. </p> <p>Huffington, who will serve as its chief executive, added: \u201cAs Thrive Global moved from an idea to a reality, with investors, staff, and offices, it became clear to me that I simply couldn\u2019t do justice to both companies ... Running both companies would have involved working around the clock, which would be a betrayal of the very principles of Thrive I\u2019ve been writing and speaking about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI step down as editor-in-chief filled with gratitude for our amazing HuffPost team and for what we\u2019ve built together, and for Tim Armstrong who had the vision to buy HuffPost five years ago and to support from day one our global expansion. The journey of the last 11 years has exceeded my wildest expectations. I\u2019m proud of all we\u2019ve accomplished and very confident about HuffPost\u2019s future with the strongest leadership team we\u2019ve ever had and the full support of AOL and Verizon.\u201d</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>66</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Girton College, Cambridge</p> <p><strong>Career 1973</strong> author, The Female Woman<strong> 1996</strong> writer, Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher (Emmy nomination_ <strong>2003 </strong>activist, The Detroit Project <strong>2005</strong> founder, The Huffington Post <strong>2016</strong> founder, Thrive Global</p>",

As a result, it is crucial that DfID has central systems in place for staff to classify, rate, escalate and monitor these risks with confidence, said Dr Alison Evans, Icai\u2019s chief commissioner and the report\u2019s author.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got so many different ways that food aid, for example, can end up in the wrong hands,\u201d said Evans. \u201cYou have to have more than one strategy for working out where that asset ends up.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike most other donors, DfID decentralises its fiduciary risk management to country offices, where the staff responsible for programmes are known as \u201csenior responsible owners\u201d. Evans said this focuses attention on the changing risk environment, encouraging personnel to implement management systems autonomously and work with local partners to control fiduciary risk more effectively.</p> <p>But there is a downside. Because DfID lacks a clear, overarching risk-management system, and country offices categorise and rate risks themselves, there is a huge variation in how risks are defined and assessed across the department\u2019s work in conflict areas. This, in turn, can affect multilateral or corporate partners.<br></p> <p>Icai\u2019s report, published on Tuesday, assessed performance in five conflict-affected countries \u2013 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 using interviews with DfID staff and implementing partners, and country strategy reviews. DfID was given a \u201cgreen-amber\u201d rating, indicating that its fiduciary risk management in conflict-affected states, though mostly satisfactory, required urgent attention in some areas.<br></p> <p>A number of senior staff expressed concern about the frequency with which decision-making was driven by \u201creputational considerations\u201d rather than fiduciary risk itself, said Evans.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you manage that political tension? We found that to be a very live discussion, particularly in environments where DfID is trying to work with local partners, or where DfID is working in unfamiliar territory, of which Syria is a good example,\u201d she said. Staff can be torn between working with a smaller, local partner (which can mean a higher fiduciary risk) or a larger (potentially lower risk) private sector partner. Fearful of the \u201creputational risk of a possible loss or diversion of aid funds\u201d, the larger partner is often chosen, despite a <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/projects/2696-localising-aid-budget-support-southern-actors\">2013 report by the Overseas Development Institute showing that local aid frequently delivers equal, or greater, development returns</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not a long track record for this,\u201d added Evans. \u201cHow far DfID goes in working with these organisations, and how quickly, is a matter of balancing both fiduciary and reputational risk \u2026 [But] there is a certain concern that DfID is putting a lot of its eggs in particular baskets with certain contractors.\u201d This narrowed the pool of potential suppliers and possibly reduced value for money, said Evans.</p> <p>DfID\u2019s dependence on taxpayers\u2019 money meant it was up to staff to protect and spend that money as effectively as possible, said a DfID spokesman, making the department likely to \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d in assessing risks. He added: \u201cThere are of course challenges to providing life-saving aid in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world, including disasters and war zones, which is precisely why we have such a rigorous system of checks and measures in place.\u201d </p> <p>The report found DfID to be at its most effective when using technological innovations to manage fiduciary risk, particularly in countries where access is limited. In Somalia, where the department has only a limited presence in the capital, Mogadishu, and is instead required to work primarily out of the Nairobi office, using third parties to deliver assets, tracking technology has been deployed to follow money and assets in real time. A similar programme, tracking pharmaceuticals, was used in DRC.</p> <p>\u201cThat seemed to show to us how [DfID\u2019s] decentralised system really plays up to its strengths,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWe feel DfID could do a better job spreading this experience across its portfolio and learning how it might be applied in other contexts.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Imagine if it would have more of an impact for Palestine to be recognised as a sovereign country by Google than by the UN.

Google has never actually labeled the country, which isn\u2019t officially recognised by the US or much of the west. The swiftness of the backlash, though, is not just about the wish for justice on behalf of an occupied people, but about the belief \u2013 now punctured \u2013 that our technology is neutral, that it presents an unbiased, infallible version of the world.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Prior to the sailing expeditions that began with the Renaissance, humanity had no map of the world. In 1891 a German geographer called Albrecht Penck proposed and set out to lead an International World Map project, by which all maps would be designed based on a single international standard. According to Jerry Brotton\u2019s book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-World-Twelve-Maps/dp/0141034939\">A History of the World in Twelve Maps</a>, Penck bemoaned a lack of consistency among scales and even styles of extant maps, and dreamed of collaborating with the cartographic agencies of the world to create a great atlas of 2,500 maps, all where one inch would equal 15.78 miles, or one centimetre per kilometre.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Penck\u2019s standardised world atlas would never be finished. Although the UNplanned to carry it on in the 20th century, commitment waned during world war two. Despite the sunk cost, relatively significant in its time, only a few hundred maps <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/millionthmap.htm\">were created</a>. Still, it remains the closest humanity has ever come to a global mapmaking standard. Despite the common notion of maps as universal and inarguable, they remain a riot of inconsistent measures, evolving coastlines, and constantly shifting ideas about nations and their sovereignty.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Not even Google can do what Penck could not: create a vision of the globe that is true for all who see it. But in fact it has tried \u2013 one thing many of us are learning for the first time off the back of the Palestine controversy is that Google Maps sometimes shows disputed borders differently depending on where the user is searching from. An ongoing project called Disputed Territories <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://opennews.kzhu.io/map-disputes/?_ga=1.48243875.420098949.1397702661\">has documented this</a>: for example, it reports, America and much of the west views Crimea in the Ukraine as a site of Russian occupation, and it appears on the map as such. However, to map users in Russia, the boundary is solid, an official annexation.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While it might seem imperialistic for Google to decide how the US should see the rest of the world, perhaps it would be equally troubling to see the company wade into global verdicts on the righteousness of every international occupation. That it allows its sketch of the geopolitical climate to reflect the perspective of who is viewing it, rather than impose the prevailing popular opinion in the west, may not be neutral or unbiased, but it is probably the most fair.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Where we wade into difficulty is the lack of transparency that average users have about how these services work. We frequently assume technology has no preference, but it often does, even something such as hiring by algorithm <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/algorithm-racist-human-employers-work\">doesn\u2019t necessarily remove human discrimination,</a> as many believe.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><br></p> <p>During high school, our history and social studies teachers had us bring in multiple newspaper clippings of the same news story from both liberal and conservative outlets, and taught us to identify bias in headlines, word choices and chosen angles. It was impressed on us how important it was we know that \u201cthe news\u201d was not a single trustworthy monolith, and that we should learn to compare different sources and perspectives as critical readers in order to understand the world. We need similar education \u2013 for adults as well as young people on the opacity and capriciousness of privately owned technology platforms, and how the things we assume to be standardised utilities are hugely influenced by biases in the data used to build them.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Until researching this article I didn\u2019t know that there had never been a single, standardised world map project but of course it makes sense that the project fell apart during the second world war. And many people don\u2019t know that there is more than one standard Google Maps (or Apple Maps, which doesn\u2019t show Palestine either, or Microsoft\u2019s Bing Maps, which does) depending on where in the world you are. Or that there are different search results for different people, and that those search results can be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/08/does-google-unprofessional-hair-results-prove-algorithms-racist-\">biased, even discriminatory</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Our many digital maps must account for multiple views of the world \u2013 but their existence also must inform us that ours is only one among them. An expanded mapping utility that encouraged users to view the world from many different perspectives, complete with current facts, could be a marvellous educational tool.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But no matter what, we need far more transparency from tech companies about the way biases affect what we see when we use their services - and about how the reliable neutrality of a trusted machine is as impossible as Penck\u2019s dream of an international world map.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

There are further flashpoints around the relative lack of cycle parking (\u201cTourists love taking photos of bikes chained to canal bridges but the council hates it,\u201d says Anna) and the use of bike lanes by scooters, which are heavier, wider and faster than bicycles. Moves to ban scooters from cycle paths nationally are currently going through parliament in the Hague \u2013 but just as that issue nears a possible conclusion, the introduction of electric bikes which can reach speeds of 30mph is threatening to create new problems.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many parents think cycling is dangerous, and when those kids hit 16 they get scooters, not bicycles</p> <footer> <cite>Maud de Vries</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Smoothing out these conflicts by improving communication between cycling groups, the council, city planners and other residents is where the new bicycle mayor comes in.

At the moment, many people in Amsterdam think \u2018because we ride a bike we own the roads\u2019. We like to think we go with the flow, but sometimes we are actually quite rude.

  "<p>The US\u2019s slow recovery from the 2008 recession is due to Republican policies on the local, state and federal level, according to a new study published by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI). </p> <p>The new report comes as the slow pace of recovery has emerged as a key battleground between Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who will set out her economic policy on Thursday.</p> <p>The EPI report blames the lackluster pace of recovery on Republican-led budget cuts in 2011 following the row over the US debt ceiling, the unwillingness of local officials to spend money when Republicans in Congress were advocating cuts in spending, and the refusal to expand Medicaid in 19 states.</p> <p>The report comes as the Republican party once again calls for the reining in of government spending and reductions in the deficit. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the degree of damage inflicted by the Great Recession and the restricted ability of monetary policy to aid recovery, historically expansionary fiscal policy was required to return the US economy to full health,\u201d writes Josh Bivens, research and policy director at EPI. </p> <p>\u201cBut this government spending not only failed to rise fast enough to spur a rapid recovery, it outright contracted, and this policy choice fully explains why the economy is only partially recovered from the Great Recession a full seven years after its official end.\u201d</p> <p>This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months.</p> <p>The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit \u2013 something Republicans in Congress are opposed to \u2013 it would also have led to \u201cseveral years of full employment\u201d and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates. </p> <p>There are few ways the government can help speed up economic recovery after a recession. One way is to cut interest rates to help increase borrowing, which should lead to increased spending. Similarly, to increase spending by consumers, the US government would typically cut taxes, essentially putting more money in people\u2019s pockets.</p> <p>The ability of the US government has been slightly limited this time around \u2013 especially when it comes to cutting the federal interest rates, which have been historically low.</p> <h2>Interest rates<br></h2> <p>At the time of the 1980s recession the federal fund interest rate was at 9.3%, whereas in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.18%.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that there was much more room to move down the federal funds rates following the 1982 trough compared to the 2009 trough,\u201d Bivens wrote.</p> <p>Low interest rates combined with the potential of another recession are a concern for the US Federal Reserve. Fed chair Janet Yellen had previously said that the central bank has few tools to deal with another recession if it were to occur. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"Interest rates chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">Interest rates chart</a> </figure>  <p>Bivens argues that the federal government should have increased aid to state and local governments following the recession and that the Obama administration should have been more outspoken about its opposition to the fiscal austerity pushed by Republicans. </p> <p>The Obama administration \u201ccould have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,\u201d Bivens wrote. \u201cHad the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q3zq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2640383\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump outlines his economic plan \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a8d83ee4b0f5d064841920\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/08/160808economy_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400063&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-outlines-economic-plan-video\">Donald Trump outlines his economic plan</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><br>The EPI report was published hours before Clinton was scheduled to deliver her speech on the economy in Warren, Michigan.

Inadvertently, it has also created a huge obstacle to animals freely moving across the border in a wildlife rich corner of Europe.</p> <p>But even though the human migration crisis has dramatically eased, Slovenia\u2019s interior ministry is seeking a change in the law to prevent environmental factors from slowing the barrier\u2019s extension.</p> <p> A government spokesperson said that while refugee numbers were falling, \u201cthere are still more than 57,000 migrants in Greece. The situation in Turkey remains very uncertain after the military coup. There is a political crisis in Macedonia, and an increasing number of migrants are gathering in Serbia, which lacks sufficient accommodation capacities. Also, the number of people travelling the migrant route across the Mediterranean to Italy has increased again.\u201d</p> <p>While the fence is supposed to be a temporary measure, fears that the crisis could be prolonged were heightened when the government <a href=\"http://svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/56b907d375320/razkrivami-vlada-tajno-kopici-nove-zaloge-rezilne-zice\">signalled its intent</a> to fence its entire 670km border with Croatia in December. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/migrant_fence_construction/giv-31075nIzY9ZYGDh2C/\" data-alt=\"Border fence location\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/migrant_fence_construction/giv-31075nIzY9ZYGDh2C/\">Border fence location</a> </figure>  <p> Researchers from the University of Ljubljana report of several tonnes of razor wire being stockpiled in the open at military barracks near the Croatian border, ready to be unfurled at short notice. </p> <p>Its deployment could be fast-tracked by an amendment to the state border control law that is currently being debated.

Stretches of the barrier are already covered by vegetation or seasonally submerged by the 292 km-long Kolpa river, which straddles the two countries\u2019 border.</p> <p> Many of the deer are thought to have strayed into the fence while foraging. Once snagged, they propel themselves further into the concertina wire in a bid to escape, only tangling themselves further before eventually dying from blood loss, or exhaustion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19dad072edfb341f038bd1e5e375608eaf250d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19dad072edfb341f038bd1e5e375608eaf250d34/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dead deer on a campsite in Radenci in Slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dead deer snagged on the fence in Radenci in Slovenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Zrinka Domazetovi\u0107, head of biodiversity in Croatia\u2019s environment ministry, said that: \u201cwhen an animal is tangled in wire, you see it right away.

That results in a disruptive competition between juvenile bears which struggle to take their place, Reljic says.</p> <p>But hunters\u2019 associations in both countries may play an important role in conserving the bear populations they depend upon, according to regional academics. As well as monitoring the animals, many hunters detain poachers, build gates in the border fence and even lure animals back from the razor wire with food dispersals.</p> <p>This is vital work because, as Domazetovi\u0107 puts it, \u201cbears and wolves don\u2019t understand political borders\u201d.

Igor Barbara, secretary of the Croatian hunting lodge, said that seven red deer had been killed in the 10km stretch of fence bordering his hunting ground alone. He had found others with razor lacerations, floating dead in the river.</p> <p> Lindi\u0107 cited another 10 deer killed on his small section of the barrier. He also claimed to have seen several retreats by animals which had become enmeshed in razor snarls. A bear had also been entangled before escaping, he said. </p> <p> \u201cI think that about 100 animals have died from entanglement on the fence,\u201d Lindi\u0107 told the Guardian.</p>",

  "<p>During a recent trip spent travelling across Nigeria, a banker friend of mine advised me to \u201ckeep things positive\u201d if I ever shared my observations in \u201cwestern media\u201d.

Over the years, I\u2019ve heard similar sentiments expressed by numerous middle- and upper-class Nigerians.</p> <p>When it comes to western media coverage of Africa, the continent\u2019s privileged classes are usually more concerned with the perceptions created than with the realities depicted. They find images of suffering Africans annoying because these \u201cperpetuate negative stereotypes\u201d.

The latter welcome anybody willing to listen to their stories. But the privileged classes resent seeing Africa\u2019s widespread poverty on display. Instead, they demand \u201cbalanced media coverage\u201d. That sounds perfectly reasonable, but what exactly do they mean?</p> <p>For instance, <a href=\"http://www.ng.undp.org/content/nigeria/en/home/library/poverty/national-human-development-report-2016.html\" title=\"\">62.6% of Nigerians currently live in poverty</a>, compared to <a href=\"http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pdfuploads/Nigeria%20Poverty%20Profile%202010.pdf\" title=\"\">27.2% in 1980</a>.

What kind of progress sees the percentage of people living in poverty more than double since 1980? Of course, inconvenient statistics can always be brushed aside.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jul/14/nigeria-on-the-brink-of-famine-children-are-dying-from-starvation-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4zqy5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2617682\"            data-video-name=\"Nigeria on the brink of famine: 'Children are dying from starvation' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57874acfe4b08239dbab73bd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/14/160714NigeriaFamine_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/14/160714NigeriaFamine.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/14/160714NigeriaFamine_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/14/160714NigeriaFamine_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/14/160714NigeriaFamine_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jul/14/nigeria-on-the-brink-of-famine-children-are-dying-from-starvation-video\">Nigeria on the brink of famine: \u2018Children are dying from starvation\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2014 the World Bank reported that Nigeria had the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/04/10/ending-poverty-requires-more-than-growth-says-wbg\" title=\"\">third highest number of poor people in the world</a>.

It is the privileged classes who come into contact with foreigners in international settings. They are the ones who attend global conferences, send their children to western universities and conduct business abroad. They understandably want to be treated as equals by those they encounter in such settings. No one likes being patronised. So they get peeved when they see news stories on starving children or violence in Africa because they know this helps shape the manner in which their countries and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 they themselves will be perceived abroad.</p> <p>Then there is the irritation stemming from the knowledge that the constant reports about violence, famine or dysfunctional governments, however well-intentioned, help nurture the racist-colonialist narrative that Africans are generally incapable of efficient self-rule. This is at once extremely frustrating and worrisome, especially for well-educated Africans who, as individuals, feel no less capable than their European or Asian counterparts. Yet the tragic news stories just never seem to end.</p> <p>I\u2019ve experienced such feelings, and they are not easy to deal with. They force you to grapple with some uncomfortable questions to which there are no easy answers. For instance, why is it that half a century after independence, one is hard put to name an indisputable African success story (save perhaps tiny, 2-million strong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/botswana\" title=\"\">Botswana</a>)? Such disturbing realities can easily make one overly defensive in reactions to outside portrayals of Africa. The defensive-aggressive posture is a coping mechanism.

  "<p>It\u2019s a Monday afternoon, and Oliver Lee and James Carter, the duo otherwise known as <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/snakehips-1\">Snakehips</a>, are currently in the throes of a worldwide tour. First they were in front of 10,000 fans at Australia\u2019s Splendour in the Grass festival; now they\u2019re in the American midwest. \u201cWe just did Lollapalooza in Chicago and are headed to Canada in a bit,\u201d says Lee, with a pep in his voice despite the punishing schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s been sick.\u201d</p> <p>The duo is zig-zagging from city to city in order to capitalize on a variety of singles which have catapulted them from a simple studio set-up in Carter\u2019s kitchen in Camden, London, to the heights of the global charts. Their most recent effort, the synth-soaked Cruel featuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/zayn-malik\">Zayn Malik</a>, became a viral smash the instant it was released last month, collecting 1m streams within 48 hours of its release and closing in on 10m in the weeks since. (The music video, below, was released on Tuesday.) </p> <p>\u201cCruel was actually an idea we started,\u201d explains Lee. \u201cWe write a lot with a songwriter named <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CassLowe?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Cass Lowe </a>and we originally worked on Cruel with him in London.

It\u2019s funny \u2013 I still don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019d be like to work in the studio with Zayn because it all happened so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>For Lee and Carter, the success of Cruel is another mainstream smash after years of working in relative obscurity. The two first met by chance in Hong Kong at a bar and struck up a conversation. \u201cIt was super random,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI can\u2019t remember how we even started talking. It turned out James lived near me in London and when we left we were on the same plane together by pure coincidence. Once we got back, we decided to start making beats together.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnRqc73QyfI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FnRqc73QyfI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The duo first found success posting remixes online. \u201cOur first one to ever go crazy on the internet was a remix for this band called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnRqc73QyfI\">Wild Belle [It\u2019s Too Late</a>]. After that, we did a remix of a Weeknd track [Wanderlust], and that was even more popular. It just grew from there,\u201d Lee says. It wasn\u2019t until last October when the duo released an original track called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3mrYxPLSH4\">All My Friends</a>, an anti-party song featuring Tinashe and Chance the Rapper, that wound up pushing them from online remixers confined to the internet to a mainstream act to be reckoned with.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect All My Friends to get such a great reception at all, because it still feels like a weird song,\u201d Lee explains of the track that catapulted them into the top 10 in multiple countries and currently boasts 30m views on YouTube for its music video. \u201cIt was really bizarre to watch it grow and was a really big step for us.\u201d</p> <p>All My Friends was an improbable success, especially considering the song\u2019s dark subject matter. While dubiously sounding like a party song, the track is actually about a night out gone awry. However, Lee is quick to point out: \u201cThe song isn\u2019t based on a particular experience, but years of them. I feel like we\u2019ve all been there, when you have a super-wack night out.\u201d Upon concocting All My Friends, the duo sent it blind to Tinashe and Chance the Rapper, two of the hottest names in music. \u201cWe envisioned them on it when we made the song, even though it was completely unrealistic. They signed on after hearing an early cut and it wound up becoming a dream situation.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3mrYxPLSH4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I3mrYxPLSH4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lee and Carter\u2019s dreams will continue to materialize this coming fall when they headline a show at Koko, a short walk from Carter\u2019s apartment. There, they\u2019re currently working on their debut album which promises to be chock full of guest stars. \u201cWe\u2019re still working out of James\u2019 kitchen,\u201d says Lee, forgoing the set-up of a major studio. \u201cAll you really need are speakers and a computer. You don\u2019t need much more these days. It\u2019s a super-relaxed vibe.\u201d</p> <p>Of course that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s jarring when the duo spins their kitchen-made tracks for thousands of screaming fans. \u201cIt definitely helps inspire you,\u201d explains Lee, still getting ready to depart the Windy City and hop the US border into Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s wicked seeing people singing along to your tune and seeing them go crazy for it.

  "<p>For people living with HIV, antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been a life-saver. ART stops HIV from making copies of itself and prevents HIV from attacking the body\u2019s immune system.</p> <p>At the end of 2015, <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet\">17 million people were taking ART around the world</a> and Aids-related deaths had fallen by 45% since the peak in 2005.</p> <p>But those who don\u2019t stick to the ART regimen set out by their doctor or health worker might become resistant to the drugs. Resistance occurs when ART regimens are not taken as prescribed, which allows HIV to make copies of itself and increases the risk that the virus will mutate and produce drug-resistant HIV. A person who is on a drug<strong> </strong>such as Efavirenz <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15127346\">can develop resistance after as little as a two-day interruption of treatment</a>.</p> <p>Globally, HIV drug resistance is on the rise. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that up to 2010, HIV drug resistance levels remained at 7% in developing countries. However, recently, some countries have reported levels at or above 10% among those starting ART, and up to <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/news/warning-hiv-drug-resistance/en/\">40% among people restarting ART</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The time to act is now. If we don\u2019t, we may find ourselves with a new global pandemic of drug-resistant HIV.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the beginning of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, there was fear among the international community that people living with HIV in resource-limited settings would not be able to adhere to their treatment due to a lack of education and resources. Would they be able to keep time well enough to take their ART at the same time every day?</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16896111\">studies have demonstrated</a> that people in sub-Saharan Africa may be better than people in the west at taking their ART as prescribed. The issue in developing countries is that people lack the resources to get to a clinic and pick up their pills. I\u2019ve worked in Namibia since 2009, and whenever I visit ART clinics, there are long queues stretching out the door. People often have to wait all day and many can\u2019t afford to take this time off work every month.</p> <p>The stigma associated with being seen waiting in a queue to pick up medication is also a factor in people not adhering to their treatment plans. To avoid this, some people on ARTs travel to a clinic many kilometres away from their town, so they can receive treatment without anyone recognising them. And if you took a whole day off work, borrowed money for the transport and stood in a queue all day, only to learn that the clinic had run out of your pills, what would you do?</p> <h2>ARTs and HIV drug resistance</h2> <p>As the use of ART increases, so does the risk of HIV drug resistance. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/news/warning-hiv-drug-resistance/en/\">global HIV drug resistance is on the rise</a>, both among those already on ART and those just starting on it.<br></p> <p>What could happen if levels of drug resistance reached critical levels? Their ART regimens would no longer be able to stop the HIV in their bodies from making copies of itself and they would then have to be switched to second-line regimens, if available. </p> <p>But second-line regimens are more expensive. For countries already struggling to provide ART to those who need it, this would is likely to mean that fewer people could be started on ART. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/03/aids-hiv-antiretroviral-drugs-treatment-prevention\">Can WHO\u2019s new \u2018test and treat\u2019 HIV policy reach those who need it most?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second-line regimens may also have more negative side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, weakness or changes in the shape or location of body fat. These plans can also be more challenging because of the large number of pills that need to be taken. As a clinician, I\u2019ve seen patients who\u2019ve reached the point where they have to take more than 10 pills a day. </p> <p>Drug resistance has been a problem since the beginning of the HIV epidemic. In the west the problem was usually limited to individual patients. But in resource-limited settings, if a high percentage of the population develops drug resistance we could see large increases in Aids-related deaths and higher healthcare costs. </p> <p>We must act now to help people adhere to their treatment plans, before it\u2019s too late. Globally, there has been a huge focus on getting more people on treatment, but the quality of how it\u2019s delivered has fallen by the wayside. </p> <p>Drug resistance will rise when ART is not delivered in a well thought-out way.

There are just two surviving species today, one found on Cuba and the other, more well known, on Hispaniola. But these two species alone are so distinct from any other mammal that they represent an entire biological family: Solenodontidae. To put that in perspective every single species of mice and rat \u2013 from the African pygmy mouse to the Northern Luzon giant cloud rat \u2013 also represent a single family of 700-plus species. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"159fde3ec1c5c39913f139f44e7f2e4a8e16d9f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/159fde3ec1c5c39913f139f44e7f2e4a8e16d9f5/63_130_1955_1172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Hispaniolan solenodon is caught on camera trap leaving its burrow at night in the Dominican Republic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Hispaniolan solenodon is caught on camera trap leaving its burrow at night in the Dominican Republic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grupo Jaragua</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solenodons sport a number of weird attributes. They can squeeze venomous saliva out of their incisors. They have evolved a ball and socket joint in their snout to give it extra-special maneuverability. They likely use echolocation to locate prey. Their eyes are tiny, their claws are in need of a trim, and they waddle when they walk as if they\u2019d spent too much time at the pub. </p> <p>Natural History Museum geneticist, Selina Brace, who recently co-authored a paper on the Hispaniolan solenodon with Turvey, called solenodons a \u201cfabulously quirky creature\u201d and said she was \u201cinstantly hooked\u201d after seeing a picture of this oddity. </p> <p>Nocturnal mammals, solenodons live in burrows and come out at night to eat grubs and insects, probably just as they did 78 million years ago, only now they don\u2019t have to worry about being stepped on by a sauropod or waking a sleep-deprived tyrannosaur. Instead, these species must worry about having their forests chopped down by people or being eaten by a dog or a mongoose. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I cannot explain what I felt the first time I touched it.</p> <footer> <cite>Norvis Henandez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Currently the Hispaniola solenodon is considered endangered by the IUCN Red List \u2013 though two of its subspecies may be close to extinction. The Cuban solenodon is in an even more precarious position. Also considered endangered, the species has been feared extinct more than once. The ZSL\u2019s <a href=\"http://edgeofexistence.org/index.php\">EDGE Programme</a>, which categorizes animals based on their threatened status and evolutionary distinctness, lists the pair of solenodons as number seven in the <a href=\"http://edgeofexistence.org/mammals/top_100.php\">top 100 mammals</a>. <br></p> <p>Turvey said the fact that the solenodon survived so many upheavals \u201cmakes it even more tragic that these \u2018living fossil\u2019 survivors are now in danger of extinction due to human activities.\u201d</p> <h2>Cuba\u2019s star</h2> <p>Norvis Hernandez, a Cuban biologist, is one of the few people on planet Earth who has seen a living, wild Cuban solenodon. Smaller than its Hispaniola cousin, the Cuban solenodon is easily distinguished by its black-and-white hair. </p> <p>\u201cThis experience of watching this ancient species [was] wonderful, it was for a short time because I do not like to feel that this species[was] stressed,\u201d said Hernandez who caught a female solenodon in Alejandro Humboldt National Park for brief study before releasing it again. \u201cI cannot explain what I felt the first time I touched it.\u201d</p> <p>It took Hernandez and her colleagues 12 days of searching in the field to finally catch a Cuban solenodon, known locally as the almiqui. <br></p> <p>She said that the Cuban solenodon\u2019s keen senses of smell and hearing make it almost impossible to capture with conventional methods. The species not only avoids human contact but, according to Hernandez, is never tricked by the mechanical traps scientists commonly use to catch small mammals. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/oct/20/the-four-horsemen-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction\">How humans are driving the sixth mass extinction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First described in 1861, scientist lost track of the Cuban solenodon near the end of the 19th Century. No one had saw it for almost a hundred years \u2013 and many assumed it was extinct \u2013 until researchers spotted a few in the mid-1970s. And then no one saw it again until 2003. <br></p> <p>Today, scientists have confirmed there is a small population hanging on in Alejandro Humboldt National Park. But no one knows how many or if its range extends beyond the park\u2019s borders. <br></p> <p>Hernandez, whose current work is funded through the <a href=\"http://www.speciesconservation.org/\">Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Foundation</a>, said research of this endangered species has suffered due to a lack of money, including for non-invasive observation tools like camera traps.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot remains to be done to preserve the species,\u201d she said, adding that many local people don\u2019t even know it exists or erroneously believe it is extinct. </p> <h2>Three-in-one solenodons</h2> <p>Even as scientists try and find out basic data on the Cuban solenodon, researchers are discovering surprises regarding the better-known Hispaniolan species. Surveying the species\u2019 various populations, Samuel Turvey and his team recently discovered that the Hispaniolan species is actually three distinct subspecies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d25c1d57c3761c145ca93f7116059d3c2c1c52c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d25c1d57c3761c145ca93f7116059d3c2c1c52c/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female Hispaniolan solenodon caught for research near the Sierra de Bahoruco and re-released.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female Hispaniolan solenodon caught for research near the Sierra de Bahoruco and re-released.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiffany Roufs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c[These] evolved as a result of local isolation in the island\u2019s geologically complex landscapes,\u201d Turvey said, who noted the subspecies can be told apart both through DNA and physical attributes. <br></p> <p>One subspecies is found in a single forest in Haiti and may be perilously close to extinction. Another is found throughout the bulk of the northern Dominican Republic, but is lesser known. The third is located across the southern Dominican mountain range \u2013 Sierra de Bahoruco \u2013 that includes several parks and is the best protected of the subspecies. </p> <p>However, the discovery complicates conservation of the species as the southern subspecies show very little genetic diversity, while the northern subspecies survives in a highly fragmented landscape. According to <a href=\"http://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch</a>, the Dominican Republic lost more than 200,000 hectares of forest between 2001 and 2014.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ced90b7895c5251ce8fdc55e1c2d4bff60a1b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ced90b7895c5251ce8fdc55e1c2d4bff60a1b87/0_0_1425_2138/667.jpg\" alt=\"A female Hispaniola solenodon with a radio collar attached so researchers could track its movements.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female Hispaniola solenodon with a radio collar attached so researchers could track its movements.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiffany Roufs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having the largest range, Ernst Rupp, a Dominican Republic biologist with the local NGO Grupo Jaragua, said the northern subspecies \u201chas never really been investigated.\u201d However, recent surveys have proved the northern subspecies does still occurs in at least four protected areas, as well as in several areas outside protection.</p> <p>The plight of the solenodon in Haiti may be the most dire of all. Haiti\u2019s forests have been decimated over centuries and the solenodon survives only in the Massif de la Hotte region, the impoverished nation\u2019s last significant stand of cloud forest. </p> <p>\u201cThe Massif de la Hotte is a spectacular mountainous area in the far south-west of Haiti, where one of the few remnants of good quality forest in the country can be found,\u201d said Rosalind Kennerley with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT). </p> <p>But, the region remains under intense pressure for the charcoal trade, which has resulted in almost total deforestation in Haiti. Even the national park \u2013 Macaya National Park \u2013 is commonly infiltrated by charcoal producers. </p> <p>Kennerley is leading a team attempting to get baseline information on the how the Haitian subspecies if faring, a project also supported by the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, which often gives grants to lesser-known species. Not only do solenodons face environment deterioration in Haiti, but locals will also kill them and eat them when they are found. </p> <h2>The perils of anonymity</h2> <p>Fame or the lack of it really does make a difference when it comes to conservation.</p> <p>In 2009, a number of conservation groups \u2013 DWCT, ZSL\u2019s the EDGE programme, La Sociedad Ornitol\u00f3gica de la Hispaniola (SOH) and the Dominican Republic\u2019s Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources \u2013 kick-started a three-year research and conservation programme on the Hispaniola solenodon called The Last Survivors (the program also included the Hispaniola hutia, a tree-dwelling rodent). While it resulted in researchers learning more about the solenodon than ever before, the conservation impacts have been negligible, according to Rupp. </p> <p>\u201c[The programme] drew a lot of international attention to the Hispaniolan solenodon,\u201d Rupp said. \u201cSome of this attention actually spilled over into the Dominican press which published a few articles on the species.\u201d </p> <p>But the press has dissipated since the program ended in 2012 after a two-day stakeholder meeting. Worse still, few of the project\u2019s conservation recommendations have come to pass. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60364986a4c6d542fd48d5e0844a93e7f1120fb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60364986a4c6d542fd48d5e0844a93e7f1120fb8/0_0_5324_3924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An asteroid strikes Earth as flying reptiles look on.

As a result, the species will likely be downlisted by the IUCN Red List in the future. The programme\u2019s work has also led to a new focus \u2013 and concern \u2013 for the nearly extinct subspecies in Haiti. <br></p> <p>\u201cProtection of the native-forest habitat remains a priority for this species, as it is for other species on Hispaniola,\u201d Turvey said. </p> <p>But there remains little pride or even knowledge of the species in his home country, according to Rupp, despite it being one of only two endemic land mammals across the entirety of Hispaniola and the fact that it actually walked with dinosaurs.</p> <p>Sure, fame isn\u2019t everything. In fact, for human beings fame may well be <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=7658253&amp;page=1\">detrimental</a> for well-being. But for species, unfortunately, fame can mean the difference between extinction and survival. Famous species rake in far more funding and attention than the millions that live out of the limelight. While hopefully one day we\u2019ll focus more on other attributes for species conservation \u2013 extinction risk, evolutionary distinctness, or ecological roles \u2013 solenodons may not have much time, especially the Haitian subspecies and the Cuban species. </p> <p>Sure, solenodons survived the dinosaurs, the asteroid, several invasions of humans, and the arrival of novel predators \u2013 but can they survive obscurity in the Anthropocene? </p>",

  "<p>Most employers will at some point have to confront allegations of bullying at work. Putting procedures in place as well as managing difficult conversations with the individuals involved is beneficial, not just in the short-term by resolving conflicts, but also by helping create a more harmonious workplace. </p> <p>Employers can be hit by serious financial, legal and reputational issues if they fail to deal properly with allegations of bullying, from discrimination claims under the Equality Act (if related to a protected characteristic such as sex or age) to claims for breach of contract, constructive dismissal and negligence (if the bullying has caused a psychiatric injury to the individual).</p> <p>An obvious starting point is understanding what bullying is \u2013 but that\u2019s not as simple as it might sound. Bullying does not have a legal definition. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) does, however, provide useful guidance in its publication <a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/o/c/Bullying-and-harassment-at-work-a-guide-for-employees.pdf\">Bullying and Harassment at Work</a> (pdf). It defines bullying as \u201coffensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, an abuse or misuse of power through means that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To prevent issues gathering momentum, employers should ensure individuals are treated fairly throughout an investigation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harassment, although typically associated with acts of bullying, is a legally separate concept. It is defined as behaviour that causes alarm or distress on more than one occasion in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/40/contents\">Protection from Harassment Act 1997</a>, and in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/26\">Equality Act 2010</a> as \u201cunwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual\u2019s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual\u201d.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/half-of-women-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-at-work-tuc-study-everyday-sexism?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">researchers from the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project</a> this week found that 52% of women had experienced unwanted behaviour at work including groping, sexual advances and inappropriate jokes. Among women and girls aged 16-24, the proportion reporting sexual harassment rose to 63%.</p> <p>Employers will naturally want to take a zero-tolerance approach when it comes to tackling this kind of behaviour. However, to prevent issues gathering momentum, you should ensure individuals are treated fairly throughout an investigation. </p> <p>So how can employers handle bullying allegations appropriately?</p> <h2>Have a bullying and harassment policy</h2> <p>A policy stating what behaviour is unacceptable can be helpful when it comes to bullying allegations. Make sure it\u2019s clear, detailed, well-publicised in the office and defines what constitutes bullying and harassment. These terms are quite broad so it\u2019s best to cover a variety of behaviours and to include specific examples.</p> <p>The policy should illustrate what process the organisation will take when dealing with allegations \u2013 how an employee can raise a complaint, how it will be investigated and how unacceptable behaviour will be handled (you can use the company\u2019s equal opportunities and grievance policies to detail this).</p> <h2>Be clear you will handle concerns sensitively</h2> <p>Knowing that an employer will deal with an employee\u2019s concerns sensitively will encourage those who might be too afraid to come forward. It is not always possible to give an absolute assurance about confidentiality, so it is important to be clear with anyone involved in a bullying investigation on what they can expect. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/17/workplace-bullying-cost-uk-acas\">You\u2019re fired! How to get rid of workplace bullying | Stefan Stern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anonymised statements can be useful in easing an individual\u2019s worries about their complaints being raised with the accused individual, who will have a right to understand the nature of the complaints against them and to defend themselves. </p> <p>It\u2019s also crucial to impress upon everyone involved that they should keep matters confidential and that victimisation or retaliation will not be tolerated (bearing in mind that even if a complaint of discrimination is not upheld, retaliation could of itself give rise to a claim). An employer should also make sure to keep all involved up to date on progress, understanding that, for reasons of confidentiality, the complainant might not be entitled to know the specific actions taken against the perpetrator.</p> <h2>Handle the difficult conversations appropriately</h2> <p>These can be difficult conversations so it is best to nip the situation in the bud. You can ease a victim\u2019s stressful situation by being sympathetic and talking to them on a human level. This can make it easier further down the line for the complainant and the accused.<br></p> <p>Depending on the circumstances, an informal approach could be the best way to encourage an employee to speak about bullying and allow the accused to speak from their perspective. A formal process can be a daunting prospect for an individual who may already feel isolated and vulnerable.</p> <h2>Offer support</h2> <p>Managing relationships should be an employer\u2019s priority. Throughout the investigation, employers should offer support to all individuals involved. Mediation can be a great way of healing a relationship between two employees and confidential counselling can offer external support for those finding the situation particularly difficult. </p> <p>Often it\u2019s also worthwhile focusing on the solution rather than the precise details of the rights and wrongs of the complaint. Sometimes an effective way forward can be simple, such as changing someone\u2019s duties or work location. </p> <p>Staff turnover, absence, employee performance and morale can all be negatively affected if bullying in the workplace is not tackled appropriately. That\u2019s why it is important that employers make it their priority to manage allegations properly and adhere to any legal obligations. This can make these trickier situations easier and help contribute to a more supportive and positive atmosphere in the workplace.</p> <p><em>Keely Rushmore is a senior associate in the employment team at SA Law.</em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>Scottish grouse moor owners have been warned they face much tougher regulation after an inquiry was launched into the disappearance of legally protected golden eagles in the Highlands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/14/englands-last-golden-eagle-feared-dead\">England's last golden eagle feared dead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, ordered the review after eight golden eagles vanished in an area of the Monadhliath mountains known for its grouse shooting, south of Inverness.</p> <p>The eight eagles, which had all been satellite-tagged as part of long-running efforts by conservationists to monitor their struggling populations, disappeared in the last five years; the eighth bird, called Brodie, vanished in early July. </p> <p>The warnings came as the shooting industry prepares to celebrate the Glorious 12th this weekend, the traditional start in August of the grouse shooting season, leading to accusations from the industry the disclosures were timed for maximum effect. </p> <p>Conservationists including specialists at Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the government\u2019s agency, have long suspected golden eagles are failing to breed in ideal territories in the Highlands, Perthshire and the Borders because of systematic persecution by gamekeepers.</p> <p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Scotland said the latest disappearance added to its fears that these eagles and their transmitters were being destroyed after the birds were shot, trapped or poisoned. </p> <p>None of the missing birds or their tags has been found, said Ian Thomson, its head of investigations, but the close cluster of cases stretched coincidence. There were repeated proven cases of golden eagles being shot or trapped over recent years. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the reliability of the transmitters, the chance of so many birds disappearing over such a short timescale without some kind of human interference is so small as to be negligible,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThe pattern we see here is consistent with the birds having been killed and the transmitters destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham has asked SNH to analyse data gathered on around 90 tagged golden eagles to establish whether there were any clear, suspicious patterns. The latest reports were \u201cvery disturbing and disappointing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGrouse moor management does help species such as curlew and golden plover as well as generating much-needed rural employment and income but this cannot be at any price,\u201d Cunningham added.</p> <p>\u201cThe public rightly expects all businesses in Scotland to obey the law. Let me be clear: grouse shooting is no exception. As previously stated, the Scottish government is prepared to introduce further regulation of shooting businesses if necessary. It will be unfortunate if the activities of a few bring further regulation on the whole sector, but that is the risk those who defy the law and defy public opinion are running.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, which represents grouse moor managers and insists it enthusiastically supports bird-of-prey conservation, said he was deeply suspicious about the RSPB\u2019s motives and its conclusions. \u201cThere is no clear evidence of the golden eagles having even died in the Monadhliath area, let alone having been \u2018persecuted\u2019 on grouse moors as the RSPB is alleging,\u201d Baynes said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is now over a month since the disappearance of this latest eagle and it would have been in everyone\u2019s interests if the matter had been raised immediately. There are other explanations for satellite tags stopping working. </p> <p>\u201cWhere there is not a police investigation, as in these cases, contact should be made with local land managers who are often in the best position to help with information. Regrettably, the RSPB has not done this and it is not the first time. The RSPB would appear to be more interested in generating anti-shooting publicity on the eve of the grouse shooting season.\u201d</p>",

Take child marriage \u2013 a form of violence against girls that means 15 million girls each year lose out on their childhood. It happens most in societies where women and girls face gender-based discrimination, inequality and harmful social norms that mean they are not valued equally to boys and men. And women and girls don\u2019t experience this violence in isolation. If they marry too young they are much more likely to experience other forms of violence in their lifetimes, such as domestic violence.

Governments need to make decisions on where to target resources based on an understanding of the local context and a focus on reaching the most marginalised.

But governments have signed up to an ambitious framework for the next 15 years and they must achieve the goals and fulfil their promises to the world\u2019s poorest people.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the SDGs challenge governments to go beyond business as usual to be truly gender transformative. None of the goals can be achieved without progress on other areas in the framework or without the involvement of girls and women throughout. <br></p> <p>All the goals are interconnected, and it is important that there is no cherrypicking by states working on some goals or targets but not others.</p> <p><em>Heather Saunders is policy and advocacy adviser at <a href=\"http://www.plan-uk.org/\">Plan UK</a>.

  "<p>When Guardian Australia launched, just over three years ago, we decided to put the country\u2019s immigration system at the heart of our coverage. As a new launch with a tiny staff, we asked ourselves: which stories matter most that aren\u2019t being told? What needs to be exposed? The compulsory detention of people arriving in Australia by sea, and the broad political consensus around it, seemed like a good place to start.</p> <p>This week we have revealed one of the most important stories in the history of detention in Australia: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">the Nauru files</a>, containing 2,000 leaked incident reports from Australia\u2019s detention camp for asylum seekers on the remote Pacific island of Nauru.</p> <p>Which is why I want to ask you, our readers, to help us fund this journalism \u2014 through a <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/?INTCMP=co_au_editorial_Kath_article\">one-off</a> or a <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=mem_au_editorial_Kath_article\">monthly</a> contribution \u2014 so we can continue this important work of holding power to account.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/nauru-teachers-speak-out-for-children-we-dont-have-to-torture-them\">Nauru teachers speak out for children: \u2018We don\u2019t have to torture them\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Nauru files lifts the secrecy surrounding Australia\u2019s hidden detention regime for asylum seekers through vivid reporting and the words of the guards and officials on the island themselves.

  "<p> The Coalition government is split over landmark commonwealth intervention in land clearing in Queensland\u2019s far north by environment department officials concerned about impacts on the

to clearing permits in Cape York</a>, which were approved by the former Newman LNP state government in 2014.</p> <p>The issue arose after the federal environment department decided the clearing of 2,900 hectares of land in Kingsvale needed to be approved under federal laws, despite neither the land holder nor the state government referring it to to the federal government.</p> <p>The federal government made the decision, claiming the clearing had the potential to impact the world-heritage listed Great Barrier Reef, by increasing sediment run-off.</p> <aside class=\"element

Newman government MP</a> David Kempton, and the new federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, will be the respondent.</p> <p>MacDonald said he would raise the issue as a priority with Frydenberg,

Frydenberg as the respondent.<br></p> <p>The matter is likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/20/former-lnp-official-urges-landholders-to-hang-up-on-environment-officers\">raise tensions between</a> the federal Coalition and the Queensland LNP, as well as between the federal Liberal and National parties. </p> <p>Former Cook MP David Kempton is the solicitor acting for grazier Scott Harris, whose permit to clear his Kingvale property hangs in limbo while the environment department seeks to assess it for impacts under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.<br></p> <p>Conservationists welcomed the department\u2019s move to require assessment of the clearing under the EPBC for potential harm through sediment runoff to reef waters downstream.</p> <p>It is a step towards possibly overturning the state permit to clear 2,900 hectares on Kingvale, which is 200km from the coast but next to rivers that flow into reef waters.</p> <p>Harris also owns the Strathmore property in northwest Queensland, where he was approved to clear 58,000 hectares of savannah woodland.</p> <p>Cutting pollution of reef waters is a key plank of the state and federal governments\u2019 long term conservation plan for the reef, which is reeling from its worst ever coral bleaching event this summer.</p> <p>Reducing pollution flowing onto the reef \u2013 including by reducing clearing in Queensland \u2013 forms part of the government\u2019s Reef 2050 plan, which needs to be implemented in order to keep the Reef off UNESCO\u2019s \u201cworld heritage in danger\u201d list.</p> <p>It comes also as the Palaszczuk state Labor government seeks to pass laws as early as next week to renew clearing restrictions that were axed by its LNP predecessor.</p> <p>The Palaszczuk government considers current rates of clearing, at 300,000 hectares a year to be unacceptably high and a key barrier to achieving national targets for cutting carbon emissions.</p> <p>MacDonald told Guardian Australia he was concerned that uncomprehending commonwealth bureaucrats were overreaching in the use of their powers to target landholders whose plans were already assessed by the state.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard reports of the commonwealth department of environment pursuing substantial landholders who have been clearing exactly in accordance with permits granted by the Queensland government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI would be very concerned if a commonwealth department was using its powers to override carefully assessed permits given by the Queensland government.</p> <p>\u201cThis to me smacks of another instance where Canberra bureaucrats who probably don\u2019t even know where the Gulf of Carpentaria is trying to make rules without any understanding of the local ecology and environment.</p> <p>\u201cI intend to raise this matter with the new environment minister at the earliest possible opportunity as I did with the previous minister.\u201d</p> <p>The federal court challenge by Harris is due for a hearing on Friday.</p> <p>Andrew Picone, the Northern Australia program officer for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said federal intervention at Kingvale was welcome but it was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d.</p> <p>Almost 1m hectares had been cleared in Queensland over three years without referral to national environment law, Picone said.</p> <p>\u201cNone of the projects that were waved through under Newman era legislation have had their environmental impacts properly considered.\u201d</p> <p>It showed the \u201curgent\u201d need to change the state\u2019s tree-clearing laws, given that \u201cunder the current system, federal intervention on every clearing proposal represents the only opportunity to have nationally significant environmental values properly assessed and protected\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to ensure that large scale clearing is stopped otherwise we will send species on the fast track to extinction.\u201d</p> <p>Australian Marine Conservation Society reef campaigner Imogen Zethoven said the department\u2019s intervention was \u201ca fantastic decision by the federal government and reveals the risk posed by the Newman tree clearing laws to the Great Barrier Reef\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the heavy rains come, soil washes into rivers and into the reef, smothering corals and seagrass meadows, which are home to threatened turtles and dugong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDirty turbid water makes it harder for corals to grow, which is especially serious for corals off Cape York, as they were hardest hit from the severe coral bleaching event last summer.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Seelig, the head of the Queensland Conservation Council, said federal intervention had been \u201ca long coming, as conservation groups have been raising such concerns about several properties in reef catchments for more than a year, and have sought federal action\u201d.</p> <p>He said the \u201chigh-value agriculture\u201d provision for clearing was \u201calways a ruse to allow clearing for cattle grazing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the high-value agriculture permit system was introduced by the Newman government, it did not require proper environmental assessment, nor rigorous and independent agricultural assessment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have clearing like this destroying large areas of native woodland, especially in areas where run-off into the reef is a risk.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a
