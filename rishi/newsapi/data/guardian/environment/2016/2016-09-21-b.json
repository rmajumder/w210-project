  "<p>The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought, according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend.</p> <p>The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world\u2019s largest cities. </p> <p>The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass. When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago, its great weight depressed the hot, viscous rocks in the underlying mantle. As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards.</p> <p>Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on <a href=\"http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/greenland_ice_sheet.html\">earlier figures</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"798cb000d80a380bb773b5c008fb95a769a44a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/798cb000d80a380bb773b5c008fb95a769a44a29/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The southern tip of Greenland seen from space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The southern tip of Greenland seen from space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ISS/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland\u2019s volcanoes.</p> <p>The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today. </p> <p>This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland\u2019s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Bamber, at the University of Bristol, UK, and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study, published in <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/9/e1600931\">Science Advances</a>.</p> <p>Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: \u201cOne thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change,\u201d said Dr Christopher Harig, at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new research happening now really speaks to the question: \u2018How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century?\u2019 As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets, these estimates have tended to go up. In my mind, the time for urgency about climate change [action] really arrived years ago, and it\u2019s past time our policy reflected that urgency.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Pippa Whitehouse, at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research, said: \u201cThis study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss. Using such measurements, this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean, making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/1000.jpg&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/1000.jpg&amp;label_after=Now&amp;\" data-alt=\"Melt water on surface of Greenland ice sheet June 10, 2014 and June 15, 2016.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/1000.jpg&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/1000.jpg&label_after=Now&\">Melt water on surface of Greenland ice sheet June 10, 2014 and June 15, 2016.</a> <figcaption>Melt water on the surface of Greenland ice sheet 10 June, 2014 and 15 June, 2016.

Their aim was to help governments, donors, health professionals and policymakers better identify successes and gaps in global healthcare delivery.<br></p> <p>A median health-related SDG index of 59.3% was established, with countries in the highest quintile (over 71.5%) clustering in western Europe, high-income North America, and parts of Asia and Australasia. Iceland, Singapore and Sweden ranked highest overall; Iceland scored 85.5%, thanks largely to tobacco controls and a well-established public health system. </p> <p>The bottom three countries \u2013 Somalia, South Sudan and Central African Republic \u2013 were all in Africa. Central African Republic scored 20.4% overall, recording 0% for hygiene, 2% for water, and 3% for malaria indicators.</p> <p>Even developed countries, including the UK and US, did badly in certain areas.

The US scored far worse, ranking 28<sup>th</sup> overall, a result shaped partly by deaths due to interpersonal violence and suicide. The US also ranked poorly among high-income countries on maternal, child and neonatal mortality.</p> <p>A number of countries did better than expected between 2000 and 2015, including Timor-Leste, Tajikistan and Colombia. Others, including Syria and Libya, fared extremely badly, due to war.</p> <p>The report also indicated that rapid economic growth alone did not necessarily make countries meet targets better. India came 143rd of the 188 countries included in the study, behind Comoros and Ghana.</p> <p>\u201cOur study is a starting point for further investigation on how and why countries are underperforming, or performing well, compared to the average,\u201d said Professor Steven Lim of IHME, one of the report\u2019s authors.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be an annual effort to ensure progress is maintained and that lessons from successes are learned and rapidly transferred to other countries where progress is less impressive.\u201d</p> <p>The data showed varied progress among nations. More than 60% of countries have already met the 2030 targets on reducing maternal mortality (less than 70 deaths for every 100,000 live births) and child mortality (25 deaths per 1,000 live births). </p> <p>But no country has met \u2013 or is likely to meet \u2013 the goal to completely eliminate tuberculosis or HIV by 2030. The authors warned that a \u201csubstantial change\u201d in the current trajectory of HIV and tuberculosis indices, as well as \u201cmajor technological leaps coupled with universal delivery\u201d, would be required to meet the deadline.</p> <p>Researchers developed a socio-demographic index in order to differentiate progress made on the SDG index from progress that countries would have been otherwise expected to make. Based on income per capita, educational attainment and total fertility rate \u2013 key indices of a country\u2019s development status \u2013 the index was highly predictive of health-related SDG indices. But it failed to predict interpersonal violence, self-harm and childhood obesity, with the authors warning that more research is required to understand what helps or hinders progress in such cases.</p> <p>Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said that the SDGs may be more useful to donors and aid organisations than poor countries, warning that \u201cglobal priorities risk over-riding local concerns and priorities\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments find it a tricky balancing act to manage pleasing donors with what their citizens are calling for, and ensuring that they are paying particular attention to marginalised communities who might have even specific needs to be met,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the end, governments should be responsible to their communities rather than to external entities.\u201d</p>",

And to the extent that those revelations damaged and undermined the trust that needs to exist, I think it is highly problematic.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the threat posed by groups such as al-Qaida and Islamic State, Younger said: \u201cI would like to be optimistic about this but we have got quite a long experience of this phenomenon now and I see it very much as the flip-side to some very deep-seated global trends, not least of all globalisation: the reduction of barriers between us.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a function also of the information revolution and the capacity for ideas to travel.

One option often raised is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/universal-basic-income-could-be-the-best-way-to-tackle-inequality\">universal basic income</a>, which would rewrite the relationship between employees and employers, give people confidence and flexibility, and reinvigorate the idea that we are all in this together. </p> <p>Ideally going hand in hand with this, mandating a shorter working week would see us both share work more fairly and grapple better with work-life balance, which seems to have gone out the window recently. </p> <p>Another idea in this area is supporting cooperatives, putting workers\u2019 jobs into their own hands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries | Claire Provost and Matt Kennard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there\u2019s the challenge of reclaiming our politics, our public spaces, our very sense of the \u201cpublic\u201d, from corporate takeover. This goes far deeper than simply corporate donations to politicians, which one scandal too many has finally put on the agenda. It needs to disentangle the entire web.</p> <p>One of the most egregious and obvious examples has been the way international trade negotiations have been handed over to private interests. The peak of this trend is investor state dispute resolution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">allowing companies to sue governments in a way which individual citizens could never dream of</a>. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the ever increasing handover of public space to private interests through advertising. How about declaring advertising free zones and removing the tax deduction for spending on ads?</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the way our schools, universities and research institutions are increasingly being run as profit-driven entities, training the next generation of workers and inventing new goods for sale, rather than as public institutions valuing knowledge for its own sake. This needs to be reversed by providing both sufficient funds and the appropriate remit to focus on educating citizens and researching for the public good.</p> <p>If we want to look really deep, let\u2019s challenge the very concept of corporate personhood, which enables companies\u2019 rights often to trump those of people, and certainly to overrule any rights of nature. If BHP Billiton is a legal person, why shouldn\u2019t the Great Barrier Reef be one, too?

  "<p> Thursday is the autumn equinox and, even though it feels autumnal, there\u2019s little sign of leaves on the big trees changing colour, except for horse chestnut trees turning prematurely brown because of leaf miners infesting the leaves.</p> <p>Despite a host of other pests and diseases, it\u2019s been a good growing year for trees. Plenty of rain, spells of warm sunshine and the astonishingly warm September all gave trees a big boost.

If anything, [today\u2019s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks.

The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u2019s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens.

The Federal Reserve will keep its main rate on hold at 0.25-0.50%, citing near-term, weak economic developments, yet insisting that enough progress has been made to warrant a rate hike at one of the upcoming meetings (hint: December, when the next SEPs are released). The key for the US Dollar today, however, is to what degree of confidence the FOMC has in the US economy, or simply, \u2018how quickly does the Fed think it will be able to raise rates next?\u2019</p> <p>...In actuality, rate expectations are completely muted for today and are sitting on the fence for 2016.</p> <p>This is the main source of risk for markets today. Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u201con the table\u201d in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple.

It was just magnificent,\u201d says Rumney, a veteran reef tourism operator, who helped pioneer ecotourism on the reef, and is now establishing a privately funded non-profit research enterprise,<a href=\"https://www.greatbarrierreeflegacy.org/\"> Great Barrier Reef Legacy</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/leonardo-dicaprio-given-rival-invitations-to-visit-great-barrier-reef\">Leonardo DiCaprio given rival invitations to visit Great Barrier Reef</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo we have a great baseline of what it was like.

While almost a quarter of coral has been killed on the Great Barrier Reef, it has been concentrated in the area north of Port Douglas.</p> <p>Despite that, the effects on this reef just 50km north-east of Port Douglas \u2013 the most popular launching point for reef tourism \u2013 have been severe.</p> <p>Guardian Australia is here with the Climate Council, which visited this reef at the peak of the bleaching, in May, and has come back now to see how much has recovered.</p> <p>Snorkelling on the outer reef where the water is crystal clear, it\u2019s obvious what a vibrant reef it would have been just a few months ago.</p> <p>While the seafloor is almost completely covered by coral, much of it is dead, covered with algae and starting to lose its structure.

The coral polyps get stressed and spit out the algae that lives inside it. Without the colourful algae, the coral flesh becomes transparent, revealing the stark white skeleton beneath.</p> <p>Because the algae provides the coral with 90% of its energy, it begins to starve. Unless the ocean temperature return to normal within a month or two, the coral dies and gets taken over by a blanket of seaweed.</p> <p>Now, upon Flannery\u2019s return, the state of this particular reef has advanced to the point where it appears about 30% of the coral has died.</p> <p>Emerging from the water, Lesley Hughes, another of the Climate Council\u2019s councillors and an ecologist from Macquarie University, says it\u2019s distressing to see so much death on the reef.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside the dead coral and algae, there appears to be an outbreak of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish.

The coral just dies.\u201d</p> <p>For Flannery, the dead coral is a stark reminder of the well-known response that is needed to climate change.</p> <p>\u201cIf it was up to me and I was the Australian government looking at the loss of this asset, I would be announcing a plan to close down all of our coal-fired power plants over a given period of time, shift to clean energy, and do whatever it takes in the transport sector and so forth to make that transition,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then go to the international community and say \u2018look, this global asset is in real danger, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done to try and secure it, please join us to do your bit as well\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>To head back to Port Douglas from the outer reef, we weave through the ribbons of reef that link together for hundreds of kilometres along the Queensland coast. As we approach the shore, a ship in the distance gets larger and larger and we slowly realise it\u2019s a coal tanker.</p> <p>Having collected its coal from one of the ports that dot the Great Barrier Reef, it\u2019s delivering it to somewhere in the world \u2013 perhaps India or China \u2013 where it will be burned, create more greenhouse gases and further warm the atmosphere, making the next coral bleaching more likely. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Michael Slezak and Josh Wall were guests of the Climate Council</em></p>",

Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council), said that members of his group (which includes Amazon, Apple, Dell, EMC, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel and Microsoft) did not think Vestager\u2019s visit will have much of an impact.</p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s aimed at explaining and putting in context what is largely inexplicable.\u201d Personal rapport, he said, is helpful to work through difficult trade issues, \u201cso a degree of familiarity and trust is helpful, but the policy implications remain the same\u201d.</p> <p>Technology industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president and principal analyst of San Jose-based Creative Strategies, was even more blunt. \u201cEvery major company we deal with has the same basic position \u2013 it\u2019s sensitive for them to speak out, but as far as they are concerned, they have paid every tax they legally owe,\u201d he said. \u201cA retroactive tax just doesn\u2019t sit well with anyone here in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Bajarin, who has been advising US technology companies for more than 30 years, also offers a historical perspective based on his own work with those companies when they were being courted by Ireland\u2019s Industrial Development Agency (IDA) to make a move to Ireland in the first place. \u201cHad they not built this program, they would not have built a tech industry in Ireland,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691352\"            data-video-name=\"Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5a5a9e4b04fe839bc4fcd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\">Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He also said that he was surprised by the European commission\u2019s decision to seek retroactive taxes, since the EU was well aware of the IDA\u2019s work with Apple and other technology companies from the start. \u201cFrom when they first did the program, they got the EU\u2019s approval \u2013 and nobody had any problems with it for almost 30 years.\u201d </p> <p>Bajarin also suggested that it loses sight of why tax incentives were offered in the first place. \u201cParents were getting upset with the Irish government [because there was no significant technology sector in Ireland] and their kids would leave. That was a huge issue and why the Irish government created this program \u2013 so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry. And it was very successful,\u201d he said. When Silicon Valley started booming, the IDA opened an office in San Francisco and pitched everything around tax, he explains.</p> <p>Yet despite concerns about the European commission\u2019s decision on Apple, virtually all of the players on the US side of the discussion concede that tax reform in the United States is part of the solution. Hatch weighed into the issue in his comments on the meeting with Vestager.</p> <p>\u201cWe must do our part to address the anti-competitive nature of the US tax code and the impact it has had on our domestic job creators both here and abroad,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cLowering the corporate tax burden and shifting to a territorial regime with base erosion protections will help shift our economic landscape and produce fertile ground for more businesses to invest here at home. It\u2019s an achievable, bipartisan goal that holds great promise, should we get a willing partner in the White House.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Irish government created this program so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry.

We believe these changes should come about through the proper legislative process, in which proposals are discussed among the leaders and citizens of the affected countries. And as with any new laws, they should be applied going forward \u2013 not retroactively,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Vestager\u2019s US visit continues on Wednesday with a speech at New York\u2019s Columbia University called \u201cTax avoidance and privacy in the digital age: an EU perspective\u201d. She also issued a statement clarifying the commission\u2019s definition of \u201cstate aid\u201d as part of the announcement of a finding on Wednesday that found that \u201cfive public measures for purely local operations in Spain, Germany and Portugal involve no state aid because they are unlikely to affect trade between member states\u201d and will thus not be the subject of any commission action.</p> <p>\u201cIn many cases member states can stimulate investment without asking the commission,\u201d she said. \u201cThese decisions confirm that many local public support measures do not constitute state aid.

He said: \u201cWe&#xa0;now know why terrorists want her so badly to be president.\u201d</p> <p>In the potential leader of a great democracy, this is alarmist drivel. We&#xa0;should also be careful, since the&#xa0;exploitation of existential fear has long been a feature of America\u2019s isolated&#xa0;political culture. In 1950, a little-known American senator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Kefauver\" title=\"\">Estes Kefauver</a>, achieved national fame by holding televised hearings into America\u2019s \u201corganised crime\u201d, drawing on blood-curdling fantasies of a Sicilian-American \u201cmafia\u201d. This mafia was, Kefauver claimed, holding American cities to ransom. Communities lived in&#xa0;fear of it. The national economy was&#xa0;menaced by it.</p> <p>The televised hearings were at times ludicrous. One hoodlum after another was dragged to Washington to protest that all he was running was a few protection rackets on the Lower East Side. Try as Kefauver might to find a Mr&#xa0;Big to justify his extravagant hearings, he found only a disorganised trail of small-time hoods. He still demanded a&#xa0;new Washington bureaucracy to \u201ccrack&#xa0;down on organised crime\u201d \u2013 and&#xa0;ran unsuccessfully for president. The search for \u201ca mafia\u201d was subcontracted to Hollywood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d9da9202eb1883265c97948a818c1ec4e447912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d9da9202eb1883265c97948a818c1ec4e447912/111_0_3279_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmad Khan Rahami\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from WABC TV showing a man believed to be the New York bombing suspect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WABC-TV/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later another senator, Joe&#xa0;McCarthy, decided to exploit a different \u201cexistential\u201d scare. His committee investigated what he claimed&#xa0;was the \u201cmassive\u201d penetration of the government and military by communists and homosexuals. Fear of a spurious threat to the state was turned into a witch-hunt by McCarthy and his aide, a certain Richard Nixon. There was a red under every bed \u2013 and&#xa0;a&#xa0;blackmailer in it. McCarthy, until his mental collapse, became a national celebrity. Americans have seemed to get a frisson from being told they are threatened, perhaps because they never&#xa0;have been.</p> <p>Likewise with Trump.

It reminded us of the response of mayor Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, when he told New Yorkers not to panic but to go to the park, see a show, buy a pizza and \u201ccontinue with your normal lives\u201d. This was the opposite of Blair\u2019s response, which was to declare that 9/11 \u201cchanged the world\u201d and \u201crewrote the rules of the game\u201d.

Its rational ambition is to change the world around it. Nor does it always fail, as some might argue in the case of the IRA. Violence in a political cause is as old as history. Civil terror is a classic tool of the weak against the strong.</p> <p>In the case of modern jihadism, brutal mayhem has yet to deliver it a stable caliphate.

Scaremongering, the search for a foe against whom to pretend&#xa0;to defend the state, may be as old as terror itself. But given the absolute security of modern America and Britain, it is a dangerous self-indulgence. It should be excoriated.</p> <p>It is not the bomb that is the terrorist\u2019s accomplice but the response&#xa0;to the bomb.

  "<p>A book about the destructive impact of domestic cats on wildlife has sent fur flying, setting its authors at loggerheads with British conservationists over whether the country\u2019s moggies should be kept under house arrest. </p> <p>The book, Cat Wars, calls for the activity of cats to be controlled in a bid to conserve global wildlife and prevent the spread of infections and diseases such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/sep/25/medicineandhealth.thisweekssciencequestions1\">toxoplasmosis</a>. \u201cFrom a conservation ecology perspective, the most desirable solution seems clear - remove all free-ranging cats from the landscape by any means necessary,\u201d the authors write.<br></p> <p>They admit such a goal is \u201chardly practical\u201d, but they propose a range of measures to reduce the environmental impact of <em>Felis catus. </em>They include keeping cats indoors, neutering, re-homing feral and stray cats and euthanising those for which there is no other option. </p> <p>\u201cCats are a domesticated species that don\u2019t belong outside. They shouldn\u2019t have access to native species,\u201d said <a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/about/staff.cfm\">Peter Marra</a>, the head of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Centre, who co-authored Cat Wars with Chris Santella. </p> <p>British experts have hit back, saying that there is no need for such measures in the UK. \u201cIn terms of the UK experience, I think it is very unfortunate advice coming through from the Americans on what we should do when there isn\u2019t a problem in the first place,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-bradshaw\">John Bradshaw</a>, the director of the anthrozoology institute at the University of Bristol. </p> <p>Habitat loss rather than cats is the key cause of concern when it comes to wildlife, he added.<br></p> <p>The 7.4 million pet cats in the UK are not a scourge, Bradshaw said, echoing the view put forward by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/makeahomeforwildlife/advice/gardening/unwantedvisitors/cats/birddeclines.aspx\">advises that while pet cats are thought to kill around 55m birds a year,</a>, they tend to prey on the sick or weak.</p> <p>Marra argues that there is no evidence for such claims. \u201cThere is no data on that. Show me the paper on that. It is not there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bradshaw says that unlike countries such as Australia or New Zealand, where cats arrived only a few hundred years ago, they have been a feature of British life for millennia. \u201cWe have had domestic cats in this country since before Roman times,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has probably been time for quite a lot of co-evolution.\u201d</p> <p>Marra disagrees. \u201cThe idea that cats co-evolve with native species is just not true. Where is the data on that? That is just not true,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cGiven what we know about cats influence globally, both on island and on continents, on mainlands, how can we, especially a group dedicated to the preservation of birds, how can we just turn our head to that? I really don\u2019t understand that,\u201d he said of the RSPB\u2019s position. </p> <p>In areas with endangered or threatened species a zero-tolerance stance is necessary, Marra says, with household cats kept indoors and stray and feral cats neutered and adopted, housed in shelters or, if absolutely necessary, put down. </p> <p>\u201cI am not saying we [should be] killing all cats,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not proposing that. I would never propose that.\u201d </p> <p>The debate comes in the same week that <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/13/1602480113.abstract\">researchers from Australia and New Zealand</a> revealed that feral cats are one of the worst offenders when it comes to threatening wildlife around the world. They claim they are responsible for the extinction of 63 species and threaten 430. <br></p> <p>\u201cAround the rest of the world we are not arguing about the impacts, we are arguing about the solutions,\u201d said <a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/about/staff.cfm\">Marra</a>. \u201cI am a little befuddled, I am a little confused by the push back in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The view of cats as murdering menaces is shared by many, including the broadcasters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/09/chris-packham-interview-springwatch\">Chris Packham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/cats-killing-birds-gardens-david-attenborough\">David Attenborough</a>, who have previously called for owners to keep their pets indoors or kit them out with bell-collars to help prevent them hunting garden birds. </p> <p>Mark Avery, a writer, environmental campaigner and former director of conservation at the RSPB, said that while moggies kill millions of birds in the UK, they are rarely threatened or endangered species. </p> <p>\u201cIf we killed all the cats in the country or kept them indoors, there would be a few more birds out there, but not that many more,\u201d he said. Many natural predators of birds are no longer present in the countryside, he added. \u201cThe British countryside ought to be full of polecats and goshawks and all sorts of things that would eat these birds.\u201d</p> <p>Marra disagrees. \u201cRight now the density that cats are at, especially in the UK, far exceeds any density of any native predator that was once there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Avery is adamant that the calling for cats be controlled is far from a top priority. \u201cIf you look at all the conservation issues in the country, this comes quite low down the list,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you have sorted out climate change, agriculture, overfishing , water pollution, over-abstraction and illegal killing of birds of prey, then maybe we will come on to the cats.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The great Rio sportsfest is over. The Paralympians have arrived home, and they are recovering from their jet lag. The Olympians are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-jonny-world-triathlon-series\" title=\"\">on to the next thing</a>. Memories are fading of the state-sponsored doping scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/31/ioc-russia-doping-athletes-rio-olympics\" title=\"\">overshadowed the opening of the Games</a> in August and led to around 100 Russian athletes being excluded from the Olympics, and all Russian athletes being banned from the Paralympics. So there is a window of opportunity, a moment to lay the foundations for a genuinely clean 2020 Tokyo Games. There is an obstacle, however. Officially it is denied. But the body that should be most interested in promoting such an outcome, the International Olympic Committee, appears instead to be trying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/wada-ioc-olympics-russia-ban-rio-2016\" title=\"\">to undermine Wada</a>, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the organisation best placed to police international sport.</p> <p>The IOC is considering setting up its own \u201cintegrity unit\u201d, a new body that Wada officials fear would take over its powers to investigate allegations and sanction drug cheats, in retribution for Wada\u2019s independence at Rio. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/31/anti-doping-organisations-ioc-politics-business-clean-sport-13-national-russia\" title=\"\">flaws in such an arrangement</a> were plain for all to see in this summer\u2019s row: Wada, acting on the findings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/18/wada-report-russia-sochi-winter-olympics\" title=\"\">McLaren report</a> that it had commissioned into the extent of state support in Russia for cheating, demanded that all Russian athletes should be banned. The IOC, whose president, Thomas Bach, is close to Vladimir Putin, insisted that such a decision was for the IOC to make, and subsequently decided that the 28 international sports federations should be the arbiters of which athletes could compete. The one person banned by the IOC was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/25/yuliya-stepanova-whistleblower-rio-olympics-ban-ioc\" title=\"\">the whistleblower </a>Yuliya Stepanova, who had alerted Wada to the extent of Russian doping. It is hard to avoid concluding that the IOC has too much at stake in mounting a global spectacular to be a credible anti-doping body as well. If its main purpose is to run a global sports event, the suspicion will always be that policing the sports themselves is a subordinate concern.</p> <p>Wada is not perfect. It is not entirely independent of the IOC: personnel overlap, and its president, Sir Craig Reedie, is also a vice president of the IOC. The IOC provides half of Wada\u2019s funding, with national governments making up the rest. Currently the whole Wada budget comes to little more than \u00a320m. That is not enough.</p> <p>According to Sir Craig, Wada needs more powers and a governance review to ensure that it can tackle corruption effectively. But it also needs the budget to conduct in-depth investigations, to keep up with the constantly shifting world of athletics medicine, and to establish and maintain international standards against which the sports federations\u2019 and national governments\u2019 anti-doping policies can be judged.</p> <p>Clean, honest sport is not only a concern for the guardians of the Olympic ideal at the IOC. It matters to the governments that pay so heavily to put on major sporting events such as the Olympics; it matters to the federations that run individual sports; and it matters to the sponsors and the broadcasters. Everyone who has an interest in it should contribute to the anti-doping agency\u2019s budget. They will all gain \u2013 including the athletes themselves, for they are the first victims of the cheats. But the biggest beneficiaries will be the fans, who deserve to know that they can believe what they are seeing.</p>",
  "<p>Independent tests in the US have found that the energy consumption of Samsung and LG TV sets nosedives under test conditions but can soar by up to 45% in real-world use, raising questions of manipulation by software devices.</p> <p>TVs from the top three best selling US brands - Samsung, LG and Vizio - have also been found to be switching off power-saving features without warning, as soon as consumers make \u201cout of the box\u201d changes to their main picture menu settings, which can double the TV sets\u2019 energy usage. <br></p> <p>If just a third of LG, Samsung and Vizio TV owners changed their sets\u2019 pre-programmed picture settings, they could end up paying $1.2bn (\u00a3920m) extra on their energy bills and releasing an extra 5m tonnes of CO2 over the next 10 years, according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/\">Natural Resources Defence Council</a> (NRDC), which commissioned the tests.</p> <p>Noah Horowitz, the director of the NRDC\u2019s centre for energy efficiency standards, said: \u201cIt appears that some major manufacturers have modified their TV designs to get strong energy-use marks during government testing but [they] may not perform as well in consumer homes.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThese \u2018under the hood\u2019 changes dramatically increase a TV\u2019s energy use and environmental impact, usually without the user\u2019s knowledge. While this may not be illegal, it smacks of bad-faith conduct that falls outside the intent of the government test method designed to accurately measure TV energy use.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, the NRDC began testing several manufacturers\u2019 ultra high-definition TVs in collaboration with the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ecosresearch.com/\">Ecos Research</a> consultancy. More comprehensive laboratory and in-store tests were carried out this year of TV sets by firms, also including Sony, Phillips and Panasonic. </p> <p>The NRDC says that its results were shared with all TV manufacturers and none questioned their accuracy.</p> <p>The software involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/01/samsung-tvs-appear-more-energy-efficient-in-tests-than-in-real-life\">was first revealed in a Guardian report last year</a> which is cited in the NRDC study. It is a feature known as \u201cmotion-detection dimming\u201d (MDD), which Samsung retails in European stores as part of the firms\u2019 9,000 and 7,000 series. </p> <p>It is not clear whether the exact models - the Samsung UN55JU7100, Samsung UN55JS9000 and LG 58UF8300 - are sold in Britain. But the product lines share the same screen size and many of the same or similar features.</p> <p>The energy performance of all TVs is highly dependent on brightness and other settings, and a <a href=\"http://www.coolproducts.eu/blog/vw-anniversary\">\u20ac400,000 study into power usage by big brand European TV manufacturers</a> is expected to announce its results later this year. </p> <p>The NRDC says that after being informed of the US test results, Samsung, LG and Vizio all said that they would consider modifying their TVs to address its concerns. </p> <p>However, John Taylor, a Vice President at LG stressed that \u201cLG disputes the findings in the report. LG has followed both the letter and spirit of the DoE [US Department of Energy] test procedure for TV energy testing, and we take great exception to the assertion that LG is \u2018exploiting a loophole\u2019 in the government test procedure.\u201d </p> <p>Taylor said the company was critical of the NRDC\u2019s test methodology and conclusions, particularly over the issue of \u201cnormal viewing\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no consensus on how to define \u2018normal viewing,\u2019 he added. \u201cThe NRDC\u2019s \u2018normal viewing\u2019 test clip and LG\u2019s \u2018normal viewing\u2019 test clip show significantly different results.\u201d </p> <p>Samsung maintains that MDD reduces power whenever any video motion is detected and so is a bona fide energy-saving measure.</p> <p> The company said in a statement that its TVs comply with US government guidelines and regulations: \u201cSamsung firmly rejects the accusation that we are misleading consumers. Our energy star rating is based on the default setting of our TVs. The majority of users stay within the default viewing settings through the lifetime of their television. Furthermore, we strongly believe that consumers should always have the option to customize the viewing experience on their TV.</p> <p>\u201cOur motion lighting and auto brightness control are default settings in our TVs. They are designed to save energy for consumers in real-world viewing conditions. Motion lighting reduces screen brightness when the picture on the screen is in motion. Auto brightness control adjusts the brightness of the TV automatically according to the ambient light level to reduce power consumption. Both are part of a range of features we have developed to help reduce the environmental impact of our TV technology.</p> <p>\u201cOur TVs have additional viewing settings for specific user preferences in which motion lighting and automatic brightness control are not active by default. Consumers are notified of this.\u201d </p> <p>While the NRDC accepts that TV firms may be trying to improve their customers\u2019 perceived enjoyment of programmes, the study says that they have nonetheless \u201ctaken questionable actions that run counter to the spirit of the law\u201d.</p> <p>Because the MDD feature reduced its TV sets\u2019 power usage during US Department of Energy (DoE) tests \u2013 by an average of 22% compared to real-world situations, but by 45% in one LG TV \u2013 the report suggests that manufacturers could be gaming the industry-designed International Electrotechnical Commission test clip. </p> <p>This is a distinctive 10-minute video spool of unusually short scenes, which is unlike normal sports, drama or news programme viewing. </p> <p> \u201cWe observed inexplicable, dramatic and sustained drops in energy use in TVs,\u201d the report says, \u201cbeginning within the first minute of the video test loop used in the Department of Energy test method for new TV models.\u201d </p> <p> \u201cIt is possible that some manufacturers have designed their TVs to detect the continuous occurrence of short scenes and frequent scene cuts and to \u2018optimise\u2019 their performance to reduce power when content with these characteristics is displayed.\u201d</p> <p>This would allow a TV manufacturer to gain a competitive advantage by publishing a low-energy usage rating, which does not reflect the products\u2019 likely performance in a real-world setting. </p> <p>Where the automatic \u2013 and often tough to reverse \u2013 brightening of screens is concerned, the NRDC report was unequivocal.<br></p> <p>\u201cSamsung, LG, and Vizio, which together represent half of all the new televisions sold in the United States, have designed their TVs to disable energy-saving features whenever users change the main picture setting,\u201d the report says.<br></p> <p>When viewers altered their TV\u2019s default settings \u2013 from \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201ccinema\u201d for example \u2013 features such as MDD and automatic brightness control (ABC) were automatically disabled, the report found. </p> <p>With many Samsung TVs, a simple change to the contrast, brightness or backlight settings would disable the MDD feature, without any warning to users. </p> <p>\u201cIf the MDD feature truly was intended to deliver energy savings and potentially reduce eye fatigue when content with certain characteristics is viewed, why would LG and Samsung design their TVs to disable this feature when the user selects a different picture setting?\u201d the report asked. <br></p> <p>Taylor said that LG was currently adding software for consumer notifications to its latest models, which informed consumers that changing picture modes could hike energy consumption rates. </p> <p>\u201cIt also allows consumers to turn on energy saving features in various picture modes,\u201d Taylor said, adding that LG was also planning to enhance the ABC features in its 2017 TV models. </p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to working with the DoE and stakeholders to develop a new test clip going forward,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The NRDC report identifies failings in the current test regime are a significant cause of the poor results in its survey.</p> <p>Chris Calwell, Ecos\u2019s principal researcher said: \u201cThe global standard video clip on which the DoE test method is based is eight years old and needs a major overhaul.

His reporting unfolded as so many other journalists were writing their 50th stories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. It is only in the past week that the Post\u2019s reporting on the Trump Foundation has gained traction. The issue should come up in the first presidential debate Monday, as those \u201cdamn emails\u201d, as Sanders called the over-covered controversy over Clinton\u2019s private email server, surely will. (The Trump campaign, by the way, has claimed that the report is \u201cpeppered with inaccuracies and omissions\u201d.)</p> <p>There is a clear disparity in the attention focused on Clinton\u2019s supposed ethics problems compared with Trump\u2019s. There has been some excellent reporting on everything from Trump University to his business practices, especially the tax breaks he received on real estate deals uncovered by the New York Times. But these revelations seem to roll off Trump\u2019s back, while in the Clintons\u2019 case they create indelible stains.</p> <p>I have covered the nexus of money and politics since 1988. My investigations revealed the twisting of the tax code governing charities by GOP political figures and different Democratic fundraising abuses in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. When it comes to the cesspool of political money, I\u2019ve been an equal-opportunity scrutinizer.</p> <p>I also practically know by heart the tax code governing charitable groups \u2013 section 501C(3) \u2013 and immediately recognize that some of the Trump Foundation\u2019s donations involve unusual interpretations of it, to say the least.</p> <p>For example, when Melania Trump used a Trump Foundation check to purchase the towering (forgive the pun) portrait of her husband, the painting wasn\u2019t donated to a charity but apparently hung in the boardroom of one of her husband\u2019s golf clubs. The more than a quarter of a million dollars of Trump Foundation funds that went to help settle legal disputes included a case involving the height of a flagpole at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida. And the conservative activist group that <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-foundation-citizens-united-donation-eric-schneiderman\">received</a> $100,000 from the Trump Foundation was Citizens United, the group that opposes the disclosure and limitations of political fundraising and is headed by David Bossie, who was recently hired as Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager.</p> <p>Perhaps the most salient thing about the foundation that bears his name is that Donald Trump himself has given a relatively small amount of money to the Trump Foundation and none since 2009, although we won\u2019t know for sure until \u2013 don\u2019t hold your breath \u2013 Trump releases his tax returns. Although there are some legitimate gifts to real charities, it\u2019s unclear what the Foundation actually <em>does</em>.</p> <p>Except for deep explorations by the New Yorker editor David Remnick, the Times\u2019 Amy Chozick and Celia Duggar, and a recent book by Joe Conason, relatively few journalists have looked seriously at the good works of the Clinton Foundation, especially on global health and the environment. The Foundation has given many millions to drive down the cost of anti-retroviral drugs to treat Aids in Africa and Latin America. It helped establish a multi-city fund for better technology to combat global warming and other environmental problems. The list of its projects could fill its own book. When I was managing editor of the Times, Bill Clinton invited a group of us from the paper to his office in Harlem for a barbecue lunch (this was before his heart problems and vegan diet) and spent more than three hours talking to us about the foundation\u2019s work.</p> <p>A separate and much smaller Clinton Family Foundation handles their personal contributions to charities. According to their tax returns, the Clintons as a couple have donated about 10% of Bill and Hillary\u2019s multimillion-dollar incomes in recent years to various well-known charities, more than most super-wealthy people, who give an average of about 3%.</p> <p>Though his vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence, has said that Trump personally contributes \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d to charities, as with so much about Donald Trump, absolutely nothing has been made public to back up the claim. We are just supposed to accept Pence\u2019s word and the statement in a recent CNN interview by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who calls reporters\u2019 questions about his charitable foundation \u201cbadgering\u201d, that Trump is indeed \u201ca very generous man\u201d.</p> <p>Personally generous he may sometimes be. The work of the Trump Foundation, however, is an entirely different question. For journalists, for regulators, for any citizen who cares about the future of this country, this isn\u2019t badgering. It\u2019s an urgent democratic duty. </p>",
  "<p>To get a measure of the wide range of themes and genres covered by the film director Curtis Hanson, who has died aged 71, one need only compare his greatest critical success, LA Confidential (1997), with his biggest commercial hit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/8-mile\" title=\"\">8 Mile</a> (2002). The former is a stylish, 1950s-set noir thriller shot through with ambivalence about Hollywood, which is shown in all its dreamy allure and soul-crushing horror. The latter picture is a semi-gritty star vehicle for the rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/eminem\" title=\"\">Eminem</a> (AKA Marshall Mathers III) which draws on the performer\u2019s own background in its story of a young man who uses hip-hop to escape his insalubrious trailer-park origins.</p> <p>LA Confidential was acclaimed by critics who had believed they did not make them like that any more; Hanson and his co-writer, Brian Helgeland, won an Oscar for their assured adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesellroy\" title=\"\">James Ellroy</a>\u2019s complicated novel and there was another for Kim Basinger for her comeback performance as a prostitute and Veronica Lake lookalike. Praise was slightly fainter for 8 Mile but it grossed $242m worldwide and confirmed that Hanson was both intelligent and commercial.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/21/curtis-hanson-director-of-la-confidential-and-8-mile-dies-aged-71\">Curtis Hanson, Oscar-winning director of LA Confidential, dies aged 71</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He had been making movies since the early 1970s but it was LA Confidential, his ninth film for cinema, which consolidated his talents and made good on his promise. As well as its precise feel for character, place and pacing, it showed him to be a warmly attentive director of actors. He helped make stars of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe\" title=\"\">Russell Crowe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/guy-pearce\" title=\"\">Guy Pearce</a> and gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kevinspacey\" title=\"\">Kevin Spacey</a> one of his best roles as a narcotics detective seduced by Hollywood. Hanson refused to take any credit for the performances. \u201cWhat I try to do is give each actor an environment in which they can do their best work,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they go off and do the mysterious thing that they do.\u201d</p> <p>He conceded, though, that LA Confidential brought him to the attention of other performers keen to vacate their comfort zones. These included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-douglas\" title=\"\">Michael Douglas</a>, whom he directed intriguingly against type as a shambolic blocked novelist in the comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/28/features\" title=\"\">Wonder Boys</a> (2000), and Eminem, who had never acted before (and has not, to date, acted since) but who gave under Hanson\u2019s tutelage an affecting and low-key performance in 8 Mile that was approximately eight miles from his brash on-stage persona.</p> <p>Hanson was born in Reno, Nevada, and raised in Los Angeles by his mother, Beverly, who sold property, and his father, Wilbur, a primary school teacher. He shocked his parents by dropping out of high school and announcing his ambition to become a screenwriter. He took a detour into film journalism and edited the magazine Cinema, which brought him into contact with directors he admired and allowed him to pick up tricks of the trade. He became friends with legendary directors including Don Siegel and Sam Fuller. He later collaborated with Fuller on the screenplay for that director\u2019s last movie, White Dog (1982), an anti-racism drama about a dog trained to attack black people. Newcomer and veteran bashed out the script together in 18 days on matching typewriters in Fuller\u2019s unheated garage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86108dfa8996a70c1d114aff35e1c8670b71d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d86108dfa8996a70c1d114aff35e1c8670b71d63/415_536_2705_1623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curtis Hanson with Eminem, on the set of 8 Mile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Hanson with Eminem, on the set of 8 Mile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He first began writing his own screenplays in the late 1960s. He was hired by the exploitation company AIP (American International Pictures) to write The Dunwich Horror (1970), before making his directing debut on another horror film, Sweet Kill (1972), and becoming one of four directors credited on the zombie movie Evil Town (1977). The starkest proof of Hanson\u2019s talent was his&#xa0;screenplay for the neat, nasty thriller&#xa0;The Silent Partner (1978), about a bank clerk (Elliott Gould) who tries foolishly to profit from a robbery. Alfred&#xa0;Hitchcock was reported to have admired the picture.</p> <p>Hanson directed the children\u2019s martial arts adventure The Little Dragons (1979) and the good-natured coming-of-age comedy Losin\u2019 It (1983), which starred a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise\" title=\"\">Tom Cruise</a>. He wrote Never Cry Wolf (also 1983), about a biologist in the Canadian arctic wilderness, and directed The Children of Times Square (1986), a TV movie about a runaway who turns to crime. But it was The Bedroom Window (1987), a minor Hitchcockian thriller, which began to establish him as a budding master of suspense. He stayed in that genre for Bad Influence (1990), in which a strait-laced man (James Spader) is corrupted by a stranger, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-lowe\" title=\"\">Rob Lowe</a>, and for The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1993), a hit thriller about a diabolical nanny (Rebecca De Mornay).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d879aea8e4fd7751e2347a93436690bc934c5cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d879aea8e4fd7751e2347a93436690bc934c5cf/0_130_2992_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toni Collette, left, and Cameron Diaz in In Her Shoes, an underrated comedy drama which Curtis Hanson directed in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toni Collette, left, and Cameron Diaz in In Her Shoes, an underrated comedy drama which Curtis Hanson directed in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sportsphoto/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The River Wild (1994) was a fascinating attempt to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\" title=\"\">Meryl Streep</a>, as a white-water rafter menaced by a pair of criminals, at the helm of an action movie. The film thrived on a unique exchange: the action genre benefited from an infusion of this esteemed actor\u2019s reputation while Streep herself seemed paradoxically lightened and lifted by the chance to head up a popcorn movie, albeit one of a superior stripe. Hanson did not so much direct her as emancipate her. The pair were reunited on-screen in 2003 when they played husband and wife in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spike-jonze\" title=\"\">Spike Jonze</a>\u2019s bizarre comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/adaptation\" title=\"\">Adaptation</a>.</p> <p>LA Confidential came next and marked an important turning point in Hanson\u2019s career. \u201cRather than being a director for hire as I have been on most of my films, LA Confidential is that one project where I\u2019ve been able to cash in the chips I\u2019ve earned from being lucky enough to have had a couple of financially successful films and saying: \u2018OK,&#xa0;now this is the film that I want to make.\u2019 It\u2019s my most personal movie.

And in the developing world things look even worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/united-nations-unctadwarns-debt-crisis-poor-developing-countries-oil-prices\">UN warns over global fallout from debt crisis in poor countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such is the message from two of the world\u2019s leading economic thinktanks, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). Both their reports on Wednesday were thick with cloud and short on silver lining. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/oecd-does-a-u-turn-over-brexit-warning-as-it-revises-growth-forecast-for-britain\" title=\"\">the OECD believes</a> that Brexit Britain will have a slightly easier time this year \u2013 but that will be followed by a far choppier 2017. And the Unctad report is even more troubling. The biggest single warning it makes is that the world is on the verge of \u201centering a third phase of the financial crisis\u201d. What began in the US subprime housing market before roiling Europe\u2019s governments is likely to rear its head again \u2013 this time in Latin America, Africa and other poor countries. What will do for them, believe the Unctad researchers, is what also did for America and Europe: debt.</p> <p>Much of the cheap money created by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank has been pushed by financial speculators into the higher-yielding markets of South Africa, Brazil and India, among others. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements, the central banks\u2019 central bank, reckon that <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/work483.htm\" title=\"\">$9.8tn was pumped out in foreign bank loans and bonds</a> in the first half-decade after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Unctad calculates that around $7tn of that was pushed through to emerging markets.</p> <p>By any standards, that is a flood of credit \u2013 one that was encouraged by panicky policymakers. Wasn\u2019t it the turn of China and the rest to pick up the slack in the global economy? Except now developing countries are lumbered with a gigantic private debt mountain to pay down. The private, non-financial sector across the developing world has debt service obligations worth nearly 150% of its income. The comparable figure for the developed world, by contrast, is just above 80%. And now developing countries are hobbling along rather than sprinting ahead, while commodity prices have tanked.</p> <p>To make matters worse, companies will typically have borrowed in US dollars and invested in their local currencies \u2013 but the strength of the dollar will make those loans all the harder to repay. This won\u2019t necessarily produce an all-out crisis, although Unctad isn\u2019t the only organisation sounding the alarm. But at the very least it will cause big problems and starve poor countries of much-needed investment. Cash used to pay off loans cannot be put towards new premises, kit, staff. And as the subprime and eurozone debacles have shown, private-sector debts that really can\u2019t be repaid have a nasty habit of ending up on the public balance sheet.</p> <p>The subprime crisis and the eurozone meltdown were both spun as morality tales: foolish borrowers buying houses they had no right to live in, feckless countries wasting euros on empty airports. Not much was said about the lenders. Doubtless it will be the same this time around. But what is really at fault here is an inadequate, unfair, ultimately self-defeating model of globalisation. For decades, the share of GDP going to workers across rich countries has been falling. Rich nations have hacked back social entitlements and public services in order to pay for tax cuts. And, notably in the US and the UK, executives have showered shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks, even while starving their businesses of investment.</p> <p>This same model has been urged on poor countries \u2013 and the result in both the global north and the global south has turned out to be big debt and disappointing growth. In the short term, America and Europe will need to do more to right the global economy, through fiscal stimulus and driving up wages \u2013 even if that causes financiers to protest. In the long run, this failed globalisation needs to be turned into something more sustainable and more inclusive, built on higher wages, robust tax systems and strong public safety nets.</p>",

Here we chronicle the seven ages of his time at the club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/arsene-wenger-arsenal-1966-premier-league-rivals-where-are-they-now\">Twenty years of Wenger: where are the Arsenal manager\u2019s rivals from 1996 now?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Brave New World (1996)</strong></h2> <p>Nobody, least of all the man himself, envisaged the depth of the opportunity ahead when Wenger weighed up the prospect of joining Arsenal in 1996. He gave the offer careful thought in his apartment in Nagoya, where he was living while manager of Grampus Eight. His spell in Japan provided an experience that fascinated him. Far away from the madding crowd of European football, he immersed himself in a culture and in a way of life that was by its nature challenging, engaging, eye-opening, and at times lonely. The work was stimulating. But friends, family and familiarity were almost 10,000km away.</p> <p>The Arsenal opening represented a mighty leap in every way \u2013 professionally, culturally, personally. \u201cI was at a dangerous point and I had to make a decision. I felt that if I didn\u2019t come back now I would stay forever in Japan,\u201d he explained. \u201cAfter two years you get slowly emerged into this spirit. What you miss in Europe is slowly drifting away. I was at a point where I thought, I will make my life here if I don\u2019t come back now.\u201d His wife was pregnant with their daughter. Either they would make the big move to Japan to join him and Wenger would commit to deepening his roots in Asia, or he would return to Europe. In hindsight, this was a sliding doors moment. Who knows how his subsequent decades \u2013 and Arsenal\u2019s \u2013 would have turned out had he taken the other decision?</p> <p>Half a world away in London, his friend, the then Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, awaited Wenger\u2019s choice. From their first chance meeting in 1989, when Wenger was passing through London with some time to kill on the day of a north London derby, Dein had been wowed by this individual who struck him as completely different to the average manager. He first proposed the idea of appointing this clever, worldly Frenchman working in the J-League in 1995, only for his fellow board members to reject it as far too risky. A foreign manager? What an audacious suggestion. There was no evidence to suggest it would work at all.</p> <p>There had been only one experiment with a manager from abroad in the top flight before. Aston Villa hired Dr Josef Venglos (predictably welcomed as \u201cDr Who?\u201d) in 1990. He arrived fresh from coaching Czechoslovakia at the World Cup, a multi-linguist who could communicate in Russian, Portuguese, Spanish and English as well as his native tongue. But a lot was lost in translation and Venglos left after one troubled season narrowly avoiding relegation. Venglos tried to introduce ideas relating to what he called: \u201cThe methodology of training, the analysis of nutrition, recuperation, regeneration and a physiological approach to the game.\u201d Frankly, most of those words sounded like they came from outer space to your average 1990 English dressing room.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/arsene-wenger-arsenal-20-years\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger should have won more but English football owes him a lot | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We now live in an age when the currency of overseas managers in the Premier League has never been higher.

If Tony Adams, Arsenal\u2019s influential captain, felt unsure, then so would everybody else. \u201cThere was a fear of someone else, a fear of change,\u201d Adams remembered, later describing the mood succinctly as \u201ccontempt before investigation\u201d. The general reaction from players, managers, supporters and media across England was pocked with suspicion.</p> <p>Wenger was conscious of it. \u201cI felt quite a lot of scepticism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s normal, especially on an island. This phenomenon is more emphasised on an island because people have historically lived more isolated. They are more cautious about foreign influences.\u201d</p> <p><strong>22 September 1996. </strong>When Wenger made his first public appearance as Arsenal\u2019s new manager, sporting a gaudy club tie and dark blazer, with a press conference at Highbury to formally introduce himself before properly starting work on 1 October, nobody knew quite what to expect. The only other foreign coach working in England had only just been promoted \u2013 Ruud Gullit took over from Glenn Hoddle to become Chelsea\u2019s player-manager during the summer. After \u201cDr Who?\u201d came \u201cArs\u00e8ne Who?\u201d Unlike Gullit, who had a global reputation and was already a familiar face in Premier League football when he was appointed to the Stamford Bridge dugout, Wenger was a virtual unknown.</p> <p>Have a look at the list of managers who began the 1996-97 Premier League season:</p> <p>Brian Little (Aston Villa), Ray Harford (Blackburn), Gullit (Chelsea), Ron Atkinson (Coventry), Jim Smith (Derby), Joe Royle (Everton), George Graham (Leeds United), Martin O\u2019Neill (Leicester) Roy Evans (Liverpool), Alex Ferguson (Manchester United), Bryan Robson (Middlesbrough), Kevin Keegan (Newcastle), Frank Clark (Nottingham Forest), David Pleat (Sheffield Wednesday), Graeme Souness (Southampton), Peter Reid (Sunderland), Gerry Francis (Tottenham), Harry Redknapp (West Ham), Joe Kinnear (Wimbledon).</p> <p>Old school, to say the least.

This rangy and athletic young midfielder \u2013 another Frenchman few in England knew anything about \u2013 was signed all of a sudden from Milan and represented a sort of advanced party before Wenger was freed from his commitments in Japan to start work with Arsenal. Actually it was more of an advanced present. Vieira made his debut midway through the first half of a modest performance against Sheffield Wednesday at Highbury under the caretaker control of Pat Rice. He came on and it was a shining lightbulb moment. Dennis Bergkamp, who was injured and watching from the sidelines, felt the crackling energy sweeping through dear old Highbury. \u201cWhen he came on he changed the game. He completely changed the game!\u201d the Dutchman recalls. \u201cAnd I think everyone in the stadium was thinking, \u2018What happened here? Did I really see it right?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Having been pedestrian and workmanlike in midfield for a few years \u2013 it certainly wasn\u2019t the team\u2019s most refined department \u2013 Vieira\u2019s appearance made a vital impression. He represented something fresh and different. As Wenger said: \u201cHe is the man who gave me the first credibility. It was a shock to people. He was like a genie from the lamp.\u201d</p> <p>Although life at Arsenal was about to change radically, Wenger did not want to be too judgmental or impose too much of a revolution without taking his time to look around and assess everybody.</p> <p><strong>1 October 1996. </strong>Wenger\u2019s first official day at work was spent at the training ground. Over the next two seasons he would introduce a range of new ideas. Some were based on science \u2013 everything from discouraging chocolate bars on the team coach, revising dietary habits and liquid intake (not only what you ate and drank but how you took it on board) and introducing stretching regimes and fitness specialists. Some were based on style of play, and short to-the-point training sessions designed to create the template for football that was both powerful and expressive. A knack for signing perfect players to fit the new jigsaw helped. In came quality of the calibre of Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka, whose pace frightened the life out of opposition defenders, and Emmanuel Petit, whose defensive instincts and long passes made him the ideal midfield foil for Vieira. All these ingredients whirled together to create a winning blend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6344286a77359abe0da1c33b6e89a55857ae5c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6344286a77359abe0da1c33b6e89a55857ae5c5f/0_26_1632_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Adams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Adams celebrates scoring a stunning volley in Arsenal\u2019s 4-0 win over Everton to seal the 1997-98 title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Bergkamp, the arrival of Wenger built a bridge between the football of his past, his education in the Dutch ideals of total football, and the never-say-die English football attitudes that were embodied by Arsenal\u2019s steely back four. There was a kind of symbiosis. Consider how Bergkamp absorbed the toughness which helped him to electrify the Premier League, or how Adams had the freedom to burst on to a chipped pass from Steve Bould to score with an impeccable volley.</p> <p>It all came together beautifully in Wenger\u2019s first full season as Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup double. There was something almost serene about how his team glided towards the honours at the end of the season. Wenger is acutely aware of the manifold complications football throws up, but just sometimes, and the finale to the 1997-98 double was one of those times, he has been able to experience the rare glow that transcends all the pressures. \u201cOf course. It happens when you feel your team is a really happy unit playing the game and enjoying it. Not distracted by any selfishness or any anxiety about the result. It\u2019s like you lead 3-0, everybody is up behind the team, they express themselves, they still respect the game. That\u2019s it. It sometimes lasts three, two, or one minute. It\u2019s so short, but you would battle forever to experience that again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/sep/22/arsene-wenger-20-years-arsenal-in-his-own-words\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's 20 years at Arsenal \u2013 in pictures and his own words</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The Wonder Years (1998-2006)</strong></h2> <p>Wenger\u2019s first decade yielded convincing, regular success. It was not without its towering disappointments. In between the doubles of 1998 and 2002 were three frustrating seasons of being close but not winning. They were league runners-up each season behind domestic rivals Manchester United, and also lost a bunch of painful semi-finals and finals. The rivalry with Alex Ferguson\u2019s team was intense and compelling.</p> <p>But overall, during the period between 1996 and 2006, Arsenal won the Premier League three times, FA Cup four times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/18/match.championsleague\">reached the Champions League final</a> for the first time in their history and went through the 2003-04 league campaign undefeated. It was an era to bear comparison with the dominance masterminded by Herbert Chapman in the 1930s.</p> <p>A decade of high achievement is what the subsequent Wenger years are inevitably measured against. Recall of that time is important not only for the substance but also the aesthetic style. A team that had Thierry Henry in his prime leading the charge, with the artistry espoused by Bergkamp, Robert Pir\u00e8s, Freddie Ljungberg, Vieira, Kanu and company buzzing around the pitch (not to forget a toughened defence that took every goal conceded as an affront), won many admirers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:43:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:43:45/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Although he is not a man who naturally enjoys looking back, making history with the \u201cInvincibles\u201d, the team that didn\u2019t lose a single league game, is a highlight that meant a great deal to him personally. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/17/arsenal-invincible-season-arsene-wenger-inside-story\">\u201cIt was one of my dreams,\u201d</a> he said. \u201cI learned that you can achieve things that you think are not achievable.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger\u2019s time at Arsenal has coincided with the globalisation of the game, and creating an imprint, an identity \u2013 one that was in opposition to the \u201cBoring Arsenal\u201d tag they had carried for years \u2013 is something he is quietly proud of. \u201cSometimes when I speak to foreign coaches and ask about a player and they say, \u2018This is not an Arsenal player\u2019 this is the biggest compliment you can get,\u201d Wenger said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2f4042942043e453417bea9026335bc3ca676e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2f4042942043e453417bea9026335bc3ca676e7/0_181_2829_1697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\u2019s \u2018Invincibles\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s \u2018Invincibles\u2019 celebrate winning the title in May 2004, having gone through the season unbeaten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, in the process of 20 years not every transfer ended up in that this-is-an-Arsenal-player bracket. On the one hand Sol Campbell, on the other Igors Stepanovs. One hand Robin van Persie, the other Francis Jeffers. But Wenger got more than enough right in that opening decade to be brilliantly successful. It was a heck of a benchmark to live up to.</p> <h2><strong>Men Against Boys (2006-2013)</strong></h2> <p>Coincidentally or not, in splitting the Wenger years into two contrasting halves, the mid-point is the significant moment Arsenal relocated. Wenger loved Highbury. Even now, sometimes, this man who does not easily give in to the sentimental makes a diversion when he is driving to or from the Emirates and stops outside the old East Stand facade on Avenell Road to remember.</p> <p>But moving always felt, to him, imperative for the club to push forward. Having revolutionised the training facilities first of all by planning for a modern headquarters to be built (he went every day to the site at London Colney to check on the progress and is particularly fond of the fact they planted 280,500 trees), the complex question of Highbury\u2019s small capacity required considerable thought.</p> <p>When Arsenal decided to leave their ancestral home and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/26/arsenal.paolobandini\">prepare for a move</a> that would in the end cost around \u00a3400m, Wenger knew and accepted that for a time it would compromise his team. What he did not know was that all Arsenal\u2019s plans would be thrown by the impact of oligarchs and billionaires landing suddenly to transform the football landscape. Arsenal\u2019s belt-tightening coincided with lavish spending elsewhere. \u201cYou feel like you have stones against machine guns,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know that. They just want you to win the championship.\u201d That period turned out to be more challenging than the club ever anticipated.</p> <p>Wenger\u2019s plan to sail the choppy waters with a modestly priced boat compared to the Premier League\u2019s financial powerhouses was to pin his faith on youth. The idea was brave: find the best young players you can, inculcate them with some club spirit, and develop a team that grows together and feels loyalty to one another and the cause.</p> <p>It nearly worked. Cesc F\u00e0bregas in his youth was sensational. In the group that included Van Persie, Samir Nasri and Abou Diaby, Wenger was sure he had enough talent to compete.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T16:09:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T16:09:16/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But project youth crumbled. It was perhaps the lowest blow for Wenger. The damage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/15/barcelona-cesc-fabregas-arsenal-tears\">when F\u00e0bregas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/26/samir-nasri-money-manchester-city\">Nasri left</a>, followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/manchester-united-robin-van-persie-everton\">by Van Persie</a>, was felt keenly. Wenger felt a very personal sense of loss. The ideology he believed in collapsed around him. Just before the stream of high-profile departures, while he fought to stem the tide, he admitted that the message it would send if they left was too great. \u201cYou cannot pretend you are a big club,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was hard to take, particularly for someone who likes to manage with a strong emphasis on the human side of his players. Although it hurt, and other managers may well have been more ruthless in blocking moves, rightly or wrongly Wenger always tried to recognise that if a player wanted to go, it was time to let them go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ac45b77bb045cd72cb4e96ac7cc0fefc105785e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ac45b77bb045cd72cb4e96ac7cc0fefc105785e/0_53_2142_1285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesc F\u00e0bregas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger sought to rebuild around youngsters such as Cesc F\u00e0bregas, pictured here in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vulnerabilities in his team during these moments made it so tough to compete with the best around. The soft centre, the free-form style that on a bad day fell foul of well-organised opponents, the one or two elite players short they usually found themselves. Wenger bore the brunt of all the problems.</p> <h2><strong>A Second Coming (2014-15)</strong></h2> <p>How is your glass \u2013 half-full or half- empty? Depending on your perspective, the difficult, trophyless years provoked mockery and scorn or a quiet respect for the bigger picture. Several times during his Arsenal tenure Wenger could have left for other clubs. He never did. He stayed put, earning a handsome salary but also absorbing the flak. Why? Because he believes in an idea that is about more than honours for the CV. He started the project to see Arsenal over their expensive move, and he wanted to finish it. Whether he will or not is a question that frequently causes ripples in the fanbase. Is he the man to take the club back to the position they were in during the first decade of Wengerian Arsenal? Can he ever get them back to title-winning standards? There have been occasional close attempts, but no bullseye.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/22/match.sport1\">winning the FA Cup in 2005</a>, the last honour of part one of his tenure, Wenger endured moments of immense pressure and blame. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/28/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league1\">8-2 defeat at Manchester United in August 2011</a> was deeply humiliating. There were a cluster of those calamities in recent seasons, piercingly bad defeats that allowed Mourinho to deliver that cutting \u201cspecialist in failure\u201d line.</p> <p>\u201cThe immense importance of football is sometimes scary,\u201d Wenger said in his early days at Arsenal, admitting how it can be overwhelming to carry the burden of expectancy for a big club. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win you are responsible for so many unhappy people. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to think about it because it could damage your life too much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b10e805c500fc9c739ccafd9d655fd3d42a99cae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b10e805c500fc9c739ccafd9d655fd3d42a99cae/0_36_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger looks on during Arsenal\u2019s 8-2 defeat by Manchester United in August 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to survive. I don\u2019t go out at all. I stay at home and try to do my best for the club. But of course in bad moments, when you play away and you lose and you see after the game all those fans who travelled for 500 miles or 1,000 miles in Europe, and spend a lot of money, you feel that atmosphere. There is a strange vibration in the street when you lose at home. You feel responsible. But you cannot survive if you only feel that \u2013 you\u2019ll kill yourself. The professional aspect always takes over. \u2018Why did we lose? What did I do wrong?\u2019 But you can\u2019t just wipe out those moments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:45:31/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:45:31/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Set against that analysis, it was meaningful when Wenger finally experienced the relief of winning again. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/17/arsenal-hull-city-fa-cup-final-match-report\">FA Cup final in 2014 against Hull City</a> was a rollercoaster. Going 2-0 down was, he said, \u201csurreal\u201d because the thought of losing when carrying so much expectation was unthinkable. Arsenal rallied and won the Cup 3-2 in extra time. \u201cWinning was an important moment in the life of the team. When it comes after a long time it sometimes comes with suffering,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe had such a feeling of relief and happiness.\u201d The following year they retained the trophy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/fa-cup-final-arsenal-aston-villa-alexis-sanchez\">with a swashbuckling performance</a>.</p> <p>The graph was back on an upward curve. Silverware, and the ability to attract a higher calibre of player made a difference. When Wenger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/mesut-ozil-arsenal-real-madrid\">recruited Mesut \u00d6zil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/10/alexis-sanchez-signs-arsenal\">Alexis S\u00e1nchez</a>, signings that were out of their league in the drifting years, it was like suddenly buying a Porsche.

Now it is September 2016. He has had to roll with some heavyweight punches but has never come close to stepping out of the ring. What keeps him there is the feeling in his gut that keeps him obsessed by trying to win.</p> <p>\u201cI can only survive if I have that desire to win,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you only fight to win that means you have to forget your life first and foremost. You feel you have more chance to win if you concentrate every part of your energy on doing that. If you lose a day by not concentrating on that you feel guilty. The years and the years and the years teach you that every small detail can make you win or lose. Once you are convinced of that you cannot allow yourself to relax any more because you think, \u2018Maybe I am making a mistake at the moment because I am not thinking about how I can win the next game.\u2019 You become a winning animal. Somewhere you slowly forget your own life. I think any manager can only be happy if he wins. We all live desperate for it, and everybody will do everything to win. It\u2019s not a regret, it\u2019s just an explanation of how the life of a manager is.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever his critics make of him, he retains the full support of his club\u2019s majority owner, Stan Kroenke, and the board. Their faith in him has not wavered. In Arsenal\u2019s broader diaspora there is black, white and every shade of grey whenever there is discussion about Wenger\u2019s ways. Some supporters frustrated by the ratio between high ticket prices and club honours vent their spleen and hold up banners. Others feel a sense of loyalty and affection for a man who has given a lot of himself to the club during his tenure. Many are stuck in the middle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"492601d6398cd2adc4553da08f3705724c8ae259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492601d6398cd2adc4553da08f3705724c8ae259/425_0_2065_1239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger feels the strain during his side\u2019s 4-3 defeat by Liverpool on the opening weekend of this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also a range of emotions among ex-players, men who in some cases grew up while playing in one of Wenger\u2019s teams, and experienced defining moments of their careers in that time. It is curious that Wenger prefers to keep a professional distance with some of the greats who are starting out in coaching \u2013 Vieira, Henry, Bergkamp are among those who would have loved to return to work at the club but for whatever reason the invitations have not quite worked out. Others will never hear a word against him. Pir\u00e8s is at the training ground most days. Ray Parlour tells stories with enormous warmth that show another side to the man who can often appear reserved in front of the post-match TV camera.</p> <p>What the majority do not see is the personal side of Wenger, and the qualities that have kept him in the same job for so long. His keen intellect, his sense of trust in those around him (sometimes arguably too much trust), his dedication and his humour all make the man. He is very funny and has no problems laughing at himself. \u201cHe is such a clever man with such a knack at understanding people. But he could also be a walking disaster,\u201d said Parlour. \u201cHe would do something accidentally every day.\u201d He could get tangled up in the nets, drop the pudding off his plate without noticing, or join in a squad relaxation technique but lie with his legs up against a partition wall rather than a solid one and roll straight through it.</p> <h2><strong>The Future (2016-?) </strong></h2> <p>As The Bard wrote: \u201cOne man in his time plays many parts.\u201d After 20 years there is no single perception of Wenger and his time.</p> <p>We look today at the tall, wiry frame, sometimes bearing that strained expression when things are not going well, at others more urbane, with a ready wry smile and dry one-liner. In the current era of incessant managerial scrutiny, where millions of armchair managers give the impression of knowing better \u2013 something that occasionally provokes Wenger to dismiss the nerve of critics who cast judgment when they have never managed a single game \u2013 the pressure is relentless. But rest assured he goes home knowing that the biggest critic, the force who applies the harshest pressure, is the man in the mirror.</p> <p>Because of the sheer weight of a 20-year marriage, it is natural to veer between periods of joy and frustration, lurch from moments of absolute faith to fierce doubt. Naturally most opinions are shaped by what is going on now. Today\u2019s Wengerometer clearly does not hit the heights it has in the past. His Arsenal is a story in two acts. The first delivered wondrous success. The second has been complicated \u2013 maybe even so complicated, lasting a decade in itself, that many have forgotten how striking act one actually was.</p> <p>The last act is yet to be written. His current deal expires at the end of this season and, as with all his other contracts, the only person who will decide if he signs another, walks away, moves upstairs, or tries something completely different is him. It is, as Wenger says, the club of his life. \u201cWhat I like about Arsenal, and I am very proud of, is that the club is a mixture of respecting traditional values while not being scared to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the last 15 to 20 years you have all of that \u2013 fantastic periods, difficult periods \u2013 I stayed here for the respect I have for all that.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens and whenever it happens to end this collaboration between manager and club, Wenger is the last of his kind. The average timespan for a manager in England\u2019s professional game is currently 13 months. We will not see a 20-year boss at elite level again.</p>",
  "<p>Booking Morrissey to end your festival is the same as betting on George Jones or Axl Rose or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/09/lauryn-hill-two-hours-late-for-concert-because-of-need-to-align-her-energies\">Lauryn Hill</a> or any other artist from both the past and present known for not owning a wristwatch. For them, time is an illusion, to paraphrase Einstein. The audience, hapless chumps.</p> <p>It turns out that Morrissey did show up at Riot Fest in Chicago on Saturday, but the audience was held in suspension. Thirty-five minutes of videos were broadcast on the big screen featuring Morrissey favorites the Sex Pistols, Clash, New York Dolls, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM6nWRXCQD8\">Anne Sexton reading a suicide poem</a> and some mild gay erotica. The booing started 10 minutes in, followed by groans each time a new video started. When the singer did appear, the videos had sucked up about a third of his scheduled set-time, leaving a brisk 70 minutes. That would have to do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/13/misfits-reunion-glenn-danzig-jerry-only-pop-punk\">The Misfits \u2013 five reasons to welcome their reunion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrissey\u2019s 17-song set drew heavily on his solo work of the last 10 years. He sang, not as if his life depended on it nor as if, in light of a recent cancer scare, they promised any new revelations. Instead the singer cruised through the setlist, his voice solid but not robust. He nodded to his Latino audience with a Spanish version of Speedway and, maybe just a habit now, ending every song with \u201c<em>gracias</em>\u201d.</p> <p>Then, midway through the set, he offered a tour through international relations. \u201cIn England, we have a new prime minister who nobody voted for,\u201d he said before launching into Irish Blood, English Heart. Then, in introducing World Peace is None of Your Business, he chided the failure of the Bernie Sanders campaign, saying the Democratic presidential nominee \u201cwas the only one who said \u2018no more war\u2019\u201d. Finally, during The World is Full of Crushing Bores a comic stock photo of Prince William and Kate Middleton sat overhead with the inscription, The United King-Dumb.</p> <p>His five-member band, powered by Chicagoan Matt Walker on drums, played with drive and ferocity but their singer, aside from one or two lassoings of the microphone cord, seemed not as charged up as the material. A single Smiths song (What She Said) was reserved for the closer but only after he assured the audience that \u201ca time restriction\u201d forced him to end his set after the next song. Not taking responsibility for holding things up? This guy could run for US president. </p> <p>Omitted from the set was Meat is Murder, the Smiths signature that he continues to revive in support of his avowed veganism. Maybe playing the song in Chicago, once home to the Union Stock Yards for nearly a century, would have hit too close to home. The people here like their sausage. But then again, Morrissey did demand that all food vendors end meat sales for two hours during his scheduled performance, which meant food lines were swelled up to his set by people not wanting to go home hungry. </p> <p>The focus of <a href=\"http://riotfest.org/\">Riot Fest</a>, which is held in Douglas Park on the city\u2019s Southwest Side, is punk: old punk bands, new ones, bands with punk sensibilities, punk veterans gone solo, and artists who simply have a peak level of insurgency in their music. The annual festival, also held in Denver, is now the bookend to Chicago\u2019s summer music season and deserves credit for finding new ways to stay true to its unifying theme. This year, about 45,000 people attended the three-day festival that, unlike most, was filled with bands that mostly operate outside the charts but instead have achieved success by grooming loyal audiences for years. </p> <p>Earlier on Saturday were tighter, leaner sets, most notably by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/apr/09/10-of-the-best-bob-mould-husker-du\">Bob Mould</a> who fired through his catalog, ranging from his recent album to five H\u00fcsker D\u00fc tracks, a total of 18 songs in an hour. Dressed in a checkerboard suit, Pelle Almqvist of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/hives\">the Hives</a> suggested a kind of Swedish Iggy Pop as he strutted, jumped and crouched low, bringing high theater to such minimal rock. The band that easily complemented the wide-open parkland environment was New York\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fightoffyourdemons.com/\">Brand New</a>. The band played against expectations as an emo originator and instead emerged as a mixture of U2 and Modest Mouse due to anthems that sounded tailored to the masses but with still enough idiosyncrasies to keep the music shifting through different moods and time signatures.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s headliner was billed as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/13/misfits-reunion-glenn-danzig-jerry-only-pop-punk\">Original Misfits</a> \u2013 surely a name thought up by a legal team \u2013 as the band featured only Misfits lead singer Glenn Danzig, original bassist Jerry Only and later guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. The horror punk originators have dealt with decades of incarnations and legal battles, which gives this final phase a sense of closure, even though it was a strange one.</p> <p>For their first seven years, the Misfits were an underground band that played adolescent punk about UFOs, alienation, the Kennedy family and fantasy violence while dressed as ghouls straight out of Universal horror films. Now as men hovering around 60, they still dressed as ghouls, with Danzig encased in black leather, but there was creakiness in the music. Despite long pauses between songs that gave the band a chance to regroup, the band ran through a crisp 26 songs in just 75 minutes, each one a jolt of manic energy. Two giant-sized pumpkins flanked the band as they ripped through classics Horror Business, We Are 138 and Skulls that reflected not just why this band created its own subgenre back in the day, but how they set the stage for Metallica and others to bring it into the stadiums.</p>",
  "<p>Rome\u2019s mayor has announced her opposition to Italy\u2019s bid to host the Olympic Games in 2024, in a move that is likely to mean the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/15/rome-olympic-bid-corruption-recession-matteo-renzi\">the capital\u2019s ambitious campaign</a>.</p> <p>Virginia Raggi, who was elected in June and has faced a tumultuous start to her tenure, said in a highly anticipated press conference that it would be irresponsible to move forward with the bid, given the debts that it would accrue and the burdens it would place on Roman taxpayers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/rio-de-janeiro-returns-to-normal-world-cup-olympics-paralympics\">Rio de Janeiro returns to normal after marathon of mega events</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are effectively asking the people of Rome and of Italy to shoulder the debts. We just don\u2019t support it,\u201d Raggi said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The announcement will add to concerns that the Olympic Games are increasingly being viewed with scepticism by potential host cities who worry about costs, environmental concerns, and the objections of local citizens.</p> <p>While the Roma 2024 campaign has not formally abandoned its bid, organisers had already suggested that the mayor\u2019s support would be necessary to continue. The move leaves Paris, Los Angeles and Budapest in contention. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/27/boston-mayor-2024-olympic-bid-doubt\">Boston</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/09/2024-olympics-why-hamburg-no-hosting\">Hamburg</a>, two other early potential candidates, have already pulled out.</p> <p>The decision was not surprising because Raggi had already signalled during her election campaign that she did not support the Olympic bid. Her party, the Five Star Movement, is vehemently opposed to unwieldy infrastructure projects and initiatives that are seen as vanity projects that come at a high cost to taxpayers.</p> <p>The decision came at a time when Raggi has come under pressure to right the course of her administration following a series of personnel issues, and when Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi, who enthusiastically launched the bid in December 2014, is facing a difficult referendum this autumn that could \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 end his career in politics.</p> <p>Renzi had launched the Olympic bid even though Rome at the time found itself at the centre of a series of public corruption scandals that came to be known as Mafia Capitale, raising questions about whether it could pull off a \u201cclean\u201d Olympics.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t allow our problems to stop us from dreaming,\u201d he said in 2014.</p> <p>For proponents of the bid, the idea of hosting the Olympic Games, while daunting, was seen as a way for the city to unite around a lofty goal, and a way to give the city the motivation necessary to pull off a huge global event that could return the city to the glory days of La Dolce Vita.</p> <p>If Renzi\u2019s view was too optimistic, then Raggi\u2019s may have sounded a bit too downtrodden. The 38-year-old lawyer said the city was still paying debts it had accrued for the Games in 1960, and would not stand for more \u201ccathedrals in the desert\u201d \u2013 abandoned stadiums \u2013 that the city could ill afford.</p> <p>\u201cThe Olympics are a dream that turn into a nightmare. I don\u2019t have all the facts about Rio, but we have the image in our eyes of the citizens of Rio,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The day included a touch of drama after Italy\u2019s Olympic Committee president, Giovanni Malago, who was supposed to meet with Raggi before the press conference, left city hall in a huff after complaining that he had waited for her for half an hour but that she had not showed up.</p>",
  "<p>Emily Blunt, the actor who stars in the film adaptation of The Girl on the Train, has called for greater compassion when it comes to a woman\u2019s choice \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 to have a family. </p> <p>Speaking in London on Wednesday, Blunt, 33, said: \u201cI think we all need to be much kinder to each other, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman.\u201d Expanding on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/emily-blunt-mummy-cult-leads-cruelty-between-women\">comments given at the world premiere on Tuesday</a> about a potential competitiveness between women, Blunt added: </p> <p>\u201cThere is a tendency in women towards being a bit judgmental of each other, particularly in the domestic environment.

The role appealed, she said, because it was so repellent. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so unusual to have your lead protagonist be female and a blackout drunk,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are often required to be an ideal of some description: pretty or likeable or witty.

And so when she decided to go back to work it was a massive decision. Whereas I [was] rather fortunate.\u201d</p> <p>Continued Blunt: \u201cI think having children has been wonderful in that it cracks your heart open in so many ways.

  "<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation into ExxonMobil over how the fossil fuel giant has valued its assets in the wake of falling oil prices and increasing climate change-related regulations.<br></p> <p>The company has confirmed that the US\u2019s top financial watchdog is seeking information on its financial reporting. Documents have been sought from Exxon as well as its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p> <p>\u201cWe are fully complying with the SEC request for information and are confident our financial reporting meets all legal and accounting requirements,\u201d said an Exxon spokesman. </p> <p>According <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-exxon-on-valuing-of-assets-accounting-practices-1474393593\">to the Wall Street Journal</a>, Exxon is the only major energy producer that hasn\u2019t lowered its valuations since oil prices fell two years ago. Shares in Exxon fell by 1.5% to $82.54 on Tuesday, before <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/xom\">rallying slightly on Wednesday morning</a>.</p> <p>The SEC investigation will also look at what Exxon has told investors about its assets in the context of growing international action on climate change. Last year, it was revealed that Exxon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding\">knew about climate change as early as 1981</a>, only to spend millions of dollars in the following decades to deny its existence. Its intervention on the issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/exxonmobil-climate-change-scientists-congress-george-w-bush\">extended into the early days of the George W Bush presidency</a>.</p> <p>The attorney generals of New York and Massachusetts have both opened investigations into whether Exxon misled investors. They have, in turn, been subpoenaed by Lamar Smith, chairman of Congress\u2019 science committee, to hand over details of their investigations. </p> <p>Smith, a climate change sceptic who has also subpoenaed government scientists\u2019 communications, has accused the attorney generals of a political witch-hunt and for causing a \u201cchilling impact on scientific research and development\u201d. The office of New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has called Smith\u2019s intervention \u201cremarkable\u201d and an overreach of federal authority.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a remarkably important development - the federal government is joining the courageous state attorneys general, and they\u2019re all following the trail of clues that began with powerful investigative journalism,\u201d said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group <a href=\"http://350.org/\">350.org</a>.<br><br>\u201cBefore they\u2019re done we\u2019ll understand considerably more about how the world overheated. But in the meantime, every institution that invests in Exxon should take real note of who you\u2019re keeping company with.\u201d<br></p> <p>Exxon is also being investigated by Nigeria\u2019s economic and financial crimes commission after it secured oil rights in the African nation despite apparently underbidding a Chinese rival bid by $2.25bn. </p> <p>The oil industry\u2019s knowledge of dangerous climate change <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968\">stretches back to the 1960s</a>, with unearthed documents showing that it was warned of \u201cserious worldwide environmental changes\u201d more than 45 years ago.</p> <p>The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute in 1968 that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry an array of harmful consequences for the planet.</p>",
  "<p>The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has backtracked on its warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>vote and has thrown its weight behind plans by Theresa May to provide fresh post-referendum support to growth in November\u2019s autumn statement.</p> <p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which issued strong warnings about the likely impact of a vote to leave the EU ahead of the 23 June vote, has revised up its forecast for growth this year as a result of a stronger-than expected performance in the first half of 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">action by the Bank of England</a> in August to spur activity. </p> <p>Until recently a staunch supporter of George Osborne\u2019s austerity plan, the OECD said it was appropriate for the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, to increase public spending in his first major policy statement later this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/philip-hammond-chancellor-worried-electorate-oecd-advice-spend-uk-brexit\">Philip Hammond too worried about votes to heed OECD's advice to spend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It said it was still predicting a sharp slowdown in the economy, but that this would not happen until 2017. It said that the expected negative effects on the rest of the global economy of the Brexit vote \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/brexit-could-spread-shockwaves-trough-global-economy-says-oecd\">compared in June to the equivalent of a hard landing for China </a>\u2013 had also been delayed.<br></p> <p>The referendum result had led to high volatility in financial markets and a rise in uncertainty, the OECD said in its interim economic outlook.</p> <p>\u201cWhile markets have since stabilised, sterling has depreciated by around 10% in trade-weighted terms since the referendum. For 2016, GDP growth has been supported by a strong performance prior to the referendum, even though business investment contracted.</p> <p>\u201cDevelopments to date are broadly consistent with the more moderate scenarios set out prior to the referendum and reflect prompt action by the Bank of England in August. However, GDP is projected to slow to 1% in 2017, well below the pace in recent years and forecasts prior to the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cSpillovers to the global economy, notably the euro area, have been modest so far, including through confidence and financial markets weighing on investment; more negative effects on the euro area are likely to become apparent in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The OECD\u2019s current assessment contrasts with the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/economy/to-brexit-or-not-to-brexit-a-taxing-decision.htm\">comments made by its secretary general Angel Gurria in April </a>when he said: \u201cFrom the moment of a Brexit vote until the arrangements for \u2018divorce\u2019 are definitively settled \u2013 years later there would be heightened economic uncertainty, with damaging consequences. Brexit would lead to a sell-off of assets and a sharp rise in risk premia. Consumer confidence would fall, as would business confidence and investment, thus holding back growth.\u201d<br></p> <p>Catherine Mann, the OECD\u2019s chief economist said it was premature to say there would be no possible consequences for the UK from Brexit and that its pre-referendum estimates had taken no account of possible policy changes by the Bank of England and the Treasury.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we made our forecasts we did not presume to speak about what the Bank of England might do. The Bank entered the market forcibly on interest rates and to calm the markets,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNor did we presume to make any judgements about what fiscal policy might do,\u201d she added, noting that Hammond had signalled higher public spending in the autumn statement. \u201cIt all adds up to appropriate policy support.\u201d</p> <p>The OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 1.8% this year, a 0.1 point increase on its pre-referendum estimate, but then fall by more than it had previously envisaged. It also shaved its world growth estimates for both 2016 and 2017 by 0.1 point, to 2.9% and 3.2% respectively.</p> <p>Mann said it was right to say that the OECD, hitherto a strong supporter of austerity policies in the UK and elsewhere in the developed world, was \u201cchanging its tune\u201d.</p> <p>She said there were three reasons for the rethink: countries had implemented a lot of austerity; global growth was flat-lining, and ultra-low interest rates had created conditions in which governments could borrow cheaply.</p> <p>Action was needed to lift the global economy out of a low-growth trap, she said. \u201cThe spiral is not upwards, it is downwards. Downwards on trade, downwards on productivity, downwards on global growth.\u201d</p> <p>The OECD fears that weak growth, stagnant living standards and rising inequality are eroding support for globalisation and making it harder for governments to pursue structural reforms.<br></p> <p>\u201cAll countries have room to restructure their spending and tax policies towards a more growth-friendly mix by increasing hard and soft infrastructure spending, and using fiscal measures to support structural reforms\u201d the interim outlook said. </p> <p>\u201cConcrete instruments include greater spending on well-targeted active labour market programmes and basic research, which should benefit both short-term demand, longer-term supply, and help to make growth more inclusive.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Like medical centres across India\u2019s sweltering capital, the Kalawati Saran hospital in north Delhi is bearing the brunt of an outbreak of mosquito-borne disease.</p> <p>Entire families are camped out in its corridors, alongside stocks of food and water. Women sleep nearly 20 to a room on mats inside the neonatal ward. Outside, a bin overflows with rubbish and a stray dog shuffles up the stairs. </p> <p>Few people wear masks and even fewer use foot covers, which might keep Delhi\u2019s incorrigible dust from entering treatment rooms.</p> <p>Hospitals such as Kalawati, a government facility providing vital free care to Delhi\u2019s poorest, are ground zero for antibiotic-resistant superbugs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/un-declaration-antibiotic-drug-resistance\">described at the UN general assembly this week</a> as the biggest threat to modern medicine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/un-declaration-antibiotic-drug-resistance\">UN agrees to fight 'the biggest threat to modern medicine': antibiotic resistance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowhere is the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4775002/\">as stark as in India</a>, researchers say.</p> <p>One of the resistance-enabling enzymes that most concerns doctors was discovered to be rampant in Delhi in 2008, and named after the city: NDM-1. It has <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/New-Delhi-superbug-spreads-to-70-countries-across-the-world/articleshow/48998960.cms\">since spread</a> to 70 countries around the world.</p> <p>But poor conditions inside some Indian hospitals, cities and villages are only part of the problem. A 2010 study found Indians were <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-becomes-worlds-largest-consumer-of-antibiotics/articleshow/38251650.cms\">the largest consumers of antibiotics</a> in the world, and the Indian Medical Association has estimated that about 50% of prescriptions might be <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/IMA-asks-doctors-not-to-prescribe-antibiotics-for-common-cold/articleshow/50700508.cms\">inappropriate or unnecessary</a>. </p> <p>\u201cDoctors try to be on the cautious side, so they usually prescribe antibiotics for conditions where it is not required,\u201d says Dr Ajay Kumar, a senior specialist in paediatrics at Kalawati Saran. </p> <p>There are also financial incentives: doctors routinely receive commissions from drug companies for prescribing particular medicines.<br></p> <p>Over-prescribing isn\u2019t limited to hospitals. At a pharmacy close to Kalawati Saran, it was possible on Wednesday to buy the antibiotic Nflox-TZ without a prescription \u2013 just a vague description of a stomach ache. The pharmacist agreed to sell a single strip \u2013 half the full course \u2013 for about 69 rupees (80p).</p> <p>Hundreds of strips and packages of antibiotic were also being sold, seemingly without prescription, from the rows of pharmacy stalls opposite the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), a major hospital in south Delhi.</p> <p>But cracking down on antibiotic use, or making the drugs more expensive, would have its own toll: more Indians still die for lack of access to the powerful medicines than from their overuse.</p> <p>Delhi\u2019s newborns often bear the brunt of poor conditions and antibiotic overuse. <a href=\"file:///Users/michael_safi/Downloads/PIIS2214109X16301486.pdf\">A landmark study</a> published in the Lancet last week followed 13,530 babies admitted into intensive care units in the city\u2019s three largest hospitals, and found an \u201calarming degree\u201d of antibiotic resistance.</p> <p>Nearly 500 babies died from sepsis, many contracting the disease from the bacteria <em>acinetobacter</em>. Of those, 82% simply could not be treated by any known antibiotic. </p> <p>\u201cWe are now staring at overwhelming evidence of rampant antibiotic resistance, across all ages, all over the country,\u201d Dr Vinod Paul, the chief of paediatrics at AIIMS, <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/babies-fall-victim-to-antibiotic-resistance/article9112101.ece\">told the Hindu newspaper</a>. </p> <p>Awareness campaigns have proliferated among India\u2019s medical establishment to persuade doctors to prescribe alternatives. \u201cWe don\u2019t use antibiotics indiscriminately, and we closely monitor the common bugs, and which antibiotics would be best to treat it,\u201d says Kumar, from Kalawati Saran. </p> <p>\u201cWe avoid broad-spectrum drugs, and we try to use specific antibiotics for specific conditions. We are more aware, and really very finicky about it.\u201d</p> <p>However, he added: \u201cDeveloping countries are the same \u2026 There\u2019s nothing unique to this place or this city. The reasons are all the same.\u201d </p> <p>On Tuesday, all 193 member states of the UN agreed to take the threat of antibiotic resistance as seriously as climate change, and report back in two years about the results.</p> <p>But superbugs are spreading fast and, in Delhi, are a daily reality. \u201cNo doubt about it,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cThe resistance is already there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Paris climate agreement is on the brink of coming into force after 31 nations officially joined the landmark accord, with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, predicting it will be fully ratified by the end of the year.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/09/list-of-states-expected-to-deposit-paris-agreement-ratification-instruments/\">31 countries</a> formally signed up to the Paris deal at the UN general assembly in New York. They include Brazil, the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/10.pdf#page=30\">seventh largest emitter</a> of greenhouse gases, Mexico, Argentina and Sri Lanka. Oil-rich United Arab Emirates also ratified the deal, as did nations considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, such as Kiribati and Bangladesh.</p> <p>The pledges mean that a total of <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">60 countries, representing 47.7% of global emissions</a>, have now formally joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris agreement</a>. The deal aims to limit the global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of keeping it to 1.5C. </p> <p>A total of 55 nations representing at least 55% of global emissions need to sign up for the deal to come into force. The first of these thresholds has now been reached, with Ban and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, both predicting that the agreement will be fully implemented within months.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ever more confident that the Paris agreement will enter into force this year,\u201d Ban said. \u201cI appeal to all leaders to accelerate domestic arrangements to join this year. </p> <p>\u201cWhat once seemed impossible now seems inevitable. When this year ends, I hope we can all look back with pride knowing that we seized the opportunity to protect our common home.\u201d</p> <p>Video messages from Germany, France, the EU, Canada, Australia and South Korea among others all promised to ratify the Paris accord in the coming months. Should these promises be fulfilled, the agreement will pass the second threshold and come into force.</p> <p>Australia, one of the largest per capita emitters, will make its \u201cbest endeavours to ratify\u201d in 2016, said the country\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, said her country planned to ratify the deal \u201cwell ahead\u201d of the next UN climate meeting in <a href=\"http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/unfccc-cop-22\">Marrakesh in November</a>. The UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-uk-ratify-paris-climate-change-agreement-this-year\">made a similar commitment</a>.</p> <p>Kerry said it was an \u201cexciting moment\u201d but warned that the threat posed by climate change grows every day.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem we continue to confront is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cEach day the planet is on this course, it becomes more dangerous. </p> <p>\u201cIf anyone doubted the science, all they have to do is watch, sense, feel what is happening in the world today. High temperatures are already having consequences, people are dying in the heat, people lack water, we already have climate refugees.\u201d</p> <p>Kerry added that international climate negotiations have been a \u201clong and frustrating path\u201d since 1992 but that the Paris deal means that they are \u201cfinally becoming a story that we are proud to tell our grandchildren and future generations\u201d.</p> <p>The UN climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, said: \u201cThis is an extraordinary momentum by nations and a clear signal of their determination to implement Paris now and raise ambition over the decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 195 nations put their name to the Paris deal and submitted promises to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Several analyses have cast doubt over whether the pledged emissions cuts will be sufficient to prevent a 2C temperature increase, with concerns exacerbated by record-breaking heat experienced over the course of 2016 </p> <p>The warmest August on record was recorded last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/global/201608\">confirmed on Tuesday</a>. The US government agency said last month was the 16th month in a row where temperature records were broken, with July being the single warmest month since modern record keeping began in 1880. </p> <p>The soaring heat, which has retained much of its intensity despite the end of the El Ni\u00f1o climatic event, is unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/nasa-climate-change-warning-earth-temperature-warming\">in at least 1,000 years and probably much longer</a>, scientists have said.</p> <p>But climate campaigners have said that the speed of the Paris deal ratification raises hopes that the world is finally swinging behind efforts to reduce emissions and prevent the worst ravages of a warming planet. </p> <p>\u201cThe global community is rallying behind swift and ambitious action to combat climate change,\u201d said Paula Caballero, global director of the World Resources Institute\u2019s climate program. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the Paris agreement will likely enter into force this year took everyone by surprise. This rapid pace reflects a spirit of cooperation rarely seen on a global scale. </p> <p> \u201cToday we pause and celebrate the important progress towards bringing the Paris agreement into force. Then we again pick up our shovels and continue the hard work of creating a safer and more prosperous planet.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>STV, the Scottish broadcaster, has tried to outflank the BBC by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/25/stv-take-on-bbc-scotland-launch-digital-news-service\"> launching a new UK and global news bulletin</a> before the corporation finally decides on its own \u201cScottish Six\u201d programme.</p> <p>STV said a nightly half-hourly news bulletin combining Scottish, UK and international news would be rolled out early next year across its growing network of city-based local channels and streamed live on its STV Player. </p> <p>That network, currently focused on Edinburgh and Glasgow, is to be expanded to include Dundee, Aberdeen and Ayr early next year and rebranded as STV2, broadcast on Freeview channel 8 in Scotland.</p> <p>The audience for the STV show, to be produced using UK and international footage from ITV News, is likely to be small. STV says the two existing city channels have a \u201cweekly reach of 300,000\u201d and a monthly aggregate audience of 700,000. <br></p> <p>In contrast, the BBC 1 regional programme Reporting Scotland has more than half a million viewers each night, <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/market-data/communications-market-reports/cmr14/scotland/\">about a third of the overall audience</a>. But STV\u2019s move will win political support within Scotland and is likely to boost advertising income. </p> <p>Gordon Macmillan, STV\u2019s head of news, said he saw this as an answer to the decades-long call for a \u201cScottish Six\u201d, which has been championed since the 1990s by the former Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond. </p> <p> \u201cThis is a programme whose merits have been long-debated in Scotland,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that it is STV that will bring this landmark new programme to Scotland\u2019s screens. </p> <p>\u201cViewers can look forward to yet another TV first: the best of Scottish, UK and international news in a single programme and presented in the way that solely meets the needs of a Scottish audience.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC is still wrestling with the technical and journalistic challenges of screening a full hour-long domestic, UK and international news programme on BBC 1 Scotland to replace the Six O\u2019Clock News, in response to the increased devolution of government across the UK.</p> <p>With a final decision on a Scottish Six now not due until later this year or early next, the BBC is still testing formats and technology. Three pilot programmes are being made this week at its Pacific Quay headquarters in Glasgow.</p> <p>STV has already defeated BBC in one ratings battle after BBC Scotland announced it was scrapping its nightly BBC2 current affairs programme Scotland 2016, which is shown head-to-head against STV\u2019s Scotland Tonight at 10.30pm. </p> <p>The BBC said Scotland 2016 has failed to win a substantial audience; the show has struggled to produce original content. Scotland Tonight has a simpler studio-based format, promoted heavily on Twitter.</p> <p>The BBC Scottish Six is also encountering open hostility from Scottish Tories and internal opposition from senior BBC executives, who are wrestling with substantial spending cuts. </p> <p>NUJ officials say James Harding, the BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, is a particular critic. In an unusual move, BBC Scotland news executives are now openly championing the Scottish Six proposal.</p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said earlier this month that the commitment placed on the BBC in the new draft charter to promote the cohesion and wellbeing of the UK and to produce UK-wide news meant a Scottish Six was now dead.</p> <p>He said the charter\u2019s stress on the cohesion of the UK meant replacing the Six O\u2019Clock News in favour of a bulletin made specifically for Scottish viewers was a policy decision rather than an editorial one. However, Karen Bradley, the UK culture secretary, disputed that, insisting the charter had no impact on the BBC\u2019s operational independence.</p> <p>Gary Smith, head of the BBC\u2019s Scottish news and current affairs, went on BBC Radio Scotland on Saturday to insist the idea \u201cis very much not dead on the water\u201d but it would cost \u201cconsiderable amounts of money\u201d. That was a challenge given the spending cuts. <br></p> <p>Several hours after STV announced its plans on Wednesday, Andrew Brown, the producer of Reporting Scotland and editor of the Scottish Six pilots, was on BBC Radio Scotland to say his team \u201cwere really keen\u201d to have a Scottish Six commissioned. \u201cIt\u2019s for people much higher up in the BBC to decide that is the direction we need to go in,\u201d he said.<br></p>",
  "<p>Antisocial behaviour can be a slippery term: on the estate I live on in London, one friend remarked how heartening it was to see children playing in the courtyard after school and neighbours sitting outside their doors enjoying the sunshine with a beer. But a former flatmate interpreted this as people \u201changing around menacingly\u201d.</p> <p> Different people view behaviour through different prisms. For some people, \u201cno ball games\u201d signs are a godsend and essential for the safety of their windows; others see them as evidence of a community broken down \u2013 no more than a series of insular homes unhappily cemented together.</p> <p> It falls to housing staff to help prevent neighbourly disputes escalating. James Wall, community safety operations manager at West Midlands housing association WHG, says his organisation focuses on the problem, rather than labelling those involved. </p> <p> \u201cIf people are told they are victims or perpetrators, they tend to act like it,\u201d he points out. Focusing on stopping the behaviour, rather than assigning blame to individuals is key to actually achieving a good outcome, he adds. \u201cTenants who are encouraged to work with us to fix the problem often feel empowered as a result.\u201d</p> <p> Although any incident with a defined victim and/or perpetrator is dealt with robustly, these cases are relatively rare. \u201cLess than 10% of our antisocial behaviour cases result in any form of enforcement action,\u201d says Wall.</p> <p> Although the tenants who report antisocial behaviour may expect eviction to be the first step, mediation is not only easier but also more beneficial for the community as a whole in the long run.</p> <p> Design and architecture is also important, argues architecture writer Owen Hatherley, who believes that features like blind corners without natural surveillance are probably a hostage to fortune. \u201cThe most important thing is maintenance,\u201d he adds. If something is well-tended, it is likely to be treated well.</p> <p> Simple steps to help people feel more connected to their community, coupled with maintenance, so people love their homes and want to keep their area beautiful, are key to happy neighbourhoods.</p> <p> Eviction should be the last resort. Far better to focus on prevention, good design and long-term care of the immediate environment.</p>",
  "<p>Our love of social media seems to have grown and grown in the past decade, but recent studies show the tide may be turning for some platforms, with young people in particular ditching Facebook.

It was after this that I gradually switched off from it, but before that I\u2019d been wanting to quit for a while. </p> <p>Facebook made me feel anxious, depressed and like a failure. When I went online it seemed like everyone was in Australia or Thailand, and if they weren\u2019t travelling they were getting engaged or landing great jobs. I felt like everyone was living the dream and I was still at home with my parents, with debt from my student loan hanging over me. </p> <p>I also felt that if I wasn\u2019t tagging myself at restaurants or uploading photos from nights out, people would assume I wasn\u2019t living. I remember a friend from uni said to me once, \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re still going out having fun, I\u2019ve seen on Facebook.\u201d I tried to present myself as always having a great time. If my status didn\u2019t get more than five likes, I\u2019d delete it. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It makes you realise who your real friends are and how \u200b\u200bsocial media takes the joy out of sharing news with people</p> <footer> <cite>Daisy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My life has changed for the better since deleting social media. I now enjoy catching up with my friends, and when they tell me new plans my response isn\u2019t just, \u201cYeah, I saw on Facebook.\u201d It makes you realise who your real friends are and how social media takes the joy out of sharing news with people. I also feel less anxious and less of a failure. </p> <p>I\u2019m planning to visit a friend in Australia next month, and she and my mum and a couple of other friends want me to go back on Facebook to share my pictures. I\u2019d really prefer not to, though. I\u2019m on Instagram, but I mostly follow sarcastic quote pages.

After doing this I started to ask, why am I using it at all? That\u2019s why I\u2019ve quit various platforms over the past year: Snapchat in November and Facebook in June. I\u2019ve never really had WhatsApp or Twitter. I mainly used Facebook at university, for organising events and meet-ups, but I\u2019ve gradually started to realise how pervasive is it. I also feel uncomfortable with the amount of time I used to spend on it. <br></p> <p>I\u2019ve always found social media to be an environment in which people constantly seek attention and validation through one-upping people\u2019s comments, and boasting over likes and retweets. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve not needed social media for thousands of years and now people think your life is over if you don't have it</p> <footer> <cite>Ben</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve not needed social media for thousands of years and now it feels like people think your life is over if you don\u2019t have it, which is ridiculous. I joined when I was 13, but I don\u2019t feel like I really knew what I was signing up for and the platform has changed a lot over the years. There\u2019s much more advertising on it now, for example.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t find it hard to quit and, after a while, contacting people through other means became the norm. People completely respect my not being on social media, and some wish they could do it too. Since I left, I\u2019ve spoken to people about it and that\u2019s convinced them to do the same.</p> <p>I\u2019m more productive and less concerned with what other people think about me \u2013 now, the only person I have to regularly compare myself with is me. I\u2019m in a much more positive mindset without social media than I ever was with it. It\u2019s let me see who my friends truly are, and who I was only concerned with simply because they were there on social media. I now use a basic non-smartphone and email as my only forms of communication, and people have adjusted to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b3e2ca46c1e6ccb5e273969f365035eef465b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b3e2ca46c1e6ccb5e273969f365035eef465b9/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter on a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter has more than 300m monthly active users.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Syed Ali, 19, Birmingham: \u2018I don\u2019t need to prove anything to people\u2019</h2> <p>There\u2019s so much negativity on social media, with people complaining about how tough their lives are (and these are the same people who post a picture of every meal they eat).

I was sick and tired of people trying to force their political beliefs upon me, and I found it so depressing that people were repeating views they had heard that weren\u2019t true.</p> <p>Now, three months later, without Facebook I feel much happier and more content. I can live my life instead of trying to shape it into one that looks good online. I also have a lot more time now, and it\u2019s easy enough to keep in touch with my friends in other ways. What\u2019s more, now we can have conversations about what we\u2019ve been doing because we haven\u2019t seen it all already on social media.</p> <p>I don\u2019t plan on going back to Facebook, but I still have my Instagram account, which I check once a day. Instagram is different because it\u2019s not as time-consuming, and you don\u2019t get bombarded with other people\u2019s views. Plus, the Instagram community is more supportive. I gave up Twitter years ago because it didn\u2019t really feel like it had a point, and it was just a space for opinionated people to air their views in a non-constructive way.</p> <h2>Kevin, 23, Dublin: \u2018I enjoy actually talking to people face to face\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"089ce807d373e3d5df48f197e765e68b25b39625\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/089ce807d373e3d5df48f197e765e68b25b39625/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Andy Staunton\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I used Facebook, I found myself aimlessly watching videos and scrolling through articles that I never had any interest in reading in the first place.

We have European influence and we have Arabic influence.\u201d</p> <p>The band\u2019s single, Soy Yo (I Am Me) sums up this attitude. It\u2019s a confident anthem of self-expression from their latest album, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/06/15/414689876/review-amanecer-bomba-estereo\">Amanecer</a>. \u201cThe song is about being comfortable in your own skin and at the same time revere others for who they are,\u201d the lead singer, Liliana Saumet, says. \u201cWhether we are talking about someone\u2019s race, age or sexual identity, we wanted to have something in the album that talked about confidence and respect.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWxXncl53U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bxWxXncl53U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxWxXncl53U\">The video</a>, directed by the Danish director Torben Kjelstrup, perfectly encapsulates Bomba\u2019s message. In it , a youth \u2013 charismatically played by 11-year-old Sarai Gonzalez \u2013 walks confidently through the streets of New York after leaving the hair salon, not letting any side-stares or judging looks get her down. In fact, she confronts them triumphantly, one by one.</p> <p>The video has made an impact (arts website Remezcla called it an \u201c<a href=\"http://remezcla.com/releases/music/bomba-estereo-soy-yo-video/\">ode to little brown girls everywhere</a>\u201d) and amassed more than 3m views on YouTube. There is a strong and passionate connection between the Colombian band and the Latino community, but their appeal goes beyond just one demographic. \u201cDespite the fact that we have a Latin perspective, our message is global \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be Latino to understand what we\u2019re about,\u201d says Saumet. </p> <p>Bomba Est\u00e9reo have come a long way since their first release, 2006\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db0W4PDrN88\">Volumen 1</a> \u2013 a seven-song EP in which they explored who they were as a band. By the time 2008\u2019s <a href=\"https://bombaestereo.bandcamp.com/album/estalla\">Estalla</a> was released, they were fully aware of their sound and the US began to pay attention. In 2010, viewers of MTV Iggy, the channel\u2019s outlet for alternative and global artists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6678312/mtv-iggy-shutting-down\">which shut down last year</a> \u2013 voted them as the best new band in the world and since then, Bomba Est\u00e9reo have only become more widescreen, eclectic and innovative. Now, with Amanecer, they have created something unique.</p> <p>Alongside the band\u2019s patent high-energy party sound, Amanecer also features more introspective moments, exploring issues of self-growth, love and discovery. In Algo Est\u00e1 Cambiando (Something is Changing), Saumet sings: \u201cI am who I am and who I have to be / And I go where I go without losing me.\u201d Admittedly in Spanish the lyrics have a much smoother flow, but what is not lost in translation is Saumet\u2019s intensity. \u201cI wrote this song during a crucial stage in my life, where I was going through a lot internally,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when we feel something is happening inside of us, effectively it affects our lives, whether it\u2019s positive or negative. For me, in this particular case, it was a positive energy, as a lot was going on around me at the time.\u201d<br></p> <p>Saumet has been through a lot over the years. She lost<a href=\"http://www.pulzo.com/barranquilla/encuentran-muerto-frances-novio-de-li-saumet-vocalista-de-bomba-estereo/153806\"> her then boyfriend, Alexis Bechu, to suicide in 2014</a>; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BAn5rseQSd5/?taken-by=lisaumet\">last year she married Canadian Brian Rea</a>.

So if the Tories are going to lose seats, they will lose them to the Lib Dems, he told his conference.</p> <p>Conveniently for the Lib Dems, <strong>Chris Mullin</strong>, the former Labour minister, is making exactly the same argument. He has just published <a href=\"https://profilebooks.com/hinterland-hb.html\">Hinterland, a memoir,</a> and in it he says Labour needs a Lib Dem revival because \u201cthey can win seats in places we can never hope to hold.\u201d</p> <p>More significantly, Mullin, a leftwinger and former minister, calls for an electoral pact with the Lib Dems and the Greens. Here is an extract from his book.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the Tories have by historical standards only a small overall majority, the political realities are stark. Labour is between a rock and a hard place. Too left-wing for the southern middle classes, not left-wing enough for Scotland. Given that Scotland is not likely to return to the Labour fold any time soon, I see only one way forward - an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens designed to ensure that in, say, a hundred of the most marginal seats the Tories face a united opposition. Tribalists on all sides will throw their hands up in horror at the prospect, but the truth is that Labour badly needs a Liberal Democrat revival because they can win seats in places we can never hope to hold. One should never say never in politics, but the alternative is an indefinite period of Tory rule. Think about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Farron did not go quite this far. But there is increasing interest in the idea of some kind of progressive alliance on the left. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/labours-lisa-nandy-urges-party-to-ditch-tribalism\">The Labour MP Lisa Nandy has co-edited a new book that explores the idea. </a>Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">a separate initiative promoting cross-party progressive cooperation. </a>And the Green party, under their new co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, are actively pushing the progressive alliance theme.

And the way it was done was even more disgraceful. At the end of an NEC, when people had left, a paper laid round and a decision taken on a vote of 14/14. And it was carried on the basis of a recommendation. So it was 14 people basically preventing 140,000 [sic] people having a vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although people who joined after January were able to vote if they paid \u00a325 to become a registered supporter, McDonnell said many people could not afford that. He said many of those excluded were Corbyn supporters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we lost, I think, a large group of people who were Jeremy Corbyn supporters. I think never again should we allow that to happen.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the proposal from Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, that was debated at the NEC yesterday to change the leadership election rules and reintroduce an electoral college.</strong> McDonnell said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing about our party now is it\u2019s based on one person one vote. I don\u2019t want to go back to some of the proposals that have come forward today [for] electoral colleges. Because what that would mean, as it was before ... the parliamentary Labour party gets a third of the votes. It will mean for every individual MP, their vote will mean 3,000 or 4,00 of ours. That is unacceptable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the way Labour has applied rules banning some members from taking part in the election</strong>. People were being suspended \u201cfor the bizarrest of reasons\u201d, he said. He said he know one woman who was suspended for tweeting that she supported the Greens; but she was talking about a team from her child\u2019s primary school, not the Green party. McDonnell said the decision to include \u201ctraitor\u201d as a word that could lead to people being suspended if used on social media was questionable, because it features in the Red Flag, sung by all members at conference. On that basis, everyone should be excluded, he said.

But McDonnell insisted that, even if Corbyn got a lower share of the vote than the 59.5% he got last time, that would not weaken his mandate. McDonnell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s going to be really tough to get the 59.5% that we got last time around because of the numbers that have been prevented from voting.

It also criticises western governments for their refusal to spend on new infrastructure to boost growth and confidence levels.</p> <p>Such a move would make up for the abject failure since the financial crash of private companies to invest in new plant and machinery, and outside the tech field to try out new techniques and processes that would raise productivity and wages.</p> <p>The OECD boss, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, might expect the 34 countries that count themselves as members of his organisation to heed his advice and step into the space left by the private sector.

  "<p></p> <p>Navarinou Park \u2013 part playground, part open-air cinema, part vegetable garden and verdant oasis \u2013 was never meant to be. On that, all of its participants agree. Stavros Stavrides, a professor of architecture at Athens\u2019 National Technical University, is the first to say it; so, too, do the local residents who, spade in hand, also worked to transform an unprepossessing parking lot on the rim of Athens\u2019 edgy Exarcheia district into a vibrant community garden.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019d have thought?\u201d asks Effie Saroglou, a dancer, walking her dark-haired mutt around the park. \u201cWho\u2019d have imagined us ever sitting here?\u201d says Yannis Mandris, a musician, watching a grainy rendition of Blade Runner in a makeshift arena on the other side of the lot. Something is stirring in the Greek capital \u2013 and in more ways than one Navarinou Park has come to represent it. </p> <p>Stavrides calls it a movement, a new form of commons in which public-spirited individuals reclaim public space; others an informal urbanism born of a spirit of solidarity that has taken hold since Europe\u2019s economic crisis erupted in Greece in 2009. For in Navarinou \u2013 a place run by neighbourhood committee \u2013 citizens have sought new ways of overcoming the trauma of economic collapse. And they have done so by creating a place where, self-contained and seemingly beyond the reach of authority, they can meet, converse, play and produce food.</p> <p>Bereft of civic protection and the great umbrella of the welfare state, grassroots groups across Athens have followed suit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc67becbf6bfefa089cb41415f6140491784732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc67becbf6bfefa089cb41415f6140491784732/0_149_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Navarinou Park hosts a \u2018community kitchen event\u2019 in 2011, organised to help out those hit hardest by the financial crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Navarinou Park hosts a \u2018community kitchen event\u2019 in 2011, organised to help out those hit hardest by the financial crisis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we are witnessing is an explosion of social networks born of bottom-up initiatives,\u201d says Stavrides, who was among the activists whose spontaneous efforts stopped the lot being turned into a parking space in late 2009. \u201cNavarinou heralded this new culture, this new spirit of people taking their lives into their own hands. They know that they can no longer expect the state to support them and through this process, they are discovering how important it is to share.\u201d</p> <p>It is a movement that has confounded expectation.

  "<p>A coal-burning power station in Wales repeatedly violated pollution controls for nitrogen oxide emissions, the European court of justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg has ruled.</p> <p>It ordered the UK to pay the European commission\u2019s legal costs after ruling that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/26/uk-faces-european-court-over-coal-plant-emissions\">Aberthaw power station</a>, near Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, should not have been allowed to exceed specially negotiated pollution limits.</p> <p>The decision prompted calls from Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth for the power station to be shut permanently on health grounds. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The government had argued that the plant, which opened in 1971, was continuing to make investments to bring down the amount of nitrogen oxide it put into the atmosphere.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The ECJ, however, ruled a higher emissions thresholdthe government had granted to Aberthawshould not have been allowed because of the quality of \u201clow-volatile\u201d opencast Welsh coal being burned. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Aberthaw was releasing more than double the quantity of nitrogen oxide than it should have been during the years 2008 and 2011, the Luxembourg court ruled.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It said: \u201cThe UK argues that the derogation was negotiated to include a plant such as Aberthaw and \u2026 that it is principally due to economic constraints that arrangements have not been made to improve the environmental performance of Aberthaw.</p> <p>\u201cThe court notes that it is clear from its case law that the UK cannot validly invoke reasons of a purely economic nature to dispute the failure of which it is accused. For those reasons, the court considers that the UK has failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive and orders the UK to pay the commission\u2019s costs.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint report, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said Aberthaw belonged to a different era. \u201cOn average, pollution from Aberthaw is responsible for curtailing the lives of 67 people in Wales every year. This is equivalent to 64% of the death toll on Welsh roads, yet there is no special strategy for securing the accelerated final closure of the plant.</p> <p>\u201cThe emissions from the power plant are estimated to be responsible for 195,000 days of illness per year, including 35,000 days of sick leave. On an average day, 530 people are ill due to the harmful health impacts of the pollution.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that its pollution has been causing respiratory sickness and prematurely ending the lives of thousands upon thousands of people in Wales and beyond for decades has eluded scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cThe Welsh and UK governments must do everything in their power to ensure that Aberthaw power station ceases operating. For good\u201d.</p> <p>Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis is a vindicating decision. The pollution from Aberthaw is unacceptable for the people near the power station in south Wales, but detrimental effects are felt as far away as Exeter, Bristol, Swindon and Bournemouth. We need a full and permanent closure, and today\u2019s decision should help bring that about. It is the only sensible solution unless we are prepared to accept premature deaths and children\u2019s ill health as a reasonable price to pay for corporate profit.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Williams, the climate and energy specialist at WWF-UK said: \u201cThis judgment is yet another nail in the coffin for the UK\u2019s dirty old coal-power stations. UK ministers have committed to phasing out coal, to improve public health, boost clean energy investment and tackle climate change. The new government should now publish the promised consultation on phasing out coal.\u201d</p>",

That might mean he feels he\u2019s made enough hard cash and now wants, as he says, to focus on philanthropy. Or it could be an exercise in reputation management.</p> <p>For Blair will know that two things have made his name toxic, in his home country at least. The first, and the one that will haunt him for ever, is the Iraq war. Blair has become the face of that catastrophe, to the point where the prime author of the 2003 invasion, George W Bush, is too often forgotten. At the time, Blair was lambasted for following Bush too slavishly, for being his lapdog. These days, in the national imagination, it\u2019s as if those roles were reversed: it was Blair\u2019s war, with Bush reduced to a secondary role.</p> <p>But the other stain on him is the one that has spread since he left office in 2007. It has come from the phenomenal sums he has made, circling the globe in private jets, advising authoritarian regimes or picking up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/08/china.tonyblair\" title=\"\">telephone-number speaking fees</a> in Kazakhstan, the Gulf and Asia. In July <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/tony-blair-wanted--35m-to-build-uaes-brand-and-influence/\" title=\"\">the Telegraph</a> reported that Blair had offered to build the United Arab Emirates\u2019 brand and influence \u2013 for the tidy sum of $35m over five years. All this has made him look both greedy and unprincipled, a mercenary to the ugliest elements of the global ruling class. It was a horror show, too easily dubbed the Blair Rich Project.</p> <p>There is not much he can do about the first stain on his name. Britons have come to a settled view of his role in Iraq. You could see that when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/blairs-iraq-war-legacy-is-now-damned-for-all-time\" title=\"\">the Chilcot report was published </a>in July. Immediately after Chilcot presented his findings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war\" title=\"\">Blair gave yet another long, impassioned defence of his role</a>. But it made barely a dent. On Iraq, people have stopped listening.</p> <p>Nor, perhaps, can he erase his image as a man willing to sell himself to the highest bidder. But he can at least stop making it worse. By heavily reducing his paid workload, he can stem the flow of stories in the papers that have, over a decade, linked him to some of the world\u2019s most suspect regimes.</p> <p>Whether that saves his reputation, allowing him to be heard as he makes contributions to the national conversation \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/01/our-nation-is-in-peril-tony-blair-urges-calm-in-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">his recent interventions on Brexit </a>and the like suggest he does indeed want to have a voice \u2013 is an open question. It may be too late.</p> <p>But where it could have an impact is on the party he once led. Every day Blair does not add to the charge sheet against himself allows Labour to look back at the Blair project \u2013 to separate Blair the man from Blair\u2019s record and, within that, to separate what worked well from what went wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/tony-blair-stricken-self-belief-unshaken-confidence-war\">Tony Blair sounded stricken \u2013 but his self-belief was unshaken | Anne Perkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For too long, the combination of Iraq and his post-prime ministership has blinded Labourites, preventing them from seeing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/08/tony-blair-labour-pride-war-criminal-iraq\" title=\"\">full picture of the Blair years</a>. They can see the disasters clearly enough, but they miss not only the three consecutive election victories but also much of New Labour\u2019s record in office.

  "<h2>\u2018Aid agencies have taken an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach to housing refugees\u2019<br></h2> <p>I travelled to Greece in February to distribute supplies in Lesbos and Athens. I commend the writer for this article. However, one thing the article failed to mention is that the crisis environment we have today is a result of poor policy decisions made by the local authority and NGOs in the early days of the crisis \u2013 and it is these same aid organisations that are now getting paid to fix the situation. <br></p> <p>Instead of taking advantage of all the existing Greek residential infrastructure, the government and NGOs consciously chose to locate refugees in old abandoned industrial buildings and remote rural areas, which directly limited their access to potable water, sanitation, electricity and food. Rather than trying to integrate refugees into life in Greece, it seems that they have taken an out of sight, out of mind approach. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a lot of strain on an already broken system and accountability is absent at every level</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I see the strategy as a missed opportunity to revitalise the Greek economy too. If refugees had been given cash vouchers to buy food from local markets and farmers, it would have helped residents financially and would also have helped change perceptions about refugees. There is a lot of empty real estate in the country that could have been used at the start but wasn\u2019t. Now these places, like the City Plaza hotel in Athens, are being turned into refugee squats. <em>Anna Segur, volunteer </em></p> <h2>\u2018The biggest hurdle is lack of support from the local government\u2019<br></h2> <p>Great article on Greek systemic failures to support refugees. UNHCR rarely answer emails these days, MSF [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res] are invisible, and it is virtually impossible for smaller NGOs to access the vast resources that should be supporting these desperate people.</p> <p>The biggest hurdle is lack of support at local government level \u2013 who undoubtedly face other immense challenges day to day. There is little appetite to support refugees \u2013 there are not enough resources to support Greek people in need, let alone refugees. In the Greek islands nearest to Turkey, the impact of the refugee crisis has also been harsh on tourism \u2013 coupled with the events in Turkey this year many businesses are down 40% to 50% on revenue. Greek people are the most hospitable people I know but there\u2019s a lot of strain on an already broken system and accountability is absent at every level.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have had fires, riots, a hepatitis breakout, and attempted suicides.

After a stint as a miner he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (<a href=\"http://www.iww.org/content/about-iww\">IWW</a>), a radical labour union known as the Wobblies. The nickname\u2019s origin is unclear but the organisation\u2019s goal gleamed bright: a revolution to let workers \u2013 in fields, farms and mines \u2013 keep what they produced.</p> <p>The IWW\u2019s leaders and intellectuals \u2013 socialists, anarchists and Marxists \u2013 were based in Chicago but Little criss-crossed hamlets, towns and cities in western states, agitating, recruiting and evangelising with little more than the clothes on his back, oratorical power and a fearlessness bordering on suicidal.</p> <p>He preached to fruit pickers, lumberjacks, oil drillers and miners, urging them to strike for better pay and conditions and if necessary to impede \u2013 to sabotage \u2013 production. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He drew crowds by standing on street corners reading the Declaration of Independence.

But by 1917 the aptly named Anaconda company, a global player, was crushing organised labour. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It controlled employment, newspapers, police, politicians and for good measure had a militia, said Gutfeld, the professor. \u201cIn many respects Montana at that time was a colony of the Anaconda company. If you wanted to commit suicide you went out against the company.\u201d</p> <p>A horrific accident in June 1917 killed 168 miners, infuriating survivors and giving the IWW, Little hoped, a chance to recruit. He arrived on 18 July. He was 38 and a physical wreck \u2013 thin, ill, a broken leg in a cast. Even so, he gave a barnstorming address to miners. He spoke with \u201cmaniacal fury\u201d and \u201cpractically threatened the United States government with revolution\u201d, the pro-company Butte Miner newspaper reported. For two weeks Little kept at it, urging miners to strike and \u201cfight the capitalists but not the Germans\u201d.</p> <p>Newspapers demanded authorities crack down \u201cwithout gloves\u201d on such \u201csedition\u201d and \u201ctreasonable tirades\u201d. In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings. Maybe he thought he would escape with just a beating. Maybe he knew what was coming. \u201cIt would be better to go down slugging,\u201d he had told colleagues. </p> <p>There were no witnesses to the abduction besides Byrne, the boarding house owner. And there were no known witnesses to the lynching. A man called Robert Brown on his way to work found the body swinging from the trestle some time after dawn. Pinned to the underwear was a placard: \u201cOthers take notice, first and last warning, 3-7-77.\u201d</p> <p>Rumours swirl to this day: that Little was castrated, stabbed 27 times and lost his kneecaps; that the numbers referred to his draft number, or Montana\u2019s grave specifications, three feet wide, seven feet deep, 77 inches long; that he was killed by union rivals, or a patriotic mob.</p> <p>The grisly details, said Jane Little Botkin, are exaggerations. He was savagely beaten and tortured but didn\u2019t lose body parts and was likely unconscious when hanged. \u201cI believe they put him on top of the car and drove the car out from underneath him. He didn\u2019t struggle. He was strangled, the neck did not break. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"210cd7a85137fb0d9ec4172b4c3954abccaa4e84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/210cd7a85137fb0d9ec4172b4c3954abccaa4e84/15_354_5882_3530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The funeral procession for Frank Little.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The funeral procession for Frank Little.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter P Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little Botkin, more than anyone, should know. The activist\u2019s great grandniece, she has spent seven years combing official archives and plumbing family lore for a biography, Frank Little and the IWW: the Blood That Stained an American Family, due out next year. The retired teacher believes the numbers refer to a warning to vagrants to buy a $3 train ticket for a 7am stagecoach, as ordered by a purported secret committee of 77 men in Helena, Montana.</p> <p>Little Botkin and other historians agree the killers most likely worked for Anaconda. The company had armed thugs, private detectives and police officers on its payroll. Which would explain why the official murder investigation went nowhere. </p> <p>There is a literary sub-plot. In his youth<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/29/100-best-novels-the-maltese-falcon-dashiell-hammett-sam-spade-raymond-chandler\"> Dashiell Hammett</a>, who created the fictional detective Sam Spade, worked for the Pinkerton detective agency, which specialised in strike breaking. Hammett\u2019s first novel, Red Harvest, concerns a labour dispute set in a thinly veiled version of Butte. </p> <p>In her memoirs Lillian Hellman, Hammett\u2019s companion, said he told her he was offered $5,000 to murder Little. \u201cThrough the years he was to repeat that bribe offer so many times that I came to believe \u2026 that it was a kind of key to his life. He had given a man the right to think he would commit murder.\u201d</p> <p>Some have speculated the novelist actually did it. <a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/n/william-f-nolan/\">William Nolan</a>, one of Hammett\u2019s biographers, thinks not. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it but the fact that someone even asked him, thinking that he would be that kind of person, and that he was that deep into the thing made him feel guilty. He never got over and it always haunted him.\u201d Hammett subsequently became a communist and ended up on a McCarthyite blacklist.<br></p> <p>Little\u2019s murder initially provoked flurries of defiance. Thousands attended the funeral and sang La Marseillaise. Protests flickered across the west. </p> <p>But instead of galvanising the movement, the lynching presaged a government crackdown: federal troops in Butte, martial law in Spokane, the Federal Sedition act of 1918 and the arrest of 165 alleged IWW members, resulting in jail terms of five to 20 years. \u201cThe wounded IWW ... seemed to lose all of its old dash, all of its genius for improvising guerrilla tactics,\u201d noted the historian Robert Tyler.</p> <p>Members of Little\u2019s family were arrested, terrifying the family into decades of silence, said Little Botkin. \u201cIf you had Frank\u2019s photo on you that could be sedition. We had no photos of him, not one. The family just stopped talking about him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.</p> <footer> <cite>Arnold Stead</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A movement which had mobilised the homeless and taught workers to take direct action never recovered, said Stead, the biographer. \u201cHis death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.\u201d </p> <p>Stead sees a continuum through the evolution \u2013 and weakening \u2013 of US unions. Instead of a wide movement infusing white, black and Latino workers with a shared class identity, unions narrowed and moderated their goals, seeking gains only for dues-paying members. </p> <p>Arguably this was a sensible, successful tack which benefited members. But globalisation and anti-union laws gradually drained their power. Only one in 10 American workers now belong to a union despite stagnant wages and widening inequality. </p> <p>Which brings us to Trump.</p> <p>In the absence of powerful unions, or a shared identity with the working poor of other races, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-decline-of-unions-and-the-rise-of-trump.html?_r=0\">blue collar white men are Trump\u2019s strongest supporters</a>. \u201cThey feel angry and left out so it\u2019s no surprise now that you have people willing to support someone who doesn\u2019t give a damn about them,\u201d said Stead.</p> <p>For CW Copeland, a Montana member of the IWW, which still limps on, the fault lies not just with unions but also the Democratic party and progressive academics. They neglected labour issues, he said. \u201cA lot of those going crazy for Donald Trump identify more with their whiteness than with their class.

  "<h2>Why is everyone talking about the Federal Reserve? </h2> <p>Because today\u2019s the day the US central bank will decide, once again, whether or not to raise interest rates. Fed chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference to discuss the Fed\u2019s assessment of the US economy.</p> <h2>When was the last time the Fed raised rates?</h2> <p>The Fed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">raised rates last December</a> for the first time since 2006.

  "<p>Yesterday, 375 of the world\u2019s top scientists, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, published <a href=\"http://responsiblescientists.org/\">an open letter regarding climate change</a>. In the letter, the scientists report that the evidence is clear: humans are causing climate change. We are now observing climate change and its affect across the globe. The seas are rising, the oceans are warming, the lower atmosphere is warming, the land is warming, ice is melting, rainfall patterns are changing and the ocean is becoming more acidic.</p> <p>These facts are incontrovertible. No reputable scientist disputes them.

After all, they went ahead with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/03/doral-donald-trump-blue-monster-wgc-cadillac\" title=\"\">March\u2019s WGC-Cadillac Championship at Trump Doral</a> in Miami despite the litany of -isms committed by their host in any given 24-hour period. By June, a few thousand -isms later, even the US PGA was finally minded to declare that sponsorship problems meant next year, the same tournament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-doral-golf-course-lose-wgc-event-mexico-city\" title=\"\">would be played in Mexico</a>, of all pointed relocations.</p> <p>Not that a US win at Hazeltine will not be seized upon by Trump as some electoral omen for America\u2019s impending being-made-great-again. Under President Trump, needless to say, all Ryder Cups will be won by the US.</p> <p>As far as Trump support within the US Ryder Cup side goes, one can only speculate as to quite how many players might find his interests and worldview align with theirs. We do know that Jack Nicklaus has come out for Trump, declaring him \u201ca good man\u201d. \u201cI like what Donald has done,\u201d Nicklaus went on a few months ago. \u201cI like that he\u2019s turning America upside down. He\u2019s awakening the country.\u201d Whether that is the majority PGA definition of \u201cwoke\u201d is unclear \u2013 though we do have some useful Sports Illustrated data. Every year, the publication polls tour pro golfers on the condition of anonymity, which allows them to speak more freely than the constraints of wealth and hardwired self-interest traditionally allow. Stop me if your own non-scientific guesses already confirmed this to you, but this year it found \u2013 inter alia \u2013 that 56% of PGA respondents wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary if she halved their taxes, while Trump was most supported in the Republican primary race.</p> <p>As for the European side of things, that promises to bring the angst. The very day after the referendum vote, the European Tour announced that the Ryder Cup team would still be flying the EU flag, though it did offer a hint on where it stood on the result with a slightly sniffy statement: \u201cLike all global companies whose headquarters are in the UK,\u201d this ran, \u201cwe are now in the process of assessing the implications for our business.\u201d</p> <p>If the Europeans win, you can be sure they\u2019ll be seen as a symbol of something or other. As the British gold medals rained in during the Rio Olympics, the Leave.EU campaign lost no time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/17/olympic-cyclist-callum-skinner-leave-eu-twitter-brexit\" title=\"\">putting out an advert</a> featuring all the winners, suggesting that their sporting success somehow proved the UK had no need of the EU to succeed. A category mistake, and one that caused the cyclist Callum Skinner to ask them to stop using his image. We shall have to see whether any UK golfers are moved to do the same should they be similarly co-opted in the event of a European Ryder Cup victory. In the event of a European loss, of course, there will be remainers quick to ascribe it to a doomy sign that the fellowship is so terminally scattered that we can\u2019t even beat the Yanks in the Ryder Cup any more.</p> <p>There is more, of course \u2013 so much more \u2013 and for some, golf is not an appropriate place for such multi-faceted conflicts to play out. For me, there is no better. Certainly no safer. Let us gird our loins, and have absolutely no time for those who wrongly imagine the Ryder Cup to be a good war spoiled.</p>",

  "<p>Japan is expected to come under unprecedented domestic pressure over its use of the death penalty when, for the first time, the country\u2019s legal community calls for its abolition next month.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> Federation of Bar Associations, whose membership includes 37,000 lawyers and hundreds of other legal professionals, said it would declare its opposition to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/capital-punishment\">capital punishment</a> at a meeting in early October due to growing concern over miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>The declaration will put the federation at odds with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose administration has executed 16 people since it took office in late 2012.</p> <p>Successive Japanese governments have resisted pressure from the UN, the EU and human rights groups to abolish the death penalty.</p> <p>\u201cIf an innocent person or an offender who does not deserve to be sentenced to death is executed, it is an irrevocable human rights violation,\u201d Yuji Ogawara, who heads a bar association panel on the death penalty, was quoted as saying by the <a href=\"http://english.kyodonews.jp/\">Kyodo</a> news agency.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still lawyers who support the death penalty, but I think we have developed an environment that enables us to seek its abolition.\u201d</p> <p>The federation will call for an end to capital punishment by 2020, when Japan hosts a UN congress on crime prevention and criminal justice.

  "<p>Last April, I found myself in Azerbaijan, at the third global Baku forum on shared societies - an event stuffed with former prime ministers and presidents from around the world. and I was duly awed, until one of the other journalists at the grand dinner pointedly reminded me of Enoch Powell\u2019s dictum that all political careers end in failure. Nothing could, indeed be clearer, as we surveyed the men (there were very few women) who had, collectively, overseen events such as the banking crash in Ireland, conflict in Ukraine, the collapse of the Greek economy, and so on.</p> <p>That event came to mind on Monday evening, when Margaret Hodge, senior Labour MP and former chair of the Commons public accounts committee, and Nick Macpherson, former permanent secretary at the Treasury, were at King\u2019s College\u2019s Policy Institute together to plug Hodge\u2019s new book, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/called-to-account.html\">Called to Account</a>, about her time on the committee.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Not, of course, that Hodge\u2019s career has ended in failure. It is very far from ending and her time as PAC chair was certainly a huge success. Macpherson, too, who left Whitehall this year, was garlanded in roses as he left the civil service.</p> <p>But there was a tinge of irony about the two of them standing side by side and agreeing that something must be done to overhaul Whitehall. For one thing, it\u2019s only three months since Hodge <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/margaret-hodge-blasts-ex-treasury-boss-sir-nick-macpherson-over-new-bank-job\">professed herself \u201cshocked\u201d</a> at Macpherson\u2019s post-Whitehall role as part-time chair of family-run bank C Hoare &amp; Co, which offers to find clients \u201cthe best after-tax returns\u201d as part of its offshore investment management wing. And Macpherson himself, an old Etonian, acknowledged the irony of criticising \u201cthe mandarins\u2019 guild\u201d of which he was until recently a long-term member.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jan/05/nicholas-macpherson-gone-treasury-replace\">With Sir Nicholas Macpherson gone, it's the Treasury's chance to modernise</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But the truth is that, as David Cameron has also recently found, once politicians or senior civil servants leave powerful positions, the baton has to be handed on. Hodge and Macpherson can call until they are blue in the face for the civil service to be reformed, but it now rests with Theresa May\u2019s ministers to push that through. </p> <p>And it\u2019s funny how people change their attitudes. In post, Macpherson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jan/05/nicholas-macpherson-gone-treasury-replace\">was distinctly lukewarm</a> about the Treasury being the \u201ccorporate centre\u201d of Whitehall and about the appointment of former BP executive John Manzoni as the first-ever chief executive of the civil service. Now, it seems, the scales have fallen from his eyes and he sees Manzoni, who has tried hard to bring in more commercial expertise to Whitehall, as the only way to force through change.</p> <p> But no matter now much Macpherson or Hodge now believe in the need for civil servants to be able to let and manage contracts, to stop millions being poured into private companies that could be better spent on much-needed support for poorer people, the baton has been handed over. It\u2019s time for the present crop of civil servants and politicians in No 10, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office to see what they can do. </p> <p>At entry level, or, at least, graduate intake level, which is where the cadre of the next generation of mandarins will eventually come from, the civil service is trying to change, to make its fast stream entrants more diverse, including more class diversity. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/19/applying-civil-service-fast-stream-reader-views\">the responses from Guardian readers</a> to the process as it stands makes it clear that the scheme still has a long way to go before it truly does bring in a more diverse set of future leaders. </p> <p> On Monday, Hodge pointed out that the accountability system for the civil service might have been suitable after the first world war, when there were 280 members of staff in the Home Office. Today, not so much. But finding avid reformers and achieving reform, at a time when the civil service has to manage Brexit?

The last week has provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/mo-farah-named-fancy-bears-leak\" title=\"\">numerous headlines about high-profile athletes</a>, many of them British, after cyber-hackers with links to Russia illegally obtained details of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) from an extensive World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) database.</p> <p>TUEs allow athletes to use banned substances because of illness or longstanding conditions such as asthma and allergies. The private records of many British athletes have been leaked \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bradleywiggins\" title=\"\">Sir Bradley Wiggins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mo-farah\" title=\"\">Mo Farah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nicola-adams\" title=\"\">Nicola Adams</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome\" title=\"\">Chris Froome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/laura-trott\" title=\"\">Laura Trott</a> \u2013 as have exemptions obtained by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/wada-hacking-abuse-debate-theraputic-use-drugs\" title=\"\">Serena Williams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal\" title=\"\">Rafael Nadal</a>.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that those named have done anything wrong, as all the TUEs publicised by Fancy Bears have been granted approval by anti-doping authorities, yet it has opened up a serious ethical debate about the use of such exemptions and their timing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/18/bradley-wiggins-world-anti-doping-agency-hackers-russian-leak\" title=\"\">Wiggins, in particular, has had his record scrutinised</a> and was forced to deny that the controversial Belgian doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/bradley-wiggins-denies-doctor-geert-leinders-gave-banned-steroid-tue\" title=\"\">Geert Leinders</a> was involved.</p> <p>Exemptions are undoubtedly an area worthy of further investigation, yet in an existing climate where distrust of star athletes already hangs like a miasma, where reputations are on the line and the very integrity of professional sport is up for debate, this illegal hack could have a dangerous effect. On the Fancy Bears website, snippets of text read: \u201cWe stand for fair play and clean sport. We are going to tell you how Olympic medals are won \u2026 We go on exposing the athletes who violate the principles of fair play by taking doping substances.\u201d</p> <p>An altruistic claim, but it is western athletes who have been targeted following a period of 18 months when state-sponsored doping in Russia has been brutally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/18/russia-doping-scandal-five-things-wada-report\" title=\"\">exposed by two independent reports, commissioned by Wada</a>.

  "<p>I miss seeing the back end of a bug.</p> <p>This summer I sensed a disturbance of some sort. There were hardly any ladybirds, almost no butterflies (only the odd cabbage white) and barely a wasp. Very, very odd. I noticed early on that the orchard would crop moderately (as opposed to well); I put this down to the slow spring and accompanying lack of pollinators. But I wonder now whether the silly December we had, with daffodils all over the place and everyone in short sleeves, followed by the later cold snap, followed by the interminably slow spring, may have dealt a seriously deleterious blow to Britain\u2019s overall insect population.</p> <p>It would appear that this decline in insects is not limited to North Essex. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/one-in-10-uk-wildlife-species-faces-extinction-major-report-shows\">State of Nature report</a>, published last week, brings together the findings of more than 50 organisations. It highlighted the particular plight of insects, suggesting a 59% decline since 1970. The general point was brought home to me recently in a conversation with a friend. He is 80 and remembered that in the 1960s, driving five miles down the road to the local town (Halstead) in high summer would leave the front windscreen of his car thick with bugs. Thinking about it, I remember when I started driving barely more than a decade ago, I would have to buy those bug wipes from petrol stations when on long journeys. This year there has been barely a smudge on my windscreen. Do they even make bug wipes anymore? And didn\u2019t there used to be special windscreen wiper things in green liquid on petrol station forecourts up and down the country precisely to de-bug?</p> <p>I build bug hotels and leave wood rotting around the place, but my instinct is that until our farming brethren take insects seriously (especially when it comes to their use of pesticides), we insect-friendly gardeners will be like Sisyphus, pushing a boulder to the top of the hill only to watch it roll back down again. I was chatting to a farming friend (a very good farmer as it happens) who had a bad year of beans and put it down to the slow spring and lack of pollinators. But what if there is an inflection point in the general insect population beyond which crops simply don\u2019t pollinate well? And what if we are approaching that point? Is crop failure the only thing that will cause people to take this decline seriously? Indeed, the State of Nature report suggests the UK is among the most nature-depleted countries in the world, with most of the country past the threshold at which \u201cecosystems may no longer reliably meet society\u2019s needs\u201d. </p> <p>An intensely seasonal approach to life is no doubt a gardener-cum-farmer thing. Every year about now, a few particularly vivid memories seem to fall from the general swirl of summer and then accompany me into the darker half of the year. This year, for example, they include the intense red of a particular dahlia I grew, a vision of the meadow together with a sense that it has finally found its feet, and the exploding sweetness of a freshly picked carrot. I can\u2019t choose these memories; they just fall into my mind and provide ballast against the hard, short days of winter. Sadly, this year, in among these summer ecstasies is a memory of absence and an accompanying anxious thought - will the insects be back next spring<em><strong><br></strong></em><br></p>",
  "<p>As a history of religion&#xa0;this book is ill\u2011conceived. As an informed reflection on the state of faith in the western world in the 21st century, written by someone who has plenty of experience (Holloway is the retired bishop of Edinburgh and primus of the Scottish Episcopal church), it is insightful and intelligent. But it is as a history that it announces itself, and that is how it will be judged.</p> <p>The task of writing a \u201clittle history\u201d of religion is an ambitious one. Religion is by its very nature big, arguably almost as big as humanity itself. The term itself&#xa0;has been endlessly debated: what counts as a religion? How is it&#xa0;different from magic, philosophy, superstition? And where does it sit, in human society, between aesthetics, metaphysics, economics and politics? Holloway approaches his task as if Mary Douglas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/03/claude-levi-strauss-obituary\" title=\"\">Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss</a>, \u00c9mile Durkheim and Keith Thomas had never been born. This history is \u201clittle\u201d not in the sense of&#xa0;being compact, punchy or condensed, but in the way that you might say \u201cthat\u2019s a nice little house\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019ll just have a little cup of coffee\u201d.</p> <p>It is a \u201clittle history\u201d because it is written from a comfortable armchair. Holloway\u2019s is an unashamedly, but apparently unselfconsciously, Protestant account. He takes it for granted that the only religious experience that matters is divine revelation, when God talks directly to human beings: none of that ritual mumbo-jumbo that bothers the anthropologists. So we race past entire areas of human experience. He explicitly states that Shinto, ancient Greek polytheist and native American beliefs aren\u2019t proper religion; presumably he would say the same about the indigenous cultures of Africa or South America, since he never mentions them.</p> <p>His account is largely narrative-driven, and every story always begins with the little guys \u2013 by implication, there were no women in religion until Mary Tudor \u2013 for whom the voice of God offers the route out of an oppressive society, whether it be Moses in Egypt, Christ or Muhammed. Religion is good in these situations; it only becomes bad when ossified into rigid, coercive social structures. God\u2019s voice is generous and true, if we have the ears to hear it; it is human society that introduces the vanity and toxicity. For Holloway, it is the second commandment, forbidding idolatry, that defines the essence of religion. All&#xa0;great religious revolutions are founded in the rejection of artifice. \u201cLike Muhammad and the leaders of the Protestant Reformation,\u201d he writes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardianwitness-blog/2014/nov/06/guru-nanak-gurpurab-sikh-festival-pictures\" title=\"\">Guru Nanak</a>, the founder of Sikhism, he \u201chated showy religion. He was a monotheist with a profound contempt for the merchants of idolatry.\u201d It is no surprise to find a celebratory narrative of Europe\u2019s Reformation occupying the heart of the book. When the plucky Protestants cast off the shackles of corrupt, idolatrous Catholicism, it\u2019s the&#xa0;culmination of the same story that&#xa0;he has told from the start.</p> <p>Holloway certainly tries to moderate the Protestant teleology of his history. He begins dutifully with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hinduism\" title=\"\">Hinduism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/buddhism\" title=\"\">Buddhism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/30/religion.uk16\" title=\"\">Jainism</a>, but then leaves these parked in the first millennium BCE. He has later excursions into Chinese and Zoroastrian thought, but these too prove to be dead ends in his overall story. Judaism features heavily, but only in its time-honoured role as parent of Christianity. (No Jewish history since the time of Jesus, then.) Islam too, is viewed primarily as an episode in medieval history, although even in his account of its formation Holloway introduces discussion of violent jihad and smuggles in metaphors of armed conflict (for example, when discussing concepts of Hell: \u201cthe&#xa0;Church\u2019s holy book couldn\u2019t beat&#xa0;the Qur\u2019an in the terror stakes\u201d), hinting that 21st-century fundamentalism was a theological inevitability. Modernity is&#xa0;represented in this history primarily by America\u2019s Christian and para-Christian developments: Quakers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mormonism\" title=\"\">Mormons</a>, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/scientology\" title=\"\">Scientologists</a> and so forth.</p> <p>Those with a little postmodern learning often opine that history can never be objective; it always tells a story. That may be true enough in a crude sense, but the writing of history remains a subtle art. Bad history is transparently ideological: it uses a crude narrative to make an obvious point. Good history, on the other hand, is based on deep learning. It surprises the reader, using the past to disrupt our expectations, or&#xa0;showing how what seems to be one thing in fact may be something very different. On these criteria, I am afraid to say, Holloway is a bad historian. It is not just the distortion of fact and the absence of any critical handling of sources (though it is disturbing, to me&#xa0;at least, to see chronological dates attached to the Biblical Abraham and Moses). The main problem is that his accounts always serve the same black-and-white agenda, painting the same picture of pious types battling monstrous state power.</p> <p>The Romans obsessively persecuted Jews and Christians because they didn\u2019t&#xa0;understand them, we are told; no acknowledgement that early Christians themselves recorded, embellished and invented martyr stories on an industrial scale for their own reasons, replaying the story of Christ\u2019s passion. Or again, the Reformation was, we are told, impelled by brave piety resisting the degeneration of the Catholic church into&#xa0;a giant medieval Amazon for papal indulgences; there is not a single word about underlying social or technological changes (Gutenberg \u2013 who?). We&#xa0;then read of British Protestants butchered by \u201cBloody Mary\u201d in the Counter-Reformation \u2013 but the brutal suppression of Catholicism by Protestants throughout Britain (particularly in Ireland) is never mentioned. I&#xa0;could go on.</p> <p>This is a vast oversimplification of&#xa0;religious history, even (especially) for the younger readers whom the dust-jacket identifies among the book\u2019s target market. A Sunday school prose style adds to the impression of corners being cut. \u201cThough David was a great warrior and a charismatic leader, he was a far from perfect man.\u201d \u201cBad things can happen to good people.\u201d \u201cSo&#xa0;who was this man called Jesus? And what really happened to him?\u201d It&#xa0;is hard to get the image of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/cliff-richard\" title=\"\">Cliff Richard</a> delivering \u201cThought for the Day\u201d out of your head.</p> <p>Holloway is at his best in the closing chapters, where he explores the meaning for us today of thousands of years of reflection on religion, this most peculiar aspect of human culture. Here&#xa0;he captures sympathetically and undogmatically the impasse that we have reached, where science, liberal values, secularism, religious conservatism, global diversity, postcolonialism and fundamentalism are on a terrifying collision course. His diagnosis of the situation is spot-on. If there is a solution to be found, however, it will lie not in partisan \u201clittle histories\u201d like this, but in an expansive, generous, self-aware and intellectually sophisticated understanding of how we ended up here.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Whitmarsh\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/battling-the-gods.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World</em></a> is published by Faber.

Certainly, though, \u201cvarious municipal authorities are using walls and it seems to be more prevalent,\u201d she suggests.</p> <p>It\u2019s with the aim of subverting the trend, and turning walls of separation into walls of connection, that MasterPeace has invited artists to spend 21 September, the UN\u2019s annual <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/\">International Day of Peace</a>, painting walls in 30 cities around the world for one of the biggest mural projects in history. Walls will be painted in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slums, one of the worst spots of post-election violence in recent years; in the Bangladeshi city of Sylhet, prescient in a country that\u2019s home to the world\u2019s longest border wall; and in Mexico City, where the Trump wall is on everyone\u2019s minds.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77aac25d3b21c46bc3c75b991d9c53aa6bad2271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77aac25d3b21c46bc3c75b991d9c53aa6bad2271/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banksy\u2019s work on the West Bank wall in Ramallah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banksy\u2019s work on the West Bank wall in Ramallah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In most cases, separation walls are imposed, usually by some sort of authority, and usually against the wishes of some, if not all, affected inhabitants.

For El-Halawany, they are antithetical to the very nature of cities: \u201cCities are built on integration, mobility and connections. The feeling of separation creates more of this feeling of \u2018I don\u2019t belong\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m hated\u2019, so it\u2019s more okay to be violent.\u201d</p> <p>She feels their ill effects in her native Cairo: \u201cWhenever there is a new compound, there is increased security \u2013 when you build a wall, you need to guard it \u2026 walls create hatred automatically.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7JHbwVD2wU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q7JHbwVD2wU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What makes these walls so damaging, says Pullan, who who is speaking from Jerusalem where she lived for over a decade, is that they\u2019re \u201coften in a place where no one would have expected a wall, they divide the urban fabric \u2013 they cause spacial discontinuities. If you get that, you usually get social discontinuities as well \u2013 it cuts the normal flow of movement in a city, it means that people never encounter each other, or very rarely.\u201d</p> <p>She takes the example of the wall and UN buffer zone built between the Turkish and Greek communities of the Cypriot capital, Nicosia: \u201c[It] goes right through what was their major commercial street ... and that\u2019s what\u2019s so damaging \u2013 you end up with two rump cities.

In such a badly divided city, Pullan says, \u201cit\u2019s very important that occasionally people see a face that doesn\u2019t look like theirs \u2026 The Palestinians hear quite a lot of Hebrew, because that\u2019s the dominant language at this point, but the Israelis need to hear Arabic \u2026 These are little things but they\u2019re really important if societies are ever to come together.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/23/struggle-cairo-egypt-revolutionary-graffiti\">'Erase and I will draw again': the struggle behind Cairo's revolutionary graffiti wall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So separation walls feed into a much bigger narrative of estrangement in divided cities: without contact with \u201cthe other side\u201d, communities will tend, Pullan says, to vilify \u201cthe other\u201d. </p> <p>The roots of division often run very deep and it\u2019s difficult to bring walls down even when they\u2019ve been physically removed. So is there an answer? Public space, according to Pullan, is essential. \u201cThere\u2019s the tendency \u2013 even in cities that have a very low level of conflict \u2013 to privatise, put in barriers.\u201d Turning the areas around walls into useable public space is one of the things El-Halawany hopes MasterPeace\u2019s project will achieve. They painted a wall in Cairo a few years ago<strong></strong>, not far from Tahrir Square. Ever since, she says, the space around it has been used for pop-up concerts and events. The local community have invested in it.</p> <p>\u201cThere probably is something fairly inherent in the way we live that we tend to want to live with our own people,\u201d Pullan says. \u201c\u2026 And I suppose there\u2019s nothing so terrible about that. However, there have to be places in cities where we meet other people, and that\u2019s key. Diversity has to be there \u2013 without it you really don\u2019t have a city.\u201d<br></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

  "<p>The problem with building a professional network online is that a contact list can be full of people you have never met and are unlikely to meet.

Paris-based co-founder, Thomas Bouttefort, says the idea was to get away from building long lists of distant contacts. Instead the app, rather like a dating service, suggests profiles that someone may want to swipe right on.

By the end of the summer another revenue stream will be available as software developments will enable event organisers to include Grip within their own mobile apps, so attendees can get swiping without having to open up a second app.</p> <p>Nicholas Oliver, founder of start-up <a href=\"https://people.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">people.io</a>, found the app useful at the Cannes Lions. \u201cNetworking at events as big as Cannes Lions can be a nightmare, especially as a startup,\u201d he says. \u201cGrip connected me with some great people including the CEO of a major global agency group, who we\u2019re now working with on a significant partnership.\u201d</p> <p>If all this swiping to meet contacts sounds too work-centric, Juan Imaz might have the service for you.

  "<p>Fashion week has been hijacked by the real world. For decades, \u201cthe shows\u201d existed in a champagne bubble, a parallel universe in which celebrities were jammed together on long benches, as if for a very glamorous school photo, and where mysterious diktats \u2013 Navy is the New Black; Minimalism is Dead \u2013 were pronounced six months ahead of time, as if by a cabal of fortune tellers.</p> <p>But this is 2016, and identity politics has trumped everything else. From Brexit to the presidential election, public debate centres on issues not of policy, or economics, but of class, race and gender. On social media, if you are not cooing over cute panda videos you are probably debating a hashtagged identity issue \u2013 Kim Kardashian and the politics of nude selfies, or diversity at the Oscars. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/french-police-make-woman-remove-burkini-on-nice-beach\">most striking image of summer 2016</a> was of a woman in a burkini, surrounded by armed police.

This London fashion week marked the beginning of a new era of immediacy in fashion, with Burberry leading the charge of straight-to-consumer shows. The cultural import of See Now Buy Now fashion is that the clothes on the catwalk relate not to the theoretical world of six months\u2019 time, but to the world as it is now. The new business model is still only embraced by a minority of designers, but its mindset is impacting everybody. Fashion week has simply become more relevant. In a world where you can order a delivery of milk on Amazon Prime and put the kettle on to make tea pretty much straight away, our relationship with time is shifting. \u201cSpeed is everything,\u201d said Christopher Bailey after his See Now Buy Now Burberry show on Monday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s changing how we think.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"220935621b5ba93f10dc51c28816e10efc01dbae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/220935621b5ba93f10dc51c28816e10efc01dbae/0_291_5122_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outsider chic is the must-have look on the front row.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outsider chic is the must-have look on the front row.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can tell fashion week has changed, because the people in its orbit look different. Look at the front row of any fashion show right now, and you will see oversized hoodies, tracksuit bottoms, flat shoes. The front-row look \u2013 high heels, sample-size dresses, everything dry clean only \u2013 was once all about signalling elite status. By contrast, this season\u2019s must-have pieces \u2013 jeans with raw, lopsided hems and sweatshirts whose extra-long sleeves give the impression of having been borrowed from a flatmate in a scruffy student house \u2013 present an uncompromising vision of outsider chic. (Some aspects of fashion, however, do not change. A pair of jeans from Vetements, the flagship label for this look, costs around \u00a3800.)</p> <p>Fashion\u2019s shift towards democracy, with catwalk streams livestreamed and increasingly open to consumers, is reflected in the clothes themselves, as a broader vision of what aspiration looks like. At London fashion week, Christopher Kane, one of the standout LFW talents of his generation, has made \u201cOutsider Art\u201d a theme of his recent collections. At his show at Tate Britain on Monday, pencil skirts in what he dubbed \u201croad kill fur\u201d represented \u201cthe alchemy of making something out of the humble and the discarded\u201d. Richard Malone\u2019s collection, part of the Fashion East show, was based on the aesthetic of workers\u2019 uniforms. Tunics were elevated, tailored versions of those worn by hospital cleaners. \u201cI wanted to integrate [workwear] into fashion, to make it a respected, beautiful thing,\u201d Malone said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c602d185d4fd4936610156ef2956dfb1b344d997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c602d185d4fd4936610156ef2956dfb1b344d997/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model Adwoa Aboah arrives for the Burberry show at LFW.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model Adwoa Aboah arrives for the Burberry show at LFW.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fashion week\u2019s intersection with identity politics is most high-profile where it is most photogenic. Gender fluidity is a talking point in public debate; fashion has turned it into a trend. London fashion week\u2019s current It girl, Adwoah Aboah, a model who walked for her friend Ashley Williams\u2019 show and sat front row at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/19/burberry-september-show-seasonless-clothes-fashion-stream-of-consciousness-era\">Burberry</a>, has a staggering buzzcut beauty which does not conform to feminine tropes. What started with a menswear influence on womenswear has evolved into Gucci\u2019s aesthetic of velvet, pearls, rainbow colours and tumbling curls for both men and women, a look that is almost post-gender. Orlando was the inspiration for Burberry this week, where the clothes for men and women were an interchangeable collage of silk pyjama shirts, blazers, and \u2013 of course \u2013 trenchcoats. Backstage after his JW Anderson show this week, designer Jonathan Anderson talked about an \u201curban cultural reappropriation of Tudor silhouettes\u201d and borrowing \u201csomething of that masculinity and aggression\u201d of Henry VIII\u2019s wardrobe for modern womenswear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eaa2d37a1db0dcc55421413d63e1168bb62576d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eaa2d37a1db0dcc55421413d63e1168bb62576d/0_112_2568_3652/703.jpg\" alt=\"Post-gender?

At the presentation for her Victoria Victoria Beckham secondary line in London this week, Beckham showed loose trousers with oversized jackets, an anti-bodycon look that is very different from the corset dresses that were the starting point for her main line. \u201cSoft tailoring is what I wear myself, most of the time, these days,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d2b5a2e128556df62db848abb2c00391400bb49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2b5a2e128556df62db848abb2c00391400bb49/0_199_1020_1180/864.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-bodycon look: loose trousers and oversize jackets at Victoria Victoria Beckham.\" width=\"864\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-bodycon look: loose trousers and oversize jackets at Victoria Victoria Beckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Victoria Victoria Beckham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A fashion-show audience typically numbers around 500; two million people watched livestreams of the most recent New York fashion week. The exploding audience figures mean fashion week is being held to account on issues to which the fashion industry has for a long time been wilfully blinkered. Model health and body image was the first flashpoint, and continues to be a touchpaper issue, the glacial pace of change reflecting the resistance by an industry which has long played by its own rules to accept accountability. Those who have watched fashion shows for decades and long ago stopped registering the size of the models are bewildered by this new audience, who see jutting collarbones as something more significant than a handy clothes hanger. Who look at models and see not just \u201cgirls\u201d, as they are always known, but people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e43d9ce637430b0d0b65a1fba5249adf5984697c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43d9ce637430b0d0b65a1fba5249adf5984697c/0_94_3432_2059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models Bella Hadid (L) and Kendall Jenner wear Marc Jacobs pastel dreadlocks during New York fashion week 2106.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models Bella Hadid (left) and Kendall Jenner wear Marc Jacobs pastel dreadlocks during New York fashion week 2106.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the same night that the prime minister hosted Christopher Bailey and Vivienne Westwood at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-shows-britain-is-still-open-for-business-at-london-fashion-week\">Downing Street reception for British fashion</a>, Marc Jacobs walked into a furore by putting pastel woollen dreadlocks on white models on his New York catwalk. Jacobs\u2019 initial response to criticism \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t see colour or race\u201d \u2013 displayed an insensitivity, for which he has since apologised. In the year of Black Lives Matter, not seeing colour is hardly a defensible position. Coco Chanel\u2019s line about fashion reflecting the world we live in has been reproduced more often than her boucle tweed jacket, but, a century later, many designers are still slow to recognise that if fashion wants to be taken seriously in the real world, it has to play by grown-up rules. With cultural power comes responsibility, after all. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d28790092e32ece8d46eceb46b2f1ac37f3363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d28790092e32ece8d46eceb46b2f1ac37f3363/0_300_2717_2869/947.jpg\" alt=\"Exploring ideas of black male identity: Grace Wales Bonner\u2019s S/S 2016 collection.\" width=\"947\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exploring ideas of black male identity: Grace Wales Bonner\u2019s SS16 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Quarmby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some designers are still struggling to navigate their place in the newly accountable fashion industry, a generation is emerging who have an instinctive grasp of fashion\u2019s place in a connected world. Grace Wales Bonner, the British winner of this year\u2019s LVMH prize \u2013 the most valuable and prestigious in the global fashion industry \u2013 explores ideas of black male identity. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen enough images of black men looking really aggressive, very hypersexualised or \u201cstreet\u201d. That\u2019s not how I think about men at all. That\u2019s not the men in my life,\u201d she said last year of her ultra-elegant menswear.</p> <p>The key trends of this London fashion week were a speeded-up business model, gender-fluidity, and outsider chic. Which is all very well, except it doesn\u2019t really explain what to wear. The more interesting fashion week becomes, the less significant the trends on the catwalk feel. My tip for the standout look as seen at this London fashion week? Forget Burberry\u2019s Cavalry jacket, or Christopher Kane\u2019s Roadkill skirt. I\u2019m calling it for the asymmetric white party shirt, as seen at Downing Street on Theresa May.</p>",
  "<p>Military convoys carrying nuclear weapons through Britain\u2019s cities and towns have experienced 180 mishaps and incidents, including collisions, breakdowns and brake failures during the last 16 years, according to a report produced by a disarmament campaign.</p> <p>The incidents catalogued in the report \u2013 based on official logs released under the <a href=\"http:// EMBARGOED midnight - for launch at 7am on web - for print tonight Military convoys carrying nuclear weapons through Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cities and towns have suffered 180 mishaps and incidents, including collisions, breakdowns and brake failures, during the last 16 years, according to a new report produced by a disarmament campaign. The incidents catalogued in the report - based on official logs released under the freedom of information act - include fuel leaks, overheating engines, clutch problems and other mechanical faults in the convoys. At other times, according to the report, the convoys went the wrong way, were diverted and lost communications with commanders. The rate at which the incidents have occurred has risen in recent years, with 43 in the last three years. In its report published on Wednesday, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) warns that a serious accident involving the convoys could spread radioactivity over cities, contaminating communities and increasing cancer risks. The convoys pass through cities and towns between Scotland and southern England. However an opinion poll commissioned by ICAN shows that nearly two-thirds of British adults did not know that the military transports nuclear warheads on British roads, prompting the campaigners to argue that members of the public have not given their consent to the dangers they pose. Materials for nuclear weapons are driven through or flown over 122 local councils in the UK, including densely-populated areas such as Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and Newcastle, according to Ministry of Defence data. A spokesman for the MoD said (something like) the convoys are safe - incidents were minor an accident leading to a leak of radioactivity is highly unlikely and there has never been a discharge of radioactivity The ICAN report describes how nuclear warheads are carried in dark green, 44-tonne trucks between a bomb factory at Burghfield in Berkshire and a naval depot at Coulport on Loch Long near Glasgow, where they are loaded onto submarines. The 900-mile round trips, usually spread over one or two days, are completed between two and six times a year, with the most recent one reported to have been completed this week. According to ICAN, the convoys - comprising up to 20 vehicles including police cars and a fire engine - use a variety of routes. No 10 blocks move to end nuclear secrecy Read more One from Burghfield, where the warheads are assembled and maintained, goes along the M40, round Birmingham and past Preston on the M6, and then the M74 to Glasgow. Another takes the convoy round London on the M25 and then north on the M1 via Leeds and Newcastle and then the A1 or A68 to Edinburgh and the M9 to Stirling. In January last year, the convoy travelled through the centre of Glasgow during a fierce storm, according to the report. The short descriptions of the incidents released by the MoD in response to freedom of information requests do not disclose where most of them happened. Two occurred in May 2013. After a rest break at a military base, one of the vehicles in the convoy came into unspecified contact with a parked civilian vehicle, and on another occasion, two convoy vehicles were involved in what the MoD said was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cminor road traffic collision\u00e2\u0080\u009d that left \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarks to bumper on one vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u009d. There was another collision with a parked car at an MoD base in January 2014. The campaigners said that one of the most dangerous mechanical failures happened in July 2011 when one of the vehicles broke down on the M6 in Cheshire. The vehicle had suffered \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sudden and dramatic loss of power and was forced to pull onto the hard shoulder of the motorway\u00e2\u0080\u009d along with the rest of the convoy, according to the MoD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report of the incident. It closed two lanes of the motorway and resulted in 10-mile tailbacks. The incident was caused by a manufacturing fault which had to be rectified across the whole fleet, according to the report. Other incidents include delays caused by poor weather such as snow, computer software glitches, and traffic jams. MoD catalogues its nuclear blunders Read more The convoys are necessary because Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear weapons need to be returned to Burghfield periodically so they can be refurbished or dismantled.

Global tax rules are handled by the OECD, and Europe insisted that it should stay that way. But speaking from Quito before the UN general assembly, Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Long\">Guillaume Long</a>, said he was confident things would be different this time.</p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama papers</a> have shone a spotlight on the murky world of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/tax-havens\">tax havens</a>,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the countries are talking about it. When I have meetings with foreign ministers we always discuss the issue \u2026 A year ago that wasn\u2019t the situation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a major issue for my counterparts in their respective domestic politics \u2026 and in terms of the way they look at global governance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31b91e04c6a7659258b10759e6dce1aa2193a912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b91e04c6a7659258b10759e6dce1aa2193a912/1_0_5165_3100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The revelations that came out of the Panama papers have changed everything, Long says.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The revelations that came out of the Panama papers have changed everything, Long says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long said countries had different reasons for wanting greater transparency about tax havens. For EU and North American countries there is a concern about their role in dispensing funds for terrorism or in concealing the profits of violent crime. While in the global south, leaders are more concerned with economic justice and the development that greater tax receipts could fund.</p> <p>Some dismiss the proposal as idealistic after it was so <a href=\"http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/07/global-tax-body-sticking-point-at-financing-conference-in-addis/\">thoroughly quashed</a> last year. But Long pointed out that Ecuador had proved itself capable of similar feats of political persuasion in the recent past. It has clamped down hard on tax avoidance by its own citizens \u2013 tripling its tax take in the process, he said. And it successfully led the charge to <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/binding-treaty/un-human-rights-council-sessions\">create a binding UN instrument to bring transnational corporations to account</a> for human rights violations.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole UN system is based on bringing states to account. But in today\u2019s world it\u2019s not just states that violate human rights,\u201d said Long. \u201cWe in Ecuador know this. We\u2019ve had terrible human rights violations by multinationals.\u201d <br></p> <p>Last year Ecuador was given the mandate to preside over a committee which is drafting a law to hold multinationals that commit human rights offences to account. </p> <p>Long admitted that sufficient support for the creation of a new UN body wouldn\u2019t appear overnight but, he said, \u201cthere is a growing consensus that tax havens need to be tackled\u201d. He thought this week\u2019s UN meeting would be the \u201claunch of the final chapter in this fight. It\u2019s been an ongoing battle, but I think the time is right.\u201d </p> <p>Many studies have underlined the positive impact that shutting down tax havens could have for the developing world. <a href=\"http://www.international-adviser.com/news/1027020/inequality-tol-stay-tax-havens-oxfam#sthash.tkgphCFm.dpuf\">Oxfam estimates that</a> wealthy individuals hold $7.6tn offshore, and that the tax on that wealth could amount to $190bn annually. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/18/developing-countries-debt-eurodad-report\">Developing countries lose $2 for every $1 gained, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Eclac) estimates that Latin America <a href=\"http://www.cepal.org/en/news/tax-evasion-latin-america-totals-340-billion-dollars-and-represents-67-regional-gdp\">loses $340bn a year</a> through tax evasion.</p> <p>Ecuador\u2019s own clampdown on tax avoidance has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/19/ecuador-radical-exciting-place\">a success</a>. Long said that in 2006 tax returns amounted to $3.5bn a year, while at the close of 2014 they were up to $14.5bn.</p> <p>He stressed that the vast majority of the increase in returns is due to better collection rather than tax increases: \u201c92% of this increase is from greater efficiency, through greater transparency, and through fighting tax evasion and tax dodging.\u201d</p> <p>Setting up a UN body to regulate tax should help end the destructive competition between countries. There has long been a race to the bottom in the tax game, with countries offering ever lower tax rates, tax breaks and greater secrecy in order to attract multinationals and wealthy individuals. <br></p> <p>Long said that some countries have been victims of their own underdevelopment. \u201cSome island countries [that] have resorted to practices that are harmful to everybody \u2026 are themselves not necessarily extremely wealthy.\u201d</p> <p>He admitted that getting those countries on board would be challenging. \u201cWe need to plan a transition for them to move away from certain financial practices and \u2026 we need to convince them that we are not trying to threaten their economy or prosperity.\u201d <br></p> <p>If Long is able to secure a vote on the issue, it is likely to be decided on a simple majority. There may well be opposition: it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/ten-reasons-why-european-governments-should-back-global-tax-body\">the EU who rejected the idea of a global tax body</a> at Addis Ababa in 2015, with the UK and France especially vocal against it.</p> <p>For Long to secure victory from last year\u2019s defeat he will need to make sure his own record on tax havens is exemplary: he is keenly aware that other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/iceland-prime-minister-resigns-over-panama-papers-revelations\">politicians have not covered themselves in glory</a>.

  "<p>At midday on 31 August, a silent and subversive music event happened inside Parliament House. Milling among the gaggles of children on school excursion were about 15 unacquainted visitors distinguished by one thing: all wore earphones and walked the same route through the building\u2019s public zones.</p> <p>I was one of them. That morning, as instructed by the artists, I downloaded an album from Bandcamp called Kill Climate Deniers: Listening Party Mix and headed to Parliament House. I parked between gleaming government-issued cars, walked to the forecourt and pressed play. Over ambient sound came the disembodied voice of the Canberra musician Reuben Ingall. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/debunking-malcolm-roberts-the-case-against-a-climate-science-denier\">Debunking Malcolm Roberts: the case against a climate science denier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are plain-clothed police officers patrolling every floor.

How does a normal person act? Be like that.\u201d</p> <p>Easier said than done. Ingall\u2019s concept album was based on a playscript called Kill Climate Deniers by the experimental theatremaker David Finnigan. The play is a hostage drama about an eco-terrorist attack on Parliament House with the tagline: \u201cWhat happens when the unstoppable force of climate change meets the immovable object of Australian politics?\u201d</p> <p>Even before the volley of gunfire during the song Music to Shoot Climate Activists To, Ingall\u2019s \u201cbangers\u201d were an unsettling score for a Parliament House stroll.

It\u2019s an era thing, says Finnigan. \u201cIt\u2019s been 28 years since [Nasa scientist] James Hansen testified to the US Congress that climate change had commenced. Around that time Chicago house and Detroit techno arrived in the UK with all the cheap ecstasy and kicked off the second summer of love.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike a lot of current dancefloor music, these tracks aren\u2019t smart or self-referential.

Which fits nicely with the extinction theme that Julian Hobba, artistic director of Aspen Island Theatre Company, sees as \u201cthe hard kernel sitting at the heart of the [Finnigan\u2019s] play\u201d. </p> <p>Hobba commissioned the work but it hasn\u2019t yet been performed as the traditional stage play it was written to be. In late 2014 the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt discovered Finnigan had received funding from Arts ACT. Bolt hadn\u2019t read the play \u2013 it was still in development \u2013 but the title was enough. </p> <p>\u201cHow does the ACT government justify spending taxpayers\u2019 money on a theatre work entitled Kill Climate Deniers?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/act-government-donates--to-kill-climate-deniers-project/news-story/1dc34e7614ced0ca80939889403b6541\">he wrote</a>. \u201cWhat sane government donates to a project urging others to kill fellow citizens, even as a \u2018joke\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Others decried it too, sight unseen.

He is out of money and says \u201cit can\u2019t be a shambolic, rough-as-guts first go because there is an audience waiting for it to fail\u201d.

Driving to Canberra for the listening party, I realised I had no idea of the major political parties\u2019 policies on climate change, even though an election campaign had just lapsed. It was the second sitting day of parliament yet I heard nothing about the environment. There was talk of new, even more alarming data on the Great Barrier Reef but according to Finnigan, data doesn\u2019t help anymore. </p> <p>\u201cThe assumption by the scientific community in the 90s was that all people needed was the evidence, provided clearly and straightforwardly,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we know about confirmation bias and the echo chamber effect and we can see evidence is never going to be enough to change people\u2019s minds.

  "<p>\u201cWe are all micro mine owners.\u201d<br></p> <p>This is the mantra preached by Veena Sahajwalla, a materials scientist at the University of New South Wales who wants to fundamentally change how we perceive our electronic waste: not as trash, but as treasure. </p> <p>Electronic waste, or \u201ce-waste\u201d, is full of valuable resources: a tonne of mobile phones, which is roughly equivalent to 6,000 handsets, contains about 130kg of copper, more than 3kg of silver, 340 grams of gold and 140 grams of another precious material known as palladium. </p> <p>\u201cWe have almost 25m mobile phones just in Australia,\u201d says Sahajwalla. \u201cAnd these are the ones not in use.\u201d Add to that the huge numbers of TVs, computers, tablets and appliances laying around our homes and that\u2019s a lot of opportunity. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not capitalising. </p> <p>Globally e-waste is an intensifying problem. Between 2009 and 2014, the amount of e-waste generated worldwide doubled, hitting 42m metric tonnes per year. According to a report by the United Nations University, the combined estimated value of the resources embedded in that waste was A$69bn (US$52bn). </p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://unu.edu/media-relations/releases/discarded-kitchen-laundry-bathroom-equipment-comprises-over-half-of-world-e-waste-unu-report.html#info\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than one-sixth was diverted</a> to proper recycling plants.</p> <p>E-waste is challenging to recycle because it contains a spectrum of mixed resources, but also toxins such as mercury, arsenic, chromium and lead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/energy-storage-how-an-abandoned-goldmine-will-be-converted-into-a-world-first\">Energy storage: how an abandoned goldmine will be converted into a world first</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is one of the world\u2019s largest generators of e-waste, producing more than 15.2kg per inhabitant each year. Regionally, Oceania is second only to Europe in that metric.</p> <p>Safe recycling of e-waste in Australia has traditionally been limited to high-cost, industrial-scale smelting facilities. Despite efforts to improve management, huge amounts of e-waste still end up in landfill, where toxins can leach into the environment, contaminating soil and groundwater, and posing public health risks. The charity <a href=\"http://www.cleanup.org.au/au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clean Up</a> estimates that just 10% of the seven million TVs and computers purchased each year in Australia are recycled correctly.</p> <p>Large amounts of e-waste are also exported from industrial economies like Australia to the developing world, where regulations are less stringent. In some places, these hazardous materials are processed by labourers in unsafe working conditions.</p> <p>Sahajwalla wants to make e-waste processing safer and more profitable. As part of her Australian Research Council laureate fellowship, she\u2019s developing the fundamental science to transform the resources in e-waste into a range of valuable products.</p> <p>She is currently developing the prototype for a low-cost alternative to industrial-scale smelting, which will be based at UNSW. The concept is simple yet innovative: portable micro-factories, roughly the size of a shipping container, which can be deployed at collection sites in suburbs, remote communities and throughout the developing world. Sahajwalla is collaborating with industry on the project.</p> <p>These micro-factories will churn out high-value metal alloys, ceramics, composites and nanomaterials, while simultaneously eliminating any hazardous impact. As the materials already have market value, they could benefit niche manufacturers producing everything from jewellery to marine hardware, says Sahajwalla.</p> <p>The technical challenge is what Sahajwalla calls selective thermal transformations: working out how to create the valuable products efficiently using precisely controlled, high-temperature chemical reactions in a small-scale furnace.</p> <p>If her team can overcome the hurdles, the benefits are clear: micro-factories decentralise recycling, allowing e-waste to be processed locally where it\u2019s collected. This helps eliminate emissions associated with shipping the waste across huge distances to recycling plants.</p> <p>Sahajwalla says large-scale smelters have a high energy cost because they need to extract metal from ore bodies, which have been produced from upstream mining activities. \u201cParts of what we are processing start their life in an e-waste, in a metallic form,\u201d says Sahajwalla. \u201cSo you\u2019re saving on energy to begin with. The energy saving is a no-brainer.\u201d</p> <p>Sahajwalla says micro-factories will also create new business opportunities for small recyclers, who can transition from being collectors of waste to manufacturers of high-value products.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/22/cheap-and-clean-australian-company-creates-hydrogen-with-near-zero-emissions\">Cheap and clean: Australian company creates hydrogen with near-zero emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe idea absolutely has legs,\u201d says Anna Littleboy, the research director of CSIRO\u2019s mineral futures project, which has studied how to improve metal recovery from e-waste. </p> <p>Just as 3D printing will enable the manufacturing industry to move away from bulk production, distributed micro-factories will enable on-demand recycling. \u201cYou process stuff as it comes in,\u201d says Littleboy. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stockpile and store it to get that economy of scale.\u201d</p> <p>She agrees it will open up new opportunities for niche manufacturers and small recycling outfits but says the current systems in Australia are designed to support \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d operations. \u201cIn the past in Australia, this has been the big smelters.\u201d</p> <p>But Littleboy says centralised e-waste recycling facilities, like those developed in Europe, are impractical in Australia because of the geography and population density.</p> <p>With micro-factories, there is \u201cgreat potential for Australia to do something a little bit different around e-waste from the rest of the world\u201d, she says.</p> <p>Littleboy says the key technical hurdle will be adapting well-understood chemical reactions to a smaller scale, to efficiently separate valuable resources and create a pure product.</p> <p>Before micro-factories make a dent on our e-waste problem, however, Australia will first need to address policy shortcomings.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479716303528\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent review</a> published in the Journal of Environmental Management found that Australia\u2019s four key pieces of legislation governing e-waste management were largely ineffective compared with countries with best practice systems, such as Japan and Switzerland. </p> <p>This was due in part to outdated targets, poor compliance and auditing measures, access issues for regional communities, and a lack of support for local councils tasked with running e-waste collections. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf you have a policy or a law, but then there are insufficient mechanisms to measure compliance and monitoring, then sometimes you get the shortest pathway, which might be send it to a landfill or ship it illegally to some other country,\u201d says report author Prof Graciela Metternicht, an environmental scientist at UNSW. </p> <p>Metternicht says one of the biggest problems around e-waste in Australia is a lack of reliable data. \u201cWe all rely on estimations \u2026 We go in circles, repeating numbers. What we need is some serious research that can tell us how much is collected, how much is recycled,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Metternicht says portable micro-factories are a \u201cgreat plan\u201d and should be considered, but they need to be affordable. </p> <p>With the design process still under way, Sahajwalla says the price tag for micro-factories is not yet clear, but maintains she\u2019s committed to providing a low-cost, accessible option. \u201cIf we can develop these affordable and sustainable solutions, that may well be the tipping point for how it becomes possible for a lot of developing regions to be more safely processing their e-waste.\u201d </p>",

Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, it\u2019s relevant reading:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.</p> <p>Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?\u2019</p> <p>But in America, people said: \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you become a citizen?\u2019</p> <p>America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable.</p> <p>With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America\u2019s example and work together to do more to support refugees....</p> <p>When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, it\u2019s important that President Obama is setting this example.</p> <p>When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country.</p> <p>Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a621e4b0603ea33c4669\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:18:18.009Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News talking head Sean Hannity\u2019s outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0J_EKmvYZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k0J_EKmvYZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV\">soak up each others\u2019 awesomeness</a>, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the reasons I\u2019m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he\u2019s going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government.</p> <p>He\u2019s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.</p> <p>And, of course, he\u2019s gonna build that wall.

But one that\u2019s not adequately developed.</p> <p>Instead, this show complies with a general mainstream media failure (with some notable exceptions) to explore the many complex arguments against Recognise within Indigenous Australia \u2013 arguments that bear no relation whatsoever to Bolt\u2019s assertion that recognition addresses \u201cracism by imposing an even more explicit racism\u201d.</p> <p>Indeed, many fear Recognise is merely part of a bipartisan process that assuages non-Indigenous guilt and reassures a horrified global community that Australia is at least cognisant of its Indigenous disaster space.</p> <p>Tens of millions of dollars are being spent on Recognise, with much more in the pipeline, at a time when the Abbott/Turnbull governments have cut at least $550m from Indigenous programs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander opponents of Recognise are not motivated by a concern it might discriminate against privileged white men;<strong> </strong>rather, they worry it may either have a negligible \u2013 or, conversely, profoundly negative <strong>\u2013</strong> impact on the lot of some of the world\u2019s most underprivileged people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/i-dont-want-your-recognise-campaign-its-nothing-but-a-sham\">I don't want your Recognise campaign \u2013 it's nothing but a sham | Celeste Liddle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They are concerned Recognise will impede a dramatically re-energised treaty movement and the ongoing fight to have sovereignty (and not just the people to whom it belongs) rightfully recognised and appropriately \u2013 finally \u2013 reckoned with.</p> <p>This is but another reason why choosing Bolt to represent the \u201cNo\u201d case was remiss.

I doubt it.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the Recognise consultation panel keeps hearing Indigenous voices crying out not, foremost, for recognition but for a truth and reconciliation process to deal with the horrific legacies of continental occupation and violent dispossession.</p> <p> Which of course brings it all back to land and the pressing need for treaties.

The snake then fatally bites her.

Refugees are people.\u201d Trump Jr followed up on Tuesday morning when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jr-skittles-tweet-hunting\">he shared an article</a> from a far right wing website that claimed, without evidence, that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of British women have been tortured and raped by gangs \u201ccomprised almost exclusively of Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>The firestorm caused by the younger Trump\u2019s tweet even forced a response from running mate Mike Pence who told NBC News\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell in an interview: \u201cIt is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr, when Hillary Clinton\u2019s calling for a 550% increase in the Syrian refugee program.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday came against the backdrop of another fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man, this time in Oklahoma.

As a result, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/778238281196662784\">jibed on Twitter</a>: \u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest.
