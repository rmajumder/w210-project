  "<p>The US Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein has <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/politics/jill-stein-vaccine-gmo-science/\">come under fire</a> for supposedly \u2018anti-science\u2019 statements relating to the risks of vaccines, genetically modified crops and electromagnetic fields from Wi-Fi. She said that there were \u2018real questions\u2019 about the dangers of vaccines, that GM foods have \u2018not been proven safe\u2019 and that \u2018more more research is needed\u2019 on the risks of electromagnetic fields.</p> <p>For many American liberals, who have often feel that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/science-must-be-seen-to-bridge-the-political-divide-1.12119\">science is on their side</a> in an increasingly polarised political war, her statements seem like a betrayal. While she is hardly endorsing a conspiracy, Stein is a Harvard-trained doctor and she is expected to know that these things are pretty safe.<br></p> <p>As with climate change, it is tempting to claim that the science is certain, the evidence is clear and the debate should move on. Things are rarely so black-and-white. In politics, the facts don\u2019t speak for themselves, so it falls to experts to make sense of the shades of grey. </p> <p>Experts have been having a tough time recently. Among the casualties of the Brexit campaign was the status of experts and their hard-won evidence. Michael Gove\u2019s response to elite institutions\u2019 predictions of economic calamity was that \u2018we\u2019ve had enough of experts\u2019. Much to the frustration of the Remain camp, the Leavers showed little interest in who knows what. For them, it was about <a href=\"http://www.perc.org.uk/project_posts/thoughts-on-the-sociology-of-brexit/\">who was in control</a>. In the US, Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy has <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-truth-about-post-truth-politics/\">led some to conclude</a> that we are now in an era of \u2018post-truth\u2019 politics. (We shouldn\u2019t ignore the irony that many fans of conspiracy theories label themselves \u2018Truthers\u2019). </p> <p>So what should experts do? How can governments make good decisions when any scientific claim is likely to be torn to shreds? </p> <p>Take electromagnetic fields (EMFs). We are surrounded by them. They are invisibly emitted across a range of frequencies by overhead power lines, microwave ovens and mobile phones as well as Wi-Fi routers. Scientists have known for decades that high-frequency EMFs like ultraviolet light can cause cancer. And they also know that powerful, low-frequency EMFs can cause health problems by heating up wet body tissue, which is how microwaves cook food. These well-known mechanisms provide the basis both for the regulation of new technologies and for advice that we should wear sun cream to prevent skin cancer and limit our exposure to X-rays. However, there are also some unknowns, some hints that long-term exposure to low-power EMFs may cause trouble. When these uncertainties are aired in public, scientists and campaigners have in the past been accused of scaremongering. Earlier this year, the Australian broadcaster ABC was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/12/criticism-of-catalyst-misses-the-point-no-journalist-should-be-in-thrall-to-mainstream-opinion\">seen by some as irresponsible</a> for its broadcasting of a clumsy documentary on EMF risk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/16/the-debate-about-mobile-phones-brain-cancer-and-artificial-electrosmog-its-complicated\">called \u2018Wi-Fried\u2019</a>. </p> <p>In 2000, however, scientific uncertainty was seen as sufficiently troubling to justify a new approach to the regulation of mobile phones in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201628\">In a new paper</a>, I revisit the controversy over mobile phone risks and conclude that it provides a useful model for how experts should deal with complex issues. </p> <p>Some readers may remember that, around the turn of millennium, the health scare over mobile phone EMFs was front-page news. More than a decade later, worries have largely abated. A <a href=\"http://www.mobilemastinfo.com/opinion-research/opinion-research.html\">YouGov</a> survey in 2013 measured public concern about mobiles among the population at 9%, down from 27% in 2000. Over the same period, mobile phone ownership went up from 50% of the population to almost 100%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mobilemastinfo.com/opinion-research/opinion-research.html\"><strong>Percentage mentioning handsets/masts as a concern</strong></a> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b66cd4661a3c68aa7c7b4a61370b520c0ad6838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b66cd4661a3c68aa7c7b4a61370b520c0ad6838/0_0_2666_822/1000.png\" alt=\"Base: All GB adults (2,164) P10Q1: What, if any, health-related dangers concern you most nowadays?

P15Q1: And which other health-related dangers are you also seriously concerned about?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The science of mobile phone risks has not advanced substantially. New <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601591/a-connection-between-cell-phones-and-cancer-has-been-found-should-we-be-worried/\">studies </a>continue to raise questions. <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/late-lessons-2\">Advisory bodies</a> continue to draw attention to troubling epidemiological data, criticising industry bodies for their \u2018inertia\u2019. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phone EMFs as a \u2018possible human carcinogen\u2019 (placing them alongside bacon and almost every other enjoyable food). Officially, the jury is still out of the risks of EMFs, and most of us seem to be OK with that.</p> <p>In 1999, an expert committee was established to deal with a rash of headlines about mobile phone dangers. A few people had blamed their brain tumours on their new mobile phones. Some who claimed to be \u2018electrosensitive\u2019 argued that mobile phones were making them dizzy or ill (an extreme version of this is the subject of this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/11/allergic-to-life-snowflake-arizona-video\">brilliant Guardian film</a>). Local communities were becoming more vociferous in their opposition to mobile phone masts that were springing up around them. Licences for third generation mobile phone bandwidth had just been auctioned, giving the Government a \u00a322 billion windfall.</p> <p>The response to public concerns had until this point been to reassure people that all technologies complied with guidelines that were based on the scientific fact of the heating effects of microwaves. As long as phones and phone masts were legal, they were therefore safe. As one regulatory spokesperson put it, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t heat you, then it doesn\u2019t harm you\u201d. End of conversation. Many concerned citizens were not satisfied by this response. They asked why the regulators appeared to be ignoring suggestions of so-called \u2018non-thermal effects. They asked why long-term exposures hadn\u2019t been investigated. They asked whether some groups may be less safe than others.</p> <p>Experts were no longer answering the questions that were being asked of them. The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones was created to fill the credibility gap. It was chaired by Professor Sir William Stewart, who had been the government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser at the tail end of the Mad Cow Disease (BSE) outbreak. This crisis had shaped Stewart\u2019s response to the mobile phones controversy. He told a parliamentary committee that, after BSE, \u2018Never again will any scientific committee say that there is no risk.\u2019 His group took seriously the uncertainties surrounding mobile phone risks and saw people\u2019s concerns as legitimate ones. He recommended that children should be advised not to use mobile phones, that phones should carry labels with their Specific Absorption Rates (a measure of how much energy is absorbed by body tissue over a certain time) and that mobile phone networks should be more careful with how they place their masts. He demanded that industry and government fund more research to fill gaps in knowledge on things like electrosensitivity. Following the Stewart report in 2000, the UK officially became more uncertain about the risks of EMFs. </p> <p>Expert groups are often relied upon by politicians to tidy up the facts on contentious issues. It rarely works. People don\u2019t like being patronised with easy answers where there are none to find. With mobile phones, a group of experts took a different approach. They instead admitted that there are uncertainties and trusted in citizens\u2019 ability to navigate them. When it comes to climate change, Wi-Fi, GM crops, vaccines and mobile phones, there will always be scientific grey areas. If experts want to regain their credibility, they urgently need to find ways to talk about them.</p> <p><em>This post is based <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201628\">on a new paper, \u2018Scientific Advice on the Move</a>\u2019, published as part of a special issue of Palgrave Communications. </em></p>",

She spoke with Kellyanne Conway, the pollster promoted to campaign manager in the overnight Trump campaign shake-up.</p> <p>\u201cNow we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump,\u201d Conway tells Lauren. <strong>And don\u2019t call it</strong><strong> a shake-up:</strong></p> <p>\u201cThis is an expansion at an incredibly busy time, the last 12-week homestretch for the campaign. We look at personnel as more as more. With Paul continuing as our chairman and Rick Gates as his deputy, Stephen Bannon and I have been added to what I would call the \u201ccore four\u201d of that senior team and we\u2019re going to divide responsibilities according to our best an highest uses.\u201d <br></p> <p>Q: How will she and Bannon work together?</p> <p>\u201cSteve Bannon and I have tremendous respect for each other as colleagues and as friends and we also have the trust of Donald Trump the candidate. You first of all have the trust of the candidate and the latitude \u2026 We have different styles but we have one vision.\u201d </p> <p>She said she expects to hit the campaign field and TV circuit while Bannon mans the HQ at Trump Tower. </p> <p>Q: Is the race over or just getting started?</p> <p>\u201cTwo or three things we\u2019ve all learned about Donald Trump is No 1: Don\u2019t underestimate him. No 2: You know he exceeds expectations and No 3: he also exceeds the metrics that are usually at play, meaning he over performed many of his polling averages in the primaries and the caucuses. But now we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump. I can\u2019t find a single hidden Hilary Clinton voter in the country. I\u2019ve been looking for him or her. They all seem to be out, proudly saying that their voting for Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Mr. Trump, the race isn\u2019t over because August is not October let alone November.\u201d</p> <p>Q: How does Manafort fit in on the new team?:</p> <p>\u201cWe would hope and expect Paul continues to do many of things he\u2019s been doing.

However, besides those owned by Origin, all other fossil fuel generators continued to operate far below their capacity, only offering electricity to the market for a very high cost.</p> <p>In addition, Mountain showed the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) forecasted that low wind and the interconnector maintenance would create high prices, which the generators could have responded to by ramping up supply and making solid profits.</p> <p>\u201cYet, they did not respond to that information by making more of their production available to the market,\u201d Mountain said in the report.</p> <p>\u201cHad this capacity been made available to the market at more reasonable prices, even prices far above production cost, those extreme prices would not have occurred.\u201d</p> <p>Mountain said Snowy Hydro, Engie, AGL and Energy Australia were exploiting their market power to push up prices. He said they weren\u2019t doing anything illegal, but they were taking advantage of a market that wasn\u2019t functioning properly.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a question of social license \u2013and we\u2019re seeing this in many other industries, where people are expected not just by the letter of the law but by the spirit of the law and maybe there\u2019s scope for some of that to find its way into how we think about these things,\u201d said Mountain.</p> <p>Miriam Lyons from GetUp said the market is failing to deliver the competition needed to protect consumers\u2019 interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/adelaide-charges-ahead-with-worlds-largest-virtual-power-plant\">Adelaide charges ahead with world\u2019s largest 'virtual power plant'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis shows that the answer to South Australia\u2019s problems is not more gas, but more competition. Supporting cleaner suppliers of on-demand energy \u2013 like concentrating solar thermal in Port Augusta \u2013 would be far better for consumers, and for the planet.\u201d</p> <p>Mountain conducted a detailed analysis of how much the generators gained by withholding their supply. For the past eight years, wholesale prices in South Australia averaged $64 per megawatt hour. But in the first two weeks of July it averaged $433.</p> <p>On 7 July in particular, there were 16 settlement periods (which happen every 30 minutes), occurring almost back-to-back, where the wholesale price was above $2,000 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>Mountain said it was not conceivable their marginal cost of production could have been more than $300 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>As a result, during that period the generators reaped $46m from the wholesale market. Mountain calculated they would have made only $5m if they had not charged more than $300 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>Mountain said: \u201cThe fact that these generators did not compete to get their plant dispatched when prices were many multiples of their production costs suggest that these generators stood to gain more by withholding capacity from the market or, equivalently, making it available only at extremely high prices, than by competing vigorously to offer their production to the market.\u201d</p> <p>As an example of the concentrated market power in South Australia, Mountain pointed to AGL, which owns the Torrens Island power station. \u201cIt was privatised as a single power station \u2026 It\u2019s capacity is almost equal to the average demand of South Australia,\u201d Mountain said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/windfarms-unfairly-blamed-for-south-australias-high-energy-prices\">How the campaign against South Australian windfarms backfired</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week, Dylan McConnell from the Melbourne Energy Institute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/electricity-price-spikes-caused-by-energy-companies-gaming-the-system-report-finds\">released another report</a>, which showed this sort of behaviour was occurring in South Australia, but didn\u2019t look at July 2016 so closely.</p> <p>McConnell agreed with Mountain\u2019s analysis and said one simply way of alleviating the concentration of the market was to build more interconnectors with other states.</p> <p>But he said another way was to diversify the sources of renewable energy.</p> <p>\u201cWind is absolutely the dominant renewable energy source in South Australia. And the fact is that when the wind doesn\u2019t blow, you\u2019re creating these conditions that are more susceptible to market power abuses,\u201d McConnell said.</p> <p>He said concentrated solar thermal with storage or battery technology could be one solution. But he said the caveat was this can\u2019t be owned by the owners of the current generators, since that wouldn\u2019t increase competition.<br></p> <p>McConnell questioned whether the grant made by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to AGL to install a lot of batteries in people\u2019s homes, which they would then control, was a smart move for that reason. \u201cIt\u2019s a good project.

  "<p>There was a moment at the opening of Mike Parr\u2019s career survey exhibition, Foreign Looking<em>,</em> when I began to have grave doubts. </p> <p>The opening night crowd were pressed into one of the NGA\u2019s downstairs galleries that had been stripped of everything except for Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles. We were watching Parr, frocked up in a white gown, having makeup applied by a beauty professional. The doubt suddenly flickered in my mind: is this for real? Is this what we\u2019re really here for? This is <em>absurd</em>.<br></p> <p> Once the makeup session was over, another woman drew blood from Parr\u2019s arm. This went on for some time. A woman in the crowd fainted, and there was a hubbub as NGA guards came in to see if she was OK. A young artist friend standing next to me went off to the bar and helpfully returned with a salt-encrusted Bloody Mary, my third of the evening. People around us started making jokes \u2013 \u201cI hope he gets a cookie when he\u2019s finished\u201d. </p> <p>Then part three began: Parr, somewhat shaky from having so much blood drawn, was led over to the floor in front of Blue Poles. He lay down and then, for the next five minutes, another assistant took a paint brush, dipped it into a bowl of Parr\u2019s blood, and started slashing it over the artist\u2019s dress. </p> <p>It was a Pollock, only in blood, and since the famous American abstract expressionist died in a car crash, there was an irony at play. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"743f29abe06d46d07c58e3d7ab272f7bf64a8017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/743f29abe06d46d07c58e3d7ab272f7bf64a8017/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson Pollock the Female, by Mike Parr (2016)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the greater scheme of Parr\u2019s performances, this was all fairly laid back\u2019: Mike Parr is splattered in his own blood for his 2016 performance art piece Jackson Pollock the Female</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the greater scheme of Parr\u2019s performances, this was all fairly laid back; he\u2019s had his lips sewn together on more than one occasion, burnt and punctured his legs, vomited blue dye \u2013 all those masculine performance art clich\u00e9s, but given an urgent and personal meaning in Parr\u2019s oeuvre. </p> <p>Parr began his career as a conceptual artist, and as you enter the exhibition proper there\u2019s a number of early text works including Facts About The Room (1970): one hundred statements about the room you\u2019re standing in, the first among them stating that this is a room with windows.

After more than a decade of producing performances and conceptual works, Parr began his<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>Self Portrait Project in the mid-1980s. These etchings produced using power tools such as angle grinders \u2013 no mean feat given that Parr was born with only one arm \u2013 have become renowned works in their own right within Australian contemporary art. They are an obsessive response to the idea of capturing a representation of the self through drawing, albeit one mediated by a Black and Decker; despite the heavy black lines and lakes of ink, there is a suppleness to them that is remarkable. </p> <p>The weight of Parr\u2019s Self Portrait Project is apparent in the number of attempts he\u2019s made to end it. He has done performances where he\u2019s painted out his prints in red and black paint, documenting the process on video, and earlier this year he set fire to a pile of his prints at Carriageworks, in a gesture that was somehow meant to protest global warming \u2013 how that works I\u2019m not sure. <br></p> <p>Meanwhile, his performances over the decades have oscillated between what appear to be exercises in aesthetics, to bloody political protests \u2013 including variations on the lip-sewing works \u2013 to performances such as those at the opening, where he puts on a dress and does something, like eat an apple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01d174aee99d581609dad95c737d0882f8d2572b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01d174aee99d581609dad95c737d0882f8d2572b/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Parr stands with The Golden Age (Choking), 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The weight of Parr\u2019s Self Portrait Project is apparent in the number of attempts he\u2019s made to end it.\u2019: Mike Parr stands with The Golden Age (Choking), 2011</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> As a viewer at the NGA, I was reminded of another Parr performance way back in October 1982, one that I\u2019d seen as part of a group of young art students who\u2019d bussed down to Canberra for ACT 3: a performance art festival that featured Parr, Stelarc and Dale Frank among others. The specifics of that multi-part, multi-site performance are lost to memory but some details remain: part one was secret; part two involved driving out to Lake Burley Griffin and watching Parr on another dark promontory starting a fire; and part three was spectacular. The audience was ushered into a room lined with uniformed school kids sitting in total silence. In the front of the room, a white chair with a blue lightbulb stood out like some weird robot, and in the background, outside and behind glass, was Parr stoking a huge fire. </p> <p>Like at the recent NGA performance, I was confronted by the entirely arbitrary nature of meaning in art \u2013 the random decisions about how one medium is somehow more worthy than another, how one form has more cultural relevance. What did it all mean? I still can\u2019t tell you, but the poetry of the moment has always stayed with me \u2013 and those moments of doubt only last for a second. </p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://nga.gov.au/Parr/Default.cfm\">Mike Parr | Foreign Looking</a> is showing at the NGA, Canberra until 6 November</em></p>",
  "<p>It turns out that Brazil can fill an Olympic stadium after all. On a baking day in Rio the grand old made-over Maracan\u00e3 was as near a full house as makes no difference as Brazil\u2019s Olympic odd-job of under-23s, coming men and lone global superstar set about the surprise semi-finalists Honduras. The match itself was a stroll, a 6-0 victory that resulted in Brazil taking another step towards the endgame of their own grand, slightly baffling obsession with Olympic football. In a delicious twist Brazil will play Germany, who beat Nigeria 2-0 in S\u00e3o Paulo in the other semi-final. The unscabbed wounds of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/10/brazil-argentina-kaka-robinho-world-cup\">that devastating 7-1 defeat </a>in Belo Horizonte two years ago will now dominate the buildup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/joao-havelange-president-fifa-ioc-dies\">Jo\u00e3o Havelange, president of Fifa from 1974 to 1998, dies aged 100</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was the most attended stadium event of this Olympics to date, a fact that will raise a few eyebrows, albeit not among Rio\u2019s organising committee or indeed the beleaguered political classes. A gold medal in this stadium on Saturday would drown out, however briefly, all sorts of noises off. Hence, in part, the presence so deep into the Spanish pre-season of the most important current Brazilian citizen Neymar, plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/03/manchester-city-sign-gabriel-jesus-palmeiras\">Manchester City\u2019s wonder-boy-in-waiting, Gabriel Jesus</a>, who scored two fine goals.</p> <p>More poignant than any of this was the timing of this game, for Brazil the first of the post-Jo\u00e3o Havelange years. Havelange <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/joao-havelange-president-fifa-ioc-dies\">died, aged 100, in Rio on Tuesday</a>, not far from the Jo\u00e3o Havelange Stadium \u2013 also the place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-surges-past-justin-gatlin-to-win-historic-olympic-100m-gold-in-rio\">where Usain Bolt won the 100m</a> the other day, not that anyone calls it that any more apart from the odd devout Brazilian. Rumours of a minute\u2019s silence inside the stadium for the grand old regent of world football proved mischievously unfounded. Havelange\u2019s status as the grand poobah and reigning bribe-master of Fifa\u2019s darkest hour might have precluded such a show of respect.</p> <p>However, Havelange is still revered by many in Brazil, if only for the sheer obliterating weight of his presence over the last 50 years. Forget Sepp Batter. Blatter was the Darth Vader in this set-up. Say hello instead to the emperor, whose death puts a full stop on the most extraordinary life in the history of world football governance, the last great one-man sporting tyrant.</p> <p>Things started well enough for Brazil on the pitch here as they took the lead after 15 seconds, the quickest goal in an Olympic match. The Honduran defence dithered over a loose ball. Neymar gegen-pressed eagerly and ended up bundling the ball into the net. Brazil\u2019s captain was then briefly taken off on stretcher in writhing agony, before leaping up miraculously to help Brazil to two more goals before half\u2011time.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/17/neymar-scores-14-seconds-into-brazils-semi-final-against-honduras-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v8hh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2663513\"            data-video-name=\"Neymar scores 14 seconds into Brazil's semi-final against Honduras \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b4a17fe4b0c23bfed8a69d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/17/160817BrazilNeymar_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/17/160817BrazilNeymar.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/17/160817BrazilNeymar_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/17/neymar-scores-14-seconds-into-brazils-semi-final-against-honduras-video\">Neymar scores 14 seconds into Brazil\u2019s semi-final against Honduras</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If the game soon descended into a march-past, a pageant \u2013 decorated by the odd sprite-like intervention from Neymar, resembling once again here a footballer made entirely from sherbet and unicorn mane \u2013 then this was probably fitting, too. A full house. A global TV audience. Sponsors ringing the pitch. Brazil on the march, watched in the spiffy press seats by a dark-suited knot of Fifa wonks. Let\u2019s face it. It\u2019s what Jo\u00e3o would have wanted.</p> <p>At Fifa Havelange was a colossus: shrewd, relentlessly influential. Famously he swam one kilometre every morning well into his late 90s. He swam for Brazil at the Hitler Olympics in 1936, then entered sports administration, building his own business wealth and becoming an IOC member in 1963. Brazil\u2019s rise as the football superpower of the 20th century ushered him into Fifa, where he became the first aggressively lobbied president, cuffing Sir Stanley Rous aside, flying around the world to curry votes from every biddable despot and setting the template for votes for promises, for scouting those vulnerable to influence and funds.</p> <p>In many ways Havelange served the top end of the sport brilliantly, boosting beyond all recognition the wealth and spread that is now shared by players, clubs, associations and everyone else clinging on to this galleon of plenty. When he arrived Fifa was an organisation with 11 employees, housed in decrepit offices with a leaky roof. By the time he left, in 1998, it was a $4bn business empire. Havelange increased the number of nations at the World Cup, brought smaller, poorer federations into the tent. He promoted women\u2019s football both to World Cup status and at the Olympics, albeit as a businessman rather than as part of some as-yet-unremarked feminist agenda.</p> <p>Above all he is the godfather of the sporting-corporate mega-deal, the most influential single figure in the commercial boom and tawdry fall of Big Sport as we know it. He brought us the cartoonish modern Fifa, supplicant to corporations, exclusive deals, wraparound advertising, logo intrusion. By association every gripe about grubby corporate influence, every funding shemozzle, every note of alienation also bears Havelange\u2019s prints. He is the godfather here, in every sense.</p> <p>There was something regal about the court of Jo\u00e3o, an uber-Blatter in his air of Sun-King chosen-one omnipotence. In the end his association with the bribes clearing-house ISL brought him into disgrace, Havelange and his Brazilian sidekick Ricardo Teixeira taking \u00a327m in payments in return for discounted broadcast rights. Which brings us back to Brazil\u2019s compromised <em>sele\u00e7\u00e3o</em>, who spent the second half here pretty much walking through Honduras at will. It was the commercial tie-in with Nike that led to Brazil playing friendlies all over the world (Hello Andorra!), the team a sideshow for hire, another stage in the incremental decline of Brazil as a megalith, a force of the imagination, even an elite brand.</p> <p>At the end here Neymar wandered about the pitch taking the applause of a giddy, fond, emptying full house. Brazil will now play the final in this stadium on Saturday, a moment to assuage in small part one or two sporting ghosts; and perhaps to offer quiet tribute to a grander, more compromised spectre.</p>",
  "<p>What a Games this has been for the most enduring of all global sports: sibling rivalry. Competing in the women\u2019s marathon last Sunday were a history\u2011making trio of Estonian triplets, with two additional sets of twins from North Korea and Germany also involved. Talk about keeping it in the family; to have more than one child in the same Olympic event is every pushy parent\u2019s ultimate fantasy.</p> <p>Even the treble-chance Estonians, though, cannot quite match the uniquely delicate situation facing Irish golf\u2019s identical twins, 21-year-old Leona and Lisa Maguire. Leona is the world\u2019s leading woman amateur, which would be a lovely tale in itself if Lisa were not also a player with lofty ambitions of her own.</p> <p>This week, to add another intriguing twist, Lisa is in Rio caddying for her sister. Watching the diminutive pair from Co&#xa0;Cavan, green-shirted peas from the same pod, marching down the manicured fairways of the Olympic course, gave a whole fresh meaning to the phrase \u201cOlympic family\u201d.</p> <p>Lisa, the oldest by 15 minutes, was honest enough to admit later that it has not been an entirely straightforward dynamic. Had Leona, for example, been listening to her advice? \u201cOn occasions,\u201d she muttered, the tiniest hint of sisterly impatience momentarily visible. Did she not feel a little jealous as she lugged Leona\u2019s bag around on a seriously hot morning? \u201cI\u2019d love to be playing this week, just hitting some of the shots she hits.\u201d That will be a definite yes, then.</p> <p>Sadly, the perfect solution \u2013 nipping behind a convenient bush halfway round, switching roles and giving Lisa a go on the back nine \u2013 was not a permitted option. By the time the Games reconvene in Tokyo in four years\u2019 time, however, Lisa is determined to be among the field herself, swinging clubs rather than carrying them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a better putter than Leona for sure but she probably strikes it better than I do off the tee. I\u2019m trying to work on that, she\u2019s trying to work on her putting ... we\u2019re kind of opposites on the golf course.\u201d</p> <p>Pity their opponents, either way. At the age of 11 Lisa beat more than 800 entrants to win the world under-12 championship in North Carolina; her sister came third. More recently both have enrolled on scholarships at Duke University in the United States; coming from a family of teachers, both are also extremely bright.</p> <p>So how many shots, someone asked, would Leona have to give Lisa when they next play against each other and who would win? \u201cI\u2019d play her straight up\u201d came the instant retort. \u201cThere\u2019d be no bragging rights if I didn\u2019t play her straight up. I\u2019d give her a good go; it would be a good match.\u201d</p> <p>Leona was slightly less upbeat after signing for a three-over-par opening round of 74. Despite her sister\u2019s proximity, too many putts stubbornly refused to drop. \u201cI could have had her hitting a few putts out there for me,\u201d she said with a nod.</p> <p>With the pace of play distinctly sluggish all day, their group was also on the clock from the 3rd hole onwards, adding a further element of stress.</p> <p>Great Britain\u2019s two representatives, Charley Hull and Catriona Matthew, fared better, with the 20-year-old Hull (68) tucked in right behind the pacesetters, Thailand\u2019s British Open champion Ariya Jutanugarn (six-under 65) and South Korea\u2019s Inbee Park and Kim Sei-young (66). Matthew\u2019s level-par 71 would have been better had she not plugged in a bunker on the par-four 3rd and recorded a double-bogey six, but she still has aspirations of emulating Justin Rose\u2019s triumph in the men\u2019s event. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit disappointed but I\u2019m still in it,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a lot of chances and hit some good putts which just didn\u2019t go in.\u201d</p> <p>With the hard, close-shaven Brazilian fairways putting a premium on driving accuracy even the world No1, New Zealand\u2019s Lydia Ko, occasionally found life tricky.</p> <p>The par-five 10th, a formidable dogleg with water down the left, scrub on the right and a deceptively narrow landing area, is certainly not for the faint-hearted and some rain is also being predicted for Rio in the coming days.</p> <p>Having waited 116 years for Olympic readmission, a few raindrops are not going to stop the world\u2019s best women golfers. Virtually all the top players are present, in defiance of pre\u2011Games warnings about the Zika virus. Those leading men who stayed at home may be interested to hear mosquitoes have been conspicuously absent, although the occasional snake has been spotted in the vicinity.</p>",
  "<p>Even when she had finished the race Caster Semenya did not stop running. After winning her heat she paused to catch her breath, then set off again in a brisk walk past the TV cameras, radio microphones, and outstretched dictaphones of the assembled press, all waiting for her, all wanting a comment.</p> <p>After seven years of intense, invasive and often ill-informed coverage Semenya has no desire to answer any more questions. She is unbeaten over 800m this year and in that period has run three of the four fastest times over that distance in the world. The best of them, 1min&#xa0;55.33sec, is almost a second clear of the second-fastest competitor and two seconds clear of the third. She is in such fine form that the hardest challenge for her this week may well be the press conference she will have to give if she wins.</p> <p>Semenya is not the only hyperandrogenic athlete at the Olympics. She is simply the most successful. The Indian sprinter Dutee Chand also has higher levels of testosterone than the sport\u2019s governing body, the IAAF, considers typical for a female. In 2011 the IAAF decided that it required Chand, Semenya, and all other hyperandrogenic competitors, to take hormones to reduce their testosterone levels. Semenya\u2019s times duly slowed by around six seconds.</p> <p>Chand objected and took her case to the court of arbitration for sport. She argued the IAAF was discriminating against her when it set an upper limit for women\u2019s testosterone levels. And she won. Which is why Semenya was able to stop taking those same hormones and, it seems, was able to again start running as fast as she is naturally capable of.</p> <p>Chand competed here in the women\u2019s 100m. She finished seventh in her heat. Outside India, where the story was mainly about how disappointing her performance was, there was no great media interest. Certainly nothing like the circus Semenya is having to navigate her way through. It was Chand who made the stand at Cas but Semenya who is being confronted by the reaction to the case. Her performances have pushed her into becoming the public face of this issue, a position she has no desire to be in.</p> <p>One of the incontrovertible aspects of this complicated story is that Semenya is being subjected to so much scrutiny only because she is so much better than everyone else. Chand has come and gone from the Games without receiving anything like the same attention.</p> <p>It has been suggested Chand\u2019s performance in Rio debunks some of the arguments that have been levelled against Semenya. If nothing else, it provides anecdotal evidence that high testosterone levels are no guarantee other hyperandrogenic athletes will necessarily dominate their events as Semenya does the 800m. And that, in essence, is what Cas ruled.</p> <p>It decided the IAAF had failed to prove Chand\u2019s condition gave her such a significant advantage over the other runners that she should have to take hormones to be allowed to compete with them. There was, Cas ruled, simply not enough evidence about exactly how much of an advantage Chand and other hyperandrogenic runners had over everyone else.</p> <p>So Cas suspended the IAAF\u2019s eligibility rule and gave it two years to gather better evidence to make its case. Last week Lord Coe said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/caster-semenya-sebastian-coe-iaaf-cas-testosterone-olympics\" title=\"\">the IAAF had been surprised by the ruling</a> and it planned to revisit it, and Cas, \u201cat some time over the next year\u201d. The IAAF president also added \u201cwe need to remember these are human beings\u201d and promised \u201cwe will treat this sensitively\u201d.</p> <p>Which rather makes you wonder why he made any comment at all, when he could simply have said this was not the best time or place to talk about the issue and promised to address it at a later date. One, perhaps, when Semenya was not about to compete in the world\u2019s biggest athletics meeting.</p> <p>There are legitimate positions on both sides of this argument. On the one hand all elite athletes have genetic advantages of different kinds and Semenya\u2019s is every bit as natural as, for instance, Usain Bolt\u2019s enormous stride. And whatever edge it does give her is not remotely close to matching the one male athletes have over their female counterparts.</p> <p>So why should she be considered anything other than another genetically gifted runner? On the other hand women\u2019s athletics is a \u201cprotected\u201d category in that, without it, elite athletics would be exclusively male. That protection rests on a distinction being drawn between athletes who do and do not posses the Y chromosome and the SRY gene, which directs the production of testosterone. Accepting that, you can then argue it is fair to set an upper limit <a href=\"http://sportsscientists.com/2016/07/caster-semenya-debate/\" title=\"\">for testosterone levels in women\u2019s sport</a>.</p> <p>Science aside, there is the equally thorny ethical question of whether Cas and the IAAF should be seeking to protect the rights of the minority of hyperandrogenic athletes, or the majority who feel they are competing at a disadvantage.</p> <p>It is a lot to take in and there is little agreement on it even among the experts who make a living from studying these things. No wonder then that the debate has become so inflamed and overtaken by strange remarks like the ones made by the former athlete Paula Radcliffe, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/07/22/no-longer-sport-paula-radcliffe-wades-into-semenya-debate/87439178/\" title=\"\">who suggested that</a> \u201cwhen we talk about it in terms of fully expecting no other result than Caster Semenya to win that 800m, then it\u2019s no longer sport\u201d.</p> <p>In response to that, and a couple of controversial reports<a href=\"http://www.si.com/olympics/2016/08/11/caster-semenya-2016-rio-olympics-track-and-field\" title=\"\"> in Sports Illustrated</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/caster-semenya-and-the-logic-of-olympic-competition\" title=\"\">the New Yorker</a>, the social media campaign #handsoffsemenya has exploded in South Africa. Many see this, with some reason, as the persecution of an athlete who has nothing to answer for because she has already been cleared to compete here.</p> <p>As for Semenya herself, her position is the same as it has been for so much of her career, stuck in the middle when she is off the track,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/the-return-of-caster-semenya-olympic-favourite-and-ticking-timebomb\" title=\"\"> and well out in front when she is on it</a>.</p> <h2>Semenya timeline</h2> <p><strong>19 August 2009 </strong>The 18-year-old announces herself on the global stage by winning the 800m gold at the Berlin world championships, leaving a string of rivals 30m behind her.

The link between short-term weather events and long-term changes in the climate may be tenuous, but it\u2019s just what the scientists warned about.</p> <p>Ever since the general election 15 months ago, too, the political climate has seemed as bleak as the weather has been warm; subsidies for renewables have been cut and incentives intended to encourage landowners to give permission for fracking expanded. Theresa May\u2019s restructuring of Whitehall closed down the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Yet there are glimmers of optimism, too. Decc\u2019s critics argued that it was too small and too narrowly focused to be effective in the kind of territorial battles it needed to win in government. With the right political leadership, the new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy\" title=\"\">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> could be capable of the kind of policies that people mean when they talk about joined-up government (although the Treasury will have views about that). The Paris climate summit commitment to cut carbon emissions far enough and fast enough to hold the rise in global temperatures below a maximum of 2C is helping to expand the market in renewables, not least by collapsing the appetite for investment in fossil fuels.</p> <p>Europe has doubled its power generation from green sources; in the UK it has almost quadrupled. Last year, it accounted for more than a quarter of power. But George Osborne\u2019s attack on \u201cgreen crap\u201d, along with the eurozone crisis, hit investment hard. China and the US are the big new forces in green energy production. So this is the challenge: we need nuclear to keep the lights on. But not from Hinkley C. Instead, redirect the \u00a330bn of subsidies into making the UK a good place for green investment again.</p>",

  "<p>Steve Emsley is wrong when he compares tidal lagoons with Hinkley and asks why tidal energy is not even being discussed (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/greener-alternatives-to-hinkley-point-c\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 17 August). The latest estimated cost of the lagoon proposed for Swansea Bay is \u00a31.3bn. Hinkley would produce 65 times as much electricity, all day, every day \u2013 true \u201cbaseload\u201d. Tidal lagoons would produce variable amounts (four times as much on a spring tide as on a neap tide in Swansea and a bigger difference further up the Severn estuary) and the generation would be intermittent (four three-hour blocks a day) \u2013 that\u2019s not \u201cbaseload\u201d.</p> <p>Lagoons could only produce 8% (about 25TWh a year) of the UK\u2019s electricity requirements (a figure challenged by tidal energy experts), if five others followed Swansea, each many times larger and much more costly than Swansea (many times more than \u00a35bn in total). But consent for the next two (huge lagoons further up the Severn estuary off Cardiff and Newport) is most unlikely because of various EU environmental designations (special area of conservation, special protection area etc). As to why no one is discussing them: in fact, Charles Hendry is conducting a review of tidal lagoons to assess, among other things, whether they could play a cost-effective role in the UK energy mix (see <a href=\"http://www.hendryreview.com\" title=\"\">www.hendryreview.com</a>). Some think the review was prompted by belated government realisation that the figures bandied around for lagoons just don\u2019t add up.<br><strong>Phil Jones</strong><br><em>Ynystawe, Swansea</em></p> <p>\u2022 The crown estate\u2019s support for wind power and tidal energy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/14/crown-estate-hinkley-point-nuclear-debate\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 15 August) must receive full backing from government and public, in spite of any commitments to Hinkley Point. Zero-carbon economies must be top priority worldwide.

I hear echoes of the abuse they suffered when they discuss the fate of Cassandra and Iphigenia in Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, the mean-spirited prank played on Malvolio in Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night, or the purity of Socrates\u2019 soul as he calmly drinks hemlock in his prison cell.</p> <p>Almost two millennia ago, Clement of Alexandria summarized the view of many of his contemporaries: \u201cTo act is the mark of man; to suffer the mark of the woman.\u201d It would take hundreds of years of struggle before women were considered fit to be active members of society and unfit to be treated as natural born victims. When the former slave Sojourner Truth stood up to hisses and hollers in 1853 and argued for the rights of women \u2013 and black ones at that \u2013 she acknowledged: \u201cWe have all been thrown down so low that nobody thought we\u2019d ever get up again.\u201d</p> <p>This has persisted, but my students are getting up and creating their own first chances. Despite the razor wire, steel walls and constant fear of abuse and solitary confinement, they have learned to focus on schoolwork, doing well enough to get into Columbia\u2019s program. Despite having to write papers in longhand and take exams in stifling classrooms, they delight in understanding profound ideas, constantly giving me \u2013 the so-called expert \u2013 new insights about the philosophical and literary subtleties of books I\u2019ve taught for years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/12/prisons-menstrual-pads-humiliate-women-violate-rights\">Prisons that withhold menstrual pads humiliate women and violate basic rights  | Chandra Bozelko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These women deserve a second chance.

  "<p>Marcin Reszka is a nice chap. He asks me to emphasise this point. But, goodness, he can simulate viciousness when he wants to. Reszka is an instructor in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga\">krav maga</a>, a martial art cum defence technique that is in the news because at the weekend it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/15/mps-taught-self-defence-techniques-used-by-mossad-after-murder-o/\">a company called Parli-Training was offering instruction in the art to anxious MPs and their staff</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/labour-mp-jess-phillips-installing-panic-room-at-office-following-threats\">Labour MP Jess Phillips installing 'panic room' at office following threats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-west-yorkshire\">the killing of Jo Cox</a> and with MP Jess Phillips <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/labour-mp-jess-phillips-installing-panic-room-at-office-following-threats\">resorting to installing a panic room at her constituency office</a> following threats, the issue of safety is high on the agenda among parliamentarians. Parli-Training ran a course offering what the company calls \u201curban krav maga\u201d, which it defines as \u201cpractical, quickfire techniques to use against potential day-to-day attacks\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s disarming and running,\u201d says a spokeswoman for the company. \u201cAll you are doing is buying valuable time to flee.\u201d</p> <p>The distinction Parli-Training draws between urban krav maga and military krav maga \u2013 the techniques are most associated with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/11/young-gun-life-israel-defense-forces\">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) \u2013 is largely bogus. \u201cDisarming and fleeing\u201d pretty well sums up the essence of krav maga. Avoiding a fight is the best defence of all but, if a fight does start, the exponent of krav maga sets out to make it nasty, brutish and short. As I type this, I can still feel a twinge in the windpipe, which is where Marcin Reszka comes in.</p> <p>Reszka, 35, spent three years in the Polish army before coming to the UK. He has worked as a doorman, but is now a full-time krav maga instructor. Krav maga, which means \u201ccontact combat\u201d in Hebrew, was a method of streetfighting developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imi_Lichtenfeld\">Imi Lichtenfeld</a> in Bratislava in the 1930s to enable Jews to protect themselves against fascist gangs. Lichtenfeld fled the Nazis in 1940, eventually reached Palestine, became chief instructor for physical fitness with the IDF and built the techniques of krav maga into the forces\u2019 training.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a6726d81b3486079f40662ae53902c45bd896850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6726d81b3486079f40662ae53902c45bd896850/0_795_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Moss blocks a blow.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Moss blocks a blow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lichtenfeld died in 1998, but his associates, acting rather like yoga masters, have passed on the code. Reszka learned krav maga in the Polish army and now teaches it through his company <a href=\"http://www.kravmaga-tactics.com/\">Krav Maga Tactics</a>, although he operates under the umbrella of <a href=\"http://krav-maga.com/\">Krav Maga Global</a>, whose chief instructor <a href=\"http://krav-maga.com/eyal-yanilov/\">Eyal Yanilov</a> studied with Lichtenfeld. Learning to gouge someone in the eyes or stun them with a sudden thrust to the windpipe has a long and distinguished lineage.</p> <p>Reszka is giving me an early-morning lesson in the back room of an office unit on an industrial estate in south London \u2013 very krav maga. After a conventional warmup, we get down to business. We simulate an altercation in the street. He advances; I put my hands up. He keeps coming; I shout as loudly as possible \u2013 the aim in everything you do in krav maga is to disorientate the opponent and wrest back the initiative. Shouting doesn\u2019t do the trick; he throws a punch and tries to get in a position to headbutt me; I block the punch, throw a straight right myself and kick him in the balls. Eyes, throat, groin \u2013 krav maga emphasises your opponent\u2019s most vulnerable areas and targets them mercilessly.</p> <p>Targeting the throat is incredibly effective. When the tables are turned and I do the advancing, the shock of a two-fingered jab to my windpipe sends me tumbling to the floor. It\u2019s called an \u201ceducational block\u201d because it educates me that this person is not to be messed with. It may alone be enough to defuse the danger in the situation. It certainly works with me: I am thenceforth ultra-wary of Reszka, who clearly takes his job very seriously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Krav maga is one of the best training methods for reality</p> <footer> <cite>Marcin Reszka</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cKrav maga is one of the best training methods for reality,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is more practical than traditional martial arts, and tries to give a little more edge to the drills and scenarios.\u201d The ultimate aim is to enable you to handle yourself under the sort of stress you would experience if you were attacked in the street.</p> <p>\u201cThe instructor will try to make you feel really uncomfortable to bring your heart rate up,\u201d says Reszka. When it is up, the adrenaline will be flowing and you will have great strength, but that has to be married to the defence techniques that have been drilled into you and will be retained in your \u201cmuscle memory\u201d no matter what level of stress and danger you face. That\u2019s the theory, anyway.</p> <p>We move on to headlocks. I get Reszka into one, and he demonstrates how \u2013 with my arms locked round his neck \u2013 <em>I</em> am the one who is vulnerable. He jabs the fingers of one hand into my eyes and, with the other hand, pushes me to the floor. One of the advantages of targeting the eyes and the windpipe is that it doesn\u2019t need much brute strength. It will, for instance, give a woman a fighting chance if she is attacked by a much stronger man. Speed of execution and knowing where to concentrate the attack are everything. Shouting as you launch your counter-attack is recommended: more disorientation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56cdc9761bd6eb69ffeb5354f04cb2d0232ea0e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56cdc9761bd6eb69ffeb5354f04cb2d0232ea0e2/0_595_3032_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If an attacker has a knife, you only have moments to mount your defence.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"778\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If an attacker has a knife, you only have moments to mount your defence.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reszka then shows me how to resist an attacker with a knife. Parry the thrust with your forearm, being careful to avoid the blade, throw a punch simultaneously, launch a kick or a knee to the groin and, while he is doubled up and groaning, get the hell out of there. Krav maga assumes there may be multiple attackers, so at all times you have to be scanning the area around you for sudden attacks from behind.</p> <p>When Reszka demonstrates the techniques, his speed is incredible: the counter-attack comes in a great flurry; the fight may only last seconds. If an attacker has a knife, you only have moments to mount your defence. If a couple of thrusts with a knife get through, you may be incapable of further resistance. Speed of thought and movement are everything.</p> <p>Despite the odd technical deficiency (and a dodgy knee), I have learned a lot in an hour. About 40% of Reszka\u2019s clients are learning krav maga for their jobs: police officers who want to be more streetwise; prison guards who fear knife attacks; bodyguards; doormen. The other 60% are doing it for fitness, to feel safer on the streets and to boost their confidence. Krav maga is empowering and, as I limp out of the makeshift gym, I really do feel a better, stronger person. Albeit one who, after that jab to the throat, is having some difficulty speaking.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2016 to correct the number years Reszka spent in the Polish army before coming to the UK.</p>",

Its cash haul put it in the right position to capitalise on the rise of the internet in the second half of that decade, providing the physical infrastructure that underpinned much of the dotcom bubble. Most importantly, its large enterprise switches were essentially the only hardware capable of supporting the bandwidth requirements of major internet service providers, giving Cisco a near-monopoly.</p> <p>As a result, by the midpoint of the dotcom bubble, it had grown to become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalisation of more than $500bn. Just two years later after the dotcom bubble burst, that had collapsed to just $51bn. It has recovered since then and now stands at about $153bn \u2013 making it still one of the world\u2019s largest publicly listed companies, but dwarfed by tech sector market leaders such as Google owner Alphabet ($533bn) and Apple ($584bn).</p> <p>During the past decade Cisco retrenched into its core market, while making continual attempts to become a household name, both in its own right and through acquisitions such as Linksys (known for its range of small office and home routers) and Flip (known for its standalone video cameras). But the hardware business was eaten away almost as quickly as it was set up, with commodity manufacturing in east Asia undercutting many of the products, even as the rise of the smartphone did away with many types of single-purpose consumer electronics.</p> <p>The company\u2019s focus is on the possibilities offered by the internet of things (IoT), the broad term for the return of small, single-purpose electronics. The difference this time is that those devices are networked, ideally allowing Cisco to focus on doing what it does best: provide the plumbing that allows the rest of the IT sector to do its work. The company has invested in a number of small IoT startups, including London-based, smart-products company EVRYTHNG, and <a href=\"https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=1728762\">in November opened an office near London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout </a>focused exclusively on the sector.</p> <p>At the same time, the company remains a behemoth in the enterprise networking sector, with up to 7,000 employees in the UK alone. The majority of these employees are focused on providing services to corporate customers. <br></p> <p>The company\u2019s British operations are led from a sprawling campus near Heathrow, with satellite offices in central London, Reading, Manchester, Edinburgh and Motherwell.

Happy students post status updates about university plans and selfies with exam certificates. Proud mums and dads chime in with congratulations. Schools and colleges are equally eager to publicise the success of their high-flying pupils. But what about the ones who are disappointed with their grades?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/16/can-students-still-get-their-a-levels-re-marked\">Will students still be able to have their A-levels re-marked?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People don\u2019t tend to <a href=\"http://www.phi.org/uploads/application/files/g9g6xbfghdxoe3yytmc1rfvvm8lt1ly9sr3j369pstkojdly15.pdf\">publicise their failures online</a>. From an early age, we are socialised into a highly competitive environment. In childhood games, we learn what it means to be a winner or a loser. As we progress through school, we keep track of our accomplishments and learn to incorporate these into our identities. Even within the family environment, the idea of success and failure can loom large, with some children feeling that love is conditional and based on performance. <br></p> <p>We define ourselves by our interactions with others. The sociologist Charles Horton Cooley<strong> </strong>coined the term \u201cthe looking-glass self\u201d to describe the way we view ourselves through the reflections and reactions of others. In the social media age, this concept is more relevant than ever. </p> <h2>Great expectations</h2> <p>Students who feel that they have underperformed in their exams feel shame because they will feel that may fear losing the respect of friends and family. They could feel incompetent or that they have let people down by not living up to their expectations. They will often blame themselves and spend time raking over the past. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, social media compounds these feelings, with Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and the rest offering a constant stream of reminders that others are feeling #happy, while they are far from it.</p> <p>Social media has <a href=\"http://onemvweb.com/sources/sources/looking_at_motives_facebook.pdf\">provided us with a very public forum</a> to share information and images that would previously have been reserved for a select group of close family and friends. Research suggests that users spend 20 minutes a day checking messages, playing games and uploading information. <br></p> <p>This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Along with memes, jokes and pictures, social media has enabled widespread dissemination of information and the creation of supportive online communities. One study suggests that nearly <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/6-new-facts-about-facebook/\">44% of Facebook users will \u201clike\u201d</a> their friends\u2019 profiles, while individuals who update their statuses frequently have reported lower levels of loneliness. These sites enable us to share the happy moments in our lives with large groups of people, many of whom will cheer and congratulate us.

  "<p>When I was asked to give an opening address for <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/sick-fringe-returns-edinburgh\">The Sick of the Fringe</a>, a project commissioned by Wellcome at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into.</p> <p>I\u2019ve given many lectures and talks at universities and conferences across the country, and the world, but this one was different. With no slides, little preparation, and following a presentation that straddled the worlds of science, technology and performance art, I felt as nervous as I have ever been. </p> <p><a href=\"http://thesickofthefringe.com/\">The Sick of the Fringe</a> is a project that supports artists and theatre-makers to get outside their comfort zones, to explore new and different ways of thinking and working, and so, embracing that ethos, I stepped outside mine.</p> <p>But did I, as director of Wellcome, address a room of people from across art and performance, as well as medicine, academia and research? </p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/about-us\">Wellcome</a> is largely known as a biomedical organisation, we\u2019re much more than that. Henry Wellcome himself \u2013 an immigrant to the UK \u2013 who established his charitable foundation in the early 20th century, was an entrepreneur, an eclectic collector and a globalist. He was perfectly comfortable within the arts, the humanities, the sciences, in academia as well as within industry, and that is the spirit we preserve at Wellcome today. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94705ca6de8a2d45bca79fc35d7e0930a9755565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94705ca6de8a2d45bca79fc35d7e0930a9755565/0_116_852_511/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Farrar giving the opening address for The Sick of the Fringe.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Farrar giving the opening address for The Sick of the Fringe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Callum Bennetts/Maverick Photo Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wellcome aims to spend up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/oct/21/wellcomes-5-billion-boost-to-british-science\">\u00a35 billion over the next five years</a>, with a significant proportion of that going to artistic projects that both entertain and inspire emotional, intellectual and critical engagement with science, creating opportunities for a wider range of people to reflect on the research that affects their lives. </p> <h2>Bridges across disciplines</h2> <p>We are currently at a real reflection point in the world. In many ways, we have never had more opportunities, we are in a golden age of scientific discovery, science that has and will continue to transform the lives of millions of people around the world. But we also face some enormous global challenges. Wherever those challenges come from, we will not find solutions to them \u2013 and solutions are findable \u2013 if we just talk among ourselves. </p> <p>We are in an increasingly polarised society. Although we have access to huge amounts of information at our fingertips, we risk becoming ever narrower in our views. I worry that we often exist in isolation, talking only to people within our own communities and bubbles: scientists talking to scientists and artists talking to artists is just one example of fragmentation and division.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have to be passive observers, though. We don\u2019t have to just watch the world go by. We have the capacity to make real change in the world by working together, reaching out beyond our comfort zones and our bubbles, and building bridges across disciplines. And I believe it is our duty to do so. </p> <p>The great minds of the past, like Henry Wellcome, were not singular in their viewpoints. They were polymaths, as happy talking about art and culture as they were about the sciences. They were artists, doctors, inventors and explorers. Although modern science doesn\u2019t allow us to do that in quite the same way, it does not, and cannot, exist in a vacuum. Science must exist within the broader cultural and societal context.</p> <p>That became even clearer to me when working on Ebola during the crisis of 2014 and 2015. Alongside our partners in west Africa and across the global health community, Wellcome\u2019s work led to the development of a <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/breakthrough-search-ebola-vaccine\">vaccine</a> in less than two years. That was an incredible achievement, but in truth there wasn\u2019t a solely biomedical solution to Ebola, just as there isn\u2019t a single scientific solution to climate change, to drug-resistant infections, to the challenges of demographic shifts, urbanisation and feeding an ever growing population.</p> <h2>Holistic approach to science and society</h2> <p>With Ebola it took partnership, evidence and most importantly a deep understanding of the communities in the affected countries in which we were working that turned the epidemic around. It is this same holistic approach to science and society that will allow us to really change the world and make it a better place for the maximum number of people. </p> <p>We would love to continue to working in this way. To be an organisation that bridges gaps, that catalyses others and works together, listening and talking with those who don\u2019t look, think or work like we do. </p> <p>Although we may not see the impact of this tomorrow, next year or even for 10 or 20 years, working in collaboration and creating opportunities for informed dialogue will make a difference. We can change the course of history and together we can find solutions to some of the world\u2019s great challenges. </p> <p>And if getting over my nerves about speaking at one of the largest arts festivals in the world is a tiny example of that, then I am delighted to have played that small part.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://thesickofthefringe.com/\">The Sick of the Fringe</a> is led by artist, performer and Wellcome Engagement Fellow Brian Lobel, and co-directed by producer Tracy Gentles, of In Company Collective.

  "<p>On what would prove to be the last occasion he appeared in London, half a dozen years ago, the American vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson left his audience at <a href=\" http://www.ronniescotts.co.uk/\">Ronnie Scott\u2019s jazz club </a>spellbound with a performance that demonstrated the eloquence of his improvisations on ballads. Every now and then, however, as the echoes of tunes such as For Sentimental Reasons and Nancy (With the Laughing Face) hung elegantly in the air, he would slip off stage to inhale from an oxygen cylinder to counter the emphysema that would shortly put an end to his public appearances.</p> <p>Hutcherson, who has died aged 75, was one of the most important vibraphonists in the history of jazz. A prodigy who was already taking the stage with first-rank musicians in his native California at the age of 15, he spent his early 20s in New York, where he was quickly accepted into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/23/blue-note-at-75-royal-festival-hall-london-jazz-review\">Blue Note label</a>\u2019s distinguished repertory company, establishing his reputation on recordings alongside the saxophonists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries2\">Jackie McLean</a> and <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eric-dolphy-mn0000800100\">Eric Dolphy</a>, the guitarist Grant Green, the pianists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/herbie-hancock\">Herbie Hancock</a>, McCoy Tyner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/23/guardianobituaries.obituaries2\">Andrew Hill</a>, and others.</p> <p>His dark, ringing tone added an emotional charge to any session and the degree of melodic and harmonic sophistication inherent in his improvisations made it hard to believe that he was almost entirely self-taught. If that supreme artistry with a ballad was a late-flowering facet of his talent, then a certain lyricism had always been implicit in his playing, even in the more austere and challenging environment of the 1960s, when the music was characterised by strategic dissonance and asymmetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/17/bobby-hutcherson-five-great-performances-jazz-vibraphone\">Bobby Hutcherson: five standout performances by the jazz great</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was born in Pasadena to Eli, a stonemason, and Esther (nee Folke), a hairdresser. Thanks to his older siblings, there was always music around the house: his brother, Teddy, had been a high-school classmate of the saxophonist Dexter Gordon; and his sister, Peggy, was a singer who eventually joined <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-raelettes-mn0000893987/biography\">Ray Charles\u2019s Raelettes</a>. Encouraged by his schoolfriend <a href=\"http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pasadenastarnews/obituary.aspx?pid=88448546\">Herbie Lewis</a>, who was on his way to becoming a distinguished bassist, and inspired by the playing of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milt_Jackson\">Milt Jackson</a> on a Miles Davis album, Hutcherson saved money from a summer job with his father to buy a vibraphone, his only previous practical experience of music having come via a handful of piano lessons.</p> <p>He and Lewis rehearsed in a garage, their band soon landing a regular engagement at a Sunset Strip club called Pandora\u2019s Box. The garage gradually became a rendezvous for musicians to jam, although the band\u2019s progress was hindered when <a href=\"http://jazztimes.com/articles/129436-bobby-hutcherson-the-jazztimes-interview\">white classmates from their recently desegregated high school </a>set fire to it, destroying their instruments.</p> <p>While still in his teens, Hutcherson demonstrated his precocity on recordings with the pianist Les McCann and the saxophonist Curtis Amy. Soon the trombonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/29/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\">Al Grey</a>, a former member of Count Basie\u2019s band, asked him to join the quintet he co-led with the saxophonist Billy Mitchell. A two-week engagement in San Francisco eventually led to a trip to New York, where Hutcherson decided to stay in order to test himself against the stiffest competition in the jazz world.</p> <p>Through the trombonist <a href=\"http://www.grachanmoncur.com/biography/\">Grachan Moncur III</a> he landed a gig with the quintet of McLean, which included the 16-year-old drummer Tony Williams, soon to become famous with Miles Davis. Between 1963 and 1965, while sometimes driving a cab to supplement his income, Hutcherson appeared on McLean\u2019s One Step Beyond and <a href=\"https://100greatestjazzalbums.blogspot.co.uk/2006/07/destination-out-jackie-mclean-blue.html\">Destination \u2026 Out</a>, <a href=\"https://www.allaboutjazz.com/grachan-moncur-iii-evolution-by-clifford-allen.php\">Moncur\u2019s Evolution</a>, Dolphy\u2019s Out to Lunch and Hill\u2019s Judgment, all albums that mapped new territory for jazz. His own early Blue Note recordings, Dialogue and <a href=\"http://www.bluenote.com/artists/ron-carter/components\">Components</a>, demonstrated a generous willingness to favour the work of composers whose writing he admired, such as Hill and the drummer Joe Chambers, over his own well-turned compositions.</p> <p>In 1965, with the saxophonist <a href=\"http://www.archieshepp.net/\">Archie Shepp</a>\u2019s group, he made his first appearance at the Newport jazz festival. It was already apparent that he had taken a place in the lineage of the vibraphone after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Hampton\">Lionel Hampton</a>, who introduced the instrument to jazz in the 30s, and Jackson, a master of bebop techniques whose sound became the defining element of the immensely popular <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Jazz_Quartet\">Modern Jazz Quartet</a>.</p> <p>A minor drug infringement in 1967, and the consequent withdrawal of his police permit to work in New York nightclubs, led Hutcherson to return to California, where he would be based for the rest of his life. In 1969 he appeared as a bandleader in They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a>\u2019s film about dance marathons in the Depression. There was a featured role for him, alongside Dexter Gordon, in Round Midnight, Bertrand Tavernier\u2019s 1986 film about expatriate American jazz musicians in Paris.</p> <p>He continued to record for a variety of labels and appeared alongside his friend Harold Land, the saxophonist, in a band called the Timeless All Stars. In 1970 the success of his jazz-funk tune <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV6ZAdUuSlM\">Ummh</a> enabled him to buy an acre of land 20 miles south of San Francisco, on which he built a house for his family. From 2004 to 2008 he was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/17/jazz.johnfordham\">SF Jazz Collective</a>, whose younger musicians, including the trumpeter Nicholas Payton and the saxophonist Joshua Redman, valued the company of an elder of such charm, wisdom and manifest integrity. His influence can be heard in the playing of many younger exponents of the vibraphone, such as Stefon Harris, Warren Wolf and Lewis Wright.</p> <p>He was married first, in 1960, to Beth Buford, whom he met in high school and with whom he had a son, Barry. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1972 he married Rosemary Zuniga, with whom he had another son, Teddy. Rosemary and his sons survive him.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Robert Hutcherson, vibraphonist and bandleader, born 17 January 1941; died 15 August 2016</p>",

  "<h2>1 Recognise we already have youth who are leaders in development<br></h2> <p>Young people are already spearheading the social entrepreneurial movement across the world. My own first venture, which worked on rural solar/biomass-based electricity generation, was launched when I was 19.

Youth marginalisation now channeling young people\u2019s energy towards violence. Seven thousand young Tunisians have joined Daesh for example, even though 95% of the youth in Tunisia are educated.

Currently young activists are given their own spaces, but at the cost of not being in the room for the \u201cgrown-up\u201d discussions. Young people are equipped to interact and inform decision-making on thematic issues, so should be involved in all discussions. A great example of this is the <a href=\"https://eudevdays.eu/young-leaders\">European Development Days Young Leaders Programme</a> which involves young people in high-level panels alongside other experts in the field. <em>Marion Osieyo, editor, <a href=\"http://youngleadersfordev.org/\">EDD Young Leaders for Development</a>, and enterprise development programme officer, <a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/\">Cherie Blair Foundation for Women</a>, London, UK <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Marion_AO\">@Marion_AO</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CherieBlairFndn\">@CherieBlairFndn</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDDYoungLeaders\">@EDDYoungLeaders</a></em></p> <h2>4 Involve young people in government consultations<em><br></em></h2> <p>We need more young people participating in the nitty gritty of decision-making at local as well as global levels. For example, national policymaking in India often involves consultation with industry groups, community leaders, and other sections of society. Rarely do these involve youth consultations, and even advisory groups formed to work on youth issues such as employment do not include a single member below the age of 40. <em>Shrey Goyal</em></p> <h2>5 Acknowledge that we\u2019re not one homogeneous group<em><br></em></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/12/effective-advocacy-101-how-to-bring-about-change-in-five-steps\">Effective advocacy 101: how to bring about change in five steps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have always been so frustrated seeing \u201cyouth leaders\u201d who do not talk about race, gender or class, so I feel having more intersectional youth-led organisations should be a priority.

Supporting young people to engage socially, politically and economically and creating opportunities for them to contribute to development processes creates effective policy and builds a generation of engaged citizens. Too often, however, their engagement is inhibited by traditional, customary and legal structures that do not value their perspectives. Dramatic examples of youth engagement in political and social processes, such as the Arab spring, are often treated as threats to stability rather than opportunities to harness. <em>Saket Mani, UN global youth advocate, <a href=\"https://www.worldwewant2030.org/\">World We Want 2030</a>, Pune, India <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaketMANI\">@SaketMANI</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WorldWeWant2030\">@WorldWeWant2030</a></em></p> <h2>8 Share knowledge and experience</h2> <p>Young social entrepreneurs and civil society leaders often face issues related to resources, access, and accountability. This is where more experienced leaders can step in and provide assistance. I have seen many examples of industry leaders serving on boards of social enterprises and NGOs, partnering with younger organisations to channel funds and mentoring young entrepreneurs. <a href=\"http://www.selcoincubation.org/\">SELCO Incubation Centre</a> in India is a great example, where a mature social enterprise is helping younger ones in the same field. <em>Shrey Goyal</em></p> <h2>9 Start your own initiative to hold leaders to account</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/03/how-can-the-un-fight-inequality-when-it-doesnt-pay-its-interns\">How can the UN fight inequality when it doesn\u2019t pay its interns?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are many watchdog initiatives to hold governments accountable, it\u2019s about learning and finding solutions that respond to your own context.

  "<h2>Donald Trump shakes up campaign</h2> <p>Donald Trump has hired Stephen Bannon of the conservative website Breitbart News as campaign CEO and promoted pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager in his latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">campaign shakeup</a>. The moves represent a demotion for the Republican nominee\u2019s current campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who has presided over a period of polling declines since taking control in June.

  "<p>The internet is not always a safe place for women, so there is something hearteningly radical about women staking a claim to this space to assert their own ambitions and interests. The new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23women_writers&amp;src=typd\">#women_writers</a> hashtag does just this; a campaign to annex a little corner of the internet for women talking and supporting each other in their shared passion for writing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/australias-women-writers-still-get-far-less-attention-than-men-survey-finds\">Australia's female writers still get far less attention than men, survey finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And before anyone says this is not needed, it is: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/04/07/vida_study_women_read_more_books_but_men_get_to_write_more_book_reviews.html\">women read more fiction than men</a>, yet come up short in both publishing deals and media coverage. The annual Vida (US) and Stella (Australia) counts show consistently that there is a lingering <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2015-vida-count\">bias against women</a>. This picture is slowly improving, but women remain under-represented as book reviewers and authors reviewed. Books by women are scorned as \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/elena-ferrante-covers-bad-no-good/488732/\">domestic</a>\u201d, books about women are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/books-about-women-less-likely-to-win-prizes-study-finds\">less likely to win prizes</a>. One woman writer found that she garnered much better responses to her manuscript when she <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/06/catherine-nichols-female-author-male-pseudonym\">submitted under a male name</a>. Looking at the numbers, it is frankly unsurprising there might exist an insecurity among female writers.</p> <p>There have been grassroots movements and online activities dedicated to promoting female writers and literature in the past, but none has been quite as inclusive as #women_writers. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://womentoringproject.co.uk/\">WoMentoring Project</a> (on sabbatical until November) saw high-profile writers and women in publishing linked with aspiring female writers, agents and editors. However, as the mentorships required an application process and it was sold on the line of \u201cexceptional women supporting exceptional women\u201d, the whole campaign had a certain amount of exclusivity built in. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/read_women?lang=en-gb\">#Readwomen</a> hashtag, spearheaded by literary polymath <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/badaude\">Joanna Walsh</a>, promoted works by women, but only for already published writers. Where was the space for women to whom a book deal was little more than a speck on the horizon?</p> <p>\u201cThere seemed to be a gaping hole, when there is such an abundance of women attendees of writing and literature courses, in writers\u2019 groups and at literary festivals,\u201d says Laurie Garrison, an academic, writer and researcher. Garrison runs <a href=\"http://lookingforxanadu.co.uk/courses/\">Looking for Xanadu</a>, a blog that offers courses for women writers, and is also the mastermind behind the #women_writers hashtag. Developed <a href=\"https://storify.com/surfyorks/first-ever-women-writers-chat?utm_source=embed_header\">for a live chat</a> on underrated female writers, the hashtag immediately took off and evolved into a wider conversation on Twitter, serving as a launchpad for women to discuss their own projects. Subsequent Twitter conversations using the hashtag have been themed \u2013 a chat on self-publishing and one on women in translation. The next is set to be on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lauriebg_/status/760878702918004736\">DIY methods for online marketing</a>.</p> <p>Garrison says that the low proportion of women with book deals is not always the fault of the publishers. Based on anecdotal evidence, she believes women are less likely to send their manuscripts in the first place. \u201cI\u2019ve heard anecdotal accounts of publishers getting more submissions by men from agents, and women being much less likely to send in second submissions even if encouraged to do so when the first hasn\u2019t been accepted \u2013 and, even more bizarrely, when the first has,\u201d Garrison says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/18/imposter-syndrome-and-time-issues-why-women-dont-write-non-fiction\">Imposter syndrome and time issues: why women don't write business books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/\">confidence gap</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html\">imposter syndrome</a>\u201d perhaps account for this? The confidence gap is a theory that a disparity of self-assurance between women and men is devastating in creative industries, where self-belief can be as important as competence. But Garrison is reluctant to use these terms. \u201cI think it\u2019s become a bit of a sweeping explanation for why women don\u2019t experience as much success as men in a lot of areas,\u201d she says. \u201cIt seems to suggest that if we\u2019d all just act as confident as men, the problem would be solved. In other words, it\u2019s the women that need to change their behaviour, not the external world of publishing, education, working environment.\u201d</p> <p>Garrison has now released <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://lookingforxanadu.co.uk/women-writers-in-the-21st-century/\">a manifesto for the #women_writers hashtag</a>, laying out the need for community-building among female writers, for rejecting traditional models of publishing and for building confidence in the face of rejection. A veritable call to arms for would-be women writers, the manifesto also addresses how both men and women are conditioned to emulate masculinised practices in the workplace and how this is not necessary for success in pitching or writing.</p> <p>Almost 20 years ago, Norman Mailer dismissed writing by women as \u201calways fey, old hat, Quaintsy Goysy, tiny, too dykily psychotic, crippled, creepish, fashionable, frigid, outer-Baroque, <em>maquill\u00e9</em> in mannequin\u2019s whimsy, or else bright and stillborn\u201d. Five years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/02/vs-naipaul-jane-austen-women-writers\">VS Naipaul said there was no living female author who was his equal</a>. And this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/gay-talese-twitter-female-writers\">Gay Talese said he could not name one woman writer he admired</a>. As these attitudes persist, it is Garrison\u2019s view that we need to work to create an environment where women feel they can carve out their own space, regardless. And online, communication, community-building and innovative ways of disseminating writing can be pursued to best advantage, even with all the potential naysayers lurking on the #women_writers hashtag.</p> <p>\u201cWe need dedicated spaces for women writers to improve their technique in a non-competitive environment, learn resilience to deal with all the rejection and criticism involved in professional writing and to be able to show vulnerability without being judged,\u201d Garrison says. \u201cIf we can create spaces for women writers where these things can be discussed and put into perspective, I think it could go a long way toward levelling the playing field.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>There are more empty seats at the Rio Olympics than there would be at an IOC lecture on moral courage, given at the Etihad. It is traditional for any Olympic Games to be followed at a seemly distance by photo-stories detailing the slide into disuse of the various eye-wateringly expensive venues in the host city.

Can tickets for Rio Olympics literally not be given away? It is unclear, but seems to be the case. The problem is variously denied, ignored, described as one of VIPs not turning up because of security or refreshment delays, or only turning up for one event in a long session. Most recently, the organising committee had a new excuse, saying that a lot of people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/rio-olympics-brazil-politics-zika-virus\" title=\"\">buying tickets</a> but only using them to have a look around the Olympic Park, leaving before they\u2019d seen any sport.

Which principled stand I admire hugely. In their city, the varying degrees of scandal that attend every major modern sporting event could not be more infuriatingly obvious. The sporting industrial complex isn\u2019t pretty at the best of times in booming first world locations. In Rio it plays out like a particularly hallucinogenic question in Family Fortunes. We asked 100 people in Rio to name something they wanted, to which the answers were obviously things like \u201csanitation\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d, but the imbecilic contestant hazards: \u201cA canoe slalom venue?\u201d The recherch\u00e9 nature of many Olympic sports and the specific facilities they demand read like especially vicious satires on late-stage capitalism when you consider the appalling deprivation so nearby.</p> <p>For my own part, to survey the future white elephants deserted even during competition is to be slightly reminded of being on the most recent general election trail, where (aside from the SNP) the major parties shunned contact with the real public in favour of \u201crallies\u201d in sanitised, non-public spaces like business parks, or closed factory floors. It all felt like a pseudo-event \u2013 something that would not happen were the TV cameras not there.</p> <p>As the vast, vast majority of humans who don\u2019t travel to World Cups or the Olympics, but watch them on TV, will always tell you: these things could really be happening anywhere.

Certainly not the audience.</p> <p>The obvious solution would be so detrimental to the real business of the Olympics \u2013 money-grubbing \u2013 that it is never arrived at. Yet the Olympics are in this age permanently dysfunctional on the road. There is no decent or realistic moral argument for not permanently homing the summer Games in Greece (and the winter ones somewhere sensationally rich and alpine).

  "<p>Coral reefs are probably Earth\u2019s most life-packed ecosystem; those who\u2019ve had the privilege of diving in the tropics know the reef as an orderly riot of colour and flow, size and shape. </p> <p>Which is why a white, dead reef is so shocking \u2013 as shocking in its way as a human corpse lying on the street, which still takes the form of the living breathing person it used to be, but now suddenly is stopped forever, the force that made it real suddenly and grotesquely absent.</p> <p>When a body falls on the street, the police come to investigate. Did this person die of natural causes, or was there foul play involved? When a reef dies, we ask the scientists.

The immediate culprit was clear: the ongoing rise in global ocean temperatures that comes from climate change. But that\u2019s like saying \u201che was killed by a bullet\u201d. The important question is: who fired the gun?</p> <p>We know the biggest culprits now, because great detective work by investigative journalists has uncovered key facts in the past year. The world\u2019s biggest oil company, Exxon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/exxons-climate-lie-change-global-warming\">knew everything there was to know about climate change</a> by the late 1970s and early 1980s. Its scientists understood how much and how fast it was going to warm, and how much damage that was going to do. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding\">the company knew the scientists were right</a>: that\u2019s why they started \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d their own installations, for instance building their drilling rigs to accommodate the sea level rise they knew was coming.</p> <p>What they didn\u2019t do was tell the rest of us. Instead, they \u2013 and many other players in the fossil fuel industry \u2013 bankrolled the rise of the climate denial industry, helping fund the \u201cthinktanks\u201d and front groups that spent the last generation propagating the phoney idea that there was a deep debate about the reality of global warming. As a result, we\u2019ve wasted a quarter century in a phoney argument about whether the climate was changing.</p> <p>Had Exxon and its ilk merely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/28/imagine-if-exxon-had-told-the-truth-on-climate-change\">told the truth</a>, that argument would have been over: no one would have accused them of being \u201cclimate alarmists\u201d. We would have gone to work to solve the problem. Our work wouldn\u2019t be over by now, but it would be well advanced; the atmospheric level of CO2 wouldn\u2019t have topped 400 parts per million, and the temperature rise wouldn\u2019t be flirting with 1.5C. There would be coral bleaching, but there likely wouldn\u2019t be a coral massacre on the scale we\u2019ve seen this year.</p> <p>Which means that the victims should be angry as well as sad. The people who depend on the reefs for food, and for shelter from the waves; the economies <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/great-barrier-reef-tourists-will-go-elsewhere-if-bleaching-continues-poll\">that count on tourist dollars</a>; the people who take spiritual sustenance from the ongoing drama beneath the waves. The reefs can\u2019t be made whole again: if they recover at all it will be slowly, and in the face of ongoing warming that seems unlikely. But at the very least, the nations that sustained this damage should be compensated. Exxon and its brethren made record profits in the last decades of denial and deceit; that money should rightfully go to pay for the damage it caused, and to build the energy systems that can power our lives without destruction.</p> <p>We need to remember that there\u2019s nothing natural about this horror. It was caused, as so many crimes are, by greed. And that greed is ongoing \u2013 Exxon continues to search for more hydrocarbons, and to reject even modest changes to its policies.</p> <p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re wrapping crime scene tape this week around those bleached coral heads, those dead staghorns. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking crime scene photos with underwater cameras. That\u2019s why we\u2019re protesting on the reefs. We\u2019re not going to let them get away with murder.</p>",

Uber also objects to plans to force taxi firms to operate a London call centre and requiring drivers to have commercial insurance for vehicles even when they are not being used as private hire cars.</p> <p>\u201cThis legal action is very much a last resort,\u201d said Tom Elvidge, Uber\u2019s general manager for London. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly disappointed that, after a lengthy consultation process with Transport for London, the goalposts have moved at the last minute and new rules are now being introduced that will be bad for both drivers and tech companies like Uber.\u201d</p> <p>Initial proposals from TfL called for proficiency only in spoken English, but <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/new-private-hire-regulations\">updated plans </a>include a requirement to pass a two-hour written exam as well, which will cost \u00a3200 to sit. Drivers from a range of English-speaking countries such as New Zealand and Jamaica are not required to take the test, a discrepancy Uber is expected to challenge in court under the Equality Act.</p> <p>A TfL spokesman said: \u201cThese [measures] have been introduced to enhance public safety when using private hire services and we are determined to create a vibrant taxi and private hire market with space for all providers to flourish.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/17/tfl-plan-for-cab-drivers-written-english-test-prompts-outcry\">TfL plan for cab drivers' written English test prompts outcry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sample papers for the exams include an \u201cextended writing\u201d task in which candidates are asked to write a short essay.</p> <p>One question reads: \u201cWrite an essay (100-130 words) for your teacher about a festival in a country you know.\u201d Another reads: \u201cA friend in another town is going to study at your college and wants to know about the college rules. Write a letter to your friend (100-130 words).\u201d</p> <p>In an email to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> users, Elvidge said the exam demands a higher level of English than the British citizenship test, which only asks for speaking and listening skills.</p> <p>The requirement also exceeds the level demanded of government employees in \u201ccustomer-facing roles\u201d, such as a teaching assistant or someone answering the phone in a local authority office.</p> <p>The court case over the English test is the latest wrangle Uber has been involved in as it seeks to expand its business in London. Last October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/16/uber-wins-high-court-case-taxi-app-tfl\">the high court ruled that Uber\u2019s app was legal</a> in the city after TfL brought a case claiming the app was a taximeter, which only black-cab drivers are allowed to use.</p> <p>The English test builds on proposals set out last year by then London mayor Boris Johnson. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/20/uber-claims-victory-after-tfl-drops-proposed-restrictions\">Johnson dropped some of the most rigorous proposals</a>, such as charging operators more for a minicab licence or enforcing a minimum five-minute period between ordering a cab and starting the journey.</p> <p>Uber has faced hostility from London\u2019s black-cab drivers and taxi firms such as Addison Lee, which claim the app allows unregulated drivers free rein on the city\u2019s streets. It is also waiting to hear the result of an employment tribunal at which a group of its drivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/uber-driver-employment-tribunal-minimum-wage\">claimed they should also get the benefits received by permanent employees</a>.</p> <p>Uber\u2019s battles in London are part of a running global tussle pitting the company against taxi drivers, politicians and regulators. In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/09/french-court-fines-uber-for-running-illegal-taxi-service\">a French court fined Uber and two of its executives </a>for running an illegal transport service with non-professional drivers.</p> <p>The case concerned UberPop, the company\u2019s service that connects customers with non-professional drivers using their own cars. Courts in Italy, Spain and Germany have ruled UberPop illegal, leading Uber to switch to using professional drivers.</p> <p>Earlier in August, Uber agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/uber-china-didi-chuxing\">sell its Chinese operation to its local rival Didi Chuxing</a>, ending a year-long standoff between the companies. The deal drew a line under $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) of losses for Uber in China over the past two years.</p>",
  "<p>Los Angeles may be the entertainment capital of the United States, but rave concerts are migrating from the metropolis to valley communities near the Mojave desert \u2013 and it\u2019s not for the fresh air.</p> <p>Concert promoters have relocated festivals to poorer, inland cities in the wake of restrictions in LA over drug-related deaths.</p> <p>They have found an official welcome in cash-strapped San Bernardino County despite lawsuits and recrimination in LA, where concertgoers used to flood hospital emergency wards.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/three-dead-hard-summer-rave-california-drugs\">death of three young people</a> and the arrest of hundreds of others on drug offenses at a concert last month in Fontana, a city in San Bernardino, has triggered a fresh outcry which could eventually force festival organizers to move again.</p> <p>\u201cThe county should not be sponsoring events that clearly create an environment of illegal drug use that results in deaths,\u201d Janice Rutherford, who sits on the county board of supervisors, told the Observer. \u201cI think we should learn from the experiences in LA. It didn\u2019t work there. There are no conditions that would make it work any better here.\u201d </p> <p>Karan Slobom, a San Bernardino resident and activist, said she hoped Live Nation Entertainment, a corporate giant which runs rave franchises, would pack up and leave, no matter the estimated $1.4m revenue loss to county coffers and other losses to local businesses.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a multibillion dollar corporation and brings in the money. But there\u2019s a dark side to these raves. Those [fatalities] are somebody\u2019s kids. Somebody loved them. They had a life ahead of them.\u201d</p> <p>The recent backlash could disrupt the ambitious growth plans of festivals which have drawn top electronic dance, hip-hop and rap stars, plus legions of fans. Hard Events, a leading promoter, has dabbled in the UK, Australia and Japan and hopes to continue expanding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efb20d3c0272b0ddf20bc72ecdc59274b95a37da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efb20d3c0272b0ddf20bc72ecdc59274b95a37da/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescue personnel carry a man off the concert grounds on a stretcher at the Hard summer music festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescue personnel carry a man off the concert grounds on a stretcher at the Hard summer music festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Valenzuela/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coroners have yet to determine the cause of the deaths of Derek Lee, 22, Alyssa Dominguez, 21, and Roxanne Ngo, 22. But many observers suspect an overdose of ecstasy, a recurring culprit in a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-rave-deaths-snap-htmlstory.html\">dozen concert deaths</a> in southern California in the past decade.</p> <p>The latest tragedies will reverberate, said <a href=\"http://edmlife.com/3-dead-after-hard-summer-is-this-the-end-of-raves-in-socal/\">EDM Life</a>, an electronic dance community news website. \u201cIs this the end of raves in SoCal?\u201d</p> <p>It is not the end. More raves are planned this summer and autumn. But there is widespread concern at the human cost and business model. Such angst is a far cry from the Beach Boys\u2019 stereotype of California as a carefree music wonderland by the Pacific Ocean.</p> <p>Raves are increasingly held far from the coast in a region known as the Inland Empire, a sprawl of towns, cities and high desert east of LA. This is the California that tourists seldom see \u2013 suburbs and exurbs known not for celebrity glamour, but for gang shootings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/11/san-bernadino-bankruptcy-cash-flow\">fiscal fiascos</a>. </p> <p>The arrival of rave festivals in recent years sprinkled some stardust and dollars on the region. One reason for the migration, after all, was the concerts\u2019 burgeoning popularity and need for bigger venues.</p> <p>With attendance doubling each year, Hard Events started <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-rave-deaths-shift-20160802-snap-story.html\">moving east in 2014</a>, first to venues outside the city of LA, then outside the county of LA.</p> <p>Insomniac Events, another promoter, has held Nocturnal Wonderland raves at the the San Manuel Amphitheater in Devore, another San Bernardino community, since 2015. Live Nation Entertainment, which earned $7.2bn last year, owns Hard and Insomniac.</p> <p>The other reason to migrate, however, was that authorities and venue owners in LA recoiled in the wake of deaths, lawsuits from bereaved families and lobbying by police and first responders.</p> <p>Marc Futernick, director of emergency services at LA\u2019s Dignity Health \u2013 California Hospital Medical Center, used to see dozens of ravers wheeled in, suffering organ failure from ecstasy-induced overheating or with brain damage from excessive water intake, which lowered sodium levels.</p> <p>\u201cWe never see this pathology at any other events. There\u2019s something about the culture of these events that invites rampant drug use. We see the same pattern \u2013 tens of thousands of heavily intoxicated people. I don\u2019t see why we allow events to continue where we know we will get dozens of ill patients, several of which will die.\u201d</p> <p>The Fontana deaths, said Futernick, should be a wake-up call. \u201cEvery city should see what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re just moving out to other venues. But the pattern is the next city says: \u2018Well, we\u2019ll bring in a few extra doctors and make a few million dollars\u2019. It\u2019s insanity.\u201d</p> <p>Aware of the scrutiny, <a href=\"http://www.livenationentertainment.com/\">Live Nation</a> provided ample medical resources at the Fontana concert, including six first aid stations, three ER doctors, 20 nurses, 88 emergency medical technicians and a medevac helicopter.</p> <p>The company declined an interview request for this article but forwarded a brief statement. \u201cWe were deeply saddened to learn about the deaths of three people who attended the festival this weekend. While the causes of the deaths have not yet been determined, we ask everyone to keep them in their prayers. Our sincerest thoughts and condolences are with their family and friends.\u201d</p> <p>Missi Wooldridge, founder of Healthy Nightlife, a consulting firm, said drug emergencies were a feature of many mass gatherings and that with proper policies and resources, raves could promote harm reduction.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an opportunity to create a safe environment for young people to socialize, experience life, and protect them while they may experiment with substances. Until we get real about drug use at events, we, unfortunately, are going to keep seeing fatalities. If we can\u2019t keep drugs out of prisons, we absolutely can\u2019t keep them out of festivals and other nightlife settings.\u201d</p> <p>Intensive policing, Wooldridge added, could backfire by encouraging rave patrons to \u201cpre-load\u201d before entering. \u201cThen, during the event, the event producers and medical teams are required to deal with the burden.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The largest migration on Earth is very rarely seen by human eyes, yet it happens every day.

The consortium of scientists and divers, led by <a href=\"https://nektonmission.org/\">Nekton</a>, is backed by <a href=\"http://xlcatlin.com/\">XL Catlin</a>, which has already funded a <a href=\"http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/\">global analysis</a> of shallow water coral reefs. The new mission is looking far deeper \u2013 onwards of 150m down, further than most research that is restricted by the limits of scuba divers.</p> <p>We already know of some of the creatures of the deep \u2013 such as the translucent <a href=\"http://www.seawater.no/fauna/ctenophora/infundibulum.html\">northern comb jelly</a>, the faintly horrifying <a href=\"http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/fangtooth.html\">fangtooth</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/in-defense-of-the-blobfish-why-the-worlds-ugliest-animal-isnt-as-ugly-as-you-think-it-is-6676336/\">widely derided blobfish</a> \u2013 where the pressure is up to 120 times greater than the surface. The deep sea was further illuminated during the film director James Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/?source=hp_dl1_dsc20120325\">cramped solo \u201cvertical torpedo\u201d dive</a> to the 11km deep Mariana trench in 2012.</p> <p>Yet only an estimated 0.0001% of the deep ocean has been explored. The Nekton researchers are discovering a whole web of life that could be unknown to science as they attempt to broaden this knowledge. The Guardian joined the mission vessel Baseline Explorer in its survey off the coast of Bermuda, where various corals, sponges and sea slugs have been hauled up from the deep.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time we look in the deep sea, we find a lot of new species,\u201d said Alex Rogers, an Oxford University biologist who has previously found a new species of lobster in the deep Indian Ocean and huge hydrothermal vents off Antarctica. </p> <p>In Bermuda, the scientists have found fossilised beaches \u2013 a remnant of the last ice age when sea levels were much lower \u2013 and large black coral forests that the locals were unaware of. \u201cThere are probably three or four new species of coral here, and some of the critters on the corals may be new too,\u201d Rogers said. </p> <p>Rogers is leading the scientific effort during a month-long survey of the three underwater volcanoes, known as seamounts, that lie near Bermuda \u2013 itself a volcano that pokes out of the north-west Atlantic. The Nekton mission, which will also include analysis of the deep sea off Nova Scotia, is recording indicators such as temperature, salinity, currents and discarded plastics.</p> <p>Mapping via sonar has also provided new data on previously unknown depths. Peer-reviewed research from the trips will be accelerated and available, it\u2019s hoped, by early next year. Nekton\u2019s next mission will be to explore the Mediterranean.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to a get a big-picture understanding because no one knows the state of the deep ocean,\u201d said Oliver Steeds, cofounder and mission director of Nekton. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a point where the most important part of the planet is the least known, which isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Steeds, a former journalist, said he was inspired by the \u201cYuri Gagarins of the deep sea\u201d \u2013 William Beebe and Otis Barton. During the early 1930s, the duo plunged into the depths in the \u201cBathysphere\u201d, essentially a hollow steel ball, after realising that submarines of the time were useless for viewing marine creatures. The bathysphere, lowered by steel cables from a ship, surveyed sites around Bermuda and descended beyond 3,000ft.</p> <p>The Nekton mission is a far cry from this. The Guardian squeezed into an extremely cosy <a href=\"http://www.tritonsubs.com/products-services/all-subs/t10002/\">two-person Triton submersible</a> lowered from the Baseline Explorer to survey the sloping face of a Bermuda seamount. The 2.5-tonne Triton vessel, comprised of a tough goldfish-bowl-like pod with ballast and thrusters that control movement, is a nimble craft initially aimed at wealthy super-yacht owners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">Coral bleaching event now biggest in history \u2013 and about to get worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dragooned into the service of science, two Triton vessels \u2013 the Nemo and the Nomad \u2013 have been taking multiple dives down to 300m to assess this patch of the Atlantic. A mechanical grabbing arm picks up samples of sponge and coral, with tubes capturing water samples.</p> <p>The light blue of the surface turns a more navy hue as we descend further, with the sun becoming hazy as if it were obscured on a very smoggy day. The warmth disappears and the light fades the further you go \u2013 by 4,000m the temperature is a little above freezing and all is dark around. </p> <p>At 150m, however, it\u2019s still possible to see the enormous walls of the Bermuda volcano, formed more than 30m years ago and, even at this depth, dotted with life. Curly whip coral is strewn across the moon-like surface. Small fish flit across the surface. Depressingly, several lion fish, a voracious invasive species that has spread from Florida, can be seen. </p> <p>The experience is much like exploring another planet in a slightly claustrophobic air bubble. And given our lack of knowledge about the deep sea, the otherworldliness felt particularly apt. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b04090f72ce599be3b3ec734c468de235d0b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b04090f72ce599be3b3ec734c468de235d0b20/0_122_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier reef, Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier reef, Australia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Conlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The state of the deep sea has been somewhat overshadowed by alarm at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">vast coral bleaching event</a>, which has decimated shallow water corals on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">Great Barrier Reef</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/el-ni%C3%B1o-revs-coral-bleaching-threat-caribbean\">Caribbean</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/coral-bleaching-spreads-to-maldives-devastating-spectacular-reefs\">Maldives</a>. Schizas says the \u201chorrible\u201d bleaching, in which prolonged high temperatures cause corals to whiten and ultimately die, has spread to Honduras and could soon reach Bermuda \u2013 the far north limit of the coral zone in the Atlantic.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report\">warming seas</a> have also become riddled with more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/full-scale-plastic-worlds-oceans-revealed-first-time-pollution\">5tn pieces</a> of discarded plastic, which cause damage throughout the food chain and have inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/22/dutch-prototype-clean-up-boom-brings-pacific-plastics-solution-a-step-closer\">ambitious inventions</a> to clean up the huge patches of seaborne garbage.</p> <p>Visible problems near the surface can percolate downwards, given the dynamic nature of life that moves up and down the water column. While coral bleaching isn\u2019t an issue for deeper corals, the excess heat being sucked up by the ocean, as well as its increasing acidity, is altering the deep sea before we even know what we are changing.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is a significant problem because it affects the means of primary food production, so there is less food going to deep water,\u201d said Rogers. </p> <p>\u201cYou also start getting more zones without oxygen. This is a worry because the deep sea carries out important ecosystem services for us, such as food production, carbon sequestration, moderating the temperature of the planet and the gases around us. They do a number of critical things that are more or less invisible to the average person on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists are still thrashing out a theory about how coral, the building block for 25% of all marine life on the planet, is replenished. If, as thought, deep sea corals help spawn replacements for shallow water corals that bleach and die, then any deterioration of these hidden creatures could trigger even steeper declines than expected as bleaching events become more common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report\">Environmental records shattered as climate change 'plays out before us'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Working this out will require ambitious scientific enquiry, something that has been sparse since the financial crash of 2008.

  "<p>When the news broke this month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/westbrom\" title=\"\">West Bromwich Albion</a> were to be t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/west-brom-takeover-chinese-investment-group\" title=\"\">aken over by the Chinese company Yunyi Guokai</a>, many were left looking for answers. The group which had bought Jeremy Peace\u2019s controlling stake was not exactly a household name. There was also an air of mystery around the consortium\u2019s front man, Guochuan Lai. The only biographical detail that people could latch on to was that he had made his money in landscape gardening.</p> <p>Curiously enough this CV entry is something Lai shares with Tony Jiantong Xia. In the late 90s Xia studied landscape design in the prestigious surrounds of Harvard University. Today he is better known as a monosodium glutamate magnate and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/19/tony-xia-revamp-aston-villa-top-three-world-owner\" title=\"\">new owner of Aston Villa</a>.

Last year the Chinese government, under the express direction of the president, Xi Jinping, published its Football Reform and Development Programme, a 50-point plan with the aim of making China a world footballing power. It has prompted a tidal wave of spending. Most notably this has been in the Chinese Super League itself with the arrival of such Premier League names as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/27/ramires-joins-jiangsu-suning-chelsea\" title=\"\">Ramires</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/11/graziano-pelle-leaves-southampton-joins-shandong-luneng\" title=\"\">Graziano Pell\u00e8</a> for huge transfer fees and even greater wages.</p> <p>But it has also meant a splurge of investment in European clubs, from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/01/manchester-city-265m-deal-chinese-investment-group\" title=\"\">Manchester City,</a> and even a controversial involvement in the Portuguese second division (the Chinese sponsor of the league had asked that each of the top 10 sides have a Chinese player in their squad \u2013 the idea was later abandoned).</p> <p>Investing in a prestige business such as football makes straightforward business sense for Chinese companies, especially with the national government looking to rebalance its economy away from low-cost exports. Marriott explains that it was the strength of West Brom as a business that made it attractive to Yunyi Guokai: \u201cIt\u2019s a club that\u2019s been run very well and has been profitable for many years.\u201d But of equal importance, it seems, is the strength of the club\u2019s academy and the sophistication of its training facilities. The expectation is that within these areas lie expertise that the Chinese can learn from and import back home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94e3fe1cca7abe1c46aa373b6804d7f9a43f9224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e3fe1cca7abe1c46aa373b6804d7f9a43f9224/0_235_4588_2754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guochuan Lai meets Tony Pulis the West Brom manager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guochuan Lai meets Tony Pulis, the West Brom manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Ashton - AMA/West Bromwich Albion FC via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe planning of new towns in China has sport at its heart,\u201d explains Marriott of the synergy that Yunyi Guokai will hope to get from its new business. \u201cThis includes building facilities for children and adults. The West Bromwich training ethos can be a model for that.\u201d This would suggest a different approach from the noughties Abramovich-esque approach to football club ownership. Rather than trying to grow the English brand in new markets, the club\u2019s expertise will be leveraged for the benefit of the domestic Chinese market. As Lai\u2019s eco towns spring up, assuming the continued support of the state government, so might Albion-affiliated training academies and local franchise teams.</p> <p>Simon Chadwick is professor of sports enterprise at Salford Business School. He believes that Chinese investment in UK clubs, and specifically those in the West Midlands, could serve an even broader political purpose. \u201cRecent moves are entirely consistent with other industrial sectors where we have seen a state-driven form of capitalism emerge in which investors and corporations appear to have been working in coordinated ways,\u201d he says. \u201cAdd to this the British government\u2019s active courting of Chinese investors, especially using football as a lever, and one can hypothesise a scenario in which Wolves, Villa and West Brom haven\u2019t just been independently acquired for football reasons alone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c02b724149134a787f9289331d9b45c87a6ba1ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c02b724149134a787f9289331d9b45c87a6ba1ea/0_123_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Xia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Aston Villa owner, Tony Xia, salutes the Villa Park crowd at their Championship match against Rotherham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What those reasons may be no one can be sure but the football investments seem consistent with other big deals in which Chinese companies have poured up to a billion pounds in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/21/sheffield-lands-billion-pound-china-deal-to-create-hundreds-of-jobs\" title=\"\"> restructuring Sheffield city centre</a> and even helped finance Gary Neville\u2019s luxury hotel in Manchester. Is this what Africans call stadium diplomacy, where the Chinese state funds new infrastructure (often sporting) in exchange for influence? \u201cThis is not stadium diplomacy,\u201d says Chadwick, \u201cbut it is football diplomacy, or HS2 diplomacy, or Northern Powerhouse diplomacy or post-Brexit diplomacy. I think football is, in part, being used as a lever in Britain\u2019s relationship with China. Football has always been a great networking channel, and the Chinese are already proving to be hugely adept at building and utilising the football network.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/15/roberto-di-matteo-tony-xia-aston-villa\">Roberto Di Matteo and Tony Xia insist Aston Villa will rise again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lever is being pulled just as West Midlands football sits at its lowest ebb in years, with only one team in the Premier League.

  "<p>American wrestler Adeline Gray sat at the Olympics the other day, thanking a fighter she\u2019s never met for making her feel beautiful. Ronda Rousey, with her vicious scowl and balled-up fists, who rants about not being a \u201cdo-nothing bitch,\u201d has changed the world for women like Gray, shattering the mirrors that say skinny only matters. For a girl who grew up wrestling boys, and the notion that doing so made her less feminine, Rousey\u2019s words were a beacon; a punch in the air with a call to follow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/gabby-douglas-hounding-american-champion-olympics\">The hounding of Gabby Douglas: an unworthy end for a great American champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think it takes someone to shine a spotlight, and I think she did that,\u201d Gray said, laughing nervously about the unprintable words that fill Rousey\u2019s soliloquies. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with how she went about it, that\u2019s not how I would have done it, but I thought she did it well. I think there\u2019s definitely a more tactful way she could have done it, but at the same time there\u2019s a lot of bigotry that goes on in women\u2019s sports and women\u2019s combat sports.\u201d</p> <p>Until Rousey stormed from Olympic judo bronze to the top of the UFC, fighting women didn\u2019t have a powerful mainstream voice. To the 25-year-old Gray, a 75kg medal hope who wrestles on Thursday, it felt like strong women didn\u2019t have a forceful voice. Rousey gave the nod that said it was OK to be tough, to fight and be proud of the feminine identity that now comes with that notion. Until Rousey, she might not have come to Rio thrilled with the strength she feels in her shoulders. Before she wore her doubt everywhere. Did she look too muscular? Did she seem too big? What did people think?</p> <p>Back in high school she wrestled boys. This is the path for any woman who wants to reach the elite level of wrestling. In order to get to the Olympics, they first have to be those girls who wrestle on a boy\u2019s team. In many places where old-fashioned notions want to keep teenage girls off the same mats as boys, the idea of a young Adeline Gray is outrageous. But she was lucky to live in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, Colorado, where the coaches welcomed her and taught her and gave her a chance.</p> <p>And yet even in that safe environment the idea of being a wrestler jarred. She was obsessed with being thin, because that\u2019s what girls did in those days. Her influence, she said, was Britney Spears. But as a 5ft 8in wrestler, she couldn\u2019t look like Britney Spears. She battled the notion of trying to be skinny when her sport demanded she have big shoulders and strong arms. She thought she fit in with her friends at school, but it was only later that she found that those same friends were scared of her. She had made herself so powerful they were afraid she\u2019d hurt them.</p> <p>\u201cI was always afraid of people mistaking me for a boy,\u201d she says. \u201cI never really had high body fat. I had slim hips and I had, like, obviously not very big breasts, and so through childhood, my concern was that I put a singlet on and people thought I looked like a boy. And I know the opposite happens when you get to high school and you get hips and a chest, and things start to get a little fluffier where boys are getting muscles. And then you are concerned on the other side of it. You are concerned that your feminine curves and cellulite is so negative in our society. And it\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p> <p>She sees what she calls \u201cbeautiful young girls\u201d coming to her wrestling club and growing horrified at the sight of themselves in the wrestling singlets. She finds herself running to each one and telling them to ignore the negative thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018The singlets aren\u2019t made for us!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not fair! I mean, these girls are 16 and 17, and their bodies can\u2019t be any more perfect for what they are. They have hard work and dedication, and they have such a negative connotation to seeing any sort of difference that\u2019s not muscular, but it\u2019s still in a range. The girls who are too buff have a lower body fat and big muscles, [they] have the concern that they are too masculine. And so it\u2019s this constant kind of tethering that you are never really pleased with your body, and it\u2019s a concern for all women, no matter if you are 16 and a non-athlete, all the way up to being an athlete. You have that kind of middle range that is perfection and never really reach it because it\u2019s constantly changing, and depending on who looks at you it\u2019s constantly changing,\u201d</p> <p>Which is why she thinks Rousey has changed everything. She sees it in the way women flock to weightlifting classes and proudly display their muscular backs. She feels that women are not judged as being too masculine if they are strong. Recently she has been mentoring a teenage wrestler from Nevada, a girl who she thinks could someday be good. A few weeks ago, the girl came to stay with her for a while. Until then, the girl had looked something like what Gray calls \u201ca tomboy.\u201d At first Gray thought that\u2019s just how the girl wanted to be, but as they talked she realized that\u2019s what the girl thought she <em>had</em> to be if she was going to wrestle.</p> <p>The day after the girl returned home, she wore a skirt to school and her mother called Gray in tears, thrilled that her daughter had learned she didn\u2019t have to look like a boy to be a wrestler.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good for me to teach young girls that you don\u2019t have to shy away from combat sports because you don\u2019t want lose your femininity,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I lost any of mine.\u201d</p> <p>This is why, when ESPN magazine asked Gray to pose naked in Body Issue, she agreed. The experience was unnerving. It\u2019s not easy to stand with strangers while not wearing any clothes. At times she worried how she\u2019d look. Would she have too much fat on her hips? Then she stopped. She has what she calls \u201can athletic female body\u201d and that\u2019s what she wanted to show. When the magazine came out she was thrilled. The photo they published made her appear strong and graceful and elegant, which is exactly the way she sees herself.</p> <p>\u201cI think it portrays all my hard work and the dedication, and what a real female body looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a Greek god by any means, with 0% body fat, with unrealistic, I guess, female proportions from a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. It\u2019s just who I am in those pictures, and I love them. It\u2019s never a bad thing when people tell you you are good at things and you look pretty.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. She loves this world of Rousey, this world of powerful women who are free to be themselves and not feel self-conscious about their strength. And yet she always wonders about the double standard, this notion that women like her will never be fully accepted, that they will forever be trapped by surface judgments. As she sat there, in a room, at the Olympic park, she thought about the US\u2019s male wrestlers, who had been in the room only a few minutes before, doing interviews behind a big table. She watched them sitting there regal in their Team USA jackets, and marveled at how easy it was for them to look purposeful and dominant, with their stoic expressions. They appeared deep in thought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/02/ufc-schedule-ronda-rousey-knee-surgery\">Ronda Rousey unlikely to fight until next year, UFC president says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She wondered about her own expressions, and lamented that she, too, couldn\u2019t look the same. And she thought of the phrase \u201cresting bitch face\u201d and how this is too often how women are judged. It annoys her that she has to be conscious of her expressions when she is sitting before people, knowing that if people see her staring seriously that she must somehow be angry. Why does it have to be like that, she wondered.</p> <p>For this, too, she admires Rousey, because Rousey doesn\u2019t worry about how her face looks. Rousey\u2019s serious face is her powerful face and she seems not to care what people think of it.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t used to seeing a strong confident female like Ronda Rousey,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAnd she gets this negative connotation. She always has this bitch face on when it\u2019s probably just her normal face.\u201d</p> <p>But now they are used to the strength. Thanks to a Olympic judo medalist turned MMA superstar there is a place for Adeline Gray, a place for the girl from Nevada, and a place for the other American women wrestlers who sit in this room beside her.</p>",

If we are to toil under our new suckered rulers, it may be prudent to examine where they came from, especially the octopuses who will likely make up the ruling class in the new mantled hierarchy. </p> <p>Living cephalopods include roughly 1000 species of octopuses, cuttlefish, nautiluses and various distinct groups of \u201csquid\u201d; ram\u2019s horn squid, bobtail squid, bottletail squid, teuthidian squid and the not-even-a-squid vampire squid. </p> <p>Cephalopods are molluscs, and weird ones at that when compared to the other mollusc groups: chitons, solenogastres, caudofoveatans, bivalves, scaphopods, gastropods and monoplacophorans. With the exception of nautiluses, living cephalopods lack an external shell. They are free-living active hunters, possess a well-developed brain and nervous system in addition to a famed reputation for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/26/paul-octopus-predict-own-death\">predicting the outcome of sporting events</a>.

With the exception of the beak, small rod-like shells in some species and a toothed radula, they lack hard parts like the cuttlebone and guard found in cuttlefish and squid respectively. Despite what popular culture may have you believe, octopuses do not have tentacles (tentacles are appendages in addition to the eight arms that only have suckers at the tips). Their bodies are gelatinous and are famously versatile, allowing them to change in colour, texture and overall shape, making identification of living octopuses from morphology alone very difficult.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/jan/29/the-secret-colourful-and-dramatic-lives-of-octopuses-uncovered-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4g8kk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2447084\"            data-video-name=\"The secret, colourful and dramatic lives of octopuses uncovered \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Peter Godfrey-Smith\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/29/1454025759937/KP_1534294_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56aaac2ee4b02808d5f289fe\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/29/1454025759937/KP_1534294_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/01/29/160129octopus_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/01/29/160129octopus_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/01/29/160129octopus.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/01/29/160129octopus_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/01/29/160129octopus_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>A small demonstration of how quickly octopuses can change shape, size and colour in the gloomy octopus <em>Octopus tetricus</em>. Source: Peter Godfrey-Smith</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So where did octopuses come from? How do they fit in with the rest of the cephalopods?</p> <p>Cephalopods have a long fossil record, the earliest certain cephalopod fossils are loosely coiled or straight shelled nautiloids found in the Cambrian of China 515 million years ago. It is hypothesised that all other cephalopods diverged from these ancestors. Nautilidan cephalopods, represented today by the six living species of nautilus are thought to have diverged from other nautiloids in the Devonian period. Around the same time as this split, geologically speaking, the straight-shelled cephalopods <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactritida\">Bactritida </a>diverged. Bactritidans are thought to be the ancestors of the ammonites, goniatites, ceratites, belemnites and all of today\u2019s major groups.</p> <p>Surprisingly, however, the palaeontology textbooks are silent when it comes to the appearance and evolution of the octopuses. My undergraduate text book, Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution by E.N.K Clarkson, only mentions octopuses in passing. <em>The</em> work on invertebrate palaeontology, the 50 volume series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Invertebrate_Paleontology\">Treatise on Invertebrate Palaeontology</a> <em> </em>started in 1953, still doesn\u2019t have a complete octopus section. This is because fossils of soft-bodied octopuses are incredibly rare. So rare are octopus fossils that one of the few people to write an accessible history of fossil octopuses, Phil Eyden, suggested in 2004 that the entire fossil record of octopuses would fit inside a suitcase. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In almost three hundred million years of octopod existence ... our entire record would fit inside a suitcase!</p> <footer> <cite>Phil Eyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The oldest fossil octopus at 300 million years old is <em>Pohlsepia mazonensis </em>from Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois. Frustratingly, the only known specimen resembles modern octopuses with the exception of possessing eight arms and two tentacles (Kluessendorf and Doyle 2000). Until the discovery of this specimen, the oldest octopus fossils were from the Jurassic period. The discovery of a much older octopus with many features of modern octopuses indicates that they have an even longer history, albeit one that is fossil poor.</p> <p>From this isolated data point, the presence of tentacles in this specimen could mean that this was the ancestral state of the group (all octopuses derived from ancestors with tentacles). Alternatively, tentacles were lost or evolved multiple times in the group. </p> <p>The second oldest species is <em>Proteroctopus ribeti </em>a single specimen from the Jurassic of France was published in 1982. This specimen does not possess tentacles but does have clear fins leading to speculation that it may be related to deep sea species such as today\u2019s dumbo octopuses or alternatively, this is a member of the vampire squid group, Vampyromorphida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7392cccfb32a1033b217296aada240a36d98e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7392cccfb32a1033b217296aada240a36d98e79/0_312_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living dumbo octopus Grimpoteuthis sp. with fins as the would be elephant ears.

These three species are differentiated by the position and shape of paired \u2018gladial vestiges\u2019 supposed to be vestigial remnants of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladius_(cephalopod)\">gladius</a> found in modern squids and which may have supported fins found in modern groups. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Fossil_Sites/Lebanese-Lagerstatt/Paleoctopus-newboldi/Paleoctopus.htm\"><em>Palaeoctopus newboldi</em></a><em> </em>from the same region in Lebanon was described in 1896, the first fossil octopus discovered, and slightly younger in geological age than the aforementioned Lebanese species. <em>Palaeoctopus </em><em>newboldi</em> is known from a number of specimens and was thought to be ancestral to modern octopuses until the 2009 Lebanese specimens showed there was already a diversity of octopus forms in the Cretaceous. A second species, <em>Palaeoctopus pelagicus</em> is known from a single gladius vestige from Mexico (Fuchs et al. 2008). </p> <p>Only one other genus of octopuses is known, two species of <em>Paleocirroteuthis </em>from the Upper Cretaceous of Canada and Japan have been described from fossil jaws alone (Tanabe et al. 2008). </p> <p>This material, alongside a few ambigious remains which defy classification and some tricky egg case trace fossils thought to made by extinct argonauts is the sum total of the palaeontological evidence of these groups. </p> <p>Returning to the original questions about where octopuses came from, this is one group where, to date, the fossil record raises more questions than it does provide answers. It\u2019s possible to dig through the (mostly freely accessible) entire literature in a day and be as informed as the experts. </p> <p>For groups of organisms like these, the lack of our knowledge about their evolutionary histories can be as interesting as what we do know about them from less than a suitcase full of fossils. At the borders of scientific knowledge, that\u2019s where the fun (educated) speculation has a part to play. Are octopuses distinct cephalopods or a weird kind of squid? What events in the past caused the extinction of most externally shelled cephalopods but lead to the modern diversity of squishier animals?

  "<p>The frenetic, isolating nature of city life can be a day-to-day struggle for millions of people. An environmental cocktail of densely packed streets and homes, cramped and lengthy commutes and noise pollution as well as significant pockets of poverty and deprivation can take their toll. As a result, mental ill health and urban life are inextricably linked.</p> <p>With urban areas expected to house two-thirds of the world\u2019s population by 2050 and some cities, such as in China, undergoing <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/happiness-and-health-in-china-the-paradox-of-progress/#https://www.brookings.edu/research/happiness-and-health-in-china-the-paradox-of-progress/\">unprecedented expansion</a>, the relationship between urban environments and mental health \u2013 and what to do about it \u2013 is rapidly coming to the fore. </p> <p>\u201cPublic health is an important component of the built environment, but all too often this focuses only on physical health,\u201d says Layla McCay, founder and director of the <a href=\"http://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/#http://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com\">Centre for Urban Development and Mental Health</a>. The thinktank was set up in 2015 to bring together researchers, policymakers and planners across the globe to push for urban space designs that create mentally healthier cities.<br></p> <h2>Projects paving the way</h2> <p>A well-designed urban space can have a positive influence on people\u2019s wellbeing and help prevent mental health problems developing or becoming worse, according to McCay.</p> <p>\u201cMental health plays a huge role in the overall burden of disease around the entire world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s prevalent in every country. The statistics do tell us that people who live in cities have a 40% increased risk of depression, a 20% increased risk of anxiety and double the risk of schizophrenia.\u201d<br></p> <p>So far, projects paving the way have tended to be small. Examples include one in Sheffield, England, says McCay, where a <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/landscape/news/improving-wellbeing-through-urban-nature-nerc-iwun-1.571819#https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/landscape/news/improving-wellbeing-through-urban-nature-nerc-iwun-1.571819\">green space parks</a> initiative, the <a href=\"http://valuing-nature.net/improving-wellbeing-through-urban-nature\">Improving Wellbeing Through Urban Nature </a>project, is aiming to promote well-designed urban green spaces as a cost-effective way to boost mental and physical health. Another is the network of <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/dementiafriendlycommunities#https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/dementiafriendlycommunities\">Dementia Friendly Communities</a> across the UK.</p> <h2>Urban living takes its toll</h2> <p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf#https://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf\">considerable body of evidence</a> (pdf) internationally suggesting that urban living, especially poorly designed environments, can have negative effects on mental health. For example, substandard, overcrowded, damp housing has been proven to affect people\u2019s capacity to cope, while the lack of something as basic as a play area can influence children\u2019s wellbeing.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, compared with non-urban areas, cities around the world have an increased prevalence of acute mental illnesses, as well as other problems such as stress and isolation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_lonely_society_report.pdf#https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_lonely_society_report.pdf\">A recent report</a> (pdf) from the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) in the UK concluded that cities becoming more crowded and the rising proportion of people living alone (up from 6% in 1972 to 12% in 2008) contributes to higher levels of loneliness, which is a risk factor for mental ill health.</p> <p>Another study, <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/poverty-and-mental-health\">Poverty and Mental Health</a>, published by the MHF for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation emphasised the adverse connections between mental health and deprivation, which tends to be most concentrated in urban areas. The report\u2019s recommendations included that policymakers consider mental health as a core part of the urban planning process, saying it \u201cshould be promoted as good practice\u201d.</p> <h2>The role of planners and architects</h2> <p>It makes sense, McCay says, to take into account, for example, that improving street lighting and housing layout might reduce fear and anxiety about safety. The same goes for using urban design to produce plentiful open, <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2013-alcock.pdf#https://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2013-alcock.pdf\">green spaces</a> (pdf) that encourage regular interaction in \u201cpro-social spaces\u201d and \u201ca sense of community\u201d with the goal of reducing isolation. <br></p> <p>\u201c[There] is a real opportunity for people who work in the planning, architecture and urban-focused professions to have an impact on mental health,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Experts at the <a href=\"http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/who/aboutthecentre.aspx#http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/who/aboutthecentre.aspx\">WHO Collaborating Centre for Healthy Urban Environments</a> at the University of the West of England (UWE), which works in tandem with the World Health Organisation\u2019s international <a href=\"http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/who/aboutthecentre/whohealthycities.aspx#http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/who/aboutthecentre/whohealthycities.aspx\">Healthy Cities Project</a>, concur that urban planning could have a substantial role to play in cities being designed with mental wellbeing in mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jun/08/city-living-bad-for-health\">Is city living bad for your health?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sarah Burgess, senior lecturer in the department of architecture and built environment at UWE, says there is definitely momentum towards mental wellness becoming a greater priority for planners globally. She points to the popularity of happiness indices internationally and to initiatives such as <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/\">Happy City</a> in Canada, which promotes wellbeing as a legitimate goal of urban design, as examples of a growing appetite for new approaches.</p> <p>But when it comes to individual cities spearheading attempts to put mental wellbeing at the centre of planning strategies, Burgess concludes that they are rare.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/who/members/visitingfellows.aspx#DanielBlack\">Daniel Black</a>, an urban planner and fellow at the WHO Collaborating Centre, while planning professionals and researchers are increasingly becoming advocates for prioritising mental health in planning decisions, there is still some way to go before decision-makers in governments catch up.</p> <p>\u201cMental health is still lagging behind,\u201d he says. \u201cEven physical health is only beginning to get on the radar. How those in control of urban development are integrating health into development is negligible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",
  "<p>One of Australia\u2019s leading members of the Jewish community has described any attempt to water down the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA) as a government signal that the public promotion of racism would be tolerated.</p> <p>Peter Wertheim, executive director of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said if the Coalition backed a bill by Liberal senator Cory Bernardi to remove \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d from section 18C of the RDA, it would be the worst possible message.</p> <p>\u201cThe removal of the words \u2018offend\u2019 and \u2018insult\u2019 from section 18C would send a signal from government that the public promotion of racism will be tolerated in Australia and will no longer be considered to violate community standards,\u201d Wertheim told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cThat would be the worst possible message to send at a time of increasing fear, insecurity and polarisation. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be a serious abrogation of principled leadership by government.\u201d</p> <p>Dissident Liberal senator, Cory Bernardi, has declared he will <a href=\"http://Fixing%20this%20problem%20begins%20with%20fixing%20Section%2018C%20of%20the%20RDA.%20While%20some%20want%20to%20abolish%20it%20in%20its%20entirety,%20a%20good%20start%20would%20be%20to%20remove%20the%20words%20%E2%80%98offend%E2%80%99%20and%20%E2%80%98insult%E2%80%99%20from%20the%20act.%20This%20has%20even%20drawn%20strong%20support%20from%20across%20the%20political%20divide.%20In%20the%20last%20parliament%20a%20Bill%20to%20this%20effect%20(which%20I%20co-sponsored)%20was%20introduced%20but%20was%20never%20voted%20upon.https//www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/14/proposed-bill-to-tone-down-australias-racial-discrimination-act-set-to-fail\">re-introduce a bill</a> to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the Racial Discrimination Act when parliament returns at the end of August.</p> <p>Wertheim also voiced concerns that if a bill passed, opponents of 18C could go further, removing the section altogether. </p> <p>\u201cIt is also clear from the comments of some opponents of section 18C that the removal of \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d would only be a preliminary step towards the wholesale repeal of section 18C and related sections of the Act,\u201d Wertheim said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea that vulnerable people should be left without any legal remedy to defend themselves against the most serious cases of racist denigration is repugnant to the principle of a fair go.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>The move will reignite a difficult debate in the Coalition party room in Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first parliamentary week since winning his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/13/labor-declares-victory-in-hindmarsh-but-falls-behind-in-herbert\">narrow election victory</a>. </p> <p>In the past week, a number of Coalition backbenchers have spoken out about the need to revive changes to the act, which were first promised by Tony Abbott ahead of the 2013 election. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/if-malcolm-turnbull-cant-fix-this-mess-tony-abbott-is-available\">If Malcolm Turnbull can't fix this mess, Tony Abbott is available | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The changes were dropped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/tony-abbott-faces-internal-backlash-over-racial-discrimination-law-change\">after widespread opposition</a>. At the time, Abbott said the reforms needed to be dropped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/race-discrimination-commissioner-backs-tony-abbotts-race-law-decision\">preserve \u201cnational unity</a>\u201d as the government planned wider security legislation in response to the global terrorism threat. </p> <p>Bernardi, who has been a regular critic of the Turnbull leadership, said section 18c of the RDA needed to change because it was \u201cOrwellian\u201d. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhile some want to abolish [18C] in its entirety, a good start would be to remove the words \u2018offend\u2019 and \u2018insult\u2019 from the act,\u201d Bernardi wrote in his weekly newsletter.</p> <p>\u201cThis has even drawn strong support from across the political divide. In the last parliament a bill to this effect (which I co-sponsored) was introduced but was never voted upon.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for that to change. In the first week back in parliament I\u2019ll be reintroducing the same bill with the expectation that this parliament will finally get a vote and expose very clearly who among your elected representatives is interested in protecting our freedoms and way of life.</p> <p>\u201cIt will also indicate those who have been captured by and surrendered to Orwell\u2019s frightening vision characterised in his book Nineteen Eighty-Four.\u201d</p> <p>The assistant agriculture minister Anne Ruston agreed in her weekly newsletter that \u201csome of the words in this section should probably go, at least\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201c\u2018Offend\u2019, \u2018insult\u2019, and \u2018humiliate\u2019 are highly subjective terms open to all manner of interpretations. Laws governing our behaviour towards others should be objective in their working as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The comments come after senator James Patterson said on Monday the senate was only \u201cone or two votes away\u201d from a passing a bill to remove \u201coffend\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d from the section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act. </p> <p>A number of Liberal sources told Guardian Australia that if a bill to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d were put to the Coalition partyroom, it would win majority support. The Bernardi bill will present a challenge for the Coalition, which will have to decide whether to allow the bill to go to the floor of the senate for debate. </p> <p>The attorney general, George Brandis, who when selling the original reforms said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/george-brandis-people-have-the-right-to-be-bigots\">everyone had the right to be a bigot</a>, has since consistently said that any change is off the table. </p> <p>The issue is building again for a number of reasons. The election of One Nation senators who support the change has emboldened Coalition senators in favour of changing the act. </p> <p>And senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/david-leyonhjelm\">David Leyonhjelm</a> has launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">discrimination complaint</a> over an opinion article describing him as an \u201cangry white male\u201d, saying it shows why the race speech law is absurd and needs to be repealed.</p> <p>While One Nation\u2019s four senators would support any bill to water down 18C, Nick Xenophon, who has three votes in the senate, is against any attempts. Of the remaining senators, Derryn Hinch of the Justice Party and Bob Day of Family First support the changes, while Jacqui Lambie is against. </p> <p> Bill Shorten has called on Turnbull to confirm whether he did a deal with the right wing of the party to change 18c, after an <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/racial-discrimination-act--malcolm-turnbull-promised-18c-changes-ahead-of-tony-abbott-spill/news-story/122263f1da4583a9cb5506a08a6eb45e\">unsourced report</a> in the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>\u201cDid Mr Turnbull do a deal with his own right wing to undermine protections against hate speech or not? \u201c Shorten said. <br></p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s office had no comment.</p>",

Or, even more unthinkably, whip gold out of the clutches of Simone Biles? Performing to the strains of Nessun Dorma\u2019s a good idea from where I\u2019m sitting. I\u2019d give her gold for that alone. The judges might not be so smitten, but it was a very experienced performance from a gymnast who\u2019s desperate to end her wait for an Olympic medal at the age of 25. It\u2019s going to be close. 14.933 is what she needs to beat to get bronze. And she\u2019s not done enough! She finishes with a score of 14.766! All of which means that Simone Biles is the Olympic champion in the floor exercise and it\u2019s an American one-two, with Aly Raisman in second. And how about Team GB\u2019s Amy Tinkler, the youngest British athlete in Rio? The 16-year-old\u2019s won a very impressive bronze medal with a score of 14.933! And she\u2019s the youngest British Olympic medalist in 32 years.

The consensus among other riders in the race who commented on the matter seemed to be that it was just one of those things that can happen in the pell-mell of race-riding, but I notice that Cavendish has been getting no end of abuse in the comments section under my report on the event and elsewhere from readers who clearly know far more about track cycling than the world\u2019s best track cyclists. <br></p> <p>Cavendish exchanged angry words with one Dutch journalist last night, who asked him if he thought he should have been disqualified from the race. The newsman in question claimed that Cavendish was getting an easy ride from British journalists who hadn\u2019t brought up the matter. They did bring up the matter, at which point the cyclist admitted the crash was entirely down to him and wished the stricken Park well.\u201d <br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/mark-cavendish-silver-rio-olympics-cycling-omnium?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Read Baz\u2019s report from last night here</a>. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:20:08.726Z\">at 4.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b32e35e4b0c23bfed8a0b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:16:56.725Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Qualification for the women\u2019s pole vault final is over - 4.60was the highest jump, and one of those who managed it was Holly Bradshaw of GB. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b32d19e4b062ce4d223ea4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:12:17.381Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ilia Zakharov, the defending champion, is out of the springboard diving.

It\u2019s not just sportspeople doing really well, such as with Van Niekerk, as that wasn\u2019t expected. It\u2019s the knowledge in advance that if you watch Biles you know basically all you need to for (all) gymnastics. Ditto Bolt and short distance running, Phelps and Ledecky for anything water. Farrah, and (not that I\u2019ve seen it) Rudisha too I guess.

We know that she is a specialist in the long, sustained, streamlined effort of the pursuit (having already won gold in the team pursuit); and sure enough she came first out of the 18 riders in that leg of the Omnium. She also won the elimination race, a sustained effort ramping up every two laps for a sprint. AND, she won the bunch sprint at the end of the points race to take second place (behind a rider who had already taken a lap over the field). Which other athletes, in any sport, consistently come out on top in disciplines with such different demands?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, agreed - I was lucky enough to be on the blog for that, and these ease with which she destroyed the field in that elimination race was awesome and bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62125afefe4d5bc6452746e1f7d73e0117ac3b0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62125afefe4d5bc6452746e1f7d73e0117ac3b0a/712_653_4480_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trott: imperious in the omnium so far.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trott: imperious in the omnium so far.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s tricky to find a similar kind of all-rounder because not much demands as much as the omnium.

Tunisian Oussama Mellouli won in the Serpentine last time around. This time, it\u2019s at the Copa, Copa Copacobana. American Jordan Wilimovsky is the one the smart people fancy. </li> <li>Wrestling! Greco Roman Wrestling. More on that in a tic with a nice little explainer for you. Flick between the velodrome and this to catch the men\u2019s 98kg div medal rounds. Armenian Artur Aleksanyan picked up bronze in London and has a couple of world champs since then. Iranian veteran Ghasem Rezaei won in London and he\u2019s there too.

The sun is through in Rio, twitter suggests. Good signs. </p> <p>Roger Kirby has some perspective on the whole topic: </p> <p>\u201cYou ask us to tell you about watching these games on tv but what about Olympics pre Internet? Depending on time zone you might have had to wait 2 days to find out results of certain events not covered on tv by buying a newspaper, your only reference was the Guinness book of records and apart from the big events, you only saw the event once, if you missed it, you had missed it forever. The difference is so vast, how far we have come in 20 years is truly amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Poses an interesting question about how we gather to watch events. Is it a more meaningful experience going through it together in places like this and social media? Or are we missing a trick by not having to be somewhere at a certain time to emphasise the importance of what we\u2019re tuning in for? Take that as a comment, like I said, forward looking from now. </p> <p>Oh, and Polly - a Londoner in Australia - says nice things about the blog like \u201cvery funny\u201d and \u201chighly informative\u201d (presumably in reference to Claire) before thinking about having a crack at the Australian TV but holding back.

Quite interesting, to those (like me, to be fair) who follow the sport once an Olympiad. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The mistake that Armour and many others have made is assuming that men\u2019s and women\u2019s gymnastics are directly comparable, when they\u2019re barely the same sport. The men compete in six events, the women in four. There is only direct overlap on two apparatuses \u2013 the vault and the floor exercise \u2013 though in the latter, the women have dance requirements in addition to the tumbling. The uneven bars is similar to the high bar though not exactly the same, and the women don\u2019t perform on any apparatuses like the pommel horse or rings.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/16/mens-womens-gymnastics-comparison-olympics\">Comparing men's and women's gymnastics is futile: they're barely the same sport</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b2e447e4b0c23bfed89f43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T10:12:35.627Z\">11.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fair bit of feedback</strong> below the line on where GB might medal (it\u2019s a verb now, I know, I hate it too) by week\u2019s end.

A special moment from the stadium, documented for us by Sean Ingle. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was the night before the Olympic 800m final, and the world\u2019s greatest middle distance runner had a message for his nation. After three years of frustration and only occasional elation following keyhole surgery on a serious knee injury, that old unmistakable tingle had returned. And he was ready to show it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And some lovely words on this topic from reader Tom Cameron</strong> about the lot in life of the 800 metre runner:</p> <p>\u201cIs the 800m the most gut wrenching of the track events? It surely is. I can recall meeting a nice fella who was the Australian 800 meter champion back circa 1996. He was the strapping boyfriend of a mate\u2019s sister who I rowed first crew with back at Ballarat Grammar - so it goes. Anyway I\u2019ve long forgotten his name but I remember him telling me success in the 800 meters is really about \u201cthe deep dig\u201d because it\u2019s quite simply just flat out, all the way round, two laps. The 800 is rare in that sense isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s all turbo but you have to reach right down into the bowels of human fortitude to find it, especially in that second lap. Hope that now middle ageing champion is doing well anyway, and watching Rio in happy comfort.

This is precisely what I\u2019m talking about. </p> <p>Here\u2019s his (edited!) story:</p> <p>\u201cUp until 2012, the BBC was the only place I had ever watched the Olympics. I watched the London Olympics on TV in the USA and it has to be my single most disappointing sports viewing experience ever. Now I live in France and I have to say that I am rather taken by the way the French cover the Olympics on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Wall to wall coverage from getting up to going to bed, one never has to be without the Olympics. I have watched events I never even knew existed - the 25m rapid fire pistol final was gripping. And ones that I did, fencing, but had never watched - who knew you could do it as a team. </p> <p>And don\u2019t let anyone ever tell you that the French hate the British. They may call the athletes competing \u201cl\u2019anglais\u201d most of the time (although they did call Andy Murray \u201cl\u2019escosse\u201d) but they seemed to be genuinely happy when a British competitor wins, especially in the cycling, really caring about how \u201cle Cav\u201d was doing. They have seemed to be happy when Murray won the tennis, Rose won the Golf and Sir Bradley Wiggins (as they insist on calling him) won his gold. And we got a bi-lingiual interview with Mo Farrah after his win on Sunday morning, which he rather sweetly ended in French.</p> <p>Right, I\u2019m off to see how they have reacted to winning silver in the Mens Pole Vault and see what todays Brazilian \u201ccooking with the presenters\u201d recipe is (hey, its France).\u201d<br></p> <p>Where are you tuning in from? <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.freelance@theguardian.com\">Tell me</a> about your experience.

  "<p>Environmentalists and indigenous reindeer herders are calling on the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Stephen Fry to disassociate themselves from a charity contracted to help a mining operation in a national park in Finland.</p> <p>Fauna and Flora International (FFI), whose patron is the Queen, has been hired by the British-listed mining company Anglo American to assess the environmental value of Viiankiaapa, a stunning 65 sq km (25 sq mile) habitat for 21 endangered bird species in the Arctic circle.</p> <p>The research includes an assessment of whether equivalent land could be offered as \u201ccompensation\u201d for wetlands damaged by the extraction of massive deposits of platinum, nickel, copper and gold.</p> <p>But Jukka Kaaretkoski, a reindeer herder of Sami ancestry from nearby Kersil\u00f6, told the Guardian that the drilling would take a heavy environmental toll and be a \u201cterminal\u201d blow for local herders whose animals graze there.</p> <p>\u201cMines cause traffic, noise, grit, pollution and contamination of water supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young reindeer herders are in danger of losing their future livelihoods because of it. We cannot even plan for the future because of the fear and insecurity. \u201d </p> <p>Riikka Karppinen, a Green party councillor in the local Sodankyl\u00e4 municipality, added: \u201cI think this is colonialism, because the big mining company has come here from another country and we are in too weak a position to protect our homeland.\u201d</p> <p>About 90 bird species live in Viiankiaapa \u2013 including pygmy owls to broad-billed sandpipers \u2013 many nesting amid the bogs and moors that host a variety of endangered plant species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c823ffd93d1da15c4175e7ab3e4e4dc5c9542cf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c823ffd93d1da15c4175e7ab3e4e4dc5c9542cf4/0_0_2231_3347/667.jpg\" alt=\"The ruff is among 90 bird species living in Viiankiaapa, many of which nest amid the bogs and moors that host a variety of endangered plant species.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ruff is among some 90 bird species living in Viiankiaapa, many of which nest amid the bogs and moors that host a variety of endangered plant species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timo Helle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But tailings \u2013 toxic waste from ore extraction \u2013 from other mining operations have been seeping into lakes and rivers around the town of Sodankyl\u00e4, according to <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/mining-boom-underway-in-finland-in-the-search-for-mineral-deposits-a-864561.html\">Der Spiegel</a>.</p> <p>Anglo American has already drilled 180 holes in the territory \u2013 more than half within a designated conservation area \u2013 although this work has been paused pending a ruling by the Finnish supreme court on an environmental appeal, now expected this autumn.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ask the Queen and those celebrities [endorsing FFI] whether they truly know what they are supporting,\u201d Kaaretkoski said. \u201cThey may think they are helping nature, or people like us to protect our land, but this work is helping to destroy these things. We would like them to disassociate themselves from it.\u201d </p> <p> Neither Fry nor Attenborough, vice-presidents of the charity, were available to respond, while Buckingham palace declined to comment, referring enquiries to FFI. </p> <p>Pippa Howard, FFI\u2019s director of business and biodiversity, said: \u201cWe are opposed to extraction in protected areas and do not promote it, but where such activities are taking place with the support of host governments, one makes sure that best environmental practice is being applied.\u201d </p> <p>FFI believes that Anglo American is committed to best environmental practice but conceded that there was \u201ca reputational risk\u201d involved in the partnership.

  "<p>I had the birds and the bees conversation with my daughter when she was around four years old.

Many of the women are educated and considered liberal in their way of thinking. They say their daughters are equal to their sons. However, they also say they want their daughters to remain virgins to protect them from harm and so that future husbands will respect them.</p> <p>What interests me about these conversations is that the women openly talked about being cheated on or beaten by their so-called respectful husbands. I nudged the women to reflect. \u201cDid remaining a virgin work for you?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid it prevent the violence and betrayal he had caused you?\u201d Many were baffled by my questions. By our second session some of the women were starting to realise that cultural patriarchy was alive and well in their homes, and they were complicit in committing the oppression they had endured against their own daughters. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sadly I only had two sessions with these women, and they left me questioning this universal obsession with virginity. I remember newspaper articles about Kate Middleton, being slut-shamed in newspaper articles for not being a virgin before marriage and rumour has it Diana had to prove her virginity before marrying Prince Charles. If a woman is sexually free or has multiple partners, society shames her and makes her feel bad about herself.</p> <p>While dating I\u2019ve been asked how many men I\u2019ve slept with. This idea of being judged based on the history of my vagina is absolutely ludicrous and another form of control of women\u2019s sexuality. My brother and all the men in my life are never asked such questions yet alone judged on them. Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners. </p> <p>I had my first sexual experience at the age of 18 with my then husband (I\u2019m currently happily divorced). I didn\u2019t make the choice to stay a virgin. I did so for two reasons. Firstly, I wasn\u2019t the girl boys were lining up to date. I was a super nerd who didn\u2019t wear makeup or pluck her eyebrows. So, no temptation or struggle for me. Secondly, my mother told me sex was great and nothing to be ashamed about. As a teenager I wasn\u2019t keen to try something my mother enjoyed (remember that trick, parents). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/29/leyla-hussein-the-women-who-made-me\">Anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein: the women who made me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remind my daughter that whenever the day comes that she wants to lose her virginity (why is it something you lose, like a precious possession?), it is no one\u2019s business but hers. If anyone tries to judge her based on her genitals, I tell her to just walk away. </p> <p>I tell her that our vaginas are very special and powerful, we bleed and give birth from them, and it\u2019s her right as a woman to enjoy sex one day. It\u2019s a beautiful and enjoyable act. Patriarchy tried to prevent me and over 200 million FGM survivors from living as sexual beings, but through therapy and a loving supportive partner many of these women can and are enjoying sex. There is hope. </p> <p>Dear world, women have sex and enjoy it, so get over the idea that virginity is something to protect. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

One of the first questions is what happens to the EU schedules. The EU, for example, can import 58,000 tonnes of top-quality steak from South America under WTO rules, but no one knows how much of that share belongs to the UK. \u201cThere will be a three-way negotiation between us, the WTO and the EU,\u201d White said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d52c27c718254c43b836109e9bd977d1ce71291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d52c27c718254c43b836109e9bd977d1ce71291/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The EU imports 58,000 tonnes of steak from South America\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The EU imports 58,000 tonnes of steak from South America under WTO rules, but Britain\u2019s share is unknown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile officials from the newly created trade department will be jetting around the globe to keep British ties with the 65 countries that have a trade agreement with the EU. </p> <p>Before the Brexit vote, leave campaigners assumed these deals would continue seamlessly.

In August of that year, the Norwegian freight ship Tampa rescued 438 asylum seekers on their way Australia. The government refused to allow the ship to dock, requesting it return them to Indonesia.<sup> </sup> </p> <p> Australia asked Nauru, a former protectorate, to accept the asylum seekers, triggering the \u201cPacific Solution\u201d. At the time, Nauru was not a signatory to the refugee convention. Under this policy, which lasted until 2008, asylum seekers bound for Australia were intercepted and detained on Nauru, or another Pacific country, Papua New Guinea, while their protection claims were processed.</p> <p> In 2012, Australia reopened detention centres in Nauru and on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island as a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d to stop relatively high number of asylum seekers arriving by boat and the accompanying deaths at sea. By this time, Nauru had signed the refugee convention.</p> <p> However, these offshore arrangements became permanent pillars of Australia\u2019s asylum policy, one based on deterring future asylum seekers through turning back boats and detention offshore. Under this policy, at least 28 boats have been turned back since 2013.</p> <p> When boats carrying asylum seekers cannot be turned back, Australia intercepts asylum seekers at sea and transfers them to Nauru and Papua New Guinea under bilateral agreements with both countries. Asylum seekers have been held in closed immigration detention for indefinite periods, though it is important to note that since October 2015 Nauru has operated as an open centre.</p> <h2><strong>Context to the Nauru files</strong></h2> <p> Even before the release of the Nauru files, significant evidence of human rights concerns had been reported in both offshore centres. Last year the UN Committee Against Torture reported conditions of \u201covercrowding, inadequate health care; and ill-treatment\u201d in Nauru and a report commissioned by the Australian government found evidence of sexual assault of asylum seekers in detention. Earlier this year, two refugees self-immolated in protest. In Papua New Guinea, there have been repeated demonstrations and rioting among the 900 all-male asylum seekers. In 2014, two staff at the detention centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/19/reza-barati-men-convicted-of-asylum-seekers-to-be-free-in-less-than-four-years\">murdered an asylum seeker</a> during one such protest.</p> <p> Secrecy is a large part of Australia\u2019s model. Operations that occur on the high seas or Australia\u2019s territorial waters are confidential. Nauru introduced a non-refundable visa fee for journalists of $8,000 dollars in 2014 and regularly refuses visa applications to foreign journalists. As a result, just two journalists have visited the detention centre in the past four years.</p> <p> Against this backdrop, the Nauru files can best be understood as another blow to the Australian offshore regime. The Australian government has repeatedly stated that while it will not tolerate abuse in detention, what occurs in Nauru is out of Australia\u2019s control.</p> <h2><strong>The beginning of the end?</strong></h2> <p> There are three factors that suggest Australia\u2019s offshore asylum model faces an existential threat: legal challenges; practical problems; and the question of responsibility. </p> <p>Firstly, the offshore regime is under legal pressure. As well as international criticism from UN human rights bodies, earlier this year the supreme court of Papua New Guinea found the detention of asylum seekers an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">unconstitutional violation of the right to liberty</a>. The court ordered both Australia and Papua New Guinea to \u201ctake all steps necessary to cease and prevent the continued unconstitutional and illegal detention.\u201d The Papua New Guinean government is currently working to find appropriate arrangements in accordance with this ruling. A second legal challenge to the Manus detention regime is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/08/asylum-seekers-manus-island-police-presence-stepped-up-as-second-challenge-heads-to-court\">currently underway</a>.</p> <p> Secondly, the current policy appears fundamentally unsustainable from a practical perspective. Neither Papua New Guinea nor Nauru can provide durable solutions to those asylum seekers found to be refugees. Under the bilateral agreements, refugees are in theory allowed to remain in these countries permanently. However, Papua New Guinea has already declared itself unable to resettle refugees on its territory. Those found to be refugees in Nauru are allowed to live in the community on five-year visas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time.

The deal has delivered little: just five people have been settled in Cambodia, of which four subsequently chose to return to their countries of origin. This leaves unanswered the question of what to with refugees left in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for years.</p> <p> Finally, the Nauru files highlight Australian responsibility for what happens offshore. Though the Australian the government denies jurisdiction over the detention centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, its indirect responsibility is increasingly clear. Australia instigated the opening of the centres, selected the contractors that run them, provide all funding, and choose who is transferred there. Hiding behind the sovereignty of another state is becoming increasingly untenable. </p> <p> These three factors, together with the realities portrayed in the Nauru files, should make it quite clear to European politicians that the \u201cAustralian Solution\u201d is no solution at all.</p> <p><em>Nikolas Feith Tan is a PhD fellow for the Danish Institute for Human Rights and advisor at the Danish Refugee Council.</em></p>",
  "<p>For decades, Australia led the world in recognising the importance of assessing the value that new medicines provide to its citizens and ensured that the prices Australians paid for these medicines reflected their value.

Healthcare treatments are quickly evolving, as is our understanding of how treatments affect society at large, an issue that is particularly important with an ageing population that must be cared for by others. This rapid evolution means that Australia\u2019s system for determining which drugs are available to the population will need to adapt to ensure that treatments that provide value to society continue to be accessible to Australians.</p> <p>More than one year ago, it was announced that Australia\u2019s Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the independent committee responsible for recommending new drugs for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS), would review its framework for how recommendations to the health minister are made. The <a href=\"http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/reviews/pbac-guidelines-review\">guidelines review</a>, which is expected to be completed in August, seeks to ensure that the guidelines are \u201cof the highest quality,\u201d \u201creflect best international practice,\u201d and \u201cdevelop a more concise, clear, focused and up-to-date methods guidance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The near-finalised new guidelines appear to be a policy-motivated attempt to curb healthcare spending</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reason this seemingly \u201ctechnical\u201d issue matters for Australians is that the near-finalised new guidelines appear to be a policy-motivated attempt to curb healthcare spending rather than an attempt to achieve global best practices for how treatments should be valued. The methods included in the draft proposed guidelines include serious gaps when held up against global best practices. </p> <p>And yet, these guidelines will form the sole basis by which treatment coverage recommendations are made to the health minister in the years to come. The deficiencies in these guidelines mean one thing for Australian patients: future access to innovative medicines may be reduced.</p> <p>As they stand, these guidelines are not designed to capture the value that medicines provide to society as a whole. However, there is no denying that medicines deliver value to society that extends beyond a narrow focus on health care budgets. It is essential that budget holders do not ignore the obvious fact that treatments impact the lives of individual patients, but also their families, loved ones, and in some instances, complete strangers. </p> <p>Studies have shown that caregivers of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease spend greater than AU<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/alzheimers-caregivers-likely-to-spend-more-than-50000-a-year/2015/09/29/f49f21de-66f5-11e5-9ef3-fde182507eac_story.html\">$65,000 annually</a> on expenses related to care, a huge societal expense that proposed guidelines would virtually ignore when considering a new treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590611\">other research</a> demonstrates that having a child with cancer, a parent with arthritis, or a family member with depression has profound effects on the wellbeing of family members. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607668\">Research</a> among Australians suggests that an acute illness in one spouse leads to at least a 15% decline in the wellbeing of the other spouse. Complete strangers benefit when individuals are vaccinated against measles or cured of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C.</p> <p>The guidelines, as proposed, do not go far enough in specifying and including direct input from patients and clinicians into the coverage recommendations. It should come as no surprise then that a failure to systematically incorporate these important views has led some drug assessments, particularly in cancer, to not meet best practices globally. </p> <p>For instance, in end-of-life care, where patient preferences are paramount, other nations have led the charge in better assessing how treatments affect quality of life near its end.</p> <p>The draft proposed guidelines do not recognise the simple fact that treatments often provide a large value to society, above and beyond the value to patients themselves. If the guidelines are not modified to reflect how other leading public health systems (such as the UK) have begun to assess societal value, future treatments for diseases like multiple sclerosis and dementia, two diseases with large caregiver burden, and HIV, which affects the population through transmission of disease, may not be covered despite their wider benefits to society. </p> <p>It is imperative that this August, the final guidelines recognise the importance of incorporating the wider value that new treatments can create for society.</p> <p>An equally important issue that must be addressed is whether new drugs being considered for public coverage should be compared against the cheapest available alternative, as some have proposed, or instead against the treatment that patients most frequently use. Comparing new treatments to the cheapest available alternative is an apples-to-oranges comparison that reflects an inherently policy-driven attempt to limit public drug expenditures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/hospital-crises-show-the-gap-between-how-doctors-and-patients-perceive-events\">Hospital crises show the gap between how doctors and patients perceive events | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The more clinically relevant way to assess whether new treatments should be covered is to compare them to treatments that the majority of patients actually use and that form the standard of care. A failure to do so risks rejecting drugs that offer patients additional clinical benefit. It also places pressure on manufacturers to lower the price of new treatments in order to achieve favourable incremental costs relative to the lowest cost comparator, potentially decreasing incentives for innovation.</p> <p>These and other issues with the proposed guidelines come at a time when Australia\u2019s own regulatory process of approving drugs based on safety and efficacy is undergoing significant reform. The recent medicines and medical devices review proposed a number of positive changes to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, including new provisions to accelerate the approval of important medical breakthroughs. </p> <p>But regulatory advances are useless if coverage guidelines do not also adapt. Several countries, including the UK, have adopted practices that are currently absent from the proposed Australian guidelines, including accelerated approval and coverage for new treatments of diseases with high unmet need and greater solicitation of input from patients and clinicians.</p> <p>Australia now has an opportunity to ensure its leading role in how high-value healthcare is provided in public health systems. The health minister should look closely at the proposed guidelines and question whether they represent global best practices, support continuing innovation, and facilitate access to cutting edge treatments for Australian patients.</p> <p><em>Anupam B.

  "<p><strong></strong>A small island, a short boat trip from Timor-Leste\u2019s capital, Dili, appears to have the most biodiverse waters anywhere in the world.

They provide a common global platform for action on corporate accountability. The principles require businesses to respect human rights and governments to protect individuals from corporate human rights abuses. </p> <p>Since 2011, the guiding principles have been widely adopted by both governments and businesses themselves, here and internationally. Their rapid and widespread uptake indicates a clear recognition that the corporate sector is, increasingly, expected to act responsibly. </p> <p>The development of business and human rights NAPs is a corresponding, UN-supported process. These policy statements are used by governments to translate the guiding principles into practice. In 2014, the Australian government supported a resolution of the UN Human Rights Council calling on countries to adopt<strong> </strong>NAPs as a vehicle for implementing the guiding principles.</p> <p>In backing these UN resolutions, the Australian government has voiced its support for international initiatives aimed at achieving greater corporate respect for human rights. </p> <p>Australia is also campaigning for a seat on the Human Rights Council \u2013 the powerhouse of the international human rights system \u2013 for its upcoming 2018-20 term.
