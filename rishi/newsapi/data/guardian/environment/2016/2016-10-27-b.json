  "<p>In March the Paul Ramsay Foundation <a href=\"http://paulramsayfoundation.org.au/supporting-mental-health-social-enterprise/\" rel=\"nofollow\">invested $600,000 in its first social enterprise: the Vanguard Laundry in Toowoomba</a>. Created by serial social entrepreneur Luke Terry, the commercial laundry business will employ up to 100 people with mental health problems over its first five years, providing a supportive workplace and a pathway to mainstream employment. </p> <p>It is due to open in early December, and is likely to be Australia\u2019s largest mental health employment project. Mental health care is a big issue for Australia. In 2013 the economist Nicholas Gruen<a href=\"http://mentalhealthaustralia.org.au/mental-illness-hurts-economy-time-companies-got-proactive/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> estimated that in 2013 </a>the total costs of mental illness had reached $190bn, with 19 million absentee days attributed to mental illness each year. Yet only 7% of all healthcare spending is invested in mental health. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/20/young-female-and-determined-how-millennial-social-entrepreneurs-are-changing-the-world\">Young, female and determined: how millennial social entrepreneurs are changing the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were many reasons the Paul Ramsay Foundation made that investment, not least the variety of social investors and federal government funding already committed, and a robust business plan. Most importantly, Vanguard had secured a nine-year contract to supply laundry services to St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Toowoomba, which gave the foundation confidence it was an investment for the long term and a model that, if successful, could be replicated in other sectors.</p> <p>It\u2019s the first stop on a long journey for the foundation within the emerging area of impact investing. The challenge is to try to use social enterprise as a tool to work towards achieving systemic change in the areas in which it works. The more successful models that can be developed show that investing in social impact, whether by creating jobs, investing in education, disability support, social housing or the environment can be done while still achieving a financial return.</p> <p>That ability to make a profit while achieving social impact is extraordinarily powerful and goes to the heart of challenging the public perception of \u201ccharity\u201d. While it is still very much an emerging sector globally and locally, Australia has a great opportunity to be at the forefront of pioneering impact investment<strong>. </strong></p> <p>If private capital such as foundations and investors can continue to develop successful pioneering models, such as <a href=\"https://www.goodstart.org.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goodstart Early Learning</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.socialventures.com.au/work/newpin-social-benefit-bond/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newpin Social Benefit Bond</a>, the opportunity may present itself to access some of the vast funds within Australia\u2019s superannuation system. Although the field of investments is small, it has nonetheless been able to demonstrate that returns of 8to 12% are achievable at the same time as achieving social good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/10/its-time-for-the-super-fund-industry-to-be-used-to-change-disadvantaged-lives\">It's time for the super fund industry to be used to change disadvantaged lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s superannuation industry has approximately $2tn under management which, according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/financial-services/articles/dynamics-australian-superannuation-system-2015.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deloitte, will double by 2025</a>. That rapid increase is likely to drive the need for diversification into alternative asset classes. The challenge for the impact investing sector is to position itself to gain access to that capital and be seen as a legitimate alternative investment class. The role of private foundations and social investors is not necessarily just as the end investor, but to develop the capacity of the sector, to take the risk inherent in building demonstration models and to develop the data and evaluation systems that will allow the growth of the impact investing market.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While there is a clear and obvious groundswell of support for impact investing and it is an exciting opportunity for philanthropy, we need to be mindful that it isn\u2019t going to be possible to apply it to every single area of interest and there will always be a place for traditional grant capital. What is key for us is to use all our resources in the most effective way possible. </p> <p><em>Simon Freeman, chief executive of the Paul Ramsay Foundation, spoke at the <a href=\"http://www.impactinvestmentsummit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impact Investment</a> summit this week </em></p>",

  "<p>When Sandy Emerson sat down in her portfolio manager\u2019s office two years ago and announced she wanted to divest from fossil fuels, the latter furrowed her brow and said: \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d Emerson, a 68-year-old Berkeley, California resident, explained her unease about owning shares in companies that contribute to climate change and began selling her stock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources\">Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result, Emerson has been paying closer attention to the ups and downs in the oil industry and the growing public discussions about the future of fossil fuel use. \u201cI\u2019ve become aware of the financial implications it has for me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Emerson is among a growing number of investors who see global warming not only as a looming environmental problem but also an investment risk. Some fund managers are ringing alarm bells as well. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with almost $5tn in assets,<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/climate-change\"> issued a report</a> last month recommending investors include climate risks in their decisions.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors can no longer ignore climate change. Some may question the science behind it, but all are faced with a swelling tide of climate-related regulations and technological disruption,\u201d the 16-page report said.</p> <p>Even before BlackRock\u2019s report, evidence was mounting that investing in companies with a low carbon footprint pays off. The MSCI Low Carbon Target Index, for example, has modestly outperformed its traditional counterpart since 2010,<a href=\"https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/c64f0873-5818-4304-aaf2-df19d42ae47a\"> data from the index provider</a> shows. Earlier this year, Morningstar issued a rating system to help investors evaluate the environmental, social and governance factors of funds.</p> <p>The bottom line: the financial risks posed by climate change could make an ugly dent in your retirement savings if you don\u2019t pay attention.</p> <p>For middle-class investors, the office worker in Illinois with a company 401k or the teacher in Oklahoma with a state-sponsored pension, the risk could be particularly acute because they don\u2019t oversee their own investments. And attitudes and expertise regarding climate risk vary widely among those charged with investing average folks\u2019 money.</p> <p>In a survey of portfolio managers and analysts done by the London-based CFA Institute last year, 73% said they consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors in their analysis \u2013 but only 40% of those regarded climate change as important. Moreover, only half of those who consider ESG risks said their firm provided training in this area, with most of that training done via miscellaneous sources such as research papers and conferences.</p> <p>Efforts have begun to create industry-specific standards for companies to disclose climate change risks, most notably by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), a nonprofit group chaired by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The board <a href=\"http://using.sasb.org/sasb-climate-risk-framework/\">estimates that significant climate risks \u2013 things like how severe weather events can impact businesses, regulations imposing a cost on carbon and economic development that is less reliant on fossil fuels \u2013 exist for most of the companies it tracks</a>, which represent $27.5tn, or 93%, of US stocks as measured by market value.</p> <p>\u201cDue to the ubiquity of climate risk, investors can\u2019t simply diversify away from it; instead they must focus on managing it \u2013 and on encouraging portfolio companies to manage it \u2013 in all its forms,\u201d the SASB writes.</p> <p>The future of fossil fuel companies is at risk as more investors move their money elsewhere. By some estimates, the industry could face a \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d that will leave it stuck with trillions of dollars in stranded assets \u2013 unburnable oil, coal and gas reserves \u2013 as nations move to limit the planet\u2019s warming trend to 2C, the target of the Paris climate agreement, which takes effect 4 November.</p> <p>But climate risk doesn\u2019t only affect the big oil. Industries ranging from automobiles to agriculture to steel to utilities could also face climate-related challenges such as sea level rise and drought, tightening emissions standards, changing consumer preferences and the growing divestment movement, the BlackRock report notes.</p> <p>New technology that emerges as a response to climate change could also force changes within industries with a heavy carbon footprint, the report says. For example, advancements and falling prices in lithium batteries are poised to impact both the oil and gas and automotive industries because they are making electric vehicles and battery storage for solar or wind energy more practical and affordable. Earlier this year, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/press-releases/electric-shared-autonomous-vehicles-will-revolutionise-transport-worlds-cities-next-15-years/\">battery prices have declined</a> by 65% since 2010, with 35% of that in 2015. The market research firm projects another 35% decline for 2016, a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>\u201cYou can lose a lot of money by having exposure to losing strategies, losses that could be hard to make up,\u201d says Ewen Watt, senior director of the BlackRock Investment Institute. \u201cIf you\u2019re saving money for your long term future, the risk for you is there won\u2019t be enough money when you retire to meet your retirement needs.\u201d</p> <p>While the financial industry is recognizing climate risks, its actions sometimes don\u2019t reflect that. Banks have continued to fund the dirtiest fossil fuel projects and big fund managers have voted against shareholder proposals forcing companies to disclose their climate risks.</p> <p>BlackRock, along with peers Invesco, BNY Mellon and Vanguard, voted against such shareholder proposals at Exxon Mobile and Chevron earlier this year. BlackRock argues that global warming has yet to harm these oil companies, so it prefers to continue putting money in them and pushing for change from within rather than getting involved in a confrontation. Sandy Emerson\u2019s wealth management firm also advocated this strategy.</p> <p>The federal government has taken conflicting approaches to hold oil companies accountable for disclosing climate risks. Earlier this summer, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would block the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing climate disclosure guidance. Proposed by Representative Bill Posey, a Republican from Florida, the measure now awaits a vote by the Senate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology\">This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regular folks might end up being the biggest losers in this fight among regulators, fund managers and fossil fuel companies over their roles in addressing global warming. Consumers who depend on investment professionals to protect their retirement savings may not entrust their hard-earned money with the right people.</p> <p>\u201cIf what you read about stranded assets is true, it\u2019s a potentially serious problem for regular, middle-class people who aren\u2019t necessarily paying attention,\u201d says Cari Rudd, a Washington DC-based communications consultant, who does social media work for Divest-Invest and sits on the board of As You Sow, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit that promotes environmental and social corporate responsibility through shareholder advocacy.</p> <p>\u201cNow that I have become involved, I\u2019m much more concerned about Joe in Cleveland who has a little 401k and how he\u2019s already been screwed on a lot of fronts,\u201d Rudd says.</p> <p>The emergence of divestment advocacy groups is providing more information to help individuals navigate what can be a daunting process of moving their investments to, say, environmentally friendly technology such as renewable energy. Some investment companies offer fossil-free mutual funds.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://fossilfreefunds.org/\">As You Sow\u2019s Fossil Free Funds</a>, which uses data from Morningstar, is a free online tool that allows investors to type in the name or ticker of a fund and see what percentage is invested in fossil fuels. Earlier this month, the organization expanded Fossil Free Funds to include a feature that shows each fund\u2019s carbon footprint and which companies are the main contributors. For 401k participants who don\u2019t have direct control of selecting the funds offered in their retirement plan, As You Sow also provides advice on how to speak to their employers about expanding their company\u2019s plan to include low-carbon options.</p> <p>Looking ahead, Sandy Emerson says she\u2019s been impressed with the handful of largely European oil producers developing small renewable energy divisions.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m watching the oil companies that are starting to make moves in renewables and I\u2019m thinking that they\u2019re pretty smart,\u201d she says.</p>",

According to the report, Topografia 3 \u201creported the presence of possible members of <em>originarios</em> indigenous peoples\u201d sometime between 23:00 on 18 September and very early morning of 19 September near a fly camp and helicopter landing area, where some company belongings were attacked.</p> <p>Yet further evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been reported as a result of BGP\u2019s operations - although it isn\u2019t included in either of the company\u2019s 17 or 19 September reports. On 14 September, the Central de Comunidades Indigenas Tacana II Rio Madre de Dios (CITRMD), an organization representing indigenous Tacana people, wrote to Bolivia\u2019s Vice-Ministry of Justice and Vice-Ministry of the Environment, among others, urgently requesting government intervention and expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d about the threats posed by the company.</p> <p>According to the CITRMD, evidence for \u201cuncontacted\u201d indigenous people - \u201cfootprints and broken branches\u201d - had been found by Cuadrilla 7, another BGP team, on 20 and 23 August. In addition, the CITRMD alleges further evidence was found by Topografia 10 on 13 September, although BGP\u2019s 17 September report says that team found nothing on that day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e620c4d24f5f092581c10fbbe11d9d1eb2add0d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e620c4d24f5f092581c10fbbe11d9d1eb2add0d1/0_0_2170_1222/1000.png\" alt=\"Do\u00f1a Teo, an indigenous Tacana woman who has expressed serious concern about BGP\u2019s operations in Bolivia.

The response from the team\u2019s colleague, Diego Rivas, is to continue working but withdraw if they see anyone.</p> <p>The CITRMD also wrote to BGP, accusing it of failing to heed a 2013 Bolivian law specifically intended to protect indigenous peoples who are \u201cuncontacted\u201d or in \u201cvoluntary isolation\u201d, \u201cforced isolation\u201d, \u201cinitial contact\u201d and \u201cdanger of extinction.\u201d BGP\u2019s response, in its 17 September report, was that the law did not apply at that point because, although some evidence had been found on 12 September, it wasn\u2019t enough to definitely indicate the existence of isolated indigenous people in the region. Despite that, BGP states that it began withdrawing its teams that day, and then took \u201cmore serious\u201d action five days later after the 17 September encounter was reported. </p> <p>The following day, 18 September, the CITRMD wrote to several indigenous organisations stating that Yacimientos Petroliferas Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), Bolivia\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company which in May 2015 sub-contracted BGP to operate in this region, had been previously warned about the existence of \u201cuncontacted\u201d indigenous people. The company was urged, CITRMD claims, to respect \u201ctheir wish not to be contacted\u201d and to stop operating if they came across them. </p> <p>The CITRMD\u2019s letter claims that that advice was ignored - an allegation apparently supported by the radio conversation transcript and the eyewitness testimonies in BGP\u2019s 17 September report. Concern about contact with the group is particularly high because indigenous peoples living in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Amazon do not have immunity to outsiders\u2019 diseases, meaning they can be easily infected and epidemics can spread among them with devastating consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4bcb5eac3501be19adfa4adf0b4557d016d10baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcb5eac3501be19adfa4adf0b4557d016d10baa/0_0_1200_958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map showing BGP\u2019s oil and gas concession in the Bolivian Amazon.

The \u201cToromonas\u201d are one of more than 100 groups of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Amazon - with the vast majority in Brazil and Peru.</p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s 2013 law commits to protecting the lives of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d and requires \u201cpublic and private institutions\u201d \u201cresponsibly\u201d exploiting natural resources to abide by the law\u2019s protection measures - one of which is establishing \u201cbuffer zones\u201d to avoid accidental contact with outsiders. However, the government institution created by that law and responsible for instituting such measures, the Direcci\u00f3n General de Protecci\u00f3n a Naciones y Pueblos Ind\u00edgena Originarios (DIGEPIO), does not exist. </p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s Constitution arguably provides better legal protection than the 2013 law, with Article 31 stating that indigenous peoples in \u201cvoluntary isolation\u201d will be \u201cprotected and respected\u201d and that they have the right to \u201cthe territory which they occupy and inhabit.\u201d Bolivia is also a signatory to the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169, an international law which recognises indigenous peoples\u2019 ownership rights to their land and obliges the government to protect it.</p> <p>Neither BGP nor YPFB responded to questions from the Guardian, but on 17 October Bolivian newspaper <a href=\"http://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20161017/ypfb-niega-existencia-pueblo-no-contactado-descarta-cambios\">Los Tiempos</a> reported YPFB\u2019s president, Guillermo Ach\u00e1, \u201cdenying the existence of supposed uncontacted indigenous people in Bolivia\u2019s Amazon\u201d and saying oil and gas operations will continue as planned.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no confirmation of any uncontacted people whatsoever,\u201d Ach\u00e1 was quoted as saying. \u201cI understand this [the recent reports of contact] has been a distortion of information and what we will be doing is looking to continue with all activities.\u201d</p> <p>Ach\u00e1\u2019s reported claims were made despite other YPFB personnel appearing to accept that evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been found by BGP. An internal 18 September YPFB report, titled \u201cPresence of <em>Originarios</em> Indigenous People at High Risk\u201d, draws heavily on BGP\u2019s report from the day before and states that \u201cas a result of the events described\u201d and the 2013 law, YPFB had withdrawn all personnel from the critical area. The next day, YPFB\u2019s Miguel Angel Rojas Castro informed the Vice-Minister of Justice about the 17 September near encounter and sent her BGP\u2019s report. However, both YPFB documents appear to express some doubt: the internal 18 September report refers to the \u201cpossible indigenous peoples at high risk\u201d who had been heard calling and shouting by a BGP team, and the letter to the Vice-Minister talks of \u201cthe presence of possible members of <em>originario</em> indigenous people.\u201d</p> <p>Georgina Jimenez, from Bolivian NGO CEDIB, calls the claims made by Ach\u00e1 \u201cscary\u201d and says they \u201crespond more to business interests than the state\u2019s responsibility\u201d to Bolivian citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat should be done? All exploratory activity should be immediately stopped,\u201d Jimenez told the Guardian. \u201cAccording to the Constitution, people who are uncontacted or in isolation have the right to remain in that condition and to have the territory where they live legally recognised.\u201d </p> <p>The reports of the near encounters with BGP teams has led to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) becoming involved. According to Bolivia\u2019s Defensoria del Pueblo, with which the UNHCHR is coordinating, a meeting will be held in Santa Cruz on 31 October to discuss how to prevent possible conflict in the region and ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples at \u201chigh risk\u201d in Bolivia are respected.</p> <p>BGP\u2019s environmental permit to operate was granted in November 2015. According to the EIA, it will involve cutting 21 seismic lines running for over 1,000 kms and detonating underground 190,000 kgs of explosives in its search for oil and/or gas. BGP\u2019s concession is called Nuevo Esperanza, an 800,000 hectare area.</p> <p>A reserved zone was established for the \u201cToromonas\u201d in 2006, although it is in the Madidi National Park and to the south-west of where BGP is currently operating. According to a 2013 report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the \u201cToromonas\u201d in the reserved zone were at that time threatened by narco-traffickers and an oil and gas concession - different to BGP\u2019s.</p>",

  "<p>At last, child refugees are being rescued from the squalor and danger of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/fear-stalks-final-hours-calais-camp\" title=\"\">the Calais camp</a> and brought to Britain. But the process has taken far too long; and even now it is still too slow. This evening, 24 hours after the French government declared \u201cjob done\u201d, the home secretary was sending angry messages to her opposite number to demand that children left to sleep rough on the first night were now properly protected. The Home Office is finally grinding into action. But the inaction of both London and Paris, allowing the camp to fester for years, has meant it metastasised into a crisis of inhumanity, devastating for its victims and shaming for the British government.</p> <p>Many of the people who cross Europe to Calais do so to come to Britain, a country where many have family, where they share a language, and think they have the best chance of getting a job or an education. They are only a tiny number compared with the thousands who find refuge in Germany and Sweden. But the British government still insists that asylum seekers must apply in the first safe country they reach. It argues that admitting asylum seekers through Calais acts as a pull factor, attracting even young and vulnerable children to make a perilous journey from which only people smugglers benefit.</p> <p>Charities that work in the camps and try to help people with their paperwork believe the inertia comes from the very top of the British government. Even after the Home Office was forced by parliament earlier this year to accept the Dubs amendment allowing in as many as 3,000 unaccompanied minors without family ties in the UK, the decision was taken to work in Greece and Italy among newly arrived refugees, rather than in Calais. While Yvette Cooper, now chair of the home affairs committee, argued that each country should take half the children and teenagers, progress remained near-invisible. Only this month, as domestic political pressure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/french-presidential-election-brexit-closure-calais-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">embarrassed French politicians into bulldozing the camp and dispersing its occupants</a>, has the Home Office agreed to take children under the Dubs deal along with those with British family.</p> <p>So for months over the summer, when children could have been interviewed and assessed and their British families contacted and visited, nothing at all happened. At the end of August the new home secretary Amber Rudd met her opposite number Bernard Cazeneuve and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\" title=\"\">reaffirmed their commitment</a> to the Le Touquet agreement, allowing UK immigration officials to work in France \u2013 politically helpful for Britain, but little help to the thousands of migrants. Only a fortnight ago, with the demolition of the camp now scheduled, was there a further meeting at which Ms Rudd promised to take 300 children from the camp regardless of family ties. A week later, Mr Cazeneuve wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/uk-french-blame-game-over-calais-camp-must-end-warns-cazeneuve\" title=\"\">a stinging comment article </a>for the Guardian denouncing Britain\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d policy and demanding that it take responsibility for the misery of the Calais camp. That is a charge few even of the government\u2019s most vehement critics would accept. Yet if Britain is not to blame for the lack of safeguarding for children in the camp, particularly teenage girls, nor for the squalor of the conditions, it is true that first Mrs May and then Ms Rudd, desperate to isolate the UK from the global refugee crisis, failed to act for far too long.</p> <p>The Home Office knows how to do this. Campaigners are appreciative of the management (if not the scale) of the scheme to take 20,000 vulnerable Syrians identified and processed in camps neighbouring the country. That was the result of designating a responsible minister, who assembled a team of officials to tackle the inevitable obstacles. Dealing with Calais has appeared to be a much more haphazard process. Professionals like <a href=\"http://www.tactcare.org.uk/about-us/?gclid=CjwKEAjwy8bABRD5osXMovTHpmQSJACfZY0FikpoScho1g7X7ZSoGSHkShKbh4pRsdJy7rkNMPw0_BoC6yDw_wcB\" title=\"\">The Adolescent and Children\u2019s Trust</a>, a charitable fostering and adoption agency, wonder why officials and social workers were not sent out together weeks ago to identify lone child refugees, find out how many there were, and start the process of assessing them. Councils complain that not enough money has been allowed to support the children; they fear the money will run out after this financial year. And while in the past couple of weeks real effort has gone into speeding up the process, the Home Office lacked even reliable figures for the number of unaccompanied minors it wanted to find \u2013 and still seems uncertain how many have arrived. A start has been made. Children and teenagers can at last imagine a future. But it began too late; it has taken too long. And much still remains to be done.</p>",

The level of change would be beyond anything the region\u2019s ecosystems had experienced during the holocene, the geological epoch that started more than 10,000 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe Med is very sensitive to climatic change, maybe much more than any other region in the world,\u201d said lead author Joel Guiot of Aix-Marseille University. \u201cA lot of people are living at the level of the sea, it also has a lot of troubles coming from migration. If we add additional problems due to climate change, it will be worse in the future.\u201d</p> <p>He said that while his study did not simulate what would happen to production of Mediterranean food staples such as olives, other research showed it was clear the changes would harm their production. Climate change has already warmed the region by more than the global average \u2013 1.3C compared to 1C \u2013 since the industrial revolution.</p> <p>The real impact on Mediterranean ecosystems, which are considered a hotspot of biodiversity, could be worse because the study did not look at other human impacts, such as forests being turned over to grow food.</p> <p>\u201cThe effect of the human is to deforest, to replace with agriculture and so on. You change the vegetation cover, the albedo, the humidity in the soil, and you will emphasise the drought when you do that. If you have the [direct] human impact, it will be worse,\u201d said Guiot.</p> <p>The researchers fed a model with 10,000 years of pollen records to build a picture of vegetation in the region, and used that to infer previous temperatures in the Mediterranean. </p> <p>They then ran the model to see what would happen to the vegetation in the future, using four different scenarios of warming, three of them taken from the UN\u2019s climate science panel, the IPCC. Only the most stringent cut in emissions \u2013 which is roughly equivalent to meeting the Paris aspiration of holding warming to 1.5C \u2013 would see ecosystems remain within the limits they experienced in the Holocene.</p> <p>\u201cThe main message is really to maintain at less than 1.5C,\u201d said Guiot. \u201cFor that, we need to decrease the emissions of greenhouse gases very quickly, and start the decreasing now, and not by 2020, and to arrive at zero emissions by 2050 and not by the end of the century.\u201d</p> <p>He said the main limitation of the study was the relatively simple model at its heart, but this was offset by the fact it was used consistently, to reconstruct the past and to forecast future vegetation.</p>",

That means women who have reached a senior position through years of dedicated service, will have made considerable financial sacrifices, as well as the usual balancing act around home, family and social life.</p> <p>Our own research, Women in Financial Services report, shows that many high-flying women are still facing a mid-career conflict and a less attractive \u201ccareer trade-off\u201d than men. Insufficient flexible working options, inadequate support for family responsibilities, shortcomings in promotion and equal pay processes, and the unconscious bias in culture, present significant structural obstacles.</p> <p>Some industries are less forgiving than others; our report found that female representation on financial services boards globally will only hit 30% in 2048.</p> <p>Gender parity is not just about doing the right thing, it\u2019s good business. We&#xa0;still need a change in attitude and culture towards a more diverse way of working. It is up to current business leaders to take a stand and create equal opportunities so the next time we have a new female CEO, it doesn\u2019t make the news. For all the right reasons. <br><strong>Dr Rebecca Emerson</strong><br><em>Head of UK, Oliver Wyman</em></p> <p>\u2022 Graham Ruddick (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/hammond-can-signal-new-era-british-infrastructure-heathrow-hinkley\" title=\"\">Financial</a>, 26 October) says Paula Nickolds has \u201cclimbed her way to the top\u201d.

Someone crawled out of the woodwork and sold some acoustic demo recordings he had made a few years earlier as a teenager to Verve Records. Verve decided to add bass, drums and strings to the songs, which consisted of voice and acoustic guitar only, in order to make them sound more like the single he had in the charts. The whole affair reeks of the worst side of the exploitative music business of those days \u2013 and yet \u2026 somehow they made something beautiful. It\u2019s like a weird, inverted form of sampling: instead of cutting and pasting the vocals and guitar over a steady rhythm track \u2013 as would happen today \u2013 Lind\u2019s performances speed up, slow down, have irregular bar counts, and the bass and drums just have to follow him as best they can. So the songs end up with very modern-sounding, unusual structures. The dislocation between the various elements emphasises the loneliness in the songs. It has an absolutely unique atmosphere \u2013 the voice is swathed in a 50s-style reverb, the instrumentation and string arrangements are very mid-60s, but when they lock into a groove and trance out (like on What Colour Are You?) it could have been made last week. It\u2019s not only my favourite Bob Lind album; it\u2019s one of my favourite albums, full stop.

Before its release, Robert Wyatt was known to me as drummer and co-vocalist of Soft Machine, through listening to John Peel, who almost single-handedly championed him throughout his solo career. Peel brought Wyatt further attention, particularly in 1983 when his original version of Elvis Costello and Clive Langer\u2019s Falklands war-inspired song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoZiOOD0HRU\">Shipbuilding</a> reached <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/\">No 2 in his Festive 50</a>. By that time, I was already well under the influence of Nothing Can Stop Us. It was on my Walkman throughout that summer, usually as I hoofed it on a daily basis from Paddington up to Shepherd\u2019s Bush, where my mates and I were busy occupying ourselves with the recording of a bunch of songs that would be released as New Gold Dream. I loved listening to the album in its entirety, and repeatedly so. I still do. Why? You could begin by listening to At Last I Am Free, followed by Strange Fruit, and then the aforementioned Shipbuilding. And perhaps like me you, too, will get a lump in the throat listening to what was surely a purposefully pale and wan rendition of Red Flag. I don\u2019t think Robert Wyatt knows how great an artist he really is.</p> <h2>Green Gartside of Scritti Politti on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Clark Sisters: Is My Living In Vain (Sound of Gospel, 1980)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWtrpuPHDcM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pWtrpuPHDcM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear the Clark Sisters\u2019 Is My Living in Vain?</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This was given to me by a writer I met in New York in about 1982: this recording of rapturous devotion to God has abided with me ever since. It\u2019s <em>so</em> good \u2026 it almost passeth all understanding. Taped live in 1979 at Detroit\u2019s Bailey Cathedral, Elbernita \u201cTwinkie\u201d Clark with her four sisters and their mother, group founder Dr Mattie Moss Clark, perform some of the most ineffably sublime music I have ever heard. As funky as grandpa\u2019s drawers and with an ecstatic sense of yearning, the sisters\u2019 goosebump-inducing singing \u2013 sometimes fragile, sometimes fearsome \u2013 is put to the service of eight exquisitely crafted paeans to the Lord. You can find a clip of the sisters in their floor-length pastel chiffon gowns performing a version of the album\u2019s title song on YouTube, which is magnificent but only hints at the record\u2019s treasures. In 1983, the Clark Sisters performed at the Grammys, provoking the ire of their church, which forbade Mattie Moss from ever performing with her daughters again. Her singing of They Were Overcome on this album is one of the loveliest things I know. A couple of years after I was first given the record, the sisters came to London to sing at [the] Westminster Hall. After their astonishing appearance I approached them to express my admiration and gratitude. I was invited to visit the family next day at a house in Tottenham, or maybe it was Finsbury Park. I\u2019m sure I was a nuisance but they were gracious and I was blessed with some albums from their back catalogue. Is My Living In Vain is an exalted delight and is up there with the venerated best.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/26/petite-meller-provocative-pop\">Petite Meller</a> on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Clark Sisters: You Brought the Sunshine (Sound of Gospel, 1981)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3YL2t4LrUY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w3YL2t4LrUY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear the Clark Sisters\u2019 You Brought the Sunshine. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>I was recommended these sisters by a female Uber driver in LA; I\u2019d just played my song Baby Love to her.

It was one of the few stores that would carry albums as soon as they were released; they used to rent movies on VHS as well, so it was a popular spot. When it came out, Buju was already a dancehall superstar but it took him to a different level. Most dancehall albums at that time were usually a collection of hits that were already out but this was made up of new material. When I got home and put it on the stereo, it was mind-blowing. Buju was in full-on rasta mode and every single song was absolute fire. The consciousness was turned all the way up. Even on the party songs and girl tunes he was talking from a higher perspective. Champion and Murderer may have been the hardcore boom shots that everyone knows but Til I\u2019m Laid to Rest and Not an Easy Road spoke to me deeply and truly inspired me even more to pursue music.

Get it now! It has the visceral edge of the Velvet Underground in places and the wistfulness of Syd Barrett in others. Faine Jade is effectively a solo project from Chuck Laskowski, a Long Island-based singer and guitarist who previously released one single with the Rustics in 1966. Barrett similarities run through the record; one of my favourite things about Syd\u2019s songs is the feeling that they could go in any direction, at any moment. They are totally tense, raw and unpredictable, and the songs on Introspection follow a similar creative path. Laskowski claims to have been unaware of Pink Floyd at the time, which is totally believable as the tracks never stray into homage territory. While seeking to emulate some of the British psych sounds of the time, Introspection retains the identity of late-60s amphetamine-driven US garage. Don\u2019t Hassle Me captures the spirit of rebellious youth, and Ballad of the Bad Guys is a burst of garage rock that Between the Buttons-era Rolling Stones fans will be into. The tension reaches its height on People Games Play, a song that combines the \u201costrich guitar\u201d strumming of Lou Reed with familiar late-60s percussion and unsettling, monotone vocals. There\u2019s definitely a bit of the Byrds in here as well. The lyrics are fairly typical of the Timothy Leary era, with mystical lines such as, \u201cTrim the wick with scarlet scissors,\u201d but they fit the mood. Laskowski went on to release an album with the country rock band Dustbowl Clementine in 1970 but has since been largely inactive. More recently, Faine Jade gained wider exposure as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mgmt\">MGMT</a> covered the folk-rock title track Introspection on their debut Oracular Spectacular.

It\u2019s one of those masterpieces that isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a commercial record, but it\u2019s one of my favourites. I love Herb, and Michel, who was a great composing talent. It was a bit of a love-in! There\u2019s some amazing music on it: very moving \u2013 there\u2019s a song on it called Emmanuel, for Michel\u2019s son, who died very young \u2013 but it also rocks like mad. It was very personal to Michel, who was a very unusual musician. He was often in another place, another world. It was made for pure pleasure. You could call it a kind of folly.</p> <h2>Alexis Taylor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/hot-chip\">Hot Chip</a> on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Franco Battiato: Foetus (Sony/BMG Italy, 1971)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfiv4a4vabM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qfiv4a4vabM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Karyokinesis by Franco Battiato. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s progressive rock but more short song-based than overblown 15-minute rock like Yes, Genesis or ELP. He\u2019s a composer and songwriter who\u2019s still one of Italy\u2019s best-known musicians; a sort of Italian Peter Gabriel. He moved away from this strange experimental record towards a more poppy, new wave direction; Foetus is his first solo album. It\u2019s a very beautiful-sounding, analogue synth-based record, but also very pop: the songs are very immediate, melodic and easy on the ear. The Italian version was the first one I really loved; then I came across the English version and that suddenly opened it up; now I knew what the songs were about. It\u2019s a very original take on describing your place in the world; not your usual singer-songwriter confessionals. It\u2019s similar to the experimental pop approach of a Brian Wilson mixed with someone like Jim O\u2019Rourke from 90s underground Chicago.</p> <h2>Alexis Krauss of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sleigh-bells\">Sleigh Bells</a> on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Eccentric Soul: The Deep City Label (Numero Group, 2006)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-2_kdVcyA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vh-2_kdVcyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Betty Wright\u2019s Clean Up Woman.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Numero Group collect really old compilations from obscure labels no longer in existence. This album is all of the tracks from a soul label based in Miami called Deep City; most of the music is mid-to-late-60s. A lot of the players were part of Florida marching bands \u2013 the cover of the album shows them wearing the most sick, badass uniforms \u2013 who later went on to run more successful studios that released funk and disco. This predates that stuff; it\u2019s tracks that had no commercial success, but it does feature artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/16/cult-heroes-betty-wright-soul-golden-agony-aunt\">Betty Wright</a>. It\u2019s similar to what was going on in Detroit, only a little funkier. It\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but if you like old soul, it\u2019s great.</p> <h2>Andrew Savage of Parquet Courts on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Necessaries: Event Horizon (Sire, 1982)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTcx71TB2w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SoTcx71TB2w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Driving and Talking at the Same Time by he Necessaries.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is a record that has even evaded diehard fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/17/arthur-russell-alexis-taylor-devandra-banhart\">Arthur Russell</a>, who played keyboards in the group during their short lifespan and wrote two of the album\u2019s best songs: Driving and Talking at the Same Time and More Real. When I listen to Event Horizon, I marvel that it isn\u2019t one of the most influential records in rock music. But it didn\u2019t make the impact it intended to, and was forgotten by Sire and eventually by fans. Russell went on to a celebrated solo career after quitting the band by jumping out of the van at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel in New York, while on the way to a gig in New Jersey. But this is a record that needs to be examined further by anybody interested in this era of rock music. It\u2019s an elusive missing piece to the lore of the downtown scene. Everyone who walks through the door of my apartment is subjected to and is changed by it.</p> <h2>Mark Stewart of the Pop Group on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>The Fire This Time: Dancing On John Wayne\u2019s Head (Extreme, 1995)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m9yCWvOIzM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5m9yCWvOIzM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Thee Fire This Time\u2019s Reluctant Warrior.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a shining example of an activist-musician using art as a weapon. The guy who got it together is Pat Andrade, who organises indigenous resistance, helping Aboriginal people, with songs about native rights issues and the way corporations own the government. In the punk days, people tended to wear politics like a haircut, but Pat actually walks what he talks. He was influenced by us [Pop Group/On-U Sound] to a certain extent. There are loads of guests \u2013 Augustus Pablo, Chuck D, Mikey Dread \u2013 on this album. He\u2019s a real internationalist; a dub activist. It\u2019s resistance through reggae. What he\u2019s talking about is really real.</p> <h2>Charlie Simpson of Busted and Fightstar on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Aereogramme: A Story In White (Chemikal Underground, 2001)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkxyglTS6UY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkxyglTS6UY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Aereogramme\u2019s The Question is Complete.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When people talk about artists who don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve, Aereogramme are always the first band I think of. It\u2019s a stunning record, so different to anything I\u2019d heard before: atmospheric, with beautiful melodies and really heavy riffs. I got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mogwai\">Mogwai</a> through my brother when I was 11 or 12 and I thought it would be great to have that sort of music with vocals and Aereogramme did just that. I love the contrast of light and dark. It was definitely an influence on Fightstar. Funnily enough, Iain Cook the guitarist, is now in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chvrches\">Chvrches</a>, so he did finally get some recognition.</p> <h2>Shirley Manson of Garbage on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Hey!

Back then she appeared to come from Mars: she was like a female David Bowie to me. I worked in Miss Selfridge and she came into the store one day and I kept staring at her. Later I got introduced to her at a club and became obsessed with her and her band. I still think they deserve more recognition; they were a fantastic pop band. The record was produced by Tony Visconti and Martin Rushent, and the result is a strange mix of white funk, jangly 80s guitar, catchy pop and synths, with girl group harmonies and some \u201calternative\u201d flavour. They flamed brightly for a few minutes then seemed to disappear, but they\u2019re really unique.</p> <h2>Rebecca Ferguson on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Lisa Gerrard: The Best of (4AD, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGmvXGBBfjs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JGmvXGBBfjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Lisa Gerrard\u2019s Sanvean.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She used to sing with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhVM930YXY\">Dead Can Dance</a>. She is kind of classical and sings in her own language that she makes up. She works a lot with Hans Zimmer and she\u2019s just unreal. She did the theme from Gladiator, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBE-uBgtINg\">Now We Are Free</a>. That made me want to find out more about her. I really like the song Sanvean (I Am Your Shadow). It\u2019s quite dark; heavy and emotional. It creates a mood and it\u2019s moving. To me, she\u2019s one of the best vocalists of all time. If someone went on The X Factor and sang Now We Are Free, it would be unbelievable. It\u2019s whether the audience are ready for that.</p> <h2>Gilbert O\u2019Sullivan on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Carole King: Writer (Ode, 1970)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14w7MVUS4Fc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/14w7MVUS4Fc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Carole King\u2019s Goin\u2019 Back.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This was Carole King\u2019s album before Tapestry, which I don\u2019t think anybody bought apart from me and a couple of other people. She made an album before it, in 1968, with a group called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCR5syrzWw4\">the City</a> because she didn\u2019t really like being a frontperson. But Writer was significant because it was the prelude to Tapestry. There are some wonderful songs here such as Up on the Roof and Goin\u2019 Back \u2013 covers of her own songs. But the album only sold about 10 or 20,000 whereas Tapestry sold 10 or 20m! James Taylor is on it, and [guitarist] Danny Kortchmar; a lot of the same people who were on Tapestry. It\u2019s a really lovely album. It definitely influenced my writing, particularly the chord sequences on Child of Mine. If I\u2019d grown my hair and worn jeans and a denim shirt I would have easily fitted into that category of singer-songwriter. But I dared to be different and chose an unusual image.</p> <h2>Stuart Braithwaite of Mogwai on \u2026</h2> <p><strong>Abner Jay: True Story of Abner Jay (Mississippi, 2009)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpflHueZAk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RKpflHueZAk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Click to hear Abner Jay\u2019s I\u2019m So Depressed.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is the only record I own that I love that has jokes on. I tend to like miserable, depressing, pretentious music. Abner Jay was a one-man-band, who classed himself as an entertainer \u2013 \u201cThe last great southern black minstrel show,\u201d as he described himself. He\u2019d move from town to town, selling vinyl records and cassettes that he published on his own label. It\u2019s folk-blues; the kind of thing that, when you hear it, you can\u2019t believe it hasn\u2019t sold a million copies. It\u2019s a guy singing his heart out, playing amazing music. The songs are absolutely incredible, poignant, dark, really captivating and wild. He wrote them about Vietnam, cocaine, the moon landing. My favourite one on this album is I\u2019m So Depressed. That\u2019s the one that blew me away. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s really moving.</p>",

Our ambition remains that all schools should benefit from the freedom and autonomy that academy status brings.</p> <p>\u201cOur focus, however, is on building capacity in the system and encouraging schools to convert voluntarily.

Here\u2019s a few sections from it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The EU is a flawed institution, but we judged it better to fight for its reform than to leave. By a majority, the referendum shows that the British people made a different choice.</p> <p>Britain voted to leave the EU, and that decision should be and must be respected. We have to now think about what Britain after Brexit will be like.</p> <p>As the negotiations get underway, we will face a series of choices. \u201cHard\u201d versus \u201csoft\u201d Brexit does not cover it. We will need to decide on our openness to trade, investment, and migration.</p> <p>Labour will always prioritise supporting jobs, growth, and the public finances in making those choices. </p> <p>But this is not only about getting the best possible deal for the British people in any negotiations. It is about our values, and who we are as a society. It is about our identity, as much as it is about the kind of economy we live in.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ought to be a political consensus on finding a deal that protects jobs, prosperity, and the public finances. Yet there is a minority Tory opinion that favours a scorched earth approach. They are making the running in the government\u2019s own Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>The government is hurtling towards a chaotic Brexit that will damage our economy, and hurt the poorest and most vulnerable most of all. By pulling up the drawbridge and tearing up longstanding ties to Europe, we will inflict huge and unnecessary pain on our society.</p> <p>Yet a hard-line Tory minority believe that if we allow market forces to tear through our society in the wake of Brexit, we will emerge a more productive society. It is the fantasy of turning our whole country into a giant offshore tax haven, with rock-bottom wages and no public services....</p> <p>Let me be clear: those who voted Conservative in 2015 are not the same as the Tory establishment. Like me, you will have friends who have voted Conservative. They don\u2019t want a bankers\u2019 Brexit any more than I do.</p> <p>The simple truth is that the Tory establishment cannot be trusted to make a success of Brexit. They want to take control for themselves, not the many. They want to turn Britain into a Singapore of the north Atlantic.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are also committed to making sure that Brexit works for everyone not an elite few. The Tories want to cut special deals for bankers, and cut taxes for big multinationals.</p> <p>Labour would work with our European neighbours to protect our key industries like steel, and negotiate deals with the EU to make sure big multinationals like Google pay their fair share in tax.</p> <p>Labour will take back the economic levers of power currently in the hands of the EU, such as state aid rules, and return them to the people.</p> <p>Not a bankers\u2019 Brexit for the lucky few, but a people\u2019s Brexit for the many.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:39:38.371Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business secretary refuses to say if Nissan was granted special deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a7647c5c9a4259a94e2f6f3ea70ce1ffd5c7d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7647c5c9a4259a94e2f6f3ea70ce1ffd5c7d73/0_9_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary Greg Clark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary Greg Clark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The business secretary, <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, has just treated listeners of BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One to a masterclass in political waffling. By my count, host Martha Kearney asked him six times whether the government had struck some sort of deal with Nissan over potential post-Brexit tariffs to persuade the carmaker to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-to-make-new-qashqai-and-x-trail-models-in-britain\">build new models in its Sunderland plant</a>. </p> <p>Each time Clark answered an entirely different question, and at great length. Not a man afraid of numerous sub-clauses in a sentence, he at times resembled a contestant on another Radio 4 show, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp\">Just a Minute</a>, seeking to run down the clock without actually saying anything of note.</p> <p>To give you a flavour, here\u2019s Clark\u2019s first two answers, in full:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we\u2019ve established a clear understanding of the seriousness of the government\u2019s intention to make sure that the car manufacturing industry not only retains its competitiveness, but actually, through our commitment through the industrial strategy we\u2019re developing for investment in research and innovation and science \u2013 especially on very important technologies like electric vehicles \u2013 that we are going to be even more a magnet for investment in the future.</p> <p>And over the weeks that I\u2019ve been having conversations with Nissan, and indeed other companies, I think we do have mutual confidence that this is going to be a very exciting place to invest, and that\u2019s what we agreed.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We talked about the Brexit negotiation and obviously it is something that was in their minds, but the first thing we were able to show was that we are absolutely determined to do a good deal with our European friends and neighbours. </p> <p>There\u2019s strong mutual interest in the automotive sector in particular, where there is mutual exporting from one country to another, and from Britain to the rest of the EU, supply chains are quite integrated. So we not only have the ambition and the intention but actually good grounds for looking forwards to a good relationship here.</p> </blockquote> <p>A bit later, Clark came close to an actual answer on one point, saying there had not been a specific deal on compensation over possible tariffs, but that was as precise as it got:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u2019ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:44:35.371Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5811ed26e4b08d944ba4b3bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:05:40.121Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273cb99052b55f5defb9d0c391cb24280791e532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273cb99052b55f5defb9d0c391cb24280791e532/0_75_3670_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m still lacking a copy of John McDonnell\u2019s Brexit speech, but here are some more full quotes from it via PA:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour are not about to make cynical promises like the Conservatives on reducing migrant numbers, knowing full well they can\u2019t be met on the scale, or timescale, with the methods they propose.</p> <p>It is not migrants [who are] to blame for low pay and insecurity at work, or the high cost of housing, it is the failure of our whole economic model, which is not supplying the investment in work, or in housing, that people need. We have to change the model.</p> <p>What we experienced during the referendum ... people voted on a whole range of issues, one of which was their concern about the low standard of living.

  "<p>Campaigners are calling on the UK to prevent vulture funds from using British courts to pursue the debts of poor countries after it emerged that Mozambique could be the first in a wave of states facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/10/poorer-countries-commodity-slump-stronger-dollar-debt-payments\">new debt crisis</a> sparked by the commodity price crash.<br></p> <p>Mozambique, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies for much of the past decade, admitted on Tuesday that its debt levels are unsustainable and that it must restructure repayments if it is to receive further aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

All of its private external debt is now owed under English law, enabling vulture funds and others who have bought the debts cheaply to shun the restructuring process and instead sue Mozambique in UK courts.</p> <p>VTB said in a statement that its loans were executed in compliance with appropriate polices, and that the government of Mozambique had confirmed it was adhering to internal and external legislation by disclosing comprehensive information to creditors and investors. </p> <p>\u201cEssentially, the government misled us,\u201d said VTB. \u201cInvestors should be protected, debts need to be repaid, and the IMF should be informed about loans in time.\u201d</p> <p>VTB said it no longer owned a loan extended to state-owned Mozambique Asset Management, the debt having been transferred to other regional investors. The bank added that it was not deserting investors, to whom it remained responsible as creditor and agent on the relevant bonds, and said it would continue to engage in constructive dialogue with Mozambique\u2019s ministry of economy and finance and its advisers.</p> <p>Credit Suisse declined to comment.</p> <p>The Jubilee Debt Campaign called on the UK government to extend a 2010 law \u2013 currently only applicable to loans granted before 2004 \u2013 that protects countries from such actions.

  "<p>The last time many people would have caught a glimpse of Michael Gove was on the morning after the EU referendum when he appeared before the TV cameras looking like a bloke who had just come down from a bad acid trip to discover he had murdered several of his closest friends. </p> <p>That, though, turned out to be just the start of his Charlie Manson political killing spree. Within a week, he had stabbed Boris Johnson repeatedly in the front before crashing and burning in his bid to become prime minister. His punishment was to be sent to the backbenches to reflect on the foolishness of his actions.</p> <p>As justice secretary, Gove was a firm believer in the saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t do the time, don\u2019t do the crime,\u201d but he\u2019s not finding it so easy to put into practice himself.</p> <p>The normal sentence for a serial killer is life without parole, but Gove has come to the conclusion that, in his case, a couple of months is quite long enough. Mikey has had enough of being just another political hack, occasionally chipping in with backbench speeches that go unreported and unappreciated. Mikey believes he is worth more than this. Mikey believes the world is ready for The Return of the Govester. Mikey 2.0.</p> <p>Sadly for Mikey, just about the only person to agree with him is the Brexit-supporting Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/19/lord-glasman-radical-traditionalist\">Maurice Glasman</a>, and the pair have set up a two-man commission to \u201cDo Something About Immigration\u201d. Which is why Mikey finally got the attention he had been craving for so long and was invited to appear on Sky News. </p> <p>Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for. There are some humiliations even a politician shouldn\u2019t be made to endure. \u201cLet\u2019s just remind ourselves of one of the most momentous occasions of this summer,\u201d said Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton, not even bothering to conceal a smirk. The screen switched to Boris Johnson announcing he wasn\u2019t going to run for leadership of the Conservative party after all. \u201cWhat did you think when you saw that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t watch it,\u201d Gove insisted.</p> <p>Boulton arched an eyebrow. Was Mikey really trying to suggest he hadn\u2019t bothered to watch Boris: My Part in His Downfall? No matter. Boulton pressed on.</p> <p>\u201cBut you did effectively bring about Boris\u2019s withdrawal from the leadership race?\u201d he observed.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a complete coincidence,\u201d said Mikey.</p> <p>\u201cTreachery. Nicking his phone. Conspiracy ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an unfair characterisation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo there was no betrayal by you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. The mistake I made was that I should have paused before offering Boris support.\u201d </p> <p>Or, indeed, before withdrawing it. It\u2019s fair to say Mikey has a bit of a way to go in his rehabilitation classes. Restorative justice must be on next year\u2019s curriculum.</p> <p>Boulton pressed on for an easy kill of his own. \u201cSo, what was your biggest mistake?\u201d he enquired. \u201cSupporting Boris, knifing Boris or thinking you were fit to be prime minister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did come third,\u201d Mikey squeaked, defiantly.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/02/andrea-leadsom-v-theresa-may\">But more MPs believed <em>even</em> Andrea Leadsom was a better bet than you</a>.\u201d That was the lowest of low blows. Living with the knowledge your colleagues have more faith in the environment minister\u2019s competency is enough to keep anyone in therapy for decades.</p> <p>Boulton\u2019s bloodlust was out of control. Gove had been a key man and was now excluded. Boris was foreign secretary and doing well and Gove wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re left to going around bayoneting the wounded,\u201d he said, oblivious to the irony he was guilty of doing just that himself.</p> <p>By now, Mikey was a wreck, praying for the interview to end as quickly as possible. He\u2019d only imagined doing a three-minute interview and it was already creeping up to 10. Mikey found himself babbling stuff he knew that even he didn\u2019t believe. \u201cIt\u2019s great news the pound has been devalued by 30%,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what are the immigration targets of your new commission?\u201d asked Boulton, finally getting round to the reason Mikey had volunteered himself for this debacle.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... er ... I don\u2019t really know. That\u2019s why I want to have a commission.\u201d</p> <p>As Mikey tiptoed out of the studios, his phone rang. Maybe it was Theresa asking him back into the cabinet, having been dazzled by his performance. It wasn\u2019t. It was his probation officer. His licence had been revoked.</p>",

Spain said Moscow had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/spain-reviews-plan-to-let-russian-warships-refuel-en-route-to-syria\">withdrawn a request to refuel on Spain\u2019s north African coast</a>, amid western suspicions the Russian fleet will be used to flatten civilians in Aleppo.</p> <p>Nato\u2019s apparent goal here is to deter future acts of aggression on European territory by Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist Russia. After a period in which Nato has seemed slow to react, and lacking in backbone, the alliance is now sending out a robust message. As the US defence secretary, Ash Carter, put it this week, these deployments are all about deterrence.</p> <p>In particular, Nato wants to signal to Moscow that it is prepared to defend the embattled Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In May, Britain will send an 800-strong battalion to Estonia, supported by the French and Danes. By next summer, about 4,000 troops from Nato countries will face off against 330,000 Russian soldiers stationed on Moscow\u2019s western border. </p> <p>None of this means Europe is on the brink of an imminent east-west conflict. Or - as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-syria-world-war-three\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/could-hillary-start-a-world-war-sure-as-hell-she-could-and-here-s-how-a7379051.html\">some commentators have suggested apocalyptically</a> - that the world is gearing up for a third world war. It isn\u2019t. Speaking at a conference in Sochi on Thursday, Putin agreed. He told a group of western experts that it was \u201cstupid and unrealistic\u201d to think Russia might attack anyone in Europe. </p> <p>Despite the cold war atmospherics, then, there\u2019s little prospect of Russian tanks rolling across the border into the Baltic states anytime soon.<br></p> <p>Rather, Russia\u2019s latest sabre-rattling is part of a hybrid Kremlin strategy. Abroad, the goal is to project Russian military power and strength \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/10/russia\">\u201cwilly-waving\u201d in the words of one analyst</a>. Since Putin became president in 2000, he has been determined to restore Moscow\u2019s superpower status, with Russia as a global co-equal of US \u201chegemony\u201d.</p> <p>Putin wants to show that no international problem can be solved without the Kremlin\u2019s views being taken into account. That goes for the Middle East and Syria \u2013 where Russia has staged its first large-scale military action outside the borders of the former Soviet Union since communism. </p> <p>And it goes for Ukraine, the neighbour Putin covertly invaded in 2014, and whose territory Crimea he annexed. Far from not attacking anyone in Europe, about 10,000 people have perished in eastern Ukraine in a war that the Kremlin kicked off and sustained.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s armed forces play a key role, but television is important, too. At home, Russian state channels have recently floated the prospect of nuclear war with Washington. (Russia\u2019s military is inferior to that of the US, but in nuclear weapons it has parity.) Many Russians now dangerously believe their country is already in a state of almost-war, or pre-war, with the west.</p> <p>This war rhetoric, of course, is designed to deflect attention from Russia\u2019s domestic woes, which are numerous. They include a worsening economy, western sanctions, recent rigging in Russia\u2019s parliamentary election and massive state corruption, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore\">led from the top by Putin and his billionaire cronies</a>. At home, the propaganda has broadly worked. </p> <p>Russia\u2019s president sees Nato is an implacably hostile and aggressive bloc. Paradoxically, Nato\u2019s newest deployments in eastern Europe merely serve to confirm the story that Putin and state television have been telling Russians for so long: that the west is hell-bent on \u201cencircling\u201d Russia and bringing it to its knees.</p> <p>The danger now is not from an open military conflict. Rather with troops deployed in big numbers, and with Russian jets routinely buzzing US aircraft carriers, and other assets, the greater danger is from an accident or collision. In September, a Dutch investigation concluded that it was a Buk missile smuggled across the border from Russia that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\">shot down Flight MH17 in 2014</a>, killing 298 people. </p> <p>For much of the 1990s, Nato had lost its rationale. In recent years, it has been short of cash. The US has repeatedly complained that many member states are unwilling to pay the price of collective European security. For better or worse, Nato now has a purpose: to contain a growing and unpredictable Kremlin threat.<br></p>",
  "<p>When he was a child, Adnan Siddiqui would take the longer route from his home to watch Crystal Palace play football. The short route would pass The Victory pub, from which racists would jeer at him. He smiles at the thought that this same pub is now a mosque, the Thornton Heath Islamic Centre. Not that the racism has vanished from the pubs of his part of south London. Last Christmas a young Muslim was out in the pubs collecting for an African clean water charity \u2013 \u201ctrying to show people that not all Muslim people are bloody Isis\u201d \u2013 but that made no difference to the man who punched him to the ground, racially insulting him as he fell. It was one small incident among a great many. The monitoring group <a href=\"http://tellmamauk.org\" title=\"\">Tell Mama</a> found a whopping 326% rise in hate crime directed at Muslims in 2015. And it\u2019s getting worse.</p> <p>Dr Siddiqui is now the local GP in the area he grew up. But what he\u2019s better known for is setting up Cage Prisoners. One of the most widely disparaged of advocacy organisations, now simply called <a href=\"http://cage.ngo/dr-adnan-2/?mode=grid\" title=\"\">Cage</a>, their aim is to support those impacted by the war on terror, documenting abuses and insisting that all should have equal access to the rule of law.</p> <p>They began with a particular concern for those kidnapped by the US and taken to Guant\u00e1namo Bay; too innocent to be put before a court of law, allegedly too dangerous to release. And, given the nature of this work, Cage inevitably stand alongside a whole range of people, from those who are innocent and have been wrongly targeted to those who are much more dangerous. Of course, it is the job of the law to distinguish between the two. Which is why the rule of law must pertain \u2013 exactly what Cage&#xa0;argue&#xa0;for.</p> <p>But in making this case they have been derided, including by David Cameron no less, as dangerous terrorist sympathisers. And yes, Cage advocates have said some silly things in the past, for instance that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/02/who-is-mohammed-emwazi-from-lovely-boy-to-islamic-state-executioner\" title=\"\">\u201cJihadi John\u201d</a> was \u201cextremely gentle\u201d before his radicalisation. They might even be right \u2013 evil can work into even the gentlest soul \u2013 but it was unwise. And yes, of course Cage condemn people like him too. But so nervous are some of the work they do that no UK bank is willing to provide them with an account. You&#xa0;can imagine how much HMRC loves the idea that Cage can only offer to pay their taxes in cash or gifted jewellery.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher once accused Amnesty International of being \u201cIRA apologists\u201d for challenging the extrajudicial killing by the SAS of three IRA members in Gibraltar in 1988. Cage are doing much the same thing as Amnesty, except in the even more febrile environment of the war on terror. And they are described in much the same way.</p> <p>I meet Dr Siddiqui for a biryani next to the East London mosque. Because I\u2019m carrying too many assumptions, his accent \u2013 a cross between public schoolboy and south Londoner \u2013 catches me by surprise. I inquire further. He went to Dulwich College, he explains \u2013 with Nigel Farage. \u201cHe was in the sixth form when I first arrived,\u201d Siddiqui says. He&#xa0;tells me he recalls Farage using words he found racially offensive, adding, \u201cand I remember the way he did it, gloating on each word\u201d. I am shocked but not surprised by this. \u201cYes, and he\u2019s a Palace fan too,\u201d Siddiqui then quips, lightening the mood.</p> <p>As Siddiqui leaves to say his prayers and I wander home, I recall A Man for All Seasons, Robert Bolt\u2019s play about Thomas More\u2019s trial for treason. There\u2019s a character who argues that it would be OK to disregard any law if chasing down the devil. It\u2019s the 16th-century equivalent to the view that it is OK to suspend the rule of law when chasing down terrorists. More replies: \u201cOh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you, where would you hide, the laws all being flat? \u2026 Yes, I\u2019d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety\u2019s sake!\u201d</p> <p>This is exactly why Cage are right to insist that the law must apply even to those that the press and public opinion regularly demonise. Indeed, even to the devil himself.</p>",

  "<p>West Ham United will pursue a zero tolerance policy against the thugs they believe are damaging their image and are ready to ban 200 of them following the ugly scenes that marred their EFL Cup win over Chelsea at the London Stadium.</p> <p>The club mounted a massive security operation for the visit on Wednesday of Chelsea, who brought 5,182 travelling fans, and it featured police officers inside the stadium concourses and rapid response units outside it. There were more than 900 stewards on duty.</p> <p>There were tensions and instances of trouble throughout but the abiding images were provided during stoppage time, when the Chelsea supporters filed towards the exit at the back of the lower tier of the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand. Some West Ham fans ran through segregation lines to confront them and, although the rival factions were kept apart by the stewards, there were many missiles thrown, including ripped-up seats, bottles and coins. There was bitter frustration among the West Ham hierarchy because they were told by experts from the police and safety groups that the stadium operation had been a success.</p> <p>The security line between the two sets of supporters was not breached and the riot police arrived on the scene less than 60 seconds after they were called. But it did not stop what was extremely damaging footage towards the end from being beamed round the world and pushing the team\u2019s 2-1 victory down the news agenda. The club have resolved to send the strongest possible message to the hooligan minority, partly because they are mindful that, in their new stadium, they have 10,000 children among their season ticket holders.</p> <p>They are in the process of sifting through the CCTV footage to identify the offenders. The club are looking at 200 cases, with the worst offences being the missile throwing. They intend to ban those individuals for life. But they will also clamp down on others. They have seen footage of people making throat-slitting gestures; others running through a segregation block of 25 unsold seats to get into the stewards\u2019 faces and some more who dashed back to join the m\u00eal\u00e9e, having initially left the stadium. The club plan to ban these individuals for the remainder of the season. West Ham\u2019s image has taken plenty of hits since their move to the London Stadium because of various instances of disorder, which has led them to ban 23 fans already.</p> <p>The West Ham vice-chair, Karren Brady, said on Twitter: \u201cFantastic result last night. The team were exceptional &amp; atmosphere electric. Shame that a few marred the occasion. WHUFC and London Stadium have today been identifying all of them and we will be issuing banning orders. Football doesn\u2019t want these people &amp; with over 55,000 supporters on our season ticket waiting list we certainly don\u2019t need them at WHUFC.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for London Stadium partners West Ham United, E20 Stadium LLP and London Stadium 185 said: \u201cAn extensive safety and security operation was delivered in and around London Stadium throughout Wednesday\u2019s match with close co-ordination between West Ham United, London Stadium 185 and the Metropolitan Police Service.

But Ceta has to be approved by all EU member states: it has faced opposition from regional parliaments in Belgium and scrutiny from Germany\u2019s highest court.

Magnette had also raised objections to a proposed court system for settling disputes between foreign investors and governments.</p> \n<p>One concession he won means that Belgium would be able to go to the European court of justice to determine whether a system of investor-state tribunals were compatible with EU law. The four-page document contains a guarantee that the Belgian government will assess the socio-economic and environmental impact of Ceta.</p> \n<p>The Walloon minister-president, who has been dubbed \u201cSuper-Magnette\u201d in the Belgian media, said: \u201cWallonia is extremely happy that our demands have been heard.\u201d </p> \n<p>Speaking of the delay, Magnette said he was \u201csorry for our European partners and for the Canadians, but what we managed to get here is important not just for Wallonians, but for all Europeans\u201d.</p> \n<p>The special court that Ceta would create has proved so controversial that the commission has decided it will not come into force immediately. EU member states insisted that national parliaments should have a say on aspects of the EU-Canada deal that touch on national competences.</p> \n<p>Even if the EU and Canada sign the treaty in the coming weeks, Ceta will only become a complete and permanent legal document following ratification by at least 38 national and regional parliaments in Europe.</p> \n<p>Only the backing of national parliaments would trigger the creation of an exclusive trade court to replace the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), the existing system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the 1960s. </p> \n<p>This system is written into thousands of investment contracts, including 1,400 involving EU countries. Critics have rung alarm bells about the scope ISDS gives private companies to sue governments. </p> \n<p>The commission argues that its proposed changes to existing investor courts deepen transparency and end conflicts of interest, as judges would be appointed by governments and not companies, but critics have dismissed the reforms as rebranding.</p> \n<p>Campaign groups welcomed the Belgian challenge to the investor-state tribunals. \u201cThe use of investment tribunals allows companies to sue governments for lost profits if they introduce laws to protect people or the environment,\u201d said Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth Europe. \u201cThese corporate courts have no place in our democracies and we welcome the stance of the dissenting Belgian regions in contending them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The European commission had no immediate comment on the challenge to the investor court idea it has championed, but a spokesperson said events were unfolding in a good direction. \u201cWhat matters is not when [the Ceta signing] happens but the fact that it happens and it will happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly after the compromise was announced, several dozen activists launched a rowdy, but peaceful protest outside the commission headquarters in Brussels.

They\u2019re like Formula One cars or greyhounds.\u201d</p> <p>While some other species, including frigate birds and alpine swifts, are known to stay in flight for periods of months, no other bird has specialised in an aerial lifestyle to the same extreme as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/above-our-village-swifts-speed-scream-country-diary\">swift</a>.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/s/swift/\">Swifts</a> were already known to feed on insects in flight and collect feathers floating on the breeze to build nests - now it appears they also nap on the wing.</p> <p>\u201cSince all organisms we know of need to sleep to some extent, we can only assume if they sleep at all it must be while they are airborne,\u201d said Hedenstr\u00f6m.</p> <p>Ornithologists have long suggested that the birds must spend most of their time in the air, partly because no swift roosts have ever been found in Africa. The latest study, published in <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)31063-6\">Current Biology</a>, was the first to continually track the birds\u2019 movements and confirm this.</p> <p>Using miniature geolocators, which also monitored motion and altitude, the scientists followed 19 common swifts over a two-year period.</p> <p>The birds were tracked as they migrated from Sweden, where they were tagged, to the Iberian peninsula down through West Africa to Central Africa. On their return the birds habitually travel via Liberia, where massive groups congregate for a week or two to eat termites. \u201cLocal ornithologists describe it as a real spectacle,\u201d said Hedenstr\u00f6m. \u201cThere must be several million swifts.\u201d<br></p> <p>There was some variation between the birds, with one settling in an upright position, possibly roosting, for four nights, and others stopping for a few hours at a time. However, some of the birds showed no sign of ever having landed during their ten-month migration. Overall, the birds spent more than 99% of their non-breeding period in flight.</p> <p>The birds were seen to soar to heights of two to three kilometres at dawn and dusk and the scientists speculate that they might have \u201cpower naps\u201d while gliding back down to lower altitudes.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a guess,\u201d said Hedenstr\u00f6m. \u201cFrom a human perspective it would be easier to take a nap when gliding when you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed by flapping your wings.\u201d</p> <p>In the future, the team hopes to record the birds\u2019 brain activity while they are in flight to test this theory.</p> <p>Each year, common swifts spend around two months in Northern Europe, including the UK, where they breed, lay eggs and raise chicks, before migrating thousands of miles to Africa where they spend most of the year. Their streamlined arrowhead form makes them the fastest species in level flight - in a steep dive the peregrine is the fastest of all birds.</p> <p>Ben Andrew, a wildlife adviser at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said that young swifts may spend even longer periods airborne, because they do not return to Europe to breed for several years. \u201cWhen young swifts are born in this country and leave their nest they don\u2019t come back straight away,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them could be in the air for four years before they land again.\u201d</p> <p>The common swift is on the RSPB\u2019s amber list of species that are showing signs of decline, which Andrew said is linked to their nesting sites in roofs being closed off in modern buildings. \u201cWe\u2019ve slowly but surely been blocking them out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with builders to put in swift holes and swift bricks, which is helping.\u201d</p>",

EU sources predicted a \u201cvery difficult\u201d meeting at the council, where ministers traditionally vie to appear strong in defence of their domestic fishing industries.</p> <p>The news for the UK\u2019s fishermen from Brussels was not all bad. Quotas for sole in the western Channel will be raised 20%, and for haddock in the Irish Sea by 7%, while North Sea mackerel landings will also go up.</p> <p>Exemptions from the sea bass embargo are slated for anglers, who will be able to catch 10 sea bass a month in 2017 \u2013 down from 30 \u2013 and for artisanal hook-and-line fishermen, whose catch limit will only be reduced to 10 tonnes a year.</p> <p>But quotas for herring, whose numbers have plunged in recent years, will be cut by 16%.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cQuotas play a crucial role in ensuring the sustainability of our stocks, striking a balance between a profitable fishing industry and flourishing marine environment. </p> <p>\u201cWe will work hard in upcoming negotiations to secure the best possible deal for the UK fishing industry \u2013 both now, and for the future.\u201d</p> <p>The EU\u2019s environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, said: \u201cWe need to bring all stocks to healthy and sustainable levels as soon as possible so that our fishing industry can remain viable. We are proposing an ambitious programme for 2017 and the only way forward will be to work with fishermen, scientists and national authorities to develop real solutions that lead to fisheries that are both economically profitable and sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>The EU\u2019s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en\">common fisheries policy</a> has promised to phase out overfishing by 2020, by imposing a maximum sustainable yield system that can lower or raise fishing quotas according to scientific advice about the health of stocks.</p> <p>For 2017, the commission foresees a rise in TACs for sole in the western Channel, Norway lobster, anglerfish, haddock, hake and horse mackerel, mostly in the North Sea.</p> <p>But big reductions have also been pencilled in for cod, sole, plaice, megrim and pollack in the Celtic and Irish Seas. </p> <p>Conservationists welcomed the commission\u2019s announcement. Lasse Gustavsson, the European director of charity Oceana, said: \u201cNearly half of all fish populations in the Atlantic - and particularly the North Sea - are being overfished. Any deviation from scientific advice would simply be irresponsible governance. The potential that stock recovery holds for the environment, and also for jobs in the fishing industry, is huge.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My father, the architect Alan Lamond, who has died from cancer aged 60, was a global leader in airport design. He shaped some of the world\u2019s most ambitious and highly regarded airports, collaborating with other architects including Norman Foster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/01/zaha-hadid-obituary\" title=\"\">Zaha Hadid</a> and Richard Rogers. His expertise in functional airport planning and layout was a major influence on projects including Heathrow terminal 5, Beijing\u2019s new airport, King Abdulaziz international airport in Saudi Arabia and Dublin terminal 2. His award-winning work can be found in more than 30 countries.</p> <p>Alan was born in Glasgow to Norman Lamond, who managed a number of manufacturing businesses, and Susan (nee Budge), a teacher. After attending Greenock academy, he studied at the University of Strathclyde for degrees in architectural studies (1977) and architecture (1979). These were followed by a master\u2019s in architecture and urban design at the University of Washington, St Louis, Missouri, in 1984.</p> <p>Between his studies, Alan spent two years in Zambia, designing public buildings, and worked at RH Partnership in London, where he met Brenda Brown. They were married in 1987.</p> <p>In 1990, Alan moved to Pascall+Watson in London, where he remained for more than 25 years, helping to transform the practice into a leading aviation specialist. During that time, the firm grew from 25 people to more than 200.</p> <p>As director of aviation at Pascall+Watson, Alan worked on 75 terminals at 65 airports. Recent projects include Al Maktoum airport in the UAE, Mactan Cebu airport in the Philippines and Jomo Kenyatta airport in Kenya. Closer to home, Alan helped design the Stansted airport master plan and Heathrow terminals 1, 2, 4 and 5.</p> <p>He was twice made chair of the British Aviation Group, helping to establish the UK as a leader in airport architecture and engineering. Shortly after being diagnosed with cancer, Alan was presented with the organisation\u2019s inaugural award for his outstanding contribution to British aviation.</p> <p>Alan travelled the world, meeting and \u2013 in his gentle manner \u2013 charming thousands of people, including politicians, sheikhs and government officials. His work was his passion: he always said it was a privilege to do what he loved every day.</p> <p>Generous with his time and knowledge, Alan was a mentor to many. He was modest, kindhearted and a calming influence.</p> <p>He is survived by Brenda and their two daughters, Isobel and me, and by his father.</p>",
  "<p>A \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d army doctor with an unblemished service record was sacked because he discovered potentially criminal appropriation of morphine at a military base in the north-west of England, a tribunal has heard.</p> <p>Senior army officers allegedly tried to smear Dr Stephen Frost by calling him a conspiracy theorist and a Kremlin sympathiser when he challenged his dismissal at an employment tribunal, court documents show.</p> <p>The 69-year-old, who led the campaign to reopen the inquest into the death of the weapons expert Dr David Kelly, was dismissed in September 2013 by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after a war veteran was wrongly given morphine tablets six times the strength he had been prescribed.</p> <p>The MoD accepts Frost neither wrote the prescription nor dispensed the superstrength painkillers at Weeton barracks near Blackpool. But he was nonetheless sacked for not telling the veteran that he had been issued with the wrong tablets and was at risk of overdosing.</p> <p>Frost denies responsibility for the error. He believes MoD officers deliberately tried to discredit and \u201cmaliciously libel\u201d him before his employment tribunal.</p> <p>Giving evidence before a panel in Manchester on Thursday, Frost said he found himself in a \u201cKafkaesque\u201d situation when he was suddenly sacked with no explanation on 6 September 2013. Comparing himself to Josef K, a character in Kafka\u2019s The Trial, Frost said: \u201cHe was arrested but he didn\u2019t know what he had been charged with, but at least he knew he was under threat. I didn\u2019t know I was under threat.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal has been told that the officer who sacked Frost decided to Google him after learning that the doctor planned to challenge his dismissal in the courts. Col Carson Black sent an email to an MoD official saying of Frost\u2019s online presence: \u201cA number of tweets refer to the \u2018illegal war in Iraq\u2019. His main internet vehicle is the website Global Research, which is a leftwing \u2018conspiracy theorist\u2019 site \u2026 it is clear to me that Dr Frost has an axe to grind and it surprises me that he has chosen to work for the MoD environment when his views are so strong.\u201d</p> <p>In another email, Black, who was then in charge of Army Primary Healthcare Services (North), notes that Frost\u2019s Facebook page \u201cuses a Moscow scene as its header. I think his love of Russia is sparked by his interest in ballet and culture in general but \u2026 we have seen this with well-meaning intellectuals and idealists in the past.\u201d</p> <p>According to the MoD\u2019s response to Frost\u2019s claim, these emails were sent to Frost\u2019s primary healthcare trust in Wales. In his claim Frost says the emails were forwarded with the intention of \u201cdestroying his reputation such that he could not practice as a doctor again\u201d. The MoD denies that it sought to maliciously discredit or libel Frost or damage his hope of working as a GP.</p> <p>Frost has not worked or been paid since and says he has suffered depression and anxiety as a result of the experience. He is claiming undisclosed aggravated and exemplary damages for loss of contract, earnings and injury to his health and feelings.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Frost worked full-time as a locum at Weeton from 22 July 2013, covering for a doctor who had been deployed to Afghanistan. His contract was due to end on 30 December 2013, but was abruptly terminated via email and text message from his agency, Castlerock Recruitment Group, on 6 September that year.</p> <p>He was subsequently told that the MoD believed he had failed in his duty of \u201ccandour\u201d to tell the war veteran patient that a pharmacist had given him the wrong strength morphine tablets by mistake. The pharmacist, Elaine Gould, told Frost she had mistakenly labelled 60mg tablets as 10mg and wrongly dispensed them to the patient.</p> <p>Frost says in his claim that after a consultation with the patient he was confident the patient had not taken the super-strength morphine, because he was not showing withdrawal symptoms despite his supply having run out at least a week previously. He made notes in the patient\u2019s medical records to that effect, which he now claims amount to a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d, ie evidence of whistleblowing, which affords an employee special legal protection. The MoD denies that the notes qualify as protected disclosures.</p> <p>In Frost\u2019s claim he says he began to suspect \u201cunlawful criminal activities had taken place and that there was a need for police investigation\u201d after the patient insisted he had never been given the 60mg tablets, which are orange, a different colour from the 10mg pills he had been prescribed by another doctor. His claim form also alleges he raised concerns about \u201cserious health and safety concerns in respect of the way in which the pharmacy operated\u201d.</p> <p>Frost says he raised concerns with MoD staff at Weeton \u201cexpressing his concern that the dispensing error was highly unlikely to have been a mistake and that he considered Mrs Gould to have been coerced into illegal activity, be it by threats or blackmail.\u201d</p> <p>He says his suggestion that police be called was met with \u201csilence and apparent disinterest\u201d. Neither civilian nor military police were informed. Responding to Frost\u2019s claim, the MoD asserts that \u201cnowhere in the contemporaneous documents is it recorded that the claimant believed that the overdose incident was related to a deliberate criminal act or that he communicated this to anybody.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal continues. </p>",

  "<p>Leaving the EU could present positive opportunities for Britain\u2019s arts and creative industries rather than the feared disasters \u2013 but only if the government takes the right decisions on a series of important issues, a report delivered to ministers argues.</p> <p>The findings are in a report by the <a href=\"http://www.creativeindustriesfederation.com/\">Creative Industries Federation</a>, which draws on evidence from around 500 contributors, many of whom attended 11 quickly-convened \u201cwhat next\u201d meetings across the UK after the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>John Kampfner, the federation\u2019s chief executive, said there were opportunities to be seized because of Brexit and that the government needed to see the sector as a \u201cmassive asset\u201d which it could \u201cwork more closely with in the new agenda\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no time for lament.

It is complete with data, analysis and recommendations around the key dilemmas facing cultural organisations in a post-Brexit world. They include the visa system, education and training, intellectual property and funding.</p> <p>The peer and businesswoman Martha Lane Fox said: \u201cWithout great data and great analysis you can\u2019t make great decisions. With so much at stake for our creative sectors in light of Brexit, we need this kind of work more than ever.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of Tate who will next year become new chair of Arts Council England, said the success of Tate had depended on the ability to employ people from across the EU at all levels.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, this is an essential ingredient in creating one of the world\u2019s great galleries.

  "<p>The west risks breaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">the landmark nuclear agreement</a> if it fails to give Iran proper access to the international financial system, a former British ambassador to Iran has argued.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sir Richard Dalton, who served in Tehran between 2003 and 2006, said <a href=\"http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2016.1225896\">in a report published this week</a> in the journal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs in London that the US and its allies had made \u201csome potentially significant mistakes\u201d in respect to reconnecting Iran to global banks after the deal. </p> <p>Hassan Rouhani, under pressure to show tangible benefits of the lifting of sanctions to Iranians before the next presidential vote in 2017, complained at the UN in September that the US was failing to fulfil its obligations. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Iranian president\u2019s comments were echoed by the head of the country\u2019s Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/west-failing-deliver-nuclear-deal-promises-iran-vice-president-ali-akbar-salehi\">who told the Guardian last month</a> that \u201cthere are hints to do away [with] or to rewrite the deal, and on the other hand to unilaterally impose excessive oversighting and overcompliance to the point of Iran\u2019s discouragement and ultimate submission.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton\u2019s article, published on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/iran-deal-adoption-day-conditional-sanctions-waivers\"> first anniversary of the nuclear deal coming into effect</a>, stated that the nuclear deal was the product of diplomacy. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Noting that the nuclear agreement would only endure \u201cif everyone works at it\u201d, Dalton wrote that \u201ccommon sense suggests that, if the situation is not appreciably better later in the year, it will be impossible for the US and its partners to argue credibly that they are not in breach of\u201d the nuclear deal, which is known in Iran by the acronym Barjam. </p> <p>According to Dalton, the US and its partners have notably failed to re-authorise Iran\u2019s access to U-turn transactions [used by Iranian banks to avoid US sanctions] in dollars, or to reassure non-US banks on handling Iranian payments, or to give general licences allowing non-US entities to use US software in their businesses dealings in Iran. Banks have remained reluctant to enter Iran <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/us-and-uk-urge-banks-to-do-business-with-iran\">despite attempts</a> by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his European counterparts. </p> <p>Among other impediments are \u201cunwillingness [by the west], apparently, to use governmental influence with state-owned banks to get them to help carry out government policy\u201d such as \u201cproviding clearing facilities in London\u201d, Dalton said. <br></p> <p>The ongoing banking difficulties have prevented Iran from capitalising on interest shown by western businesses in returning to the country, or finalising lucrative deals with the west, such as the purchase of planes from Airbus and Boeing. Iran is also partly to blame because it does not have adequate regulations on transparency, anti-corruption and money laundering.</p> <p>Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of the Europe-Iran Forum business conference series, said the mood in Tehran was mixed. \u201cOn one hand, major multinationals like Siemens, Peugeot, Unilever and Vodafone have signalled ambitious plans for Iran, generating optimism in Iran\u2019s business community,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOn the other hand, there are frustrating gaps in the US Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s licensing policy. OFAC has issued so-called \u2018general licences\u2019 to help open the door for non-US companies to trade with Iran, but these provisions use broad language and do not fully account for the complexity of trade and investment by multinational companies.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton served in the British Foreign Office for more than 35 years and was among a group of former western ambassadors to Tehran <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace\">who co-penned an article in 2011</a> saying there was \u201cno evidence that the country is building nuclear weapons\u201d and urging dialogue. He is currently an associate fellow at the London thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>Dalton predicted that the nuclear agreement would last \u201cprovided that mutual benefit is delivered in practice\u201d and that the US \u201cuses its power wisely\u201d. Iran would not be the first to renege, he argued, saying that \u201cthe overwhelming interest of Iran is to comply\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe nuclear deal will stick, subject to US policy. And even if a Republican wins in the US, it is not a foregone conclusion that a candidates\u2019 hostility to perceived past \u2018concessions\u2019 to Iran would translate into active sabotage of the deal \u2013 it is too obviously a good agreement for US, regional and world security against the spread of nuclear weapons.\u201d A Donald Trump presidency would be unlikely to change that, he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With Iran\u2019s own elections scheduled for May, the moderate Rouhani faces a tough time ahead. \u201cHigh expectations in Iran of economic progress have not been realised. Disappointment has set in and criticism of the limited benefits that have accrued to Iran by the supreme leader and by President Rouhani\u2019s opponents is rising in intensity; 2017 will see a presidential election in Iran and the right scent Rouhani\u2019s blood.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Economically, Dalton viewed Iran as an emerging Bric country, alongside newly advanced economies such as Brazil and India. \u201cThey have a $1.4tn diversified economy, growing at some 4-5%, with a backlog of investment in all sectors, a reforming government (for the next year at least) and a well-educated population (total 80 million) striving to take advantage of the country\u2019s improved prospects,\u201d he observed. \u201cCrude production will soon go above 4m barrels per day. The oil minister projects a production capacity of 4.8m barrels per day within five years.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On the regional context, Dalton wrote that \u201cwe should compare [Iran] not with post-Ottoman, post-imperial Egypt or Saudi Arabia, but with Russia and other Asian powers.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>On a scorching hot day in June 2015, I gave water to thirsty pigs on board a transport truck headed for the slaughterhouse.

It doesn\u2019t matter if the sufferer has two legs or four or asks for help in words we can understand or with body language that is just as easy to comprehend. Leo Tolstoy, an ethical vegetarian and one of my inspirations, wrote, \u201c[W]e should take pity on animals in the same way as we do on each other. And we all know this, if we do not deaden the voice of our conscience inside us.\u201d </p> <p>The pigs I was trying to help on that fateful day were undoubtedly suffering. Crammed into a transport truck on a sweltering day, these helpless animals \u2013 covered with their own excrement, being crushed together and slowly suffocating from heat \u2013 stared at me through the trailer\u2019s metal slats with their pleading eyes. As Dr Armaiti May, a veterinary expert, testified during my trial, some of the pigs were foaming at the mouth and in \u201csevere distress\u201d, appearing to breathe as quickly as 180 breaths per minute. </p> <p>I think we have not only a right but also a duty to help suffering animals. <a href=\"http://www.torontopigsave.org/about-us/\">Toronto Pig Save</a>, the group that I helped start with my dog Mr Bean in 2010, has continued to give water to thirsty pigs to this day. Our approach is to collectively bear witness to ill-fated animals at the end of their miserable lives and hold weekly vigils outside slaughterhouses.</p> <p>A slaughterhouse might seem like the last place that animal lovers would want to be, but for us \u2013 as for the Quakers, Greenpeace and similar groups \u2013 bearing witness is about being present at sites of great injustice. Our personal contact puts a face on the nameless numbers, to borrow from Charles Dickens, and helps people see animal victims as unique individuals who want to live.</p> <p>There\u2019s little doubt in my mind that if those were dogs in distress in that truck instead of pigs, my actions would be applauded and it would be the driver facing charges instead. This double standard should have everyone questioning the ethics of the meat, dairy and egg industry, our legal system and our food choices. Like dogs, pigs are friendly, loyal and sensitive animals who have a strong sense of self and intelligence. They are playful and affectionate: they love to snuggle. They feel love and joy, but also pain and fear. They possess protective feelings for their families and friends. Pigs have <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/features/reasons-never-eat-bacon/\">been known</a> to courageously jump into water to rescue drowning children. </p> <p>In Esther the Wonder Pig, a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/07/10/animals/\">bestseller</a>, Esther\u2019s human dads attest to the porcine internet star\u2019s big personality, her keen intelligence and her sense of humor. Our laws need to be changed to reflect this: all animals should be treated as thinking, feeling individuals under the law, because that is what they are. They are not property, nor cogs in the machine, with numbered tags slapped on their ears.</p> <p>Humans need to recognize that we are also animals and that we are all interconnected. We are like animals in all the ways that matter \u2013 we feel pain, we suffer, we grieve, we are afraid of being killed and we get thirsty on a hot day. By showing people this, we hope we will reach their hearts so they will feel what animals feel. Then finally we will be able to end the horrific suffering at farms and slaughterhouses and shift towards a nonviolent plant-based economy.</p> <p>We are all in this together, humans and pigs. I am, quite literally, because I am facing jail time for giving pigs some small comfort in their final moments. My trial resumes 1 November. The cruelty inflicted on pigs at animal farms and slaughterhouses touches all of us, by harming animals, by polluting the environment, by harming our health and our conscience when we consume the products of this suffering. By bearing witness to animals in distress, we discover the unity of life.</p>",

  "<p>Should foreign aid continue? It\u2019s a complex question. There are so many types of aid, and different countries have different models. The Chinese, for example, are committed to vast infrastructural programmes, particularly to do with transport and communications. Other countries take other approaches. </p> <p>No one is suggesting humanitarian aid should end. Catastrophe evokes a human response to help fellow creatures. When help is not possible, for example in ending the carnage in Aleppo, we feel frustration and despair that people suffer without respite.</p> <p>But the debate over the extent of aid and whether it should continue is concerned with wastage, corruption and dependency. It recognises that while much of western aid cultivates markets for exports, the overall effect appears to be enrichment of an elite. Poverty has been greatly reduced over the last decade, but the discrepancy between rich and poor seems to be growing. And, in many countries, the rich seem still to be committed to accumulation rather than to the circulation of capital and its investment in new enterprises that would generate employment. Where a proportion of aid leaks, it facilitates an elite that is not economically dynamic, merely rich.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>\u200bWe want to help the developing world, preferably to our advantage. But we do not want them to rise above us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Critics, such as the global economist Dambisa Moyo, have long accused aid regimes of retarding rather than developing. Her critique is that aid creates dependency, and the sub-text is that this is precisely because western donors prefer it that way. An Africa, for instance, that develops through the vibrancy of its trade \u2013 in particular its manufactured products \u2013 would threaten western industries and the voter base of governments from both left and right. Aid is expressed in terms of a pious commitment, but is in fact a long-term selfishness.</p> <p>This is a powerful critique, but not every developing country has something to trade. Some are merely impoverished. Others are the site of intense competition for resource extraction: west and east seek Africa\u2019s mineral resources for future industrial capacity. Africa sells those resources because it has been discouraged from developing industrialisation of its own.</p> <p>This discouragement has perverse and arcadian aspects \u2013 forms of romanticism. If Africa industrialised, it would add to world pollution. But this ignores the possibility of a generation jump in technologies. Africa as a leader in vast solar energy plants, for instance, requires a leap in imagination, and often involves skills not plentiful even in the west.</p> <p>The debate on aid comes down to this kind of lack of imagination. We have cemented in our minds the idea of a hierarchy in the world\u2019s nations: the developing world is below us and we need to help them, preferably to our advantage. But we do not want them to rise above us. How many new Chinas can the west bear? Aid to this extent becomes a solidification of the current status quo.</p> <p>But if the mantra of \u201ctrade not aid\u201d took off, the left would complain as industrial workers lost their jobs because of cheap imports from new manufacturers, while left and right would complain as new economic centres of power reduced our international capacity to influence others. It is we who would then become dependent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9782d055c206b2f28c8a78d1924b3f62d83d9e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9782d055c206b2f28c8a78d1924b3f62d83d9e7/0_472_2000_2117/945.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Geldof speaks at the Live Aid press conference at the Hard Rock Cafe in 1985 in New York City.\" width=\"945\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Geldof speaks at the Live Aid press conference at the Hard Rock Cafe in 1985 in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L.

Certainly, Britain\u2019s aid contribution seems set to diminish as it leaves the EU \u2013 and the multilateral funding schemes that have delivered quantities of aid to the outside world. But humanitarian aid should certainly not diminish. Here, the public can sometimes lead the governments of the west.</p> <p>I remember in 1991 walking by the Red Sea in front of the bombed-out ruins of the entire city of Massawa in Eritrea. As part of Ethiopia, the region had suffered greatly from the terrible famine of 1984. A young boy came to walk with me. In broken English he asked where I came from. When I replied, he said: \u201cMy father tells me that when I was born, we had terrible famine.

Until recently, there was barely a voice arguing that Britain should not do more; instead, the debate was about what or how much should be done.

But the British government persistently failed to act, despite its legal obligations. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to project the refugee crisis as if it is always someone else\u2019s problem. In failing to address the inhuman conditions in Calais, the government excuses itself, claiming that it is primarily a French problem.</p> <p>This is a recurring theme of the official response to this emergency. In the recent debate on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/how-should-uk-respond-syria-crisis\" title=\"\">crisis in Syria</a>, and in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/aleppo-bombings-syria-un-stephen-obrien-vitaly-churkin\" title=\"\">Aleppo</a>, there were calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/jordan-crane-to-deliver-aid-syrian-refugees-supplies-border\" title=\"\">Jordan to do more</a> to rescue 70,000 Syrians on their joint border.

If they do avoid death or drowning, we regard it as Italy\u2019s or Greece\u2019s problem. Other European countries take the approach that they are rescuing refugees; others, such as Germany and Sweden, actually want to offer them refuge.</p> <p>There is an alternative. Britain could take far more refugees than it has done to date. It could first prioritise all those who have a legal right to be here. It could use the Royal Navy to rescue people, even while it clamped down on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/uk-warship-to-tackle-libya-people-smugglers\" title=\"\">people smugglers</a>. It could end the scandalous conditions at any new Calais camp by accepting refugees and establishing a safe and sanitary processing centre. This should be a moral imperative. As it happens, it would also be a benefit to all of us. Sweden\u2019s economy is booming in part because of a growth in both refugees and migrants.</p> <p>Britain could also collaborate with all those internationally who are trying to establish safe and legal routes for refugees from conflict zones. We should act now to prevent further conflicts and to tackle climate change, two of the major causes of modern mass displacement of people. Otherwise this generation of British politicians will be remembered as one that knew what was happening and did nothing to help.</p>",

(Asked by a reporter if he was a liberal, in later years when that was an unpopular thing for a politician to be called in the US, he replied simply, \u201cI hope so!\u201d)</p> <p>In 1960, in Mississippi on the highly dangerous mission to register black people to vote, Hayden met Sandra \u201cCasey\u201d Cason. They married in 1961. The experience of campaigning led Cason to contribute to <a href=\"http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc43.htm\" title=\"\">an SNCC position paper</a> (1964) that she and her friend Mary King expanded into \u201ca kind of memo\u201d, <a href=\"http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm\" title=\"\">Sex and Caste</a> (1965). It voiced the disillusion of white female civil rights workers who went to the south with high ambitions to liberate African Americans but found they were expected to make coffee for their male fellow activists, type out their papers and sleep with them, and it marked a key step in the \u201csecond wave\u201d of American radical feminism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0614da86db0dde89e1bb7d11354c503c8da8897e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0614da86db0dde89e1bb7d11354c503c8da8897e/0_6_3109_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda in 1978.

Cason was a committed Protestant, a quiet woman who shunned publicity and worked unobtrusively for many causes for the rest of her life, whereas Hayden had a notable gift for publicity in the service of many radical causes.</p> <p>Later in life he did express regret for \u201cromanticising\u201d the North Vietnamese and also for allowing his zeal against the war to turn into anti-Americanism, something of which his political opponents routinely accused him and, especially, Fonda. His gift for self-promotion got him into a lot of trouble even with sympathetic voters, and he complained, not unfairly, that he was criticised by both left and right.</p> <p>His radical and in particular his democratic instincts, and his commitment to activism, all remained undiminished. Because he thought American democracy was drowning in money, he would accept donations only of less than $250. As a result of the settlement that followed his divorce from Fonda in 1990, he became a relatively wealthy man who could help fund his own campaigns. In 1993 he married the Canadian actor Barbara Williams.</p> <p>He poured out books, journalism and speeches on behalf of many causes, especially care for the environment and issues of class inequality. After he left electoral politics in 2000 he set up the Peace and Justice Resource Center. Critical as he remained of racial, gender and class injustice, he was proud of his adopted state of California. \u201cThe wind is blowing for California,\u201d he told an interviewer on al-Jazeera, \u201cand the wind is progressive.\u201d</p> <p>In 2001 his unconquered radicalism found an expression that surprised many and infuriated not a few. In a passionate account of Irish history, Irish Inside, he assailed British colonialism, but denounced even more the respectable version of Irishness embraced by many Irish Americans including, as he pointed out, his own parents.</p> <p>He is survived by Barbara and their son, Liam; and by the son from his marriage to Fonda, the actor Troy Garity.</p> <p><em> </em> \u2022 Thomas Emmet Hayden, political activist, born 11 December 1939; died 23 October 2016<em> </em></p>",

Now, Tajinder Singh Hayer\u2019s North Country presents a post-apocalyptic vision of Bradford\u2019s future.</p> <p>Once again, it\u2019s the interplay of theme and environment that makes Freedom Studio\u2019s work distinctive. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more authentically post-apocalyptic atmosphere than the <a href=\"http://wildwoodsbradford.co.uk/\">Wild Woods</a>, a pop-up arts venue located in the basement of an abandoned Marks &amp; Spencer. This, you sense, is how communities will continue to live following the collapse of civilisation \u2013 hunkered down on a bare expanse where the socks and underpants used to be.</p> <p>Hayer imagines a very near future in which a plague has wiped out most of the world\u2019s population, leaving three Bradford teenagers to deal with the problem of survival. Alleyne has the resources of his father\u2019s farm; Harvinder the dwindling medical supplies left by his doctor parents; and Nusrat the makings of a textile empire within the city\u2019s old mill-working communities. What emerges is a form of feudalism based on dynastic marriages, the payment of tithes and a bartering system based on the scarcity of food. </p> <p>The measure of good science fiction is what it has to tell us about the present, and Hayer\u2019s scenario unfolds like a bleak inversion of the current immigration crisis.

Similar <a href=\"https://www.marysmeals.org/what-we-do/the-impact-of-our-work/\">impact assessment studies</a> are under way in Liberia and Zambia.</p> <p>Alex Keay, head of programmes policy, said: \u201cThe Malawi results demonstrate that a daily meal increases school enrolment numbers and improves attendance, allows children to concentrate better, promotes wider access to education for marginalised children, increases support for community education and makes children happier.\u201d </p> <p>Sesay agrees. \u201cSince they started working with us, I can see we have really seen an improvement. Before they came, we had hungry children who couldn\u2019t concentrate. Now they have lunch they come to class with eager minds. </p> <p>\u201cRegular attendance has improved because if parents know they are getting fed here, it takes pressure off them at home and encourages them to make sure their children come daily.\u201d </p> <p>At Manivalor Mesila public school in Grand Cape Mount county, facilities are even more sparse. Here, 450 pupils learn in just six classrooms with little in the way of furniture or basic learning materials and no access to water or sanitation. In the nursery class, more than 40 children sit on broken wooden benches waiting for a volunteer teacher to arrive. A faded blackboard is the only classroom resource.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the only school nearby and some pupils come from different areas so face a long journey here,\u201d says Isaac Nathaniel, school feeding officer for Mary\u2019s Meals. \u201cFor many pupils, the meal we provide is their only meal of the day because there is nothing to eat when they get home at night. Without it, many children just wouldn\u2019t be able to come because their parents wouldn\u2019t bother to send them or because they would be too weak to walk here.\u201d</p> <p>Mambu, 12, started school when he was eight. \u201cI saw my friends studying here and I was encouraged to come too. My mother is a widow and was worried how we would manage it because it is far, but when I told her that I would receive a daily meal here she agreed for me to come.\u201d</p> <p>Nathaniel believes that without the feeding programme the school would probably have closed due to lack of numbers. It used to be an Islamic school, teaching only a Koranic education in Arabic. Now it offers a mainstream English curriculum, teaching both Christian and Muslim children together. </p> <p>\u201cThe promise of a meal really boosted the intake, that in turn encouraged the school to offer a wider curriculum,\u201d he says. \u201cNow that pupil numbers are secure, we can work with the school to help them improve in wider areas and bring in other NGOs to help with things like the building or sanitation. Feeding pupils is our main purpose but our impact goes beyond that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e51a1fffbfbd28e6cd0b07c813d3a9279ba919f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e51a1fffbfbd28e6cd0b07c813d3a9279ba919f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bookshelves at a primary school in Montserrado county lie empty apart from a few papers, some green twine and a handbell.

They appear on the index for at least the second consecutive year. </p> <p>At the same time, violence perpetrated against journalists by criminal groups and local officials allowed impunity to tighten its grip in Latin America, with Brazil and Mexico each moving two spots higher on the index this year. </p> <p>The index, published annually to mark the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_to_End_Impunity_for_Crimes_Against_Journalists\">International day to end impunity for crimes against journalists</a> on 2 November, calculates the number of unsolved murders over a 10-year period as a percentage of each country\u2019s population. </p> <p>For the current edition, CPJ analysed journalist murders that took place between 1 September 2006 and 31 August, 2016. Only those nations with five or more unsolved cases for this period are included on the index \u2014 a threshold that 13 countries met this year, compared with 14 last year. </p> <p>In rank order (with the numbers of unsolved murders in brackets) they are: <strong>1.</strong> Somalia (24); <strong>2.</strong> Iraq (71); <strong>3.</strong> Syria (17); <strong>4.</strong> Philippines (41); <strong>5.</strong> South Sudan (5); <strong>6.</strong> Mexico (21); <strong>7.</strong> Afghanistan (5); <strong>8.</strong> Pakistan (21); <strong>9.</strong> Brazil (15); <strong>10.</strong> Russia (9); <strong>11.</strong> Bangladesh (7); <strong>12</strong>. Nigeria (5); <strong>13.</strong> India (13). </p> <p>Cases are considered unsolved when no convictions have been obtained (cases in which some, but not all, perpetrators are held to justice are classified as partial impunity and are not included in the tally). <br></p> <p>While militant extremists are responsible for the greatest numbers of attacks against journalists in recent years, they are not the only ones getting away with murder, nor are conflict zones the only place where impunity thrives. </p> <p>For example, the Philippines is placed fourth in the index because of the failure to prosecute any of the perpetrators behind <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao_massacre\">the 2009 massacre in Maguindanao</a>, in which 32 journalists and media workers were killed. </p> <p>In Mexico and Brazil, criminal groups and government officials are also leading suspects in murders of journalists in Russia and India. Each of those countries except Brazil has appeared on the index since its inception.</p> <p>Sri Lanka, where violence against journalists has receded since the end of a decades-long civil war, dropped off the list for the first time since CPJ began calculating the index in 2008.</p> <p> CPJ recorded only four unsolved murders in Sri Lanka for the latest 10-year period, leading to its elimination from the index. Amid the country\u2019s becalmed political climate, no journalist there has been murdered in direct connection to journalism since editor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasantha_Wickrematunge\">Lasantha Wickramatunga</a> was killed in 2009. </p> <p>Justice has not been achieved in any murder despite a pledge from the president, Maithripala Sirisena, to reinvestigate old killings. But Wickramatunga\u2019s case did inch forward this year with one arrest and the exhumation of the editor\u2019s body for a new post-mortem.</p> <p>Impunity is widely recognised as one of the greatest threats to press freedom, and international pressure to address it has mounted in recent years, with states, in- cluding some of the repeat offenders on this list, beginning to respond. </p> <p>Six countries on the index \u2014 Bangladesh, Brazil, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, and Somalia \u2014 convicted perpetrators of journalist killings in the past year, up from three countries in the previous year\u2019s report.</p> <p>In another positive development, more countries on this year\u2019s index participated in Unesco\u2019s impunity accountability mechanism, which requests information on the status of investigations into killed journalists. </p> <p>In previous years, half of the countries on the index ignored this process. This year, only three states among the 13 index countries \u2014 India, South Sudan and Syria \u2014failed to respond. </p> <p>Other findings that emerged from the index: </p> <p>\u2022 Eight of the countries have been listed each year since CPJ began the annual analysis in 2008, an indication of how entrenched impunity is in some nations.</p> <p>\u2022 Despite their poor records in achieving justice, four countries on the Impunity Index \u2014 India, Mexico, Nigeria, and the Philippines \u2014 are on the governing council of the <a href=\"https://www.community-democracies.org/\">Community of Democracies</a>, a coalition dedicated to upholding and strengthening democratic norms. </p> <p>\u2022 Political groups, including Isis and other extremist organisations, are the suspected perpetrators in more than 40% of all murder cases. Government and military officials are the leading suspects in nearly a quarter of the cases. </p> <p>\u2022 In at least 40% of cases, the victims reported receiving threats before they were killed. Threats are rarely investigated by authorities and in only a handful of cases is adequate protection provided.<br></p> <p>\u2022 In the past 10 years, around 30% of murdered journalists were first taken captive, the majority of whom were tortured, amplifying the killers\u2019 message of intimidation to the media community.</p>",
  "<p>In 2011, the British-born, Los Angeles-based writer Simon Reynolds published a much debated book called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/29/retromania-simon-reynolds-review\"><em>Retromania</em></a>, which examined pop music\u2019s growing devotion to revivals, reissues and reunions. Wasn\u2019t this phenomenon, he speculated, \u201canother facet of the recline [sic] and fall of the West\u201d? If so, then perhaps innovation in music and sound, together with the spirit of \u201crebel yell\u201d, was now more likely to emerge from China, Africa and Latin America \u2013 parts of the global south where \u201cpopular energies and desires will be stoked that come into friction with existing political structures and social norms, producing sparks and possibly conflagrations\u201d.</p> <p>One of the people best placed to cast more light on these tantalising vistas is <a href=\"http://www.jaceclayton.com/\">Jace Clayton</a>, otherwise known as DJ /rupture and once described by the influential music magazine <a href=\"http://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/333\">Wire</a> as a \u201cpan-global, post-everything superhero \u201d. In his DJ sets and on his popular <a href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/\"><em>Mudd Up!</em></a> show on the American <a href=\"https://wfmu.org/\">WFMU</a> radio station, he routinely meshed Jamaican dub, Japanese noise, south London jungle and Egyptian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/01/dj-sadat-mahraganat-salam-cairo\">mahraganat</a> \u2013 electronic music born of Cairo\u2019s slums. Harvard-educated, a writer for art journals such as <a href=\"https://bidoun.org/\">Bidoun</a> and <a href=\"https://frieze.com/\">Frieze</a>, he\u2019s also responsible for conceptual art projects such as <a href=\"http://www.beyond-digital.org/sufiplugins/\">Sufi Plug Ins</a>, for which he created a series of programs that readjusted and retuned western sounds according to north African quarter-tone scales. Essentially, the goal was to orientalise the technology of late capitalism.</p> <p><em>Uproot</em>, his first book, is a meditation on how sounds are made, circulated and used by people around the world. It also chronicles an era at the beginning of the 21st century when the ecology of music \u2013 the material on which it was pressed, the shops where it was sold, the money made by its creators \u2013 had become mostly nonexistent. But Clayton was too young to spend all his time bemoaning past epochs; he self-released a frenetically polycultural mixtape, <em>Gold Teeth Thief </em>(2003), made it freely available online, and parlayed the attention it received into a still-intense schedule of air-mile-racking DJ sets.</p> <p>The book is a travelogue of sorts. Here he is in Zagreb, Dubai and Osaka. Here he is in Lebanon using Bluetooth to grab some of the tunes his Adidas-tracksuited cabbie is playing on his mobile phone. Here he is in Monterrey, north-east Mexico, going past emo kids and reggaeton fans on his way to hear thundering tribal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jun/15/scene-heard-tribal-guarachero\">guarachero</a> played by a DJ behind whom is projected a Harry Potter movie. And here he is in Kingston where he is gobsmacked to hear George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d dropped by dancehall DJs.</p> <p>Among the Berbers in Morocco, he hangs out with local singers, listening to them make showy use of Auto-Tune, the audio processor that shifts pitches \u2013 made famous by Cher in her single \u201cBelieve\u201d. He ponders the popularity of Whitney Houston-style melisma across the Maghreb, from \u201cbawdy folksingers whose throats have been burned by a lifetime of whisky, to honey-voiced Koranic reciters, who \u2018sing\u2019 the Koran magnificently yet consider all music to be sinful\u201d.</p> <p>In places like these, there is groove and grit, tradition and reinvention. (Closer to home, in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park, an especially well-textured section of the book concerns the Mexican sound-system parties he attends.) Clayton isn\u2019t looking for undiscovered music or acoustic authenticity; today, he argues, physical instruments and spaces to rehearse, along with dexterity, technique and muscle memory, are less important than computer access, \u201calthough, in a pinch, a PlayStation or smartphone will do\u201d. Rather, he\u2019s fascinated by \u201caudio terroir\u201d, the ways in which environments \u2013 even tough, unprepossessing ones \u2013 can gestate and nurture novel sounds.</p> <p>Enemies of promise are often lurking. DJs and producers scour the planet looking to extract resources from previously untapped areas, plundering emergent scenes for grabby rhythms and samples. In one excellent riff, Clayton contrasts the daring, almost violent collage techniques of 1920s dadaists and Soviet montagists with the \u201cboring, tidy, toothless\u201d ways in which the copy, cut and paste functions on a keyboard allow data to be moved around a screen today. Even more insidious are the sports and soft drinks companies that increasingly seek to forge brand-enhancing relationships with \u201cunderground\u201d culture. \u201cOur sounds and struggles activate their environs as places of heightened meaning.\u201d</p> <p><em>Uproot</em> is witty and nuanced rather than sloganeering, and shot through with the immersive research and hard\u2011earned access to key, sometimes evasive, figures that would be the envy of any Ivy League anthropologist. But Clayton is at his most suggestive when, true to his title, he discusses the relationship between the movement of sounds and of migrant bodies. In Barcelona he has a friend, Mark, an undocumented African musician who lives out a kind of \u201cMediterranean gothic\u201d, squatting in an ex\u2019s apartment, unable to use electric lights after dark for fear of alerting others to his presence. In Casablanca, he heads to a market where the \u201cinorganic tang of injection-molded plastics off-gassing complex, probably carcinogenic, polymer molecules mingles with sweat and diesel exhaust\u201d. Here, as in much of the world, he says, the sellers of cheap, Chinese-run, factory-produced plastic are also the sellers of bootleg, MP3-stuffed CDs.</p> <p>Indeed, when Clayton talks about techniques such as transcoding and compressing \u2013 the art of squeezing recorded music into easily exportable and copyable packets of data \u2013 he could almost be talking about the journeys of refugees and migrants: \u201cThis is the sound of files that have survived patchy connections and erroneous metadata, straddling pirate servers and shaky Bluetooth transfers and YouTube rips, evading spam filters en route to Russian wares sites, to end up on a desktop or in some web video accompanied by an equally messed-up JPeg.\u201d Foreign sounds, like foreigners themselves, invade. But Clayton, like many club goers, embraces the idea of music as a zone of mutation and adaptation, of new rhythms as thrillingly contagious, of the dancefloor as a place of both affirming and redefining community.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Uproot</em> is published by <a href=\"http://www.fsgoriginals.com/books/detail/uproot\">FSG Originals</a>.</p>",

  "<p>British businesses are losing hundreds of millions of pounds every year as a result of women being forced out of jobs after having a baby, a damning report from the equalities watchdog has revealed.</p> <p>The costs of hiring and training new staff, redundancy payouts and lost productivity after women were pushed out of jobs amounted to \u00a3280m a year, according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission.<br></p> <p>About 11% of women are pushed out of their jobs following maternity leave \u2013 about 54,000 women a year \u2013 but only 1% of these lodge a complaint at an employment tribunal, according to the watchdog. The cost to British women who were forced out of their jobs \u2013 either by being dismissed, treated so poorly they had to leave, or made compulsorily redundant \u2013 could be as much as \u00a3113m a year, according to the report.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/22/fifth-of-women-harassed-at-work-over-pregnancy-or-flexible-hours-report-finds\">a report earlier this year</a>, the EHRC found that over three-quarters of pregnant women and new mothers \u2013 the equivalent of 390,000 women - experience negative and potentially discriminatory treatment at work each year. The report suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/jul/27/maternity-leave-discrimination-pregnant-then-screwed-stories\">pregnancy discrimination</a>, which is illegal, has risen significantly since 2005, when 45% of women said they had experienced such discrimination.<br></p> <p>Many women who kept their jobs still faced a financial loss costing up to \u00a334m in total over the year after their return to work as a result of having pay reduced, missing out on promotions or receiving a lower pay rise or bonus. <br></p> <p>Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said: \u201cThis is a very important report that shows if you force out a member of your workforce because of pregnancy it actually costs you much more. There is not just a moral and legal case for retaining women who are coming back to work, but a very strong financial case as well.\u201d</p> <p>She said that the figures related to the first year after women returning to work faced discrimination, but the longer term costs \u2013 including to the state which were estimated at between \u00a314m and \u00a316.7m \u2013 were likely to be much greater.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Women working on zero-hours contracts and doing agency work were more likely to face discrimination and loss of earnings, she said. \u201cWomen working in more precarious roles are more likely to lose their jobs as a result of becoming pregnant, they are more likely to be held back from reaching their potential and contributing to the economy, and that of course costs the state.\u201d<br></p> <p>The EHRC said it was working with businesses to promote flexible working and support for parents returning to work, citing Barclays, the Royal Mail and Ford as positive examples. It called on the government to extend the time limit for making an employment tribunal claim to six months for cases relating to pregnancy and maternity and examine whether prohibitive costs \u2013 which have to be paid up front \u2013 were proving to be a barrier to women getting justice. </p> <p>\u201cThe more people know there is an avenue for redress, the more confident they will be in discussing their needs while employers will know they are more likely to be held to account,\u201d said Hilsenrath.<br></p> <p>Emma Stewart, joint chief executive of flexible-working recruitment firm <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://timewise.co.uk/\">Timewise</a> said all businesses needed to promote flexible working which suited modern families to retain a competitive advantage. </p> <p>\u201cModern economies need modern workplaces, where quality jobs \u2013 for all - are openly advertised to consider flexible working options from the point of hire, so that businesses can attract and retain the best possible talent \u2026 be they parents or not,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The government should give more support for businesses around maternity pay and flexible working, said Mike Cherry, national chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk/join-fsb/what-we-offer?gclid=CKvT9cbe8M8CFZKdGwod94wHwg\">Federation of Small Businesses</a>. \u201cSmall businesses know the value of supporting their staff, boosting morale, productivity, staff retention and ultimately business success,\u201d he said, adding that FSB research showed 80% of small businesses offer or would consider offering flexible working.</p> <p>\u201cThe self-employed also need support,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular, we are campaigning for the maternity allowance to be increased more into line with statutory maternity pay to help our self-employed members and help ensure fairness in government support.\u201d <br></p> <h2>I was told \u2018you are shit\u2019 </h2> <p>When Hannah Martin, a copywriter in an advertising agency fell pregnant with her first child she worked up to her due date, and did not take a day off sick.

  "<p>Developers who illegally demolished a historic Melbourne pub have reportedly promised to rebuild it, blaming among other things the weather forecast for their decision to raze the 159-year-old Corkman Irish Pub.</p> <p>The Victorian government and City of Melbourne launched action against the developers Stefce Kutlesovski and Raman Shaqiri after the Carlton pub was knocked down without a permit 11 days ago.</p> <p>But The Age reported on Thursday night that the pair had written to the government saying they were sorry for knocking the building down without warning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/we-need-to-save-our-cities-the-fate-of-the-corkman-pub-and-sirius-is-social-destruction\">We need to save our cities. The fate of the Corkman pub and Sirius is social destruction | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe want to make absolutely clear that we will rebuild the building at our expense,\u201d the pair reportedly said in their letter.</p> <p>The developers say they ignored the rules because of a combination of \u201clegal advice, engineering advice, weather forecast and injury litigation\u201d.</p> <p>They also conceded another project they had been involved with had a wall collapse that injured a pedestrian, the newspaper reports.<br></p> <p>Earlier in the day, the Andrews government began legal action to force them to rebuild it in heritage style. It also implemented a planning restriction to prevent it being replaced by anything taller than two storeys for the next two years.</p> <p>The pub was knocked down without approval by the developers who reportedly intended to build apartments on the inner-city site.</p> <p>State and local governments have since launched legal action against the pair in the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal seeking orders that the pub be rebuilt in line with its original design, scale and layout.</p> <p>The planning minister, Richard Wynne, said the height restriction imposed by the new planning overlay would allow the city of Melbourne time to involve the community in deciding what should be built on the site.</p> <p>\u201cWhile these cowboy developers thumbed their noses at Victoria\u2019s building and planning laws, we are sending a clear message that wilful and illegal destruction of our heritage will not be tolerated,\u201d Wynne said.</p> <p>The Corkman, previously known as the Carlton Inn, was built in 1857 and had been assessed by the state government as having significant heritage values.</p> <p>It was bought by Kutlesovski and Shaqiri for $4.7m in 2014. With the building demolished the site could be worth $10m, Wynne said.</p> <p>Existing penalties for destroying heritage properties are capped at $200,000, a cost Wynne said could be written into the overall costs for a multimillion-dollar residential development.</p> <p>The government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/victoria-plans-harsher-penalties-for-cowboy-developers-after-historic-pub-demolished\">promised to look at increasing those penalties</a>.</p> <p>Melbourne\u2019s lord mayor, Robert Doyle, said the proposed measures would prevent developers from benefiting from the unlawful demolition.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t get the original Carlton Inn back but we can support legal action to require restitution of the building and amendment of the planning scheme to put strict controls on any future development of the site,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The demolition crew moved in seven days after police were called to a suspicious fire at the building and the demolition continued despite a stopwork order issued by the council.</p> <p>The developers are being investigated by the Victorian Building Authority and the city of Melbourne for breaching several planning and building laws, which could amount to substantial fines.</p> <p>They are also being investigated by the Environment Protection Authority on claims they unlawfully dumped asbestos from the site, as well as by Heritage Victoria and Worksafe.</p> <p>The union representing construction workers has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/unions-issue-blanket-ban-on-work-at-site-of-illegally-demolished-melbourne-pub\">issued a green ban</a> preventing any of its members from working on the site unless it is on a reconstruction of the original building, or other community-approved solution.</p>",

Every two weeks the <a href=\"http://www.forgoodgovernment.com/\">Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government</a>, a conservative group, meets here primarily to discuss campaigning on local issues. </p> <p>Nationally Hillary Clinton is <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/elections/ \">ahead in most polls</a>; regionally they suggest she is mounting a challenge in states such as <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/clinton-campaign-makes-play-arizona-buys-ads-texas-n667706\">Utah, Georgia and even Texas</a>, where Democrats haven\u2019t won in decades; <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/what-the-early-voting-numbers-are-telling-us.html\">early voting</a> is on balance looking promising for the DNC. But when I ask the 12 people in the room how many still think he has a shot, they nearly all raise their hands.</p> <p>A reader of this project suggested I contact Hiatt, who told me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think the polls are rigged. But I think there\u2019s a hidden vote and people are giving the PC answer they think people want to hear rather than how they\u2019ll actually be inclined to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Secret Trump supporters are waiting to cause an earthquake, goes the theory. To the CDCGG members present, the alternative \u2013 that Trump loses \u2013 is unthinkable. \u201cIf she gets elected ...\u201d says Judy Campbell and then shakes her head where the end of her sentence might be. \u201cPeople can\u2019t seriously be thinking about voting for that woman. I mean what in the world ... What can they be thinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what he\u2019s done and said is indefensible,\u201d says Jim Arnold. \u201cBut when you compare it to what she\u2019s done they\u2019re not comparable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me worry about the intelligence of some of these people,\u201d says Margaret Niccum.</p> <p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t fix that,\u201d says Arnold. </p> <p>More than 50 million people are likely to vote for Trump, even if he goes down in flames. It would be unhelpful to generalise about all of them, reducing them to caricature only to dismiss them. Something is happening here and it behooves people to try to understand it, whether or not they like it. From interviews with a range of Trump voters in Muncie, it\u2019s clear most are not blind to his flaws, even if they wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe them in the manner of his detractors. </p> <p>The CDCGG was originally set up to repeal property taxes in Indiana which the group argued were exorbitant. After a successful campaign, they gained the ear of the governor and won a cap on property taxes statewide, and transformed themselves into a local group rallying around local issues. Mostly small businessmen and retirees, half male, half female, all white, it feels like a reconstitution of the Tea Party. </p> <p>Good government, in this context, means small government; with <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/articles/58583-muncie-mayor-says-fbi-investigating-city-government\">Muncie\u2019s Democratic administration under investigation by the FBI for corruption</a> they feel like they are pushing at an open door and would push harder if the local Republican hierarchy were not so reticent. The atmosphere in the room is cordial; these are not just ideological allies, with a keen sense of civic engagement \u2013 two are running for local office and the conversation touches on water rates, sewage rates and teachers\u2019 contracts among other things \u2013 but also friends.</p> <p>Only a couple had wanted Trump to win in the Republican primaries earlier this year. Most preferred Ted Cruz, the Texan who has tried to style himself as a Reaganesque disruptor of Republican politics, or Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida. \u201cI would have been happier with almost anyone else,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cI wanted [Ben] Carson, then Cruz then Rubio. Trump would have almost been my last choice.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask if they are worried that he will do something embarrassing again they mostly laugh and nod.</p> <p>Dave Jamison, who is retired and voted for Obama twice, says he thought Trump was an \u201carrogant SOB when he was on The Apprentice\u201d, but his hunting buddies in southern Indiana persuaded him to take a second look and now he\u2019s thinking seriously of voting for him.</p> <p>Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and training to be a mortician, variably describes Trump as \u201cgarbage\u201d and a \u201cword-butcher\u201d. Walsh, who got in contact with the Guardian through this project, grew up in Muncie but moved away because she saw drugs, single parenthood or incarceration claiming her peers on the southside \u2013 the white working class part of town \u2013 and felt the need to escape. She now lives in the Indianapolis suburb of Brownsburg and probably would have voted for John Kasich, one of the more moderate Republicans in the primaries, if she had registered for a party. \u201cI hated Donald Trump during the primaries,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a mockery.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c/0_58_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh has only voted in a presidential race once: for Obama in 2008. She is likely to vote for Trump now, but says of him: \u201cHe\u2019s a 70-year-old white man. He\u2019s been supported in bigotry his entire life. He\u2019s been validated his entire life. And people wonder why he acts like this. No wonder he acts like this.\u201d</p> <p>One local senior Republican tells me privately: \u201cLook, he\u2019s a bully. Everyone can see that.\u201d</p> <p>The question of why they would vote for a man of whom they apparently have such a low opinion brings us to something else that connects most of them: their loathing of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>It is a disdain of such depths that not a single virtue can be salvaged; a contempt nurtured and tended with such animus and anomie over the decades that she has been in the public eye that any redeeming features she might claim have long been stripped away. \u201cUnlike Hillary, he hasn\u2019t done anything criminal,\u201d says Hiatt. </p> <p>Niccum believes this moment is the culmination of a longstanding plot hatched by the Clintons several years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s been planning this since she was in college,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you let all this stuff go?\u201d asks Walsh, referring to things Clinton has been accused of of late. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy stuff going on in these emails if you read \u2019em. This is all the stuff the crazy people have been talking about for years and now it turns out it\u2019s most likely true ... She\u2019s a professional politician. How do you make millions of dollars as a politician? You\u2019re supposed to be a civil servant.\u201d </p> <p>Jamison is rare among Trump supporters I\u2019ve met, in saying he could vote for Hillary, if Trump were \u201cto go off the deep end again\u201d.</p> <p>But for the overwhelming majority, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/8/1478776/-Why-Do-People-Hate-Hillary-Clinton-So-Much\">Hillary hatred</a> is their driving force. What they see as the apocalyptic scenario of Clinton running the country has them reaching for the largest immovable object to stop her. This cannot simply be dismissed as misogyny. Until just a couple weeks ago Clinton and Trump were running almost even among white women, while white women without college degrees <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a12016ElectionTrackingNo1.pdf\">still favour him 51-42</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d asks Campbell. \u201cJust look at the kind of women she has standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d at the last debate he not only faithfully reflected their sentiments \u2013 he actually understated it. They do not only think she is dishonest, they think she is a criminal, scheming, cheating snob who will sell America to the highest bidder and pocket the proceeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc/160_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump window sticker in Muncie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump window sticker in Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Younge for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey look at things through the global order,\u201d says Will Statom, the head of the Delaware Republican party. \u201cA lot of people are looking at Hillary Clinton as nothing good. It\u2019s laughable that she can relate to the middle class \u2013 laughable. They\u2019re elitists. They have always have been elitists. They were elitists in Arkansas. They have just found a way to get ultra rich with that sham called the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>There are policies of Trump\u2019s they like too. \u201cUnderneath all the crap there are decent ideas but people don\u2019t see them,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cYou have to go looking for them. That\u2019s his own fault. His position on tax reform, trade reform \u2013 they\u2019re not bad. And the plan to privatise the Veterans Administration, that\u2019s a really good plan.\u201d</p> <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is the government agency that is supposed to provide services, including healthcare, to those who have served in the military. It is so notoriously badly run that <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/06/jon-stewart-vs-va-how-tv-host-raged-against-red-tape/31207623/\">Jon Stewart made improving it a campaign on The Daily Show</a>. Walsh\u2019s husband served in Iraq and has PTSD and hearing loss, following an IED explosion. The VA care he is entitled to is hard to access and inadequate when he does get it, so he uses his employer\u2019s health insurance instead.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they get home the VA just hands them pills and sends them home,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cBut psychological pills aren\u2019t one size fits all. You need therapy and treatment and they\u2019re not getting that. It\u2019s like a flow chart of pills. It\u2019s a mess. We have soldiers killing themselves in epic proportions and it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting for care.\u201d</p> <p>For Arnold it\u2019s the supreme court \u2013 currently hanging in the ideological balance after the death of the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left a four-four split between liberal and conservative judges. \u201cThat can change our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how anyone who calls themselves a Christian can vote for her. There\u2019s Roe v Wade, LGBTQ and then she says she\u2019s for the second amendment but then she\u2019ll tell you all the restrictions she\u2019ll put on gun owners.\u201d</p> <p>But the economy is the biggest issue of all in a town like Muncie, which lost much of its manufacturing base as companies moved south. About a third of what was once a thriving blue-collar town lives in poverty; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/25/middletown-muncie-factories-photo-essay-midwest\">huge factory plants lie abandoned</a>, sitting like gigantic art installations depicting the post-industrial era. The broad consensus is that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalised trade between the US, Canada and Mexico, helped kill the economic life of this town: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/hillary-bill-clinton\">an agreement championed by Bill Clinton</a> and supported by Hillary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681/0_0_5000_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Statom drove me around the empty factories, elegising about the loss of both jobs and communities, the tumbledown streets where his grandparents lived and the shuttered buildings where they and his father used to work, he tells me he helped load the last machines on to the trucks in nearby Anderson that took the jobs to Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the unions got greedy. That was part of it. And then Nafta did the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like Trump,\u201d says Jamison. \u201cGet America back, middle-class jobs and everything. I think we need some of that.\u201d Do you think those jobs are coming back? I ask Jamison. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The devastation wreaked by that hollowing-out is what Walsh felt the need to escape when she left Muncie. \u201cI have friends from high school who were incarcerated for bank robbery. One of the guys I went to high school was killed not so long ago. My best friend, who has a daughter, she\u2019s on her own. It\u2019s just a mess. People addicted to drugs. There\u2019s nothing to do. It\u2019s a sad situation. It\u2019s textbook of how you create an inner city.\u201d</p> <p>During the primaries, when all but a couple of the Republican contenders had dropped out, Trump did well on the southside where Walsh grew up. The white working class \u2013 and particularly white men without a college degree among whom he leads by a whopping 60-21 \u2013 form a significant part of Trump\u2019s core support. But it would be a mistake to conclude from that that he has the bulk of support in these areas. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">Nationally, Trump supporters are generally wealthier than most Americans</a> and considerable wealthier than those who voted for Clinton. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dcelectionday.com/2016-2/primary-election-2016/\">Democrats outpolled Republicans by a significant margin</a> during the primaries in most, if not all the southside precincts in Muncie. Bernie Sanders, the \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d insurgent on the Democratic side, got more votes than Trump on the southside and even though Clinton lost to Sanders there, she wasn\u2019t far behind Trump in vote totals.</p> <p>\u201cNobody speaks up for the poor,\u201d says Walsh, explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to those she grew up with. \u201cThere is systemic racism but black people have advocates. Poor white people don\u2019t. They\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t feel racist, they don\u2019t feel sexist, they don\u2019t want to offend people or say the wrong thing. But for them white privilege is like a blessing and a curse if you\u2019re poor. The whole idea pisses poor white people off because they\u2019ve never experienced it on a level that they understand. </p> <p>\u201cYou hear privilege and you think money and opportunity and they don\u2019t have it. I understand how it works but I don\u2019t think most people do. So when Trump says stuff, they can understand what he\u2019s saying and he speaks to them in a way other people don\u2019t. And then you\u2019ve got people calling them stupid and deplorable.

  "<p>New York City endured another brutal summer this year, and you know what that means: a severe <a href=\"http://thegreencity.com/the-causes-and-effects-of-the-urban-heat-island-effect/\">urban heat island</a> effect and the omnipresent stench of rotting garbage. Summer in New York makes one acutely aware of the near-constant presence of waste piling up on pavements waiting to be collected and trucked to an out-of-state landfill.</p> <p>New York is, in fact, widely <a href=\"http://matadornetwork.com/life/new-york-wasteful-city-world/\">reported</a> to be the world\u2019s most wasteful city. Wastefulness in this case means New York uses the most energy (<a href=\"http://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/megacity-metabolism-is-your-city-consuming-a-balanced-diet/\">\u201cthe equivalent of one oil supertanker every 1.5 days\u201d</a>), disposes of the most trash (33m tonnes per year), and uses the most water. The dubious title comes from <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5985.abstract\">a study</a> published last spring in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p> <p>While the world\u2019s most wasteful city could well be in the consumption-rich US, New York is an unlikely culprit. If the world\u2019s most wasteful city is American, as it very well may be, it\u2019s probably a sprawling sunbelt metropolis like Houston, Atlanta, Tampa, or Phoenix \u2013 all of which rate worse than New York on most environmental metrics but weren\u2019t included in that particular study.</p> <p>Among global megacities, Mexico City generates the most trash after the New York region: 12m tonnes per year. That\u2019s largely a function of relative wealth: the regions have similar population sizes of just over 20 million and 21 million people respectively, but GDP per capita is three times higher in the US.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/11/beautiful-lebanon-becoming-rubbish-tip-beirut-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4hfbd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2471620\"            data-video-name=\"How beautiful Beirut is becoming a rubbish tip \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/3/11/1457690096249/KP_1832931_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56e295fee4b0dfdfc0925967\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/3/11/1457690096249/KP_1832931_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/11/160311Stink_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/11/160311Stink_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/11/160311Stink_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/11/160311Stink_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/11/160311Stink.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/11/beautiful-lebanon-becoming-rubbish-tip-beirut-video\">The parody rubbish film that went viral in Beirut</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But waste is a bigger quality of life problem in Mexico. At least the steaming trash in New York is being put out for the sanitation trucks. In 2011, Mexico City closed its largest dump, <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/sustainable-communities/gov-mexico-city-recycling-incentive-more-food.html\">causing trash</a> to pile up at illegal dumping sites and be left out on the street, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/09/waste-mountain-mexico-city\">highlighting the absence</a> of a comprehensive policy for urban waste collection, disposal and processing. There are signs of hope, though. A number of recycling initiatives have been launched, including one that <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/virgin-unite/trash-food-mexico-city-market-thats-tackling-capitals-waste-problem\">allows residents to trade in recyclables</a> for vouchers to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>The third biggest waste producer among megacities is Tokyo, which is actually impressively austere. Greater Tokyo has more than 50% more residents than Mexico City, but it produces slightly less rubbish. Japan is very densely populated, and so it lacks the space that the US and China have to throw their garbage in landfills. Instead, they have adopted hyper-aggressive <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/world/asia/how-do-japanese-dump-trash-let-us-count-the-myriad-ways.html\">recycling programmes</a> to cut down on waste. Tokyo, which <a href=\"https://msu.edu/~hillrr/The%20Zero%20Waste%20City%20whole%20text.pdf\">strives to be</a> a zero-waste city, is no exception.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wealthier a place is, the more is wasted and thrown.</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Kovac, World Resources Institute</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So how can Tokyo be rated the third most wasteful city? This is the tricky thing about measuring wastefulness: waste is a byproduct of consumption, and consumption generally tracks with income. \u201cThere are some general rules for consumption levels: as income rises, people just cycle through more consumption patterns in general,\u201d says Alex Kovac, a research analyst at the World Resources Institute, an international environmental research organisation. \u201cThe wealthier a place is, the more is wasted and thrown.\u201d</p> <p>A city\u2019s waste rate, Morton says, roughly follows that of the country it\u2019s in. According to a World Bank <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/0,,contentMDK:23172887~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:337178,00.html\">study from 2012</a>, the most recent on the subject, New Zealand generated the most garbage, 3.68kg per person every day, among developed countries, followed by Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, and the US. But the data on smaller countries may be failing to account for recycling. </p> <p>Norway, for example, has high rates of recycling and Oslo, its largest city, has <a href=\"http://oslo.miljobarometern.se/state-of-the-environment-oslo/waste-and-litter/annual-household-waste-per-capita/\">successfully reduced</a> its waste production in recent years. Ireland, on the other hand, has <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ireland-has-third-highest-waste-level-per-capita-147581.html\">lower recycling rates</a> than in the rest of western Europe. Dublin might be one of the most wasteful cities in Europe, but it is still only a second-tier competitor for world\u2019s most wasteful city, as its greenhouse gas emissions are still only half the rate of the US or Australia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7e2f72fff782e42f7f5d7327e2f5a5d51dca364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e2f72fff782e42f7f5d7327e2f5a5d51dca364/0_0_3913_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walking in the street, Tokyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tokyo is densely populated, so doesn\u2019t have the space for landfills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuya Shino/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US is the world\u2019s biggest <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/global-development/la-fg-global-trash-20160422-20160421-snap-htmlstory.html\">producer of trash</a> in absolute terms, generating 624,700 metric tonnes per day, which is <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/which-countries-produce-the-most-waste/\">2.58kg/capita</a>. That\u2019s considerably more than many other rich countries, such as Japan\u2019s 1.71kg/capita, the UK\u2019s 1.79kg and France\u2019s 1.92kg.</p> <p>According to a 2010 <a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/04/prweb3882124.htm/\">study</a> by the water bottle company Nalgene \u2013 which measured self-reported behaviours such as using public transportation, recycling, and conserving electricity \u2013 the five most wasteful of the US\u2019s 25 largest cities are Houston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Tampa and Indianapolis, in that order. Nalgene found New York was found to be the third least wasteful, after San Francisco and Seattle. (On the subject of water waste, Phoenix, which is built in a desert, devotes half of its residential <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/us/an-arid-arizona-city-manages-its-thirst.html\">water use</a> to irrigate lawns.)</p> <p>In China, waste is growing twice as fast as the population. As the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/chinas-trash-is-taking-over/article24367032/\">Globe and Mail notes</a>, China now produces an average of 1.12kg per person per day of residential waste, nearly 10% more than the average in Ontario, even though China\u2019s GDP per capita is more than six times lower. Chinese cities don\u2019t recycle, meaning that their waste output could be cut in half, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-the-worlds-geniuses-of-garbage-disposal-1463519134\">as it has been</a> in neighbouring Taiwan.</p> <p>China doesn\u2019t break out its waste data by city, but some Chinese cities with notable refuse problems include <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/897061.shtml\">Beijing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1530028/thousands-people-visit-garbage-sites-guangzhou-tries-build-support-new\">Guangzhou</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-03-17/what-to-do-with-china-s-trash-burn-it\">Shenzhen</a>, which have started building trash incinerators to pick up the slack from a shortage of landfill capacity. But burning trash, in turn, just worsens their notoriously dirty air.

Most wasteful as measured by total garbage created, will knock out almost all developing world cities, for the simple reason that they cannot afford to buy and waste as much. But if you\u2019re talking about some of the local problems associated with trash, like having it piling up in your streets, some of the world\u2019s poorest cities, such as <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/6\">Manila </a>and <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/7\">Port-au-Prince</a>, have very big problems indeed.</p> <p>Without the infrastructure to collect garbage, it\u2019s dumped in rivers, canals and streets, and the result is unsanitary chaos. Other developing cities that are overburdened with trash they cannot process include those with fast-growing economies such as <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/10\">Bangalore</a> and Delhi.</p> <p>Mumbai produces the fifth most waste of any megacity, and last year Bloomberg <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-16/mumbai-is-being-buried-under-a-mountain-of-its-own-trash\">reported</a> it was \u201cbeing buried under a mountain of its own trash\u201d. The city of over 18 million people produces 11,000 metric tonnes of trash per day. Plastic wrappers and bottles fill the gutters, backyard waste burning contributes to air pollution, and the rest winds up in a giant open landfill.</p> <p>In Delhi, which <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/22/world/la-fg-india-trash-mountain-20120422\">experienced</a> a 50% increase in waste between 2007 and 2012, the lack of formal trash pick-up systems leads to rubbish mountains and impoverished waste pickers sorting through it for anything that can be reused or resold. Delhi\u2019s garbage problem and its overwhelming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/11/delhi-considers-shutting-schools-as-toxic-smog-continues\">smog</a> could certainly make it the world\u2019s dirtiest city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47f4b6b120ddc56611849275befd71575ca4b0e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f4b6b120ddc56611849275befd71575ca4b0e1/0_329_3902_2342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indian scavengers look for coins and re-usable items amongst the religious offerings and wooden frames of idols of goddess Durga which are piled up in the Yamuna river in New Delh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men scavenge for coins and re-usable items in the Yamuna river in New Delhi, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rapid population growth itself may also be a risk factor. <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/8\">Jakarta</a>, for example, is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities and many of its residents are in the habit of dumping their household items in the nearest waterway. So much makes its way out to sea that 100 tonnes of garbage a day is collected on the beaches of an island five miles away.</p> <p>Even a rich city can find it impossible to stash away all its waste if it\u2019s too tightly packed. Hong Kong is on the precipice of <a href=\"http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/msw/htm_en/executive/main.htm\">running out</a> of space in its landfills. A decade ago, Singapore <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-waste-singapore-idUSSP9046620080522\">had the same problem</a>, but it implemented policies to boost recycling and burn trash for energy. Now it <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/singapores-innovative-waste-disposal-system-1442197715\">puts</a> only 2% of its waste in landfills. That\u2019s not without its own drawback: burning rubbish creates <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/where-trash-is-a-burning-problem-17973\">air pollution</a>, from carbon emissions to toxins and particulates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/9\">Cairo\u2019s </a>trash problem is unique: not only does it produce 625 kg per person per year of solid waste \u2013 a very high rate for a poorer country \u2013 but its system of trash pickers, and feeding waste to pigs, have been disrupted by political instability, religious disapproval of pigs by the temporary Muslim Brotherhood government and an outbreak of swine flu.</p> <p>Whichever of these cities is truly the world\u2019s most wasteful, New York probably doesn\u2019t take the crown after all. The 2015 study titling it thus misleadingly measured its metropolitan region, rather than the city itself. New York City\u2019s metro region includes large swathes of suburbia and satellite cities spread across three states. What\u2019s more, the study only took into account megacities over 10 million people, leaving out a whole host of incredibly wasteful smaller cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/27/new-york-rubbish-all-that-trash-city-waste-in-numbers\">What does New York do with all that trash?

That discrepancy is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/07/suburbs-carbon-emissions-_n_4556474.html\">very pronounced</a> in New York, thanks to the city\u2019s unusually high share of non-drivers and relatively small homes. New York City also has aggressive recycling programmes that are currently expanding beyond paper, metals, and plastics to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/nyregion/with-compost-program-keeping-waste-from-going-to-waste.html?_r=0\">compost</a> food waste. </p> <p>The greater density, more pedestrian-oriented urban planning, and vastly superior mass transit networks in Europe and Japan make their cities and suburban towns much more energy efficient than most of the US.

  "<p>Achieving the ambitious target to end maternal and child deaths, enshrined in the sustainable development goals (SDGs), will require ingenuity. The good news is that 11 health innovations could save more than 6 million mothers and children by 2030, if they are invested in and used widely in <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health/maternal-and-child-health/priority-countries\" rel=\"nofollow\">24 priority countries</a>.</p> <p>When I began working in global health (at the World Health Organisation in 1990) 12.7 million children under five and 532,000 new mothers died every year. The challenge looked insurmountable. But in the two decades that followed, unprecedented global cooperation resulted in annual child deaths being cut by more than half, to <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/mortality_under_five_text/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">5.9 million in 2015</a>, and annual maternal deaths to just over 300,000.</p> <p>As impressive as the progress has been, it\u2019s not enough. The current rate of decline in maternal and child mortality will not get us to the ambitious SDG targets by 2030. We need innovative tools and approaches to accelerate progress. </p> <p>The 11 innovations modelled in our <a href=\"http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=2647\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis</a>, <a href=\"http://ic2030.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">crowdsourced from experts around the world</a>, are gamechanging health technologies and approaches that will have wide-scale impact, ensure healthier babies, protect mothers, and secure better health in the long term.</p> <h2>1 Injectable contraceptives</h2> <p>A new formulation that combines a widely used long-acting contraceptive in an easy-to-use injection is already improving access to this life-changing intervention by allowing community health workers to bring the drug directly to women. Several countries are even studying the potential for women to self-inject, further empowering women and their choices. </p> <p>Modelling showed that this innovation, making long-acting contraception more accessible, could save more than 3 million lives \u2013 including women, newborns, and children \u2013 by helping women space their pregnancies in a healthy way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-25T10:24:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Estimated lives saved graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-25T10:24:15/embed.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Estimated lives saved graph</a> <figcaption>Estimated lives saved graph.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2 Better pneumonia treatment</h2> <p>Accurately diagnosing pneumonia in young children is very difficult. New tools to diagnose and treat the condition, including better respiratory rate monitors and portable pulse oximeters, can save many more lives from this disease, which is the leading infectious killer of children under five.</p> <h2>3 Kangaroo mother care</h2> <p>There is so much we can do now to give newborns a better chance at a healthy life. Studies have shown that <a href=\"http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9241590351/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kangaroo mother care</a>, or skin-to-skin contact between the newborn and mother immediately after birth, improves breastfeeding and thermal regulation of newborns, both critical for survival in low-resource settings.</p> <h2>4 Chlorinators for water treatment</h2> <p>Beyond traditional interventions for mothers and newborns, we also need to ensure access to clean water. New technologies, like a chlorinator for community water treatment, are making the use of chlorine for disinfecting water easy and economical.</p> <h2>5 Antiseptic gel</h2> <p>Chlorhexidine, a low-cost antiseptic, is a very simple gel that, if applied to the newborn\u2019s umbilical cord, can prevent deadly infections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c9392fa81809b39d923423c71115f825e378b38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c9392fa81809b39d923423c71115f825e378b38/0_0_3776_3032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Despite widespread distribution of mosquito nets, malaria is still one of the world\u2019s biggest killers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"803\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite widespread distribution of mosquito nets, malaria is still one of the world\u2019s biggest killers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6 Single-dose anti-malarial drugs</h2> <p>Better drugs to protect against diseases like malaria are in the works, including a potent single-dose anti-malarial drug.</p> <h2>7 Neonatal resuscitators</h2> <p>As many as one in 10 newborns need help breathing at birth, new, simple, neonatal resuscitators can help prevent deaths. <br></p> <h2>8 Low-cost balloon tamponade</h2> <p>Women with postpartum haemorrhage can also be stabilised and treated by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_tamponade\" rel=\"nofollow\">balloon tamponade</a>, a common tool in high-income countries. Recently, this tool has been adapted using readily available materials in low-income countries. Using the materials at hand, a healthcare provider can create a tamponade out of condoms and rubber tubing. Now simple low-cost kits and pre-assembled versions are available, that make this solution more accessible and effective.</p> <h2>9 Drugs to stop blood loss after childbirth</h2> <p>New forms of the drug oxytocin are currently being developed and tested that could increase coverage because they won\u2019t require skilled health workers to administer or refrigeration for storage. These innovations could help ensure this highly effective drug reaches and treats hundreds of thousands of women at risk of death from postpartum haemorrhage (or severe bleeding after delivery) each year.</p> <h2>10 Rice fortification</h2> <p>For children who live in areas where rice is a staple food, we are seeing amazing developments in rice fortification, a process that enriches rice with vitamins and iron supplements. Better nutrition is at the core of better health and smarter ways to supplement staples and introduce foods with more nutritional value are essential.</p> <h2>11 New tests for a life-threatening maternal condition</h2> <p>Preeclampsia is another danger that affects more than one in 20 pregnant women. It is associated with dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to seizures. New diagnostic tools to treat preeclampsia will help identify at-risk women so that they can receive low-cost treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/21/we-shouldnt-have-to-wait-until-the-next-olympics-to-end-malnutrition\">We shouldn't have to wait until the next Olympics to end malnutrition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How will these life-saving innovations be funded?

This year, Flint, in Michigan, suffered from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">water contamination crisis</a> when a high amount of lead was found to be present in the drinking water.

Erin Brockovich, environmental activist, rose to fame in 1993 when she revealed there were dangerously high levels of cancer-causing chromium-6 in a Californian town\u2019s water source. She has continued to fight for greater transparency about water quality, and recently claimed that <a href=\"http://www.brockovich.com/portfolio/hinkley-california/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hinkley</a> wasn\u2019t an isolated event with more water supplies contaminated across the US. In September, new <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/research/chromium-six-found-in-us-tap-water\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis</a> conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Environmental Working Group</a> (EWG) of federal data from drinking water across the US found the same carcinogenic discovered by Brockovich has contaminated significant bodies of water in all 50 states. </p> <p>Raising awareness of poor water quality can be challenging, but more organisations are stepping up to the task. Stephen Abbott Pugh, portfolio manager at <a href=\"https://okfn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Knowledge International</a> explains how South Africa\u2019s Department for Water is looking for new ways to collect information about water quality and availability during one of the worst droughts in history. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do everything they can to raise awareness of water issues.\u201d</p> <p>The government is keen to learn how it can deal with crises like drought, or poor sanitation. In April the Department for Water held <a href=\"http://code4sa.org/2016/04/04/hack4water-hackathon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">hackathons</a> across the country which saw 15 hack teams bid to share their solutions to the water crisis by coding apps and debating. The goal according to a statement on their website is \u201cto make data available to citizens for purposes of scrutiny and interrogation and to figure out how the state can best use data provided by citizens.\u201d </p> <p>Abbott Pugh describes how the use of open data is spreading across Africa, and how it can help combat water disease and sanitation issues. \u201cIn Rwanda, organisations are trying to connect a million farmers to data in some way. We need to work out what information we need for this to work and how we can trigger the process. Already open data networks exist where farmers receive messages if there\u2019s a warning they need to be aware of, for example a weather situation.\u201d </p> <p>One organisation that is succeeding at encouraging disparate communities and individuals to share data is <a href=\"http://www.mwater.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mWater</a>. This not-for-profit tech startup has been making a huge impact on communities since 2011 with its open data initiatives. With 8,000 users in 73 countries, mWater has developed a <a href=\"http://www.mwater.co/explorer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">mobile phone app</a> that allows users to analyse water quality and share this information on their global, open-source water monitoring database.</p> <p>Studies conducted by the startup found water users tend to choose from an average of three water sources on any given day. They decide where to fetch water based on how it tastes, when it flows best, and whether their friends will be there. mWater wants to make whether it\u2019s contaminated a factor that weighs on their choice. </p> <p>Annie Feighery, CEO and co-founder of the app, says: \u201cThe first public health office we partnered with was in the city of <a href=\"http://mwauwasa.org/site/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mwanza, Tanzania</a>. They are very forward thinking and there, every aid organisation that builds a water source (like a shallow well, borehole, kiosk) has to register with them. When they saw our dataset emerge showing shallow wells were dangerously contaminated, even at levels beyond the WHO standard for safe wash water, they made a policy to not certify NGOs building shallow wells any more. Shallow wells are an easy sell in aid.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/16/data-pioneers-close-development-gap-rural-india\">Data pioneers aim to close the development gap in rural India</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is more to just building a well for village, she says. \u201cNinety per cent of shallow wells tend to become dangerously contaminated within a year of their creation. mWater brought that kind of finding to light because we now have monitoring data on massive amounts of water sources across different geographies and over time.\u201d She explains the goal is to incentivise monitoring as much as possible; keeping it free also protects against water monitoring turning into a cycle of aid dependency after the donor leaves.</p> <p>Organisations like WaterAid are using mWater to monitor a water source once it has been created, but other NGOs like the <a href=\"https://ugandanwaterproject.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ugandan Water Project</a> are using the app to conduct a more democratic pre-site assessment. Rather than building a new well somewhere because an important politician lives there, they look at evidence like where water is needed and what is already available to decide where is most deserving. </p> <p>She explains how mWater was designed with a similar user interface as Facebook and WhatsApp because they\u2019re easy to use. \u201cWe routinely train people who have never touched a smartphone in their lives to become proficient app users within a few hours.\u201d </p> <p>The UN predicts that half the world\u2019s population <a href=\"http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">will live in a water-stressed area by 2030</a>, while EWG research has highlighted how poor water quality is not confined to the developing world.</p> <p>Open data can be used to give residents a voice, and enable them to choose whether to buy bottled, how to filter their water, or where to lead their cattle to drink.

  "<blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve just switched from slow ADSL broadband, where the router was outside my office, to fast Virgin broadband, where the router is on the other side of the house. Unfortunately, my computer is struggling to pick-up the Wi-Fi signal. In the past, I\u2019ve tried Wi-Fi extenders from Netgear and Belkin but not had much luck with them. I found that if I placed them where they got a strong enough signal, they didn\u2019t actually extend the signal much further. Will Google\u2019s Wi-Fi mesh routers be the solution, and if so, do you know of any routers like that that can be bought in the UK? <strong>Stephen</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Wi-Fi is never as fast, and never as reliable, as a wired internet connection. In the old days, before DECT and mobile phones, many people had wires running to landline phones, and it\u2019s still not that hard to do with bulkier Cat5E (E for \u201cenhanced\u201d) or Cat6 cable. Cat6A can deliver 10 gigabits per second over 100 metres of Ethernet cable, which would solve the speed problem for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Failing that, the best answer is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePlug\">HomePlug</a>, which is what I use.</p> <p>HomePlug was developed to send broadband internet traffic across a home\u2019s \u2013 or an office\u2019s \u2013 mains electricity cables. The system is overseen by the <a href=\"http://www.homeplug.org/\">HomePlug Alliance</a>, which is much like the Wi-Fi Alliance that looks after Wi-Fi. The first HomePlugs were shipped in 2001, and the latest versions are HomePlug AV (2005) and AV2 (2012). The latest AV2 HomePlugs offer MIMO (multiple input multiple output) operation instead of SISO (single input single output). This should provide much better throughput.</p> <p>HomePlug AV includes 128-bit encryption, in case your mains signals stray onto next door\u2019s wiring.</p> <p>HomePlug networks are usually sold with two paired devices. There\u2019s a sender, which you connect to your router via an Ethernet cable and RJ-45 socket. There\u2019s a receiver plug that connects to your local device. The pair may be hard-wired with a unique password to talk to one another. If the devices ship with common default passwords, you should change them, following the instructions in the manual. This may be as simple as holding down the reset button for a couple of seconds on each device.</p> <p>Some HomePlug devices offer Wi-Fi as well. That is to say, the receiver has a small Wi-Fi transmitter as well as one or more RJ-45 ports for wired connections. In my experience with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Devolo-Powerline-Starter-Adapter-Extender/dp/B00OZDO8RE/\">Devolo dLan 1200+ Wi-Fi ac Starter Kit</a>, this works well.</p> <p>The disadvantage is that a HomePlug usually creates its own separate Wi-Fi network. The Devolo dLan 1200+ gets round this by including \u201cWi-Fi Move Technology\u201d that lets you use your existing router\u2019s SSID and password to create a single network. Some systems have a \u201cWi-Fi Extender\u201d mode instead.</p> <h2><strong>HomePlug speeds</strong></h2> <p>As with Wi-Fi, the specified speeds of HomePlug devices are nothing like the actual speeds. For example, an 802.11n Wi-Fi router may have a theoretical maximum speed of 600Mbps, but you may well get only 40-50Mbps. It depends partly on the distance from the router, your walls and floors, interference from other networks, and the number of devices sharing your bandwidth.</p> <p>Similarly, a HomePlug AV system has a theoretical speed of 200Mbps, but you\u2019re more likely to get 30-60Mbps, sometimes less. In this case, it depends on the distance from the router, wiring quality, and the amount of noise present. Noise can be created by other electrical products from fridges to smartphone chargers. If you have problems with a HomePlug connection, try turning off other devices and see if you can find the culprit.</p> <p>Some HomePlug devices may work better when plugged directly into a wall socket than when plugged into a multi-way adaptor. Most HomePlugs have a pass-through connection so you don\u2019t actually lose a socket.</p> <p>Either way, my ancient Solwise 85Mbps HomePlug Turbo package was more than fast enough to handle BBC iPlayer. I would expect any decent HomePlug AV or AV2 system to meet your needs.</p> <h2><strong>Router changes</strong></h2> <p>Before you invest in some HomePlugs, try to improve the performance of your current system. Rather than leave your router in a corner or on the floor, try to position it as high as possible, perhaps on a shelf, with lots of space around it. Move it away from the TV set and other large household appliances.</p> <p>See if it\u2019s possible to add one or more high-gain antennas to increase the signal strength.</p> <p>You may also get better performance if you use a different channel from any strong Wi-Fi networks nearby. There are lots of ways to find out which channels your neighbours are using, but in Microsoft Windows, you can open a command prompt and type (or paste in): netsh wlan show all</p> <p>Many PC programs and smartphone apps will give you a list of all the networks within range, and tell you which channel they are using, among other things. Examples include the paid-for <a href=\"http://www.metageek.com/products/inssider/\">inSSIDer</a> (Windows, Mac and Android), and free ones such as <a href=\"https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/wlan-software/wlan-scanner-acrylic-wifi-free/\">Acrylic WiFi Home</a> (Windows), <a href=\"http://wifiscanner.com/wifiscanner.html\">WiFi Scanner</a> (Mac, though there\u2019s a scanner built in now) and <a href=\"http://www.ampedwireless.com/wifianalytics/\">Amped Wireless</a> (Windows, Android).

You may get better results by disabling channel bonding and using a different single channel. Remember to reduce the channel width to 20MHz.</p> <p>Unfortunately, switching from the overcrowded 2.4GHz baby alarm band to 5GHz, if available, probably won\u2019t help.

However, you could set one up using existing comms equipment, if you knew how. The problems are that it\u2019s tricky to do and, unless you live in a mansion, you really don\u2019t need one.</p> <p>The sites that can benefit from mesh networks include stadiums, small towns, large clubs, restaurant chains and so on. Hotels are ideal. <a href=\"http://www.open-mesh.com/success-stories.html\">Open Mesh supplies these markets</a>, and includes a cloud-based network controller called <a href=\"https://ct4.cloudtrax.com/login\">CloudTrax</a>.</p> <p>A few companies have seen the potential for simplifying mesh networking for home users. These include Eero, Luma and, most recently, <a href=\"https://madeby.google.com/wifi/\">Google</a>. They all take the same approach: you can buy a single device or a three-pack to set up a mesh. All three have designed their products to look nothing like routers, which is where they differ from Open Mesh. (The prices are <a href=\"http://www.open-mesh.com/products/access-points.html\">not that different</a>.)</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"https://store.eero.com/\">Eero</a> sells a router for $199 and a three-pack for $499. <a href=\"https://getluma.com/\">Luma</a>\u2019s three-pack costs $399.

On the outside of its breeze-block walls, Pentreath\u2019s Butter Cross bakery is dressed as an early 19th-century brick gazebo, crowned with a gilded fibreglass orb. It looks on to a little market square, where cast-iron verandahs face off against a creamy rendered terrace, watched over by a neoclassical office block that is raised on an arcaded plinth. It might seem grand for a village square, but it\u2019s nothing compared with the latest set-piece tableau a few streets away, unveiled by the Queen today.</p> <p>Almost 30 years since the masterplan was drawn up for this 400-acre site on the edge of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/03/lets-move-to-dorchester-dorset\">Dorchester</a>, Poundbury has finally received its town centre in the form of Queen Mother Square. If the first phase, built in the early 90s, was based on a villagey \u201cDorset vernacular\u201d, this grandiloquent piazza has cranked up the dial to full Greco-Roman. A doric colonnade marches along the front of a new Waitrose on one side, facing the yellow facade of <a href=\"http://www.strathmore-house.co.uk/\">Strathmore House</a> across the square.

Sprouting from this block (which \u201cbrings to Dorchester design standards normally associated with Knightsbridge\u201d), a 40-metre-high tower now rises above the square, visible from far around. It\u2019s an odd beast, looking a bit like an inflated Georgian townhouse perched on top of the Arc de Triomphe, crowned with a domed pavilion and a little bright green pergola.

It has industry, shops and small workshop units mixed in among terraced streets, apartment blocks, mews houses and squares, arranged in such a way that the layout of buildings defines the street pattern, rather than being straitjacketed into a car-dominated grid. The streets are winding and deliberately chaotic to calm traffic, with blind bends and no stop signs or any other signage, while each neighbourhood is planned to be no more than a five-minute walk to its centre.</p> <p><em></em>Still, the progressive attitude to cars hasn\u2019t curbed habits: a survey conducted at the end of the first phase showed that car use was higher in Poundbury than in the surrounding rural district of West Dorset. The free-for-all parking policy, meanwhile, has turned many of the streets and squares into a car park for Dorchester shoppers.<em> </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"364cc97a75d930836aecd49ae437c6d765811b29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/364cc97a75d930836aecd49ae437c6d765811b29/0_1239_4808_6009/800.jpg\" alt=\"Waitrose on Queen Mother square.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waitrose on Queen Mother Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the chief success has been achieving the holy grail of genuine mixed use. As well as the medical clinics and vets, offices of lawyers and accountants, travel agents and a funeral home, there is a thriving chocolate and cereal factory, a tech company making components for plane wings, along with 80 small units for startup businesses scattered among the porticoes. \u201cWe sort of reinvented medieval workshops by mistake,\u201d says Poundbury\u2019s estate director, Simon Conibear, listing the enterprises, ranging from those making cakes and wedding dresses to curtains and electric bikes, two-thirds of which are run by women.</p> <p>A primary school is also under construction, reflecting the increasing number of young families moving to Poundbury. \u201cI thought it was a retirement village,\u201d says Aaron Watkins, who opened menswear shop <a href=\"https://www.clath.uk/\">Clath</a> here last month, stocking Red Wing and YMC, rather than Hunter and Barbour. \u201cBut it\u2019s a really mixed demographic with loads of younger people moving down from London.\u201d</p> <p><em></em>Despite the leaded windows, the place has impressive energy credentials, too. An anaerobic digester nearby uses local farm waste to create enough fuel to power up to 56,000 homes on the Dorset grid, as well as charging the electric blue bus that trundles between Poundbury and Dorchester (bridging the \u201cus and them\u201d divide, which has softened over the years). So does this quaint experiment deserve all the derision?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to come here and compare it unfavourably with a 300-year-old town,\u201d says Pentreath. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a modern housing estate. If you look at a 1989 suburban development, it\u2019s all identical two-storey brick houses, with a business park on the edge if you\u2019re lucky.

  "<p><br>On 26 September, staff with the <a href=\"http://atlantabg.org/\">Atlanta Botanical Garden</a> found a frog dead in his enclosure. The frog had big brown eyes, massive feet with thick webs between the toes, and brownish skin speckled with little yellow dots. His name was Toughie. He was big for a frog and he didn\u2019t like it when humans <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/media/cinematic/video/2580713/toughie-is-last-of-his-species-of-tree-frog/\">handled</a> him. He\u2019d lived a long time: 12 years. </p> <p>And he was the last of his kind. </p> <p>On 26 September 2016, the world very likely lost Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed treefrog (<em>Ecnomiohyla rabborum</em>) to extinction. The species, only discovered by scientists in 2005, lived in Panama before it was wiped out in the wild by habitat destruction and the amphibian disease, chytridiomycosis. The last one was heard calling in the wild in 2007. But before this, a small number of Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed treefrog had been taken into zoological facilities for captive breeding. Unfortunately, the attempt failed. Toughie was the last to die. </p> <p>Despite the fact that we can actually trace the extinction of Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed treefrog to an exact date, it occurred with very little media interest. Sure, the species\u2019 demise was covered by many standard science media sites, such as <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/media/cinematic/video/2580713/toughie-is-last-of-his-species-of-tree-frog/\">Scientific American</a>, <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/toughie-rabbs-fringe-limbed-tree-frog-dies-goes-extinct/\">National Geographic</a>, and <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/10/rabbs-fringe-limbed-tree-frog-now-presumed-to-be-extinct/\">Mongabay</a>. </p> <p>But the list of what media outlets thought the story not interesting enough is perhaps more notable, including the BBC, the Sun, and CNN. Even this outlet, the Guardian, did not devote a full article to the extinction. </p> <p>Many news sites simply reprinted the Associated Press\u2019s story, which spilled 264 words on the extinction of Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed treefrog (in contrast, the AP wrote three times as many words, 798, on Taylor Swift\u2019s concert at Formula One). The New York Times at first only carried the AP article, though it later published a beautiful <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/opinion/a-frog-dies-in-atlanta-and-a-world-vanishes-with-it.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&amp;smtyp=cur\">op-ed</a> by one of the researchers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/oct/20/the-four-horsemen-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction\">How humans are driving the sixth mass extinction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, I waited a little while to see if news coverage would pick up as the story trickled out \u2013 it didn\u2019t.</p> <p>A week after the extinction, I gave a presentation to a local herpetological society, ie devoted to amphibians and reptiles. When I brought up the recent demise of Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed treefrog, there were audible gasps in the room. Even herp lovers hadn\u2019t heard of it. </p> <p>This begs the question: how could the public care about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/world-on-track-to-lose-two-thirds-of-wild-animals-by-2020-major-report-warns\">global mass extinction</a> if they aren\u2019t even told about its victims? How can we care if we don\u2019t grieve? <br></p> <p>Scientists have repeatedly warned that if we don\u2019t change our ways we could see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/oct/20/the-four-horsemen-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction\">mass extinction event</a> with potentially hundreds of thousands, even millions, of species wiped out by human actions. <br></p> <p>The impact \u2013 and scale \u2013 is impossible to imagine. The last time the Earth suffered such a mass extinction event was when an asteroid slammed into it, killing off all the non-avian dinosaurs. We didn\u2019t show up for another 64m years. </p> <p>Despite this, most media outlets chose to ignore a story that could not only inform readers of the loss of one distinct species, but also connect them to a global crisis that rarely makes its way on to the front page \u2013 or any page for that matter. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know why so many outlets ignored the story \u2013 but it may be because the species that went extinct was a frog and not a big mammal like the baiji (which also didn\u2019t get the <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2007/04/the-news-of-extinction-western-medias-response-to-the-demise-of-the-baiji/\">coverage</a> it deserved when it vanished, but got plenty more than Toughie\u2019s species). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29becb2af588e2dd9bfbf8c6a5b462ab6045b867\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29becb2af588e2dd9bfbf8c6a5b462ab6045b867/0_108_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The golden toad, another victim of our current biodiversity crisis, was last seen in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The golden toad, another victim of our current biodiversity crisis, was last seen in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Conservation International/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, Rabbs\u2019 fringe-limbed treefrog was truly amazing. Living in the canopies of Panama\u2019s cloud forests, this species glided through the air via the webbing connecting it toes. Scientists also believe that it was the only frog species to feed its tadpoles by allowing them to nibble at the skin of adults.</p> <p>If a frog such as this is not noteworthy, what does that mean for the reptiles, fungi, plants, insects or fish that vanish? What does that say about any species that doesn\u2019t grip the public\u2019s imagination \u2013 are they somehow lesser for not having evolved (or vice versa) to be easily loved by us? </p> <p>Amphibians are the canary in the coalmine for our current biodiversity crisis. Having been around for 370m years, amphibians make dinosaurs look babyish. But experts believe we may have lost more than 150 species in the last few decades alone, many of them to chytridiomycosis. On top of this amphibian plague, amphibians are being hard hit by deforestation, habitat loss, pollution, pesticides, the illegal wildlife trade for pets and even consumption and yes, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/jan/06/-paris-agreement-biodiversity-coral-reefs-forests\">climate change</a> (which may be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-19199197\">exacerbating</a> the stunning death tolls of chytridiomycosis). </p> <p>Unfortunately, Toughie will not be the last frog to vanish or the last species. How many more will depend on us. But it\u2019s hard to imagine anything changing when a story like Toughie\u2019s is so easily swept aside.

  "<p>\u201cIf my children were ever taken off me, I wouldn\u2019t survive the day,\u201d was my sister\u2019s emotive, yet understandable, comment when we were discussing the impact losing your children could have on your mental health. It made me think of a woman I had worked with, Emily.</p> <p>Emily had her son taken off her after she had attempted to kill herself. The boy, Jacob, was pre-school, and the decision by social services was made in her best interests. Emily had been in an abusive relationship and was struggling to cope. She had serious mental health problems as well as a history of childhood abuse, so coping was not something she was good at. She had always refused to engage with mental health services for fear that it would result in Jacob being taken away. The tragedy is that engaging with services was probably the only thing that would have kept their family together.</p> <p>After further attempts to take her own life, Emily was detained under the Mental Health Act and admitted to the mental health ward where I worked. At this point, Jacob had been taken away by social services. Emily was told Jacob would be adopted; she could have phone contact until then and one final visit to say goodbye.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/08/convicted-paedophile-teenage-girl-child-abuse-psychiatrist\">Sam is a convicted paedophile \u2026 and a teenage girl</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Initially she could not accept this and just wanted to die. It was one of the hardest cases I have experienced. She was right \u2013 what did she have to live for now she had lost Jacob? How could she continue feeling this pain and despair for life? As a team \u2013 nurses, doctors, occupational therapists and psychologists \u2013 we worked tirelessly with her to instil some sense of a future. Jacob was going to grow up loved, in a safe and secure environment unlike anything Emily had ever experienced. Her son had a positive future and she could take some comfort in that. </p> <p>We focused on preparing Emily for her last contact with her son. She made her own plans about what she wanted for the two of them, and we supported her to achieve it. Emily was brave and made sure she could hold it together until Jacob had left, and then her world came crashing down.</p> <p>Part of the preparation included talking to Emily about her suicidal thoughts and talking to her about what we could do to minimise the risk. We kept her safe while she grieved the loss of her son. We then worked with her to create the positive future she wanted for herself. This started with her keeping herself safe on the ward, one day at a time. We then looked at a longer term placement where she could get the intensive psychotherapy she needed to manage her mental health issues, heal from the hurt of the past and come to terms with losing Jacob. </p> <p>Every day mental health nurses help people like Emily, who feel they have nothing to live for. Every day mental health nurses save lives. According to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Mental-Health-Taskforce-FYFV-final.pdf\">report</a> by the Mental Health Taskforce Strategy (2016) more than 14,000 people who have killed themselves between 2003 and 2013 had been in contact with mental health services; this is only just over a quarter of all suicides in that time. The same report acknowledges that suicide rates for mental health inpatients are declining, but sadly it is only the people we don\u2019t manage to save that make the headlines. I am glad that we were able to help Emily and she hasn\u2019t become another statistic. </p> <p><em>Names and some details have been changed</em></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.samaritans.org/welisten?gclid=CL6A_b-l68sCFYZuGwodhR4HuQ\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>Clean, green development is the sole route to future global economic growth, according to British economist Lord Nicholas Stern, with a continuation of polluting, high-carbon growth only leading to self-destruction.</p> <p>There is a strong argument that China is now leading the world in action on climate change, Stern said, making the country both a competitor and inspiration for other nations. </p> <p>Stern, speaking ahead of two lectures to mark the 10th anniversary of the highly influential <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080910140413/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">Stern report</a>, said the cost of not acting to halt global warming had risen while the costs of doing so had fallen.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\">The 2006 Stern report</a>, commissioned by the UK government, found that the economic damage caused by unchecked climate change could be 5-20% of global GDP each year, but that cutting carbon emissions would cost just 1% of GDP. The report warned against delaying action, but this has not been heeded, said Stern on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWe have delayed action,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential damages now look bigger than I suggested then. In that sense I underplayed the consequences of not getting on with it. But the costs of action are a good deal lower than I indicated then, in that technical progress has been faster that we thought. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/26/solar-panel-costs-predicted-to-fall-10-a-year\">cost of solar power</a> [for example] is not far off a factor of 10 less than in 2006.\u201d</p> <p>Today, he said, a low-carbon future is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/16/climate-change-report-damage-overhaul-global-economy\">sole option for prosperity</a>. \u201cIt is the only one available and it is a very exciting growth story,\u201d Stern said. \u201cAny attempt to follow high-carbon growth will eventually be self destructive due to the very hostile environment it creates. There was an old alleged tension between growth on the one hand and climate responsibility on the other, but it\u2019s a completely fake horse race.\u201d</p> <p>Stern said other drivers of economic growth, such as using interest rates, tax changes and structural reforms, had limited potential. \u201cSustainable development of infrastructure and cities is the growth story of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are winning the arguments intellectually and politically, but it has all been much too slow.\u201d</p> <p>Stern foresees economies in which people<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/sterns-warning-on-climate-change-battle\"> travel using efficient self-driving cars</a>, bicycles and walking, homes and businesses are powered by green energy, materials are widely recycled and ultrafast broadband supports home working. \u201cIt is a very attractive future if we just put our minds to it,\u201d he said. \u201cCities where you can\u2019t move and breathe make no sense.\u201d</p> <p>Stern said China could be seen as the leader in climate action today. \u201cYou can make a strong case for that,\u201d he said, noting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/china-coal-peak-hailed-turning-point-climate-change-battle\">Chinese coal use peaked two years ago</a>. \u201cYou have radical change in energy and very big structural change in the economy, moving very strongly towards service sectors and high-tech.\u201d</p> <p>He said a key driver is the threat to China from fossil fuel burning, both in terms of climate change impacts, particularly droughts and floods, and air pollution. </p> <p>\u201cI wish the whole world had known [in 2006] how big an issue air pollution was. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/25/air-pollution-kills-7m-people-a-year\">kill millions a year</a>, so delay on that has resulted in probably the deaths of tens of millions of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe double gain \u2013 both reducing the risk of climate change and reducing air pollution \u2013 is now seen as a very powerful and attractive argument for action. This argument has been particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/27/more-than-million-died-due-air-pollution-china-one-year\">strong in its attraction in China</a>, which has probably moved the most in the last 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>Stern said China was also driven by the desire to be the biggest player in the green economy: \u201cIf there is a race in green products, China rather fancies itself to do well.\u201d</p> <p>China already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">leads the world in wind and solar energy installations</a> and also has a major nuclear power programme. \u201cThe future of nuclear will be determined in China as it is the only country doing it at scale,\u201d Stern said, suggesting 100-150 new nuclear power plants could be built there in the next 15-20 years.</p> <p>The UK has been a leader on climate change, he said, both in its pioneering domestic laws passed in 2008 and in international negotiations towards the global Paris climate change agreement. \u201cBut the UK wobbled in 2015 in terms of support for renewables and that has created some uncertainty,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Since coming to power, the Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\">has drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power</a>, leading the UK to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/11/uk-loses-top-10-spot-in-global-energy-ranking-for-the-first-time\">fall down league tables ranking national energy sectors</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/gl/en/industries/power---utilities/renewable-energy-country-attractiveness-index\">attractiveness for renewable energy investment</a>. Stern said all low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear, would be needed in the UK but that \u201csolar and wind with storage is particularly promising\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, when the UK had a future in the European Union and Ed Miliband was a potential prime minister, the chief business commentator of the Financial Times, John Gapper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6e43e54-f8a3-11e3-befc-00144feabdc0\">announced the demise</a> of Britain\u2019s rightwing tabloids. Unusually for an FT journalist, Gapper had once worked at the Daily Mail, and at the FT he often writes about the media, sweepingly and authoritatively even by that paper\u2019s standards. \u201cThe era of the Fleet Street tabloids, the populist and fearsome emblems of British culture and politics, is over,\u201d he wrote on 25 June 2014. \u201cIt has been over for some years, in fact, but neither they nor their critics chose to admit it.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to their shrunken print circulations: in 1950 the Daily Express was \u201cthe world\u2019s best-selling paper\u201d, he wrote, and \u201csold more than 4m copies each day\u201d. Yet by 2014 it was selling barely a ninth of that; and it has weakened further since. \u201cThe tabloids appeal to a readership limited by class, occupation, and social attitude,\u201d Gapper continued. \u201cThat is not sufficient in the digital era. Young people are not loyal to one tabloid title and few of them will subscribe online.\u201d</p> <p>Gapper cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">the phone-hacking scandal</a> which closed the News of the World in 2011; competition from politically neutral, free tabloids such as Metro; the distraction of readers by smartphones; and the advancing years of key tabloid figures such as Paul Dacre, now 67, who has been the crusading, splenetic editor of the Mail for almost a quarter of a century. Gapper predicted that Dacre would probably be the last tabloid editor to successfully \u201cexpress their readers\u2019 inner thoughts and emotions \u2026 more strongly than the readers could themselves\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/14/revenge-of-the-tabloids-podcast\">Revenge of the tabloids \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, the many observers and enemies of the tabloids have repeatedly forecast their political decline. In 2010, the blogger Sunny Hundal wrote in the New Statesman that that year\u2019s general election had been \u201cnotable for how little impact the tabloids had\u201d. He concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely the Sun can claim victory after an election ever again.\u201d This June, in the middle of the EU referendum campaign, the i newspaper declared on its front page, \u201cThe Media Won\u2019t Decide This Vote\u201d. In August, a former managing editor of the Sun, Stig Abell, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/opinion/britains-paper-tigers.html?_r=0\">wrote in the New York Times</a> that the other tabloids had become \u201cliving relics\u201d, with the Express \u201cno more than an incontinent shriek of made-up facts about health and immigration\u201d. The headline for the piece was \u201cBritain\u2019s Paper Tigers\u201d.</p> <p>Yet on 23 June 2016, almost two years to the day after Gapper had written their obituary, one of the biggest, oldest dreams of the tabloids came spectacularly to life, when Britain voted to leave the EU, against the predictions of most broadsheet commentators. It was an outcome for which the tabloids had campaigned doggedly for decades, but never more intensely \u2013 or with less factual scrupulousness \u2013 than this spring and summer, when the front pages of the Sun, Mail and Express bellowed for Brexit, talking up Britain\u2019s prospects afterwards, in deafening unison, day after day. Two days before the referendum, the Sun gave over its first 10 pages to pro-Brexit coverage.</p> <p>The referendum has not been the only tabloid triumph of the last 18 months. At the 2015 general election, again contrary to most predictions, the Conservatives won a majority against the Labour bogeyman the papers had alternately mocked and feared for the previous five years: \u201cRed\u201d or \u201cWeird\u201d Ed Miliband. At Loughborough University, Prof David Deacon and his colleagues have studied the tabloid coverage of the last six general elections, going back to 1992. \u201cWe were doing our initial analysis of 2015 while the campaign was going on,\u201d he remembers, \u201cand there seemed to be laughably extreme anti-Labour headlines. The levels of partisanship were at least the equal of what we recorded in 1992,\u201d widely considered the previous high point \u2013 or low point \u2013 of tabloid electoral influence.</p> <p>\u201cOn polling day in 2015,\u201d Deacon continues, \u201cI was doing the final data runs, and I thought to myself, \u2018If Miliband gets a hung parliament, in spite of this hostility, it will be extraordinary. This election will put us out of business.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/28/when-tabloids-publish-and-dont-give-a-damn\">When tabloids publish and don\u2019t give a damn | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, this July, Theresa May suddenly swept past the favourite Boris Johnson to become Conservative leader and unelected prime minister. The Mail has long admired and promoted her as a stern, controlling figure, like Dacre himself. To his usually formal paper, which was thrilled by her fierce party conference speech this month, she is \u201cTheresa\u201d.</p> <p>British politics now feels relentlessly tabloid-dominated. From the daily obsession with immigrants to the rubbishing of human rights lawyers, from the march towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d to the smearing of liberal Britons as bad losers and elitists, the tabloids and the Conservative right are collaborating with a closeness and a swagger not seen since at least the early 90s.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sun and Mail have more power now than they have for a long time,\u201d says David Yelland, editor of the Sun from 1998 to 2003. \u201cYou could argue that in Brexit the tabloids had their most powerful moment ever.\u201d In a text less than an hour after the Brexit victory was declared, the current editor of the Sun, Tony Gallagher, told the Guardian\u2019s media editor: \u201cSo much for the waning power of the print media.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Even the most confident and successful<strong> </strong>modern British politicians have regarded the tabloids as culturally and electorally pivotal. In 2012, Tony Blair told the Leveson inquiry into the behaviour of the British press: \u201cIf you have a readership of three to four million \u2026 that\u2019s power \u2026 I don\u2019t know any other way of describing it.\u201d In his autobiography, Blair writes of his decision as Labour leader to appease the Sun and its proprietor Rupert Murdoch: \u201cNot to [do so] was to say carry on and do your worst, and we knew their worst was very bad indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Like almost every book about New Labour, Blair\u2019s has dozens of index entries for the Sun and Mail. Conservatives tend to be more reticent about their relations with the tabloids: there are no index references to the Sun in either volume of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memoirs. But shortly before her 1987 general election victory, she spoke privately about Murdoch to her confidant Woodrow Wyatt. \u201cWe depend on him to fight for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Sun is marvellous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e/125_79_3201_4358/735.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/08/general-election-2015-how-britain-really-voted/\">research by YouGov</a>, the paper you read is still \u201ca far better predictor of Labour and Tory support than any other indicator\u201d. This applies to all national papers \u2013 in 2015, Guardian readers chose Labour over the Tories by 10 to one. But with the rightwing tabloids, uniquely, the link is rapidly growing stronger. At the 2015 general election, the Tory advantage over Labour among Sun readers was one-and-a-half times as big as it had been in 2010. Moreover, as John Curtice of Strathclyde University, the veteran analyst of British voting behaviour, points out: \u201cPeople who still read papers in print are disproportionately politically interested. They vote!\u201d</p> <p>The word \u201ctabloid\u201d was invented in 1884 by the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome; before it referred to pithy newspapers, it meant a concentrated dose of medicine.</p> <p>Consider some headlines from the Express this autumn: \u201cMigrant Influx Is Threatening To Destroy Our Way Of Life\u201d; \u201cMuslim Bus Driver \u2018Put Children\u2019s Lives At Risk\u2019 By Stopping For Prayer\u201d; \u201cBenefit Cheats Spared Jail As Fraud Rockets\u201d. For the rightwing tabloids, they are unremarkable \u2013 such themes and stereotypes and phrases have run through the papers for decades: on front pages, in news stories, in features, editorials and pieces by columnists, almost all the articles agreeing with each other, almost every day. The papers have tirelessly devoted themselves to what the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci referred to as the manufacturing of \u201ccommon sense\u201d, by which he meant the partisan but often unnoticed and unchallenged assumptions that tilt public opinion rightwards. In 2013, an in-depth survey by <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx\">Ipsos MORI revealed</a> that Britons vastly overestimate the number of British immigrants, Muslims and benefit fraudsters.</p> <p>In an era when agreed facts are becoming rarer, and voters are increasingly impatient and distracted, but also disorientated by shock events, influencing how issues are talked about is more important than ever \u2013 possibly more important, in fact, than influencing elections. In Britain, uniquely among democracies, a few tabloid newspapers are at the heart of both; their preoccupations so familiar that the terms \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201crightwing tabloid\u201d have become almost synonymous.</p> <p>Yet the exact workings and nature of their influence are fiercely disputed. Politicians, journalists, academics, and tabloid proprietors say contradictory things about it. Defenders of the papers say that tabloids understand and represent their readers; critics say that they talk down to them and manipulate them. Even the owners of tabloids can\u2019t always keep their story straight. In 2012, Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that the Sun\u2019s famous claim after the 1992 election \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won it\u201d \u2013 had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/25/rupert-murdoch-sun-wot-won-it-tasteless\">\u201ctasteless and wrong \u2026 We don\u2019t have that sort of power.\u201d</a> But at the Sun\u2019s offices in London, some of the rooms have glass walls with reproductions of its most mythologised headlines embedded in them, including the front page from the day of the 1992 election, about the then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock: \u201cIf Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.\u201d</p> <p>Like Miliband, Kinnock unexpectedly lost. Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry he thought this front page was \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d. He could not resist revelling in his paper\u2019s power, it seemed, even as he denied it.</p> <p>In 1992, the political scientist Ken Newton wrote that identifying the political role of newspapers was \u201ca classic conundrum of the behavioural sciences\u201d. Do people think and vote as rightwingers because they read rightwing papers \u2013 or is it the other way around? Are tabloids just one voice in a larger media babble, or do they play a unique role in setting the agenda for other journalists, such as broadcasters? To what extent do the tabloids shape their readers\u2019 social values \u2013 or have the tabloids\u2019 own values been made to shift by changing public attitudes towards race and gender and sexuality?</p> <p>In the Britain of Theresa\u2019s Brexit and seemingly perpetual Tory government, the rightwing tabloids reign again \u2013 even as their business, like the rest of the print media, continues to crumble. Is theirs a brittle supremacy? Or is their hold on the national discourse secure for another generation?</p> <p>One way to investigate these questions is to tell the story of their political influence on modern Britain. It is not a simple tabloid tale.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Britain is in many ways a perfect environment for a partisan press. It is a small, centralised country with a raucous party politics and an enduring culture of national newspapers. Unlike local papers, the nationals do not have to appeal to everyone, but can have intense relationships with particular readerships. British newspapers first appeared regularly during the civil war of the 1640s: the earnest Mercurius Britannicus supported parliament, the mocking Mercurius Aulicus backed the royalists. Three hundred years on, political bias remained so blatant that in 1947 Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government established a royal commission to investigate the press, in particular the power of its disproportionate number of rightwing proprietors. Lord Beaverbrook, the domineering owner of the Express, told the ineffectual commission: \u201cMy purpose originally was to set up a propaganda paper, and I have never departed from that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, the pioneering social research organisation Mass Observation conducted one of the first British studies of the interactions between newspapers and their readers, by scrutinising press consumption in libraries and other public places. \u201cMost people choose their paper primarily for its politics,\u201d it found. Fifty-eight per cent of people read political news stories, far more than read sport or \u201cgossip\u201d. With huge electoral turnouts and party memberships, Attlee\u2019s Britain was a highly politicised society. \u201cNewspaper influence on [reader] opinion,\u201d the study went on, was \u201ca subtle, almost imperceptible process\u201d: either \u201cthe long-term reinforcement of opinions already held\u201d, or to \u201csow seeds and implant suggestions on points to which people have up to now given next to no thought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42/0_0_3259_4164/783.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.\" width=\"783\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Express Newspapers/Daily Express</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Mass Observation warned over\u2011ideological proprietors: \u201cPeople tend to resist newspaper influences that lead them in a direction they are not disposed to follow.\u201d During the 1945 general election, one Express headline read, \u201cGestapo In Britain if Socialists Win\u201d. Attlee won by a landslide.</p> <p>So used to thinking of tabloids as always omnipotent, modern Britain has forgotten that their political influence actually dwindled during the postwar decades. Improving literacy and the complexities of the war reduced the impact of simplistic newspapers. Mass Observation found the press falling behind \u201cbooks\u201d, \u201cpersonal experience\u201d, and \u201cfriends and family\u201d as political influences. The arrival of television during the 50s, which was not allowed to be partisan, made the Mail and the Express, founded in 1896 and 1900 respectively, look still more like bombastic Victorian throwbacks. So did the increasingly consensual nature of postwar party politics.</p> <p>In 1952, the Labour politician and diarist Richard Crossman spent a hospital stay reading a British newspaper history: \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d he wrote afterwards, \u201cwas the enormous power of the press in politics before 1918 and its steady decline since... Today, [when there is] a campaign against a cabinet minister, the effect is usually to strengthen his position.\u201d</p> <p>As the economy recovered from the war, advertising revenue became more important to papers, and this brought a pressure to publish fewer political, potentially reader-alienating stories. According to the media historians James Curran and Jean Seaton, the amount of \u201cpublic affairs\u201d coverage in the tabloids halved between 1945 and 1975. The Mail and Express carried on backing the Conservatives, but their readers increasingly ignored the editorials: by 1963, 28% of Mail readers and 38% of Express readers supported Labour.</p> <p>In 1964, the struggling Daily Herald, founded half a century earlier as a radical paper for striking trade unionists, was relaunched as the Sun. It remained Labour-supporting;<strong> </strong>but as its apolitical-sounding, blandly uplifting name might suggest, it was more interested in consumerism, and in what it called \u201cpacesetters\u201d: young working-class people, often women, who were joining the expanding middle class of southern England.</p> <p>The idea that newspapers should no longer lecture their readers received support from academia. The Sun was conceived partly on the advice of a sociologist and social forecaster, Dr Mark Abrams. He produced reports with graphs and tables which appeared to prove the existence of a new, increasingly well-educated, less politically tribal, mass newspaper readership. Meanwhile in America, where most academic work on the media was done, the analysis of press influence converged on a \u201cminimal effects model\u201d. It noted that few voters changed their minds during presidential races, when coverage of politics was at its most feverish, and concluded that papers were not much of a factor in electoral contests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f/0_0_1036_1351/767.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GNM/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many postwar American ideas, \u201cminimal effects\u201d quickly crossed the Atlantic, and helped shape the thinking of the small number of British media analysts. In 1974, the respected Colin Seymour-Ure wrote languidly in his book The Political Impact of Mass Media: \u201cMost British national newspapers ... are \u2018partisan\u2019 in only a loose sense.\u201d Beaverbrook had died in 1964. The equally rightwing co-creators of the Mail, Viscount Northcliffe and Viscount Rothermere, had died in 1922 and 1940, respectively. Newspapers were increasingly controlled by corporations seeking profits or prestige rather than political clout. In a 1977 essay titled \u201cThe Organization of Public Opinion\u201d, the media academic Tom Burns concluded: \u201cThe power of the press barons has gone.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It had not. In 1969 Murdoch bought his first British paper, the News of the World. While mostly interested in sex and scandals, it was traditionally a Tory paper. According to Roy Greenslade\u2019s reliable 2003 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/society1\">Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda</a>, Murdoch was permitted to acquire it partly because the other potential buyer was Robert Maxwell, then a book publisher and Labour MP.</p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s own politics, at this stage, were a slightly unformed but usefully ambiguous mix, both pro-business and pro-trade union. Despite the elite-bashing persona which he would deploy, brilliantly and shamelessly, in the intensely class-sensitive world of British newspapers for decades to come, he was in fact the son of an Australian press magnate, Sir Keith Murdoch. Sir Keith had been so influenced by the Mail\u2019s Northcliffe that he was nicknamed Lord Southcliffe. When Murdoch junior was asked if he would tell the News of the World what to say, he replied: \u201cI did not come all this way not to interfere.\u201d</p> <p>When the Sun was also put up for sale in 1969, after its first incarnation attracted too few readers, Murdoch and Maxwell again competed to buy it. Maxwell wanted to slim the Sun\u2019s staff, while Murdoch assured the paper\u2019s powerful unions that he had no such intentions. Again, Murdoch won. His Sun tried to be youthfully, fashionably left-liberal: it was against the death penalty, nuclear weapons and the Vietnam war; for Labour and personal freedom. Its endorsement of the party at the 1970 general election deferred to readers rather than tried to browbeat them: \u201cThis \u2026 far-from-perfect Labour government has just about earned the right to \u2026 another term of office. That is our view. But you have a mind of your own.\u201d</p> <p>During the late 60s and early 70s, the large advantage that the Conservatives had always enjoyed among the tabloids, in terms of both circulation and opinions expressed, suddenly evaporated. When the national union of mineworkers (NUM) went on strike in 1972 against Edward Heath\u2019s Tory government, the Express, despite still being owned by the Beaverbrook family, was sympathetic: \u201cThese men do a hard, dirty, dangerous job \u2026 All they ask is a decent wage. They should have it.\u201d The Mail acknowledged \u201cwidespread public support\u201d for the strike, and commented: \u201cSympathy for the miners is a good cause. It makes sense for Britain.\u201d The editor of the Sun, Larry Lamb, was the son of an NUM official and had once edited a union journal. Of the Sun\u2019s pro-strike coverage, Murdoch said afterwards, \u201cWe certainly pushed public opinion very hard behind the miners.\u201d</p> <p>Just as startling and forgotten, in Britain\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, in 1975, the tabloids urged their readers to vote in favour of Europe. When the pro-EU side won by 67% to 33%, the Mail rejoiced: \u201cThis is the most crushing victory in British political history. The effects of this thunderous YES will echo down the years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631/0_0_4096_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the tabloids\u2019 flirtation with cosmopolitanism and the left was short. In 1974, the miners went on strike against Heath again, and the Mail condemned them. When he called a general election that February, to try to end the dispute, the Sun endorsed the Conservatives. Some of this shift was a reaction against the increasing radicalism of parts of the union movement and the Labour party. The Mail became preoccupied by the presence of communists in the NUM. But the tabloids were also increasingly hit by strikes themselves. The stalling, inflationary British economy of the mid-70s had brought lower advertising revenues, higher newsprint costs, and higher wage demands. All Fleet Street papers had prickly unions, but the Sun\u2019s were the most rebellious of all, regularly stopping editions from appearing.</p> <p>James Alan Anslow joined the Sun in 1977, and worked there on and off for four decades, as well as writing and lecturing in academia about tabloids and their readers. \u201cSoon after I started at the Sun,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was working on production, and I let the word \u2018victory\u2019 through on a headline about a strike by the firemen\u2019s union. Kelvin MacKenzie [who later became the paper\u2019s most aggressively rightwing editor] gave me a bollocking. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t you know what we\u2019re all about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Margaret Thatcher seized the Tory leadership from Heath in 1975, Larry Lamb quickly became a convert. The Sun editor would invite her to his office for evening chats and whisky, and published so many favourable pieces about her that the more cautious Murdoch, anxious about the Sun\u2019s large residue of Labour readers, would phone Lamb and ask, \u201cAre you still pushing that bloody woman?\u201d The Sun had backed the losing side at both the 1970 and February 1974 general elections. But by the late 70s many voters were turning against unions and collectivism, and the individualistic Sun\u2019s circulation surged, doubling over the decade. In 1978, it overtook its once-dominant leftwing rival, the Daily Mirror, to become Britain\u2019s best-selling daily paper. In January 1979, amid the strike chaos of the Winter of Discontent, the Sun lethally punctured the credibility of the Labour prime minister, Jim Callaghan, with a headline that sounded like a quote from him but was actually disguised editorialising: \u201cCrisis, What Crisis?\u201d</p> <p>The Mail was an early and effective Thatcher ally too. Its editor during the 70s and 80s was David English, a zealously rightwing former entrepreneur who had backed her coup against Heath (the Mail was the only paper to do so). English modernised the Mail\u2019s design, and turned the paper into a less fusty, more seductive advocate of Conservative values, presenting them as basic British common sense, somehow above mere party politics. The day before the 1979 general election, the Mail\u2019s front page read, \u201cThe Woman Who Can Save Britain\u201d. The Sun\u2019s endorsement of the Conservatives was less personal and more equivocal, but eye-catching: \u201cVOTE TORY THIS TIME.\u201d The return of the rightwing tabloids was complete \u2013 and with it came the press culture we still live in now.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As British voters have become more disengaged since the 70s, the tabloids\u2019 political messages have had to become louder. \u201cVOTE FOR MAGGIE,\u201d yelled the Sun\u2019s front page on the day of the 1983 general election. When Labour moved rightwards after losing, choosing the pragmatic Kinnock as leader, the Sun immediately dismissed him regardless: \u201cHe has no intellectual depth, no coherent philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Kinnock\u2019s strategist Philip Gould, who would become Labour\u2019s key interpreter of voter behaviour during the 90s, began reading the tabloids closely. \u201cI looked at those papers and silently wept,\u201d he wrote after the 1992 general election campaign. Some tabloid journalists had mixed feelings about their papers\u2019 power. James Alan Anslow remembers: \u201cWhen the Sun did the lightbulb\u201d \u2013 its famous 1992 front page of Kinnock\u2019s balding head inside a bulb \u2013 \u201cI was out on the doorstep canvassing for him. Politically, I thought it was awful. Journalistically, I felt \u2026 professional admiration. I couldn\u2019t help smiling. In the office after the paper came out, there was a lot of chatting and smiling. There was a sense of being in amongst it \u2013 of counting.\u201d</p> <p>When Labour lost, despite a tired Conservative government, there was a surge of academic and media interest in the tabloids\u2019 political role. The \u201cminimal effects\u201d model had already begun to attract British doubters. In 1991, the media analyst William Miller had written about what he instead called \u201cthe Basildon effect\u201d. In this heavily working-class Essex constituency, which had one of the highest proportions of Sun readers in the country, a small and supposedly vulnerable Conservative majority had risen rather than fallen at the 1987 election. According to Miller, this swing had happened late in the campaign \u2013 when the Sun\u2019s onslaught on Labour was at its loudest \u2013 and it had been repeated in other similar Tory marginals. He suggested the paper had played a major role.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100/0_0_590_768/384.jpg\" alt=\"The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.\" width=\"384\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GMN/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1992, John Curtice interviewed a panel of voters from across the country, before and after the general election. Unlike Miller, he did not find tabloid readers shifting from Labour to the Conservatives. But he wrote that the papers did play a part in \u201cwinning over or maintaining in the Conservative camp electors who might otherwise have abstained or voted Liberal Democrat\u201d. All the scare stories about Labour, it appeared, had persuaded these pivotal voters to choose the Tories as the lesser evil, as they would in 2015.</p> <p>More ominously still for non-Tories, in 1992 Ken Newton found that people with Labour views who read a rightwing paper \u2013 of whom there were still millions \u2013 were more likely to vote Conservative than people with Tory views who read a leftwing one were to vote Labour. Tory papers were better at making converts than Labour ones, in other words, just as they would prove better at turning leftwing readers into Brexiters than the Labour press would be at creating remainers.</p> <p>By the 90s, many political observers assumed that readers of rightwing tabloids were a sort of block vote, to be deployed en masse by proprietors as decisively as union members had been by their leaders during the 70s. In academia and beyond, the tabloid factor was frequently cited as a reason why Labour would never win power again.</p> <p>There were weaknesses in this argument. The gap between the Conservative share of the newspaper market \u2013 between 70 and 80% \u2013 and the Conservative share of the vote at general elections \u2013 around 40% \u2013 suggested that papers were not terribly efficient creators of Tory voters. Even in 1979, when the Sun had said \u201cVOTE TORY\u201d, fewer than half of its readers had done so. Another third actually believed it had endorsed Labour. As Britain became a less deferential, less politicised society, readers could no longer be relied on to absorb or even notice bossy political articles in the way that they had in the editorialists\u2019 heyday of the 40s.</p> <p>Yet by the mid-90s, after four consecutive general election defeats, Labour was not interested in examining such complexities. Under Blair, the party generally sought to accommodate rather than challenge rightwing interests: Gould decided that the Mail was \u201cthe key influencer of Middle Britain\u201d, Blair that Murdoch was \u201cimmensely powerful\u201d. More than a year before Blair became Labour leader in 1994, a delicate political dance began between him and the tabloids \u2013 each side seeking to draw maximum advantage from the rising strength of the other \u2013 which culminated in the Sun endorsing Labour at the 1997 general election.</p> <p>The day before the announcement, Blair\u2019s press secretary Alastair Campbell was contacted by the Sun and told to call its editor, Stuart Higgins. \u201cHe said they were going to come out for us in a big front page tomorrow,\u201d Campbell wrote in his diary, capturing the sense of mutual triumph and machismo. \u201cStuart said Rupert Murdoch was sure [about Blair], and laughed \u2026 I took [Blair] to one side and \u2026 I said you remember in 1994 when I said we should try to get the Sun on board and you said you weren\u2019t sure it was possible, well, they are. He thought it was good news in its own right \u2026 [and] in the effect it would have on the other side\u2019s morale.\u201d The next day, the Today programme on Radio 4 reported that the Conservatives felt bewildered: \u201cOld friends\u201d \u2013 its correspondent meant the Sun \u2013 \u201care passing them by on the other side of the street.\u201d</p> <p>Less noticed was the fact that the paper had endorsed Labour on its own, almost unchanged, rightwing terms. \u201cLike us, Blair recognises that the Tories under Maggie Thatcher achieved remarkable reforms,\u201d said the Sun. \u201cBlair has promised to slay the dragon of Europe,\u201d it went on, and might even \u201ctame\u201d the welfare state. As well as choosing governments, the tabloids now wanted to decide what they did.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2004, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published a deceptively breezy political book called Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant! Its central argument was that how issues are \u201cframed\u201d \u2013 which points of view the media and other political tastemakers defined as acceptable, and the language used to do so \u2013 largely decides how voters think about them.</p> <p>For the last two decades, through Labour, coalition and Conservative governments, the tabloids have successfully chosen and then framed most of the debates that have dominated British domestic politics, ensuring that law and order, immigration, the role of the state, and Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe have all been discussed in ever more rightwing terms.</p> <p>The Blair government\u2019s determination to be \u201ctough on crime\u201d; the Brown government\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d; the Cameron government\u2019s onslaught on benefits-claiming \u201cshirkers\u201d; the May government\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d \u2013 all have been catchphrases, not always with workable policies attached, intended to \u201cplease the tabloids\u201d, in the euphemistic stock phrase of British political punditry.</p> <p>On occasions, the newspapers have directly intervened in the making of government policy. According to Nick Davies\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/hack-attack-truth-rupert-murdoch-nick-davies-review\">Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch</a>, in 2001 the Sun forced Brown as chancellor to permit more private sector involvement in the NHS. First, the paper condemned his cherished plan to increase NHS spending as too profligate, writes Davies, then a \u201cpanicked\u201d Brown \u2013 desperate not to be portrayed as a traditional tax-and-spend leftwinger \u2013 \u201ccontacted the Sun \u2026 agreed to rearrange his diary so that he could go to their office that day \u2026 [and] sat down with the Sun\u2019s outspoken rightwing political editor, Trevor Kavanagh, for an interview which \u2026 rapidly became a negotiation about policy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78/47_36_1149_1569/732.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, policy ideas that have been popular with the public but not with these papers, and their proprietors \u2013 raising taxes on the wealthy or on property; renationalising loathed and ineffective privatised utilities \u2013 have almost never been enacted.</p> <p>During the Blair era, tabloid circulations, like those of all newspapers, stagnated and then fell. British party politics, fixated on the \u201ccentre ground\u201d, was often as consensual as it had been during the 50s, when the tabloids had felt obliged to tone down their rhetoric. Yet this time they did the opposite, emboldened by the Blair government\u2019s acceptance of their agenda and eagerness to have friendly relations. The tabloids became more influential still.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the media in general adjusted to a new world of internet competitors, squeezed budgets, and recycled content, the papers became a dependable source of polemic for other outlets. \u201cSky and the BBC are still obsessed by reviewing the papers,\u201d says Charlie Beckett, a former TV executive who is professor of media at the London School of Economics. Presenters holding up tomorrow morning\u2019s front pages to the camera, he points out, \u201cis cheap telly\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The need for broadcasters to be balanced, once seen as a threat, has created a market for tabloid shrillness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yelland says: \u201cThe first thing you do when you\u2019ve put together a front page, is get it over to Sky, to the paper review shows.\u201d Tom Baldwin, Ed Miliband\u2019s press strategist as Labour leader, told me: \u201cThey could say \u2018Black Is White: Exclusive\u2019 on the front of the Mail, and the next day, there\u2019d be a story on the BBC: \u2018Controversy over whether black is white \u2026\u2019\u201d The legal requirement for British broadcasters to be balanced, once considered a threat to the tabloids, has created a new market for their shrillness.</p> <p>It is even possible that the papers\u2019 political stances are even more influential now than in the past, precisely because they are less and less read. Their positions are simply assumed \u2013 rather than widely scrutinised for flaws or contradictions \u2013 and politicians and public opinion adjust accordingly. Gramsci, who died in 1937, would be appalled and fascinated.</p> <p>As the editor of the Sun, says Yelland, \u201cI was very much aware that most people were not reading the political stuff. But the Sun set the mood music of Westminster, of the lobby [journalists], of the morning meetings in every department in Downing Street.\u201d Like any good tabloid journalist, he may be overstating a little, but to manipulate the elite while insisting your journalism is for the masses is certainly quite a trick.</p> <p>While Labour leader, Miliband tried to break out of his party\u2019s suffocating tabloid relationship. Baldwin, who supported the move, remembers: \u201cAt first, we felt we had better keep talking to them, have dinners with the editor of the Sun. Ed would have drinks with Dacre. Then phone-hacking happened \u2026\u201d Miliband reacted to the scandal by attacking the tabloids\u2019 political influence, and calling for them to be properly regulated. \u201cThere weren\u2019t ever drinks with Dacre after that,\u201d says Baldwin. \u201cDacre was screaming down the phone at Ed. It felt liberating, exciting, scary. Gordon Brown said to us, \u2018This is a big thing you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve got to keep your foot on their neck, or they\u2019ll come back up and smack you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet as often with Miliband, his anti-tabloid initiative petered out. \u201cEd\u2019s management style is to balance,\u201d says a former adviser, \u201cand there were some good personal relationships in the Labour team with some tabloid reporters.\u201d Baldwin says: \u201cWe lost the [internal] argument. We got back to business as usual.\u201d At the 2015 election, the tabloids tore into Miliband and Labour regardless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the Cameron governments, it felt like Murdoch and Dacre were the adults, and the politicians were children</p> <footer> <cite>David Yelland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Cameron underwent a similar experience with the papers. At first, as Tory leader \u2013 influenced by his adviser Steve Hilton, who believed that in the digital era the views of newspapers were of increasingly minor relevance \u2013 Cameron decided that rather than \u201csucking up to Murdoch\u201d, as one of his aides put it, it was better to \u201ckeep your distance\u201d from the tabloids, and to focus instead on television appearances. Yet when the effectiveness of Cameron\u2019s leadership was widely criticised in 2007 \u2013 not least by Murdoch\u2019s papers \u2013 he quickly changed his approach. He hired the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his director of communications, and maintained a high-profile, highly political friendship with the editor of the Sun and Murdoch favourite, Rebekah Brooks. In 2009, the Sun switched its support from Labour back to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/21/andy-coulson-resigns-david-cameron\">Coulson\u2019s resignation over phone-hacking</a> in 2011, and conviction for the same offence in 2014, Cameron\u2019s governments remained tabloid-friendly throughout, straining to come up with populist policies and language.But while the Mail backed the Conservatives as always, Dacre and his paper remained lukewarm towards the metropolitan Cameron. And when Cameron finally challenged the tabloids\u2019 worldview, the EU referendum, they were brutal towards him, and helped terminate his premiership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386/24_23_761_981/388.jpg\" alt=\"When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sun</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baldwin says, \u201cI\u2019ve been amused to hear Craig Oliver\u201d, Coulson\u2019s successor as Cameron\u2019s communications director, \u201craging to left-of-centre journos about the rightwing press and how awful they are.\u201d Yelland argues that the tabloid barons are simply \u201cbetter at what they do than the politicians. Murdoch and Dacre have been around for so long, fashioning words and campaigns. During the Cameron governments, it felt like they were the adults, and the politicians were children.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Will the reign of the tabloids ever end?<strong> </strong>It was interrupted when the second world war created a kinder Britain, and again, fleetingly, after the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Profound social change, or the exposure of journalists\u2019 excesses, can weaken even apparently impregnable tabloid citadels.</p> <p>Over recent decades, shifting public attitudes have undermined some of the papers\u2019 certainties. \u201cWhen I look back at the words I used to use as a Sun sub,\u201d James Alan Anslow remembered, \u201c\u2018the gay plague\u2019, \u2018black gangs\u2019. You\u2019d get sacked if you used those now!\u201d</p> <p>Charlie Beckett detects a hard-nosed rationale behind this softening: \u201cIn a tightening market, you don\u2019t want to put off readers. When you had a circulation of four million, it mattered less if you said something racist, say, and put off 5% of your readers.\u201d Moreover, the tabloids have sometimes received disproportionate credit for their liberal moments. The Mail\u2019s much-praised campaigning for the truth about the racist murder in 1993 of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence sits uneasily with the endless xenophobic nudges of its immigration coverage.</p> <p>The tabloids still look much the same now as they did three decades ago. Redesigns have been much rarer and more cautious than at other papers. So have alterations to the basic tabloid prose style. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re going to get from the first sentence,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cThey haven\u2019t caught the conversational tone of the internet \u2026 their style is very clunky.\u201d David Deacon of Loughborough University says that in his research on election bias he finds that \u201cPeople are far more aware [now] of the narrative games, of tabloid-speak.\u201d The tabloids have always been self-conscious \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won It\u201d \u2013 but nowadays their political rages would be almost camp, if they did not have such consequences. As Baldwin puts it, the papers often read \u201clike a parody of themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Anslow, who is 65, said he sometimes sensed a nostalgia in the air at the Sun\u2019s offices. \u201cIf we do a special front page, people say, \u2018It\u2019s a real classic. It\u2019s just like the old days.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the paper moved from its old premises in east London, an intimidating compound of hulking, almost windowless blocks behind high-security fences, widely known as \u201cFortress Wapping\u201d, to a much blander, more generic office building in central London. Its glass-walled, approachable-feeling lobby faces directly on to the street. Down one side are blown-up photographs from various Murdoch publications. The Sun\u2019s is just a generic showbiz shot, as if the paper\u2019s political coverage is less of a priority nowadays. On the Sun and Mail websites, political stories are much less prominent than in their print editions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is 14 months into an experiment in ignoring the tabloids. It may well be doomed; but his leadership has already lasted longer than the tabloids expected, and their ceaseless attacks on him, like their shouting down of anyone who doubts Brexit will be a success, have a small undertone of anxiety about them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3/0_0_3153_4055/778.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty-four years ago, the British political scientist Ken Newton pondered the multilayered puzzle of how newspapers and their readers relate politically, and produced perhaps the closest thing to an answer. \u201cThe press and its readers are likely to be mutually dependent,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinfluencing each other in a constantly shifting process of mutual adaptation.\u201d The tabloids may have adapted \u2013 a little \u2013 to their readers\u2019 changing attitudes, but the papers retain an old-fashioned suspicion of new kinds of Briton, and a nastiness towards people who do not fit their rigid worldviews. Above all, the tabloids remain stubbornly attached to the optimistic free-market ideas of the one prime minister that they have never turned against, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 an optimism that many of their readers have not felt since at least the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>This autumn, both the Sun and the Mail have responded to what the Mail\u2019s owner called a \u201cchallenging market\u201d for newspapers by making editorial redundancies. A Sun journalist emailed me: \u201cJust had massive compulsory redundos in editorial. Hardly enough bodies left to get out the paper. Mood is of the post-apocalyptic variety \u2013 survivors staggering around dazed and confused.\u201d</p> <p>Anslow, who started on the Sun 39 years ago, was one of those culled. Well before it happened, he told me he could imagine a Britain without tabloids \u201cwithin my lifetime\u201d. He went on: \u201cIf you take that kind of political communication away, we [Britons] will all go into our own ideological silos, because of the way social media works.\u201d</p> <p>More surprisingly, Tom Baldwin also fears that if the tabloids die, then what comes next could be worse. \u201cTheir political stories contain at least kernels of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout the tabloids, we\u2019ll be in a totally post-truth world.\u201d But in a world without tabloid truths, perhaps other kinds of politics will have a chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\"> here</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

They are promised a male child if they take the remedies \u2013 which come in tablet or powder form \u2013 following a strict ritual.</p> <p>Women are often told to take the drugs in the morning with a glass of cow\u2019s milk while looking at their husband. The drugs are sold for as little as $3 (\u00a32.50) or up to $50, according to locals.</p> <p>Research has found that the drugs often contain phytoestrogens \u2013 compounds from plants that are similar to the hormone oestrogen \u2013 in levels beyond that considered safe.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12246/abstract\">recent study</a> published in the journal Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, SSDs were found to be a factor in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26444206\">20% of all stillbirths in Haryana</a>, where the use of such drugs is pervasive. </p> <p>Research by Dr Sutapa Bandyopadhyay Neogi, a maternal and child health specialist at the Public Health Foundation of India, found that large doses of phytoestrogens are linked to birth defects and developmental disorders in mammals that \u201ccould be potentially detrimental to the growth and development of the foetus\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIn north India there\u2019s a huge preference for a male child but it\u2019s wrong to say that this practice is not happening elsewhere in India,\u201d she said.

According to government officials, the number crossed the 900 mark for the first time last December.</p> <p>Experts attribute Haryana\u2019s strong preference for boys to the ingrained belief that women are a liability rather than an asset and because of the state\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/hindu-women-property-myth-vs-reality/131896.html\">strong tilt towards men inheriting land</a>.</p> <p>It is estimated that up to 60% of women who have a female child first take SSDs for their second birth.</p> <p>\u201cHaryana is infamous for killing its daughters,\u201d said Dr Rakesh Gupta, additional principal secretary to the chief minister of Haryana. \u201cWe need to empower the girl child with the idea that girls are equal to boys.

The state has set the ambitious target of a sex ratio of 950 girls to 1,000 boys.</p> <p>\u201cNothing can be done to change people\u2019s mindset. They are practising century-old rituals.

  "<p>Growing up in multicultural Australia, I first really understood multiculturalism by going to school. Not via textbooks, but through my lived experience of making friends with kids from a dozen different cultural backgrounds, and being exposed to the range of different ethnic groups with whom I shared my suburb. I learned to get along with people very different from myself, or at the very least, I accepted their right to share my school community.</p> <p>For young people, schools are unique in their ability to foster these cross-cultural communication skills, and for orienting kids to the realities of our globalising world. British geographer Ash Amin describes schools as \u201cmicropublics\u201d, places where people from different backgrounds are thrown together on a daily basis to work together. In the process, they learn acceptance and cross-cultural understanding.</p> <p>However, not all schools are equally well-placed to achieve this. As families increasingly turn away from the local public school in favour of private schools that are often restricted to particular religious groups, and of course, restricted to those who can afford the fees, Australian children are less and less likely to encounter the full range of our diverse society within their school communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/oct/27/all-they-see-is-your-race-because-that-is-whats-written-on-your-body-podcast\">'All they see is your race, because that is what's written on your body' | Christina Ho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same can be said for selective schools, the focus of my latest research. As education policy increasingly emphasises competition, school choice and elite programs for the \u201cgifted and talented\u201d, a growing number of schools have become demographically unbalanced, so that they can no longer operate as \u201cmicropublics\u201d or microcosms of the wider community. </p> <p>Selective high schools routinely top the annual league tables of HSC results in NSW, often outperforming prestigious private schools. For instance, James Ruse Agricultural high school, in north-west Sydney, has outperformed all other schools in the HSC every year for the past 20 years. </p> <p>The outstanding achievements of selective schools come at a cost however, to their students and to the community more broadly. Apart from the allegations that these schools are \u201chothouses\u201d breeding stress and anxiety among their pupils, my research examined another dimension of these school communities: their hyper-racialised environments. </p> <p>Almost all selective high schools in Sydney are dominated by students from a language background other than English (LBOTE). According to the MySchool website, at James Ruse, 97% of students were from a LBOTE in 2015. Across Sydney, LBOTE students regularly make up 80 or 90% of enrolments in selective schools. Most of these students are children of migrants from various Asian countries, especially China, Korea, other east and south-east Asian countries, and increasingly, India and south Asia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/east-asian-school-success-culture-curriculum-teaching\">\u2018Culture, not just curriculum\u2019, determines east Asian school success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This reflects Australia\u2019s elitist migration policy, which for the last 20 years, has favoured well-educated or wealthy applicants, who arrive as skilled or business migrants. As migration from Asia has grown, a new middle-class has formed in Australia, one that is more highly educated than native-born Australians. According to the Department of Immigration, among Australia\u2019s China-born and South Korea-born populations, nearly 40% hold a university degree, approximately double the national average. Among the India-born population, more than 50% hold a university degree.</p> <p>It is not entirely surprising that these families pay a great deal of attention to their children\u2019s education. They see education as the key mechanism for ensuring their children\u2019s future, in a society in which migrants lack the social networks and local knowledge that the native-born might use to get ahead.</p> <p>Arriving in Australia during an era of intensified educational competition, Asian migrants often adopt highly instrumental approaches to education, particularly around school choice (and residential choice), private tutoring, close monitoring of children\u2019s time use, and targeted training for selective admissions tests. As a result, their children now dominate the enrolments of most selective high schools. </p> <p>This ethnically unbalanced profile of selective schools has created a hyper-racialised environment within these school communities, in which people are eternally defined by their ethnicity. In Australia\u2019s multicultural society, we would hope that people working together would get to know each other as individuals, rather than perpetually seeing others as members of a particular ethnic group. Cultural difference could then become normal and unremarkable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Christina Ho on the ethnic imbalance in our selective schools\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/290188606&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In selective schools however, cultural difference is hyper-visible and a key means by which people identify themselves and others. As a minority group, Anglo-Australian students feel their whiteness more keenly in selective schools, while many Asian-Australian students feel more \u201cAsian\u201d, or adopt a more \u201cAsian\u201d identity than they might do in a more ethnically balanced environment. Even the homogenising label \u201cAsian\u201d \u2013 widely used by students from all backgrounds \u2013 fails to capture people\u2019s precise ethnic identity, and seems almost designed to emphasise difference from \u201cwhite\u201d. </p> <p>My interviewees, who included current students and recent graduates of selective schools, described how people\u2019s interests, abilities and preferences were seen in terms of ethnicity, and even subjects were racialised. Maths and sciences were \u201cAsian\u201d subjects, while the humanities and extra-curricular activities like debating and sport were \u201cwhite\u201d pursuits. These stereotypes could be damaging. For example, the notion that white students are \u201chopeless at maths\u201d could undermine their confidence in the subject, as one interviewee told me.</p> <p>In the playground, students often organised themselves by ethnicity, with \u201call white\u201d or \u201call Asian\u201d friendship groups sitting in their own demarcated spaces. One student told me that the \u201cwhite girls\u201d in her school even invented their own language, which they spoke loudly to each other whenever other students spoke Chinese. Another student described how the boys\u2019 lunchtime soccer teams were based on ethnicity, with the Indian (\u201ccurries\u201d) and white students teamed up against \u201cthe Asians\u201d, an arrangement known as \u201ccheckerboards versus the Asians\u201d.</p> <p>While hyper-racialised environments do not necessarily foster racism, and most of my interviewees denied that there was racial tension in their schools, they artificially inflate the importance of ethnic identification. This may make it more difficult to broaden one\u2019s outlook by transgressing cultural boundaries, or develop full-bodied cross-cultural understanding.</p> <p>Of course there are some students who do cross those boundaries and befriend people from different backgrounds to themselves. Among my interviewees were two Anglo-Australian students who joined \u201cAsian\u201d friendship groups, became fluent Chinese speakers and developed ambitions to live and work in China. One even dreams about becoming Australia\u2019s ambassador to China.</p> <p>However, systemically, selective schools are all about segregating a select few from the mainstream. These schools are also segregated from their local communities. Their enrolments do not reflect the demographic profile of the local areas in which they are located. In most cases, students of selective schools do not reside locally, but often commute long distances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/china-education-exams-parents-rebel\">Nine-hour tests and lots of pressure: welcome to the Chinese school system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the local public school can be a significant site of \u201ceveryday multiculturalism\u201d for young people and their families, selective schools rarely function as local schools, depriving their local areas of this potential micropublic. </p> <p>Ultimately, as Australia\u2019s education system becomes increasingly segmented by policies encouraging choice and competition, our schools are less and less capable of providing environments for young people to encounter diversity and learn how to deal with the rich mix of cultures found in our globalising society. </p> <p>For me, the extreme imbalance in selective school communities highlights the importance of the local comprehensive public school, where all are welcome, and where students encounter maximum diversity, not only in terms of ethnicity, but also socioeconomic status, religion, ability, aspirations and interests, and all the strange and wonderful subcultures that make up our community. Exposure to all of this is an education in itself. </p>",

During a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">soft launch</a> in September, Trump ensured wall-to-wall media coverage by using the occasion to finally admit he had been wrong to doubt Barack Obama\u2019s right to American citizenship.</p> <p>But weeks of political scandal appear to have taken their toll on the brand.

The best location,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>Even the struggling campaign\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, was watered down, perhaps succumbing to criticism that it implies the country is no longer at its best. \u2018The United States is great.

Even liberal second amendment experts have called some of Clinton\u2019s explanations of her position \u201codd\u201d.</p> <p>As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she opposes Roe v Wade.</p> <p>At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which overturned Washington DC\u2019s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a law that required other guns in homes to be \u201ckept nonfunctional\u201d.</p> <p>In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense.<br></p> <p>Clinton had <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&amp;page=1\">dodged giving a clear answer</a> about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional. But in 2015, the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/leaked-audio-clinton-says-supreme-court-is-wrong-on-second-amendment/\">Washington Free Beacon reported</a>, Clinton told an audience at a private event that \u201cthe supreme court is wrong on the second amendment.

A Gallup poll from 2008 found that <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/105721/public-believes-americans-right-own-guns.aspx\">73% of Americans</a> believed the second amendment \u201cguarantees the rights of Americans to own guns\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/hillary-clinton-gun-rights-second-amendment\">Why gun rights advocates don't trust Clinton on the second amendment</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58111e09e4b0219a00d390b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-26T21:20:30.042Z\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With less than two weeks before the general election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign deployed one of its most potent weapons in the fight against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump: Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim war hero killed in the line of duty.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/28/khizr-humayun-khan-donald-trump-video-democrat-convention\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p98f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2624631\"            data-video-name=\"Father of Muslim American soldier: \u2018Donald Trump, you have sacrificed nothing\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-579aceebe4b075867609e4f3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/29/160728father_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/29/160728father_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/29/160728father.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/29/160728father_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/29/160728father_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jul/28/khizr-humayun-khan-donald-trump-video-democrat-convention\">Father of Muslim American soldier: \u2018Donald Trump, you have sacrificed nothing\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Khan, a Gold Star father whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/khizr-khan-democratic-convention-constitution-trump\">impassioned speech</a> on the final night of the Democratic National Convention helped knock Trump down to his current position in the presidential race, spoke on Clinton\u2019s behalf to congregants and guests of a mosque in Norfolk, Virginia, home to the world\u2019s largest naval base and more than 60,000 active duty military personnel.</p> <p>\u201cThe courage [to speak against Trump] wasn\u2019t ours,\u201d Khan said at Masjid William Salaam, the first of three stops in Norfolk Khan made on Wednesday. \u201cThe courage was given to us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople ask would I do it again,\u201d Khan continued. \u201cA million times - again and again and again - up until hatred and political bigotry is wiped out of this United States, we will continue to speak.\u201d</p> <p>Khan\u2019s son, Marine captain Humayun Khan, was killed in 2004 by a car bomb after instructing the soldiers under his command to fall back from the vehicle.

Pence\u2019s stop in Utah is sure to have people talking, as the state usually is at the top of the rankings of states voting Republican. Mormon aversion to Trump and the independent candidacy of Evan McMullin have changed the calculus this time around. </p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> has two rallies in Florida today, one in Palm Beach County in the south-east and one in Hillsborough County on the Gulf coast. <strong>Tim Kaine</strong> has two events in Pennsylvania, while <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> is diligently trying to put his wife over the top in North Carolina, with three stops there today after three stops there yesterday. <strong>Chelsea Clinton</strong> has three stops in Ohio, while senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has an event in Pittsburgh.</p> <h2>Trump with narrow Florida edge \u2013 Selzer poll</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/florida-poll\">A poll of likely voters</a> in Florida by gold-star pollster J Ann Selzer for Bloomberg politics has Trump slightly ahead of Clinton in the state, 45-43, when third-party candidates are included. That\u2019s within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Trump had 46% to Clinton\u2019s 45% in a head-to-head matchup. Clinton has a three-point lead in polling averages of the state. </p> <h2>Trump wants Biden behind barn</h2> <p>The campaign action overnight was typically nasty and nausea-inducing, with Trump saying that yes, he would like to go in back of the barn with Biden (Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/21/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-campaign-2016\">had said gym</a>), and campaign surrogate Newt Gingrich accusing Fox News host Megyn Kelly of having a \u201cfascination with sex\u201d because she takes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">women who say Donald Trump violated them</a> seriously.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/599d2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2841266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump says he would love to beat up 'Mr Tough Guy' Joe Biden \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581013e6e4b0219a00d38b1c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\">Trump says he would love to beat up \u2018Mr Tough Guy\u2019 Joe Biden</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p></p> <p>The row on Tuesday night between Kelly and one of Trump\u2019s most stalwart supporters began when the host brought up the multiple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">sexual assault and misconduct allegations</a> against the candidate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMlC0-Ut8Ng\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oMlC0-Ut8Ng?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>During the ensuing debate, which bordered on personal attack, Gingrich said the host was \u201cfascinated with sex\u201d and Kelly urged him to \u201ctake your anger issues and spend some time working on them\u201d.</p> <p>Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s director of social media, later responded on Twitter, saying Kelly had \u201cmade a total fool out of herself\u201d and warning: \u201cWatch what happens to her after this election is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/791095922709200897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/megynkelly\">@MegynKelly</a> made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>.

  "<p>Barnaby Joyce has rejected suggestions that he changed the Hansard in a dispute which led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/13/paul-grimes-sacked-over-lack-of-strong-mutual-confidence-with-barnaby-joyce\">the agriculture department secretary, Paul Grimes, being sacked</a>.</p> <p>Grimes was sacked in March last year because of a relationship breakdown with his minister, Joyce. </p> <p>On Monday, after fighting freedom of information requests for more than a year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/24/barnaby-joyce-accused-of-sacking-department-head-for-challenging-his-integrity\">the government released a letter</a> in which Grimes told Joyce he could no longer work with Joyce as agriculture minister \u201cto resolve matters of integrity\u201d.</p> <p>At the time of the dispute,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/20/hansard-saga-broke-confidence-between-joyce-and-sacked-staffer-paul-grimes\"> Grimes said the Hansard dispute was part of the reason for the relationship breakdown.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/24/barnaby-joyce-accused-of-sacking-department-head-for-challenging-his-integrity\">Barnaby Joyce accused of sacking department head for challenging his integrity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But on Thursday Joyce denied the breakdown was related to the dispute in which the Hansard was changed after an answer on drought funding. </p> <p>Joyce told parliament in 2014: \u201cOn 20 October 2014 I understand a request for minor edits was made to Hansard by my staff without my knowledge. My staff have been counselled.\u201d</p> <p>Joyce told ABC radio on Thursday: \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t like is this insinuation that I changed the Hansard. </p> <p>\u201cI never did. I never changed the Hansard, and when I subsequently found out the Hansard had been changed, we had it changed back.\u201d</p> <p>Labor has accused Joyce of having Grimes sacked but Joyce said he did not sack department secretaries. It was done by the secretary of prime minister and cabinet.</p> <p>Under section 59 of the Public Service Act a department secretary can be sacked by the prime minister, on the advice of the relevant minister, after the prime minister receives reports from the secretary of his own department and the public service commissioner.</p> <p>Grimes has not spoken publicly and has not returned Guardian Australia\u2019s calls.</p> <p>Joyce said the relationship breakdown arose after the high pressure environment during the agriculture white paper process. <br></p> <p>\u201cWithin that confines the tempers get frayed, the issues get heated,\u201d he said. \u201cBy reason of that letter you can see the relationship broke down.</p> <p>\u201cI think Dr Grimes is a good \u2018fella\u2019 and I think he going to go out and do good things. It\u2019s stating the bleeding obvious that the relationship had moved on and everybody had to have alternative arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>He also defended his speech to the National Farmers Federation congress on Wednesday in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/barnaby-joyce-derides-labor-as-communists-in-front-of-chinese-ambassador\">he questioned foreign investment and equated Labor\u2019s policies as communist in front of the Chinese ambassador</a>.<br></p> <p>Asked if it was appropriate, Joyce said: \u201cI think China more than anybody is moving towards a market economy.<br></p> <p>\u201cEver since Deng Xiaoping decided that that was the direction they would go they have been exceptionally good at it.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/barnaby-joyce-derides-labor-as-communists-in-front-of-chinese-ambassador\">Barnaby Joyce derides Labor as communists in front of Chinese ambassador</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joyce said although it would always remain the case that foreign investment was necessary to fuel growth, \u201cpreference number one is the Australian people as the owner of the Australian assets\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPrivate ownership fundamentally underpins new attachment to an asset ...,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you love things more if you own them than if the only position you have in life is renting it ...</p> <p>\u201cWe have the treasurer out the other day saying basically it\u2019s about home ownership. He didn\u2019t say there\u2019s a problem with home renting.\u201d</p> <p>The opposition spokesman on agriculture, Joel Fitzgibbon, addressed the congress on Thursday, and praised it for its positive messages on foreign investment, contrasting its stance with the National party leader\u2019s speech the previous day.</p> <p>\u201cPlaying to populist community concern is a zero sum game,\u201d Fitzgibbon said.</p> <p>\u201cEverything we do and say as industry and political leaders must be designed to help people understand why foreign investment is so important and to build community confidence in it.</p> <p>\u201cI congratulate the leadership of the NFF on this front. Your positive messaging on foreign investment has been clear and consistent.\u201d</p> <p>Fitzgibbon called for bipartisanship on foreign investment, given Australia\u2019s small population and limited savings pool.</p> <p>\u201cWith a population of only 23 million, we have a limited savings pool, and by necessity much of the investment will come from foreign sources,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cNo area of public policy is more deserving of bipartisanship than this one. Our language and rules must be clear, concise and consistent.\u201d</p>"
