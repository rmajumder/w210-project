  "<p>Gary Johnson \u2013 the Republican-leaning, marijuana-smoking, Everest-climbing presidential nominee of the Libertarian party \u2013 has a problem: he will be barred from crucial election TV debates this autumn unless he can boost his polling numbers to 15%, from around 10% now.</p> <p>Without the blockbuster ratings that the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, many say it\u2019s hard to see how Johnson, 63, or either of the two other third-party candidates \u2013 Jill Stein of the Green party and Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and policy director for the House Republican Conference \u2013 can ever be anything more than electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But other commentators suggest that the emergence of three independent candidates could still provide an unpredictable twist. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look.</p> <p>In Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian-American and Pacific islander voters to press their case. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico who presents a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs, reasoned at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, one indication of the craziness was that \u201cI might be the next president of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>A just-released <em>Wall Street Journal</em>-NBC poll gives Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. Johnson said he had been asked repeatedly if a vote for him, or any third-party candidate, was a wasted vote. \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said in Vegas. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who also spoke at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she described as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominee in US history. \u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who was also the Green party candidate in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d focused on renewable energy jobs and on completing America\u2019s transition to renewable energy by 2030. She also proposes to cut the military budget by a third and the creation of regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.</p> <p>On the Republican side, McMullin, a beneficiary of the #Never Trump movement, missed getting on the ballot in 26 states before he had even sent out his first campaign release.</p> <p>Despite this, he gives disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee, who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best chance would be if Trump were to drop out of the race for some as-yet-unanticipated reason. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said. \u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles has a third party candidate had any influence: that was in 1992, when Texan businessman Ross Perot took almost 18.9% of the vote and helped to hand the election to Arkansas governor Bill Clinton over what could have been a straightforward re-election for George HW Bush.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he had seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Johnson\u2019s campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has said that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third party candidate could be limited. But given the unpredictability of the race so far, and the probability that Johnson and Stein will pull more voters from Clinton than Trump, all that could change. \u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d says veteran Democratic adviser Hank Sheinkopf. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf believes the election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63dbf15c211ee27d4c60466f991c563d9f98c8e1/0_62_3010_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Perot in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last third-party candidate to significantly affect a US presidential election was businessman Ross Perot in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, federal judge Rosemary Collyer rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion in debates is set artificially high. Yet there are signs that the ground could be shifting. Former Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, hinted that a third podium might be needed. \u201cSome of our production people may have said: \u2018<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like\u2019</a>,\u2019\u2019 McCurry told Politico. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a non-partisan polling firm, said: \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included, and in an election like this where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <p>But even Johnson and Stein remain somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a political realignment among voters dissatisfied with a two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019, as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarised that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>In Vegas, Stein advanced a similar position: \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganisation in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart, and the Democrats have kind of split, with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d She noted that it was by voting for the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d that the country had inherited many of its problems.</p> <p>When recent polls are expanded to include all four candidates, rather than just the main two, most show a smaller lead for Clinton over Trump and in the others the margins remain similar.</p> <p>Johnson accepted that his polling was thus far insufficient to qualify for the debates and his chances of making an impact were remote unless he could take part in the debates.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that, right now, arguably the two most polarising figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Every visitor to Glasgow must take a <a href=\"https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=19136\" title=\"\">tour round the city chambers</a>. Almost 130 years after its completion it remains one of the finest examples of Victorian civic architecture in the UK and you\u2019re advised to allot a couple of hours to your visit if you want to appreciate its splendour. It was opened by the old queen herself in 1888 and has lost none of its beauty since. It sits in George Square in the heart of the city and not long after you embark on your tour you will think that you have been here before.</p> <p>The city chambers has been cast as a handsome and silent star in dozens of Hollywood movies and UK drama productions where it conveys a time, place and an atmosphere in an instant. Last month, its presence in the BBC adaptation of Joseph Conrad\u2019s <em>The Secret Agent </em>enhanced the visual appeal of the series. The sweep of its artistic range possesses both the temporal and the spiritual. It performed a similar job in <em>An Englishman Abroad </em>where it represented the Kremlin and in <em>Heavenly Pursuits </em>where it became the Vatican.</p> <p>The city chambers also has more Carrara marble than the Vatican. This fact was relayed last week by Baillie Liz Cameron, one of Glasgow\u2019s best-known councillors, to a group of Fulbright scholars as she led them through the halls of her workplace. Ms Cameron, a bit of a city gem herself, also informed the Americans that she had written to the pope to tell him that Glasgow trumped his palace for Michelangelo\u2019s favourite marble and that she had extended him an invitation to see it for himself the next time he\u2019s in the city.</p> <p>The city chambers is also bound to feature in an eagerly awaited book about Glasgow by the journalist and author Alan Taylor that is soon to be published by Birlinn. The title of Taylor\u2019s book is <a href=\"http://www.birlinn.co.uk/Glasgow-the-autobiography.html\" title=\"\"><em>Glasgow: The Autobiography</em></a> and will feature the thoughts of hundreds of people who have lived in Glasgow or encountered it. It will include the observances of James Boswell and Samuel Johnson as well as those of a somewhat more edgy cast of lesser-known characters.</p> <p>Taylor, who relayed to me the story of the outstanding papal invitation, is one of those rare beasts: an Edinburgh man born and bred who doesn\u2019t get a nose bleed whenever he bides long in Glasgow. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written this book about Edinburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch as though I love Edinburgh, it simply doesn\u2019t have anything like the drama and human dynamism of Glasgow. This is a city that lives and talks at 100 miles per hour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ad5c64ba18e92342dffb5ed4f7ceb34aa0375c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad5c64ba18e92342dffb5ed4f7ceb34aa0375c1/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street performer pays the price for requesting help from the audience at the Edinburgh fringe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street performer pays the price for requesting help from the audience at the Edinburgh fringe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taylor will be appearing at the <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on\" title=\"\">Edinburgh International Book festival</a> next weekend to talk about his work with Richard Holloway in a session that is already sold out. There will be much to discuss, not least the ageless rivalry between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the fact that while Edinburgh has been the subject of dozens of studies, there are no serious academic histories of Glasgow. Also sure to feature in the discussion is the revelation last week that the population of Edinburgh may be about to outstrip that of Glasgow by 2037 at the present rate of growth. According to the National Records of Scotland, <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-population-to-grow-by-28-per-cent-1-3410407\" title=\"\">Edinburgh\u2019s population</a> will rise by more than 28% over 25 years, more than three times the rate for Scotland as a whole, to 618,978 in 2037. Meanwhile, Glasgow\u2019s will fall, thus suggesting that it is in danger of losing its status as Scotland\u2019s largest city.</p> <p>The figures don\u2019t actually take into account the fact that Glasgow\u2019s real population is more than 1.2m. This, though, was artificially reduced by massive relocation in the 1960s and 1970s to ease overcrowding within the city and successive boundary changes in the 1990s that were unkind to Glasgow. Thus, boutique local authorities such as East Renfrewshire were created that denuded Glasgow of revenue and territory. More than 2 million Scots of working age live within a one-hour commute of Glasgow and the city generates \u00a318bn in gross value added to the Scottish economy each year. Glasgow could function perfectly adequately by itself, but Scotland couldn\u2019t function without Glasgow. It is and will remain for a long time to come the nation\u2019s biggest and most important city.</p> <p>Yet it is grossly undervalued and underappreciated by the rest of the country. Every year since the SNP came to power in Scotland in 2007, Glasgow\u2019s block grant from Holyrood has been cut. And though Glasgow was one of only four out of 32 local authority areas to vote for Scottish independence in 2014, it remains curiously and grossly underrepresented in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Holyrood cabinet. The tiny, self-serving and utterly unrepresentative political and media elite that has mushroomed in the environs of Holyrood continues to revile and criminalise Glasgow with its discriminatory <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36935900\" title=\"\">Offensive Behaviour at Football Act</a> and the eye-watering numbers of <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/police-continuing-to-use-inappropriate-stop-and-search-methods-1-4167325\" title=\"\">stop and searches</a> carried out on its young citizens by an out-of-control police authority.</p> <p>The huge gap between affluent and poor that exists within a seven-mile stretch of Glasgow has become something that these people mock. This is before they fob the city off with vapid promises of reducing inequality and increasing attainment. My city has suffered grievously from population manipulation and the failed social experiments of scientists, academics and politicians. Yet Scotland, while skimming off Glasgow\u2019s output and its capacity for hard, hard work has done little to alleviate the pain of its poor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/28/stop-targeting-football-fans-draconian-laws\">Stop targeting football fans with \u2018draconian laws\u2019, says campaign group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Edinburgh meanwhile, where this discussion of an important book about Glasgow will occur, the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/\" title=\"\">international festival</a> is taking place.

As its town planners continue to drive a wrecking ball through its glorious and ancient cityscape they have also permitted it to become a city of froth and artifice: a 24-hour party city.</p>",

Once it became clear that many venues would have empty seats, the IOC could have put contingency plans in place.

Instead, many of those soldiering on here look exhausted.</p> <p>It could have pushed those sports unfamiliar to Brazilians, put its marketing muscle behind innovative ways to engage the populace, subsidised ticket prices, better supported a haphazard attempt to give away hundreds of thousands of tickets to schoolchildren, and it could have used its expertise to fix transport and signage issues and made it easier and more attractive for fans to travel.</p> <p>In short, if the \u201cOlympic family\u201d wants to bask in the warm glow of taking its \u201cmovement\u201d to new parts of the world, it had better be prepared to invest to get the local population on board and put some of its own vast resources into making it work.</p>",
  "<p>Whether he wins or loses the US presidency next November, Donald Trump has already come up with one of the defining slogans of 2016 \u2013 \u201cMake America great again\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s vision of an America in precipitous decline is all-encompassing.

This erosion of the west\u2019s privileged position in world affairs is creating new economic, geopolitical and even psychological pressures in both the US and the EU.</p> <p>The driving force of this change is the extraordinary economic development of Asia over the past 50 years. In 2014, the IMF reported that, measured in purchasing power, China is now the world\u2019s largest economy. The US had held this title since 1871, when it displaced the UK; now China is number one. The rise of China is just part of a broader shift of economic power towards Asia. The IMF reports that three of the world\u2019s four largest economies are now in Asia. China is first, the US is second, India third and Japan fourth.</p> <p>It is true that if you measure economies at current exchange rates the US is still the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and European nations also rise up the pecking order. But growing Chinese and Asian economic weight is demonstrable in many other ways. China is now the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and the largest exporter. It is also the world\u2019s largest market for vehicles, smartphones and oil \u2013 and the biggest single market for many western companies such as Daimler and KFC. But it is not just Mercedes and fried chicken that are being consumed in Asia. In 2012, for the first time in over a century, Asian countries spent more money on armaments and troops than European nations. The world\u2019s two largest arms importers are now India and Saudi Arabia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/arab-states-almost-double-small-arms-imports-report\">Middle East states almost double small-arms imports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conventional economic theory holds that the growing wealth of Asia should be a boon to the economies of the west, since it offers new markets and sources of investment.

In response, the US navy has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/26/us-navy-destroyer-chinese-islands-south-china-sea\" title=\"\">sent patrols</a> through waters claimed by China.</p> <p>Both a Trump and a Clinton presidency would probably lead to increased tensions with China, but by very different routes. Hillary Clinton is regarded in Beijing as a dangerous hawk who would be likely to be more determined in pushing back against China\u2019s maritime claims. President Xi is a tough-minded nationalist, so a Clinton presidency would increase the chances of a clash in the Pacific between the US and China.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, seems relatively uninterested in America\u2019s strategic role in the Pacific, but his vociferous protectionism has led him to propose swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods. Any such policy would be regarded as an act of economic warfare by Beijing.</p> <p>Either way, the era when globalisation seemed like a process that could create only common interests between China and the west is over. It is now giving way to an epoch that looks altogether darker and more dangerous.</p>",

Nested within this is the childhood memory of being told to go and play in the fresh air, essentially because your parents or teachers wanted five minutes free of your company. But you are an adult now and you don\u2019t have to care about this. You can sit inside with the telly on and the blinds shut watching the Olympics, cricket, Premier League football or the latest grand prix. Why not make a viewing chart?

It\u2019s not even accurate. Most of the time they\u2019re not bothering to work at all.

There is always something coming out of the sky, and always will be until there isn\u2019t, and then we really will have something to complain about. There is also much fun to be had with, say, air conditioning \u2013 lack of, as compared with fortunate America, and ecological evils of; the garden \u2013 who can keep up with the watering and everything\u2019s over by August anyway; clothes shops \u2013 the ludicrousness of their being filled with autumn wear; pub gardens \u2013 the impossibility of getting a seat; neighbours \u2013 the inconsiderate nature of open windows; and sleep \u2013 who even bothers to try. That lot should keep you going until January.</p> <h2>9<strong> Speaking of which \u2026</strong><br></h2> <p>Take a rest from politics, or at least politics as currently conducted on social media. Bawling at people about Brexit, cavilling about Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 it\u2019s a pastime surely best saved for when the evenings close in. Take a leaf out of Owen Smith\u2019s book: last weekend saw him on Twitter posting a selfie taken after a swim at the London Fields Lido in Hackney, somewhat daringly given the prevailing political wind in north London. But while the heat is on the street, better that the hot air on Twitter should cool down, and everyone calm down, with some soothing pictures of animals having a paddle; it\u2019s not called the silly season for nothing. Meanwhile, those referendum leaflets you haven\u2019t got round to recycling are perfect for fanning a fevered brow.</p> <h2>10<strong> Eat, drink and be merry, because tomorrow it rains</strong><br></h2> <p>If you have absorbed all of the above and find it wanting in joie de vivre, feel free to toss it out of the window. In reality, we know that, following a short season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, and a few pre-solstice jabs at jollity, courtesy of Bonfire Night and Hallowe\u2019en, we will soon be plunged into greyness, rain, thermal vests and darkness by four. To some, this is very heaven, but it has the rest of us reaching for the SAD lamps and Googling sun-drenched beaches. So, grab this opportunity to play Frisbee in the park, sip long, icy drinks and generally do all manner of things that only usually appear in romcom montages.</p>",
  "<h2>Weather<br></h2> <p>On Wednesday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/chris-mears-team-gb-diving-rio-2016\" title=\"\">Chris Mears and Jack Laugher</a> won Britain\u2019s first diving gold. They looked surprised, as anyone ought to when they have just beaten the Chinese at a form of gymnastics. But the conditions played into their hands. If British summer holidays prepare you for nothing else, it is jumping into a manky swimming pool in the pouring rain. Rio\u2019s grey skies, perpetual drizzle and squally wind are the closest Team GB is likely to get to home weather. They should make hay while the sun isn\u2019t shining.</p> <p>In fact the people having the worst time with the conditions seem to be the BBC presenters, who have been muttering resentfully all week. If only they employed weather forecasters \u2013 cursory Googlers could also have done the job \u2013 they might have discovered that Rio de Janeiro is prone to the odd August drenching. During the rowing on Thursday, John Inverdale apologised for the sound conditions and explained that some of their equipment wasn\u2019t working. In Inverdale\u2019s case it might be more apt to apologise when the equipment is working.</p> <h2>Sexy time<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09e055a4e91c74af490aec64746c3a4d2ff1793a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09e055a4e91c74af490aec64746c3a4d2ff1793a/0_245_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian rugby player Isadora Cerullo, right, kisses her girlfriend, who proposed to her on the pitch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian rugby player Isadora Cerullo, right, kisses her girlfriend, who proposed to her on the pitch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is now taken as read that Olympic villages are a stockpot of sexual tension, overflowing with free condoms and randy Scandinavian handball players. What\u2019s different this time is the attention being drawn by the gay athletes. The Brazilian rugby player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/brazilian-womens-rugby-player-becomes-first-althete-to-get-marriage-proposal-at-olympics\" title=\"\">Isadora Cerullo received a proposal</a> from her girlfriend on the pitch. Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh, the British hockey players, are the first married gay couple to compete at the games. Not forgetting Tom Daley, abdominals glinting under the floodlights. Sensing the opportunity to show moral leadership, the <em>Daily Mail</em> reported that, while Laugher and Mears had hugged in celebration, their Chinese counterparts had settled for a \u201cmanly\u201d pat on the back. Between the semi-nude grunting and shoving and hugging, it\u2019s not as if the Olympics have hidden their homoeroticism under a bushel. But some argued that Nico Hines, a reporter for the <em>Daily Beast</em>, went too far when he logged into various dating apps \u2013 both gay and hetero \u2013 to scour the athletes\u2019 village for possible suitors. He did not follow through, and said he explained who he was as soon as the question came up, but managed to out an athlete from Kazakhstan, a nation not renowned for its gay rights. Gay athletes, competing in record numbers, were not impressed. If there is any broader point to the Games jamboree, surely it\u2019s as the ultimate expression of western soft power. These are our values: PE, McDonald\u2019s and being able to sleep with whoever you want within five minutes, using your phone.</p> <h2>All in the detail<br></h2> <p>Before the Games, most of the gnashing of teeth was about whether the big stadiums would be ready in time. Nothing has collapsed, even if the mayor, Eduardo Paes, described the velodrome as \u201cum trabalho desgra\u00e7ado\u201d (a wretched job). As the most beautiful setting for a city in the world, Rio was always going to look spectacular in wide-shot. But close-up there are little details that lend the spectacle a cheap feel. The green diving pool, with the tiles that look like they might at any moment crack off. The huge container ships behind the sailing route, as if the racers were oil crews grabbing time off from cleaning an engine. The little multicoloured trophies being handed out with the medals, like Google paperweights. The endless naff music. The little clown-car honk that goes off each time a rowing boat crosses the finish line. More than anything else these details were what London got right, from the signage all over the Tube to the foam-fingered volunteers to the wildflower landscaping around the paths.</p> <h2>Hyperbole, Hyperbore <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a3f257ec1eafcff248e930f97a56b5d29ca512a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3f257ec1eafcff248e930f97a56b5d29ca512a/0_0_2700_3648/740.jpg\" alt=\"Japan\u2019s Kohei Uchimura competes in the parallel bars.\" width=\"740\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan\u2019s Kohei Uchimura competes in the parallel bars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey make this look so easy,\u201d said Matt Baker as the men\u2019s gymnastics team went through their miraculous routines on Monday. Perhaps for Baker, who was a champion junior gymnast himself. But to some of us, sprawled on the sofa with mouths full of olives and ros\u00e9, it was still possible to think of simpler-looking activities than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/08/rio-olympics-2016-mens-gymnastics-team-final-live\" title=\"\">Kohei Uchimura\u2019s horizontal bar routine</a>.</p> <p>One can hardly blame Baker for his enthusiasm. The Olympics are Christmas for commentators on minority sports, summoned from their niche satellite channels for a glorious fortnight of national primetime. You can hear them straining at the microphone, begging us to love fencing or canoeing. It\u2019s all rather needy, and in some cases \u2013 looking at you, dressage \u2013 comes with a whiff of over-protestation. More grating is the jingoistic shrieking whenever a Brit comes within 100 yards of a medal. I blame that Icelandic pundit during the World Cup, who showed that losing your mind in the commentary box is a sure way to go viral. To be fair to him, Iceland\u2019s performance in that tournament was cause for a high pitch of celebration. For Team GB it would have been appropriate 20 years ago, when only the boat with Steve Redgrave in it went anywhere near gold. Now that we are draped in medals of all colours, perhaps the commentary could be a bit more circumspect. Perhaps in future each pundit could be allocated one patriotic shriek per Games.</p> <h2>Heavenly bodies?<br></h2> <p>I thought gymnasts were meant to be elegant and lithe. Divers too, for that matter. Instead they all look like video-game characters who\u2019ve been eating nothing but steak and fighting each other in the woods all winter. This is especially true of the American team, who combine their absurd physiques with crew cuts and lots of manly shouting. One of their number, Sam Mikulak, suggested that they would get more respect if they competed with their tops off and everyone could see how \u201cyoked\u201d they were. In a pre-dive interview, Tom Daley said it had been a conscious strategy to bulk up, to help him get through his routines with more power. Perhaps it is also a consequence of more money and professionalism in the sport. But it is hard not to think that social media have a part to play in all this. Male torsos have not been this objectified since ancient Greece: athletes\u2019 Twitter and Instagram accounts are lovingly curated exhibitions of pecs and abs.</p> <h2>Sports<br></h2> <p>One sport that didn\u2019t need any shrieking was the rugby sevens, whose debut was an unalloyed triumph. It is the perfect sport for the dilettante television watcher: fast, exciting and short. Not adjectives anyone is levelling at golf. The Olympics ought to be a platform for ascendant sports. Golf is a tired old game \u2013 white, male, stale and bad for the environment \u2013 dying on its feet. Contrast the sight of Fiji, blitzing Great Britain to win their nation\u2019s first medal, with Justin Rose \u2013 one of the few multi-millionaire top golfers to bother with the flight to Brazil \u2013 arms aloft after his hole in one, ignoring the caddy coming in for a high-five. Red-buttoning between the two sports, it was not hard to see why middle-aged men are trading their putters for pelotons. In this context, Rio looks less like a showcase and more like the last-chance saloon. Perhaps someone will invent golf sevens in time for Tokyo.</p> <h2>Tickets<br></h2> <p>For those of us who remember the agony of buying tickets for London 2012, it has been particularly galling to see the thousands on thousands of empty seats on display. Predictably it is only their football team \u2013 straining for the Olympic victory that has eluded them until now \u2013 that truly grips the nation\u2019s imagination. As ever, the entire country shuts down for two hours when the sele\u00e7\u00e3o is in action. One wonders how many Brazilians see the Olympics as a football tournament surrounded by a lot of unnecessary peripheral events.</p> <p>For Jessica Ennis-Hill\u2019s high jump on Friday and Almaz Ayana\u2019s obliteration of the 10,000m world record, there were almost as many on the field as in the arena. Rio\u2019s chief spokesman, Mario Andrada, took several days before conceding that the empty seats were \u201ca problem\u201d. It need not be an intractable problem. When empty seats were spotted in London, the army was drafted to plug the holes. If there is one thing Rio has no shortage of, it is soldiers and policemen who could use an afternoon off, particularly after the death of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3734009/Now-Olympic-soldier-shot-dead-comrades-wounded-bloodbath-Rio-slum-running-drugs-gang-mistake.html\" title=\"\">H\u00e9lio Vieira</a>, the soldier shot dead after his GPS led him into a favela.</p> <p>Still, perhaps we are not giving enough credit to the authorities. You could argue that Rio is cunningly stealing a march on its critics by turning its stadiums into deserted white elephants during the Games, rather than waiting until afterwards, like other host cities.</p> <h2>And yet\u2026<br></h2> <p>Despite the weather, the empty stadiums, the falling-apart accommodation, the unbearable traffic, the reports of violence and of homeless people being evicted, the proven doping, the suspected doping, the monstrosity of the <em>IOC</em>, John Inverdale and every other issue collated under the #rioproblems hashtag, the show goes on. More than any recent Games, Rio reveals the Olympics for what they are: a titanic game of chicken with the human spirit. We are horribly biased: one <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/sport-olympics/rio-olympics-2016-chubby-ethiopia-swimmer-robel-kiros-habte-becomes-internet-hit-after-struggling-in-a3316216.html\" title=\"\">plucky Ethiopian swimmer</a>, one leaping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/katarina-johnson-thompson\" title=\"\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson</a>, or Mo Farah crossing the line with arms outstretched, is worth almost any amount of proximate shambles and disaster. Joy lingers longer in the blood than suspicion. When it is all weighed out, the question every nation has to answer is: do we feel good? One suspects the Brazilians might have a different answer from the British. Depending on how their football team does.</p>",

A quicker way to facilitate downsizing for the over-65s would be to abolish stamp duty in their case.

Taxes on fuel or consumer pressure on large companies would give businesses a strong incentive to improve energy efficiency and reduce the most polluting activities in their supply chain.

  "<p>It is a sprawling fantasy featuring deformed humans, superheroes who can read minds and fly, and plot lines exploring issues such as bigotry and raw political ambition. Like the blockbuster TV hit <em>Game of Thrones</em>, it is also based in part on the work of the cult fantasy writer George RR Martin.</p> <p>Now Hollywood is betting that a major TV adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/08/wild-cards-george-rr-martin-tv-adaptation\">Wild Cards</a></em>, a series of science fiction books grounded in gritty realism that Martin began writing 30 years ago, can emulate the extraordinary worldwide success of the HBO show. If it does, it will fulfil the dreams of Martin\u2019s collaborator on <em>Wild Cards</em>, Melinda Snodgrass, who has struggled in vain for 12 years to interest film and television producers.</p> <p>The US writer and editor was praised by executives, only to be given excuses about why the books were not for them. She refused to be bowed by rejection and her determination has finally paid off. She is now heading an ambitious TV adaption of the series backed by Universal Pictures. </p> <p>The phenomenal global success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> got the industry\u2019s attention, and Snodgrass has no doubt that it paved the way for the new show. She told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cIt\u2019s been crucial. The success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> and George have really helped. People now see the possibilities in this other major work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7754e534688b2594e15f6562054d7e6e830dcfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7754e534688b2594e15f6562054d7e6e830dcfa8/0_0_1138_1422/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Melinda Snodgrass\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melinda Snodgrass has collaborated on Wild Cards with George RR Martin for 30 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Wild Cards</em> imagines a world that was intentionally infected by an alien virus in 1946. Ninety per cent of those infected die. Of the remaining 10%, most are deformed (called Jokers) and 1% (called Aces) get superpowers, from flight to mind-reading, which they use for both good and evil.</p> <p>The characters include the Sleeper, whose DNA-changing virus has enabled him to go without sleep for months on end. When he does sleep, he can wake up with a completely new face and new powers. Snodgrass said: \u201cIt is a superhero franchise, but it\u2019s different in that it\u2019s far more realistic than some superhero films, and grittier. If you die in the <em>Wild Cards</em> books, you don\u2019t get to come back. We want death to have consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The books also offer analogies for our times. Through the Jokers, for example, they explore persecution and bigotry. \u201cEntertainment works best when it reflects what\u2019s happening in the real world and when it allows people to reflect on it, perhaps in a safer space where it doesn\u2019t feel so charged,\u201d said Snodgrass.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>George and I created Wild Cards, and then invited a bunch of writers to come play in the sandbox</p> <footer> <cite>Melinda Snodgrass</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She added that some of the stories mirror real life: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about superheroes fighting super villains.

Interestingly enough, one of our books predicted the rise of a caliphate before Isis actually arose.\u201d</p> <p>While Martin and Snodgrass have each written some of the books, they have built up a consortium of about 30 authors, all creating stories set in the same world.</p> <p>The first book was published in 1986, 10 years before Martin\u2019s first <em>Game of Thrones </em>book in 1996. Such is the series\u2019 popularity that the 23rd volume will be released later this month, and Martin and Snodgrass are already working on the next three. Beyond publication worldwide, the books have inspired spin-off comics and games.</p> <p>An announcement that <em>Wild Cards </em>is to be developed with Universal Cable Productions was made last week by Martin, who said that \u201cthere are thousands of stories to be told\u201d.</p> <p>As he has an exclusive development deal with HBO, he has handed <em>Wild Cards</em> to Snodgrass and producer Gregory Noveck: \u201cThey know and love the <em>Wild Cards</em> universe almost as well as I do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They hope to begin shooting next year. \u201cIt is very exciting. George and I created <em>Wild Cards</em>, and then invited a bunch of writers to come play in the sandbox. Then it\u2019s just grown and grown,\u201d said Snodgrass. Her passion for fantasy and science fiction began as a child, lapping up books by JRR Tolkien and watching <em>Star Trek</em>. \u201cI wanted to go to the stars.\u201d</p> <p>That passion never left her. She gave up a legal career to become a writer and was a story editor and executive script consultant on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. Like Martin, she lives in New Mexico, where she trains horses and rides them in competition. Her latest science fiction novel, <em>The High Ground</em>, has just been published by Titan Books.</p> <p>She says she had always seen the screen potential of <em>Wild Cards</em>. The emphasis was always the emotional content, dialogue and \u201ccharacters with whom people can identify and care about, even if you may hate them\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The sun shines on clear river water running through a valley in the Cairngorms, bringing the stones on the river bed into colourful focus. Here and there are dark shadows, half-buried clusters of dull black shells, lined and gouged by decades of shifting water and gravel: the pearl mussels of the river Dee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/19/fundraising-drive-aims-save-seabird-paradise-off-scotland\">Fundraising drive aims to save seabird paradise off Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pearl mussel is one of the most ancient invertebrates on the planet, a freshwater shellfish that has helped to shape the history of Britain. One pearl mussel in every 1,000 or 5,000 \u2013 no one can be sure \u2013 lives up to its name and contains a lustred treasure. Julius Caesar\u2019s biographer, Suetonius, cites a desire for pearls as one of the reasons why the Romans invaded Britain in 55BC.</p> <p>But pearl hunting, pollution and habitat destruction have almost led to the mussel\u2019s extinction. It has been illegal to pearl fish and to sell or buy a Scottish pearl since 1998, but their numbers remain perilously low. This week or the next, some of the remaining female mussels along all 86 miles of the Dee will spawn \u2013 all at once. On just one day a year, they release millions of tiny larvae, or glochidia, into the water.</p> <p>The baby mussels face the most extraordinary odds \u2013 they have to latch on to the gills of a passing fish to survive. Roughly one in four million make it, fewer if the salmon and trout are in short supply. Which is why a remarkable project is under way to attempt to transform the Dee, restoring its natural course to improve the prospects of the pearl mussel.</p> <p>On the Slugain, a tributary of the Dee near Braemar, a giant digger has arrived, part of the \u00a33.5m <a href=\"https://www.pearlsinperil.org.uk/\">Pearls in Peril</a> habitat restoration project being undertaken by Scottish National Heritage (SNH). The plan is to break down artificial banks and barriers that over decades have been built to force rivers off farmland or away from housing. These constructions funnel the water into channels that flow faster and fill up more quickly \u2013 a flood risk for towns and roads downstream \u2013 and no longer have the meandering shallows, cascades and pools that suit the mussels and the fish they rely upon.</p> <p>\u201cAnything you can do for a mussel has an immediate knock-on effect, on the salmon, on the trout and on the river,\u201d said Jackie Webley, the SNH project manager. \u201cReinstating the natural progress supports the resilience of the river and everything in it. You really have to let the river do what it wants to do. It becomes slower and shallower, helping the fish to have safer nursery spaces. It helps the mussels, it helps the land. It helps people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"217a110012d258342e0dc3d722b0e6f2c5480085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/217a110012d258342e0dc3d722b0e6f2c5480085/0_47_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl mussels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pearl mussels are the barometer of the Dee\u2019s health, says Jackie Webley of Scottish Natural Heritage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe pearl mussel is the barometer of river water health; if they\u2019re deteriorating, then so is the river. If we can get them to flourish once more, that will have an enormous impact. Each mussel is filtering 50 litres of water each day, and here in the Dee that\u2019s good news for 200,000 people in Aberdeen drinking it.\u201d</p> <p>On the Slugain, 200 metres of boulders will be pulled out; in the Dee last year it was 30 old cars. \u201cThe river was blocked with corrugated metal and railway sleepers, but then behind it we were pulling out old cars. One was a Bedford van with cigarette butts still in the ashtray,\u201d said Webley.</p> <p>Digging out these banks will allow the river to regain its natural course, while hundreds of native trees are being planted, dotted along the banks, to provide shade for river creatures. \u201cClimate change means we are seeing substantial rises in river water temperature, so the trees will not only stop soil erosion but cool the water down as it passes underneath their shade,\u201d said Webley.</p> <p>The effects of catastrophic flooding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/storm-frank\">during last December\u2019s Storm Frank</a> can be seen all over the Cairngorms \u2013 shops remain closed due to water damage and bridges no longer cross water where the river shifted its course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/scottish-pearlmussels/giv-31075s7DgWkEeSjXa\" data-alt=\"Pearl graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/scottish-pearlmussels/giv-31075s7DgWkEeSjXa\">Pearl graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Last year\u2019s salmon numbers were poor in the Dee, worrying the fishing and tourism industry, which rely on the river for a living, just as the pearl fishers once did.</p> <p>Bill Abernathy, 91, made his living pearl fishing the rivers of north-west Scotland. He can tell a mussel that holds a pearl just by looking at it, and could extract it without damaging the mollusc, using skills learned from his father. \u201cA good living it was too. You couldn\u2019t get a better occupation, out in the fresh air, your own boss.\u201d</p> <p>For those whose livelihood was dependent on the mussel population\u2019s rude health, commercial exploitation, poaching and pollution were their enemies too. \u201cPeople did, and still do, try to poach them. They think they will make their fortune, but of course they won\u2019t at all. They just cause terrible destruction,\u201d said Abernathy.</p> <p>In 1967 he found the world\u2019s most perfect freshwater pearl \u2013 named Little Willie in his honour \u2013 but refused to sell it, instead striking a deal with a Perthshire jeweller to keep it on display. \u201cThere was a nominal sum but no, I wasn\u2019t tempted to sell it. It\u2019s part of the history of the country, money is only one thing. If you haven\u2019t got your health you haven\u2019t got anything.</p> <p>\u201cThe mussels have survived for thousands of years,\u201d added Abernathy. \u201cIt would be a terrible tragedy if they were to go extinct in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>However, interest in this neglected mollusc is likely to be rekindled this month with the publication of a novel by author Julia Stuart set in the pearl fishing communities. \u201cI discovered Scottish river pearls while visiting a family friend in the Borders,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I told her I\u2019d just found a pearl while pearl diving in Bahrain, she showed me an old necklace of white pearls which she said had been found in Scottish river mussels. I was astounded. Like most people, I thought pearls could only be found in oysters.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s a shame that such a fascinating and endearing Scottish custom as pearl fishing had to be stopped, it is an imperative. Pearl mussels are critically endangered and pearl fishing caused the extinction of many important populations. Anyone who is thinking they\u2019ll strike it rich is deluded and risks being prosecuted. They probably wouldn\u2019t find a pearl for a start and, if by some miracle they did, they couldn\u2019t sell it as it would be illegal to own it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.waterstones.com/book/the-last-pearlfisher-of-scotland/julia-stuart/978178704292\"><em>The Last Pearl Fisher of Scotland, by Julia Stuart, is published on 25 August (Vintage, \u00a37.99)</em></a></p>",

What sends \u201csneakerheads\u201d \u2013 those who collect or trade shoes \u2013 into a frenzy is trading in limited edition footwear from major sports brands paired with celebrities such as Eminem and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\" title=\"\">Kanye West</a>. The potential for hobbyists to make money is fuelled by websites such as StockX and K\u2019lekt, whose trading platforms have helped improve liquidity and price transparency in the opaque secondary market.</p> <p>The virtual price tags on StockX run in some cases to five figures, with a pair of Eminem-branded Nike Air Jordans on sale for almost $17,000 despite the uppers being made of canvas rather than the gold plate the price might imply. For those whose rapper/trainer guru of choice is West, a pair of his Adidas Yeezy Boost 750s is on sale for a gym membership-busting $1,800 \u2013 bringing the seller a sizable profit on their original sale price of $350.</p> <p>Josh Luber, co-founder and chief executive of US based StockX, says the resale market is growing at 10-20% a year, which is a slowdown on the \u201chyper-growth\u201d seen between 2011 and 2013. Since the site\u2019s launch in February, it has attracted 26,500 listings.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are passionate about sneakers, and brands like Nike and Adidas have been great at building up hype in the sneakerhead community,\u201d says the former IBM consultant, who started collecting trainers at the age of eight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5299231406ba18aaaa2ff5244be24a6065a64037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5299231406ba18aaaa2ff5244be24a6065a64037/0_47_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adidas Originas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adidas Originas have seen a 50% increase in sales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The site\u2019s backers include US billionaire Dan Gilbert and Marshall Mathers, better-known as Eminem.</p> <p>StockX is not regulated like other exchanges, but offers the kind of trading tools more usually found on specialist financial sites.

This person has betted heavily on the popularity of Air Jordan trainers, which make up half the 549 pairs they own. At the other end of the scale, a large number of sellers on the site have just one or two pairs for and are nursing hefty losses, with portfolios deemed worthless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1442573b6ad4d428892bd2c36049318298706826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1442573b6ad4d428892bd2c36049318298706826/0_51_1808_2919/619.jpg\" alt=\"Kanye West, wearing Yeezy 3 sneakers.\" width=\"619\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West, wearing Yeezy 3 sneakers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerie Macon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mattpowell/#77bc1ebcd70d\" title=\"\">Sportswear analyst Matt Powell</a>, who writes the influential <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mattpowell/#5897eef2d70d\" title=\"\">Sneakernomics</a> blog, says the athletic shoe market is \u201cgrowing nicely\u201d, although demand for fashion styles is stronger than for performance shoes, which comprise a larger part of the overall market. \u201cLimited-edition shoes are not released in commercial quantities and therefore are pretty meaningless [to the overall picture],\u201d says Powell who cautions potential investors: \u201cLike with any collectible, the market can be very volatile.\u201d</p> <p>Germany\u2019s Adidas recently reported bumper sales and profits for the first six months of 2016.

But market leader Nike also dominates the resale market, as enthusiasts covet iterations of the Air Jordan \u2013 named after basketball legend Michael Jordan \u2013 even though they have been around since the 1980s.</p> <p>Gary Warnett, a blogger who worked on now-defunct online store Crooked Tongues, says social networks have turned a niche pursuit into an industry, with soaring prices inviting opportunists to enter the fray. \u201cSocial media has blown up this world and exposed it to a new audience. What used to be myriad of subcultures has become mainstream, with a lot of desire focused on six or seven silhouettes, like Yeezy, NMD and Air Jordan. Kanye West\u2019s influence on the young buying public is massive.\u201d</p> <p>If StockX is successful, the plan is to become a wider \u201cstock market of things\u201d, trading collectibles such as comics, watches and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/hermes-birkin-handbag-best-investment-returns\" title=\"\">handbags</a>.

After 15 years in charge of the German sportswear giant, he presided over his last set of results via a conference call from the host city.</p> <p>At the start of last year, after several profit warnings and a slump into third place behind Nike and Under Armour in the key US market, it looked like Hainer might be leaving Adidas under a cloud. But earlier this month he could probably have danced the samba.</p> <p>\u201cThese financial results are just fantastic,\u201d he told investors as the company reported a 21% increase in sales to \u20ac4.4bn and a near 100% increase in profits, to \u20ac291m for the second quarter. \u201cAnd I saved the best for last.\u201d Adidas shares, which are listed on the Deutsche B\u00f6rse, have more than doubled in value, and are now changing hands for 152p.</p> <p>He could have chosen a pair of Stan Smith trainers for his imagined victory dance, because the renewed popularity of the classic style, which Adidas has been making since the 1960s, fuelled a 50% sales increase at its Originals fashion division during that record quarter. Shrewd reissues of other retro trainer styles as well as big name collaborations, such as one for Yeezy Boost with Kanye West (pictured, with Kim Kardashian) have helped make Adidas cool again. And in doing so they secured a podium finish for Hainer. <strong>ZW</strong></p>",
  "<p>In a side street in the heart of Athens, two siblings are hard at work. For the past year they have run their hairdressing business \u2013 an enterprise that was once located on a busy boulevard \u2013 out of a two-bedroom flat. The move was purely financial: last summer, as it became clear that Greeks would be hit by yet more austerity to foot the bill for saving their country from economic collapse, they realised their business would go bust if it continued operating legally.</p> <p>\u201cWe did our sums and understood that staying put made no sense at all,\u201d says one sibling. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t [offer] receipts, if we avoided taxes and social security contributions, we could just about make ends meet.\u201d</p> <p>They are far from being alone. A year after debt-stricken Greece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/greece-edges-third-bailout-positive-signals-germany\" title=\"\">received its third financial rescue</a> in the form of international funding worth \u20ac86bn, such survival techniques have become commonplace. For a middle class eviscerated by relentless rounds of cuts and tax rises \u2013 the price of the country\u2019s ongoing struggle to avert bankruptcy \u2013 the draconian conditions attached to the latest bailout are invariably invoked in their defence. Measures ranging from the overhaul of the pension system to indirect duties \u2013 slapped on beer, fuel and almost everything in between \u2013 and a controversial increase in VAT are similarly cited by Greeks now reneging on loan repayments, property taxes and energy bills.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of monumental debt \u2013 \u20ac320bn, or 180% of GDP, the accumulation of decades of profligacy \u2013 fatalism is fast replacing pessimism on the streets. \u201cOur country is doomed,\u201d sighs Savvas Tzironis, summing up the mood. \u201cEverything goes from bad to worse.\u201d</p> <p>Close to half a million Greeks are believed to have migrated since the crisis begun, thanks to the searing effect of persistent unemployment (at just under 24%, the highest in Europe) and an economy that has shed more than a third of its total output over the past six years. The nation has been assigned some \u20ac326bn in bailout loans since May 2010 \u2013 the biggest rescue programme in global financial history. Yet the fear that it is locked in an economic death spiral was given further credence last week when Eurobank analysts announced that consumption and exports had also fallen, by 6.4% and 7.2%, in the second quarter of the year.</p> <p>The duration and depth of the recession is such that the World Bank now compares it to the slumps seen in eastern European countries in the early 1990s. The poorest 20% of Greece\u2019s 11 million people have suffered a 42% drop in disposable income since 2009.</p> <p>\u201cIf we continue down this road, a fourth, even a fifth, bailout should be expected,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, associate professor of law and economics at Athens University. \u201cI don\u2019t see any progress. The economy is stagnant, the private sector devastated, the public administration underfunded and ineffective. And there is always the spectre of Grexit at the end of the tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>The 14 August bailout deal was meant to have put paid to that. Announcing the agreement after months of negotiations that not only brought Athens to the brink of euro exit but provoked the continent\u2019s biggest existential crisis in recent times, EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker chirpily announced that Greece was \u201cirreversibly\u201d part of the euro area. The 19-member currency bloc had \u201clooked into the abyss\u201d, but henceforth, he said, there was no looking back.</p> <p>A year on, however, there are many who would argue otherwise.</p> <p>In many ways, the Greek debt drama has disappeared in the folds of other crises now stalking Europe: in quick succession, fractious debate has moved from the influx of refugees through the Aegean islands to repeated terrorist attacks and Britain\u2019s shock referendum vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>The runaway train that was carrying Greeks downhill at the height of the crisis has slowed down to the point where loss and sacrifice have almost been normalised. The gradual relaxation of capital controls \u2013 imposed to prevent a run on banks as fears grew that Greece might crash out of the eurozone \u2013 has helped reinforce the sense that the economy has returned to a path of stability. The global lack of appetite for any more Greek drama is such that eurozone finance ministers disbursed a whopping \u20ac10.3bn in emergency loans in June and made an unprecedented promise of debt relief when the current programme finishes in 2018, on condition that Athens presses ahead with yet more unpopular reforms. The country is predicted to see growth of 2.5% next year.</p> <p>\u201cNo economy can withstand endless recession and stagnation,\u201d says George Pagoulatos, professor of European politics and economy at Athens University. \u201cAt some point there could be a change of preferences, with forces who would want to continue outside the euro,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is anyone\u2019s bet what will happen if the economy doesn\u2019t [exhibit] a strong recovery in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>But few believe it will get better before it gets worse. After promising to eradicate austerity, the once popular leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is now a reviled figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b04447f79f104bdf86d174e242dd87dc4dcde96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b04447f79f104bdf86d174e242dd87dc4dcde96/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras speaking outside parliament in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras speaking outside parliament in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anti\u2013EU sentiment is on the rise. In October, 70% thought it better for Greece to remain in the single currency; by July those backing the euro had fallen to 50%. Real recovery can only come if the country\u2019s staggering debt burden is reduced. Without debt relief, the International Monetary Fund, which has yet to participate in the latest rescue, believes interest payments on the growing pile will account for 60% of the budget by 2060. In an excoriating review of its own role in the crisis, the IMF\u2019s internal watchdog recently admitted to a litany of mistakes, including the failure to foresee the recessionary impact of austerity on an economy curtailed by corruption and vested interests.</p> <p>Almost all agree that last summer\u2019s bailout simply kicks the can down the road \u2013 an art EU mandarins have mastered since Greece\u2019s ordeal by financial collapse begun. Europe\u2019s weakest link will face further tumult when the latest measures kick in this autumn and the Syriza-led government is forced to enact contentious employment reforms to secure a further \u20ac2.8bn in loans.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could say Greece has been on the mend over the last year,\u201d says George Papaconstantinou, who oversaw the country\u2019s first rescue package as finance minister. \u201cInstead we are witnessing a double-dip recession that can be wholly ascribed to Syriza\u2019s first six months in office, which almost destroyed the country and certainly set it back many years.\u201d</p> <p>More than ever, he says, Greece needs large-scale foreign investment to kickstart growth \u2013 investment that is unlikely to happen in the face of government hostility to investors, both domestic and foreign.</p> <p>Papaconstantinou, who has chronicled the crisis in a memoir, <em>Game Over, </em>argues that last summer\u2019s lifeline was all the more tragic for being unnecessary. \u201cWhat really differentiates the latest bailout from the previous ones is that this time around, it could have been avoided,\u201d he writes in the book. \u201cIt became necessary because of a mix of ideological blindness, lack of understanding of basic eurozone rules, unforgivable brinkmanship and plain incompetence during the first six months Syriza was in power.\u201d</p> <p>A year on and Greece, though quiet, remains as febrile as ever on the frontline of the euro storm.</p> <h2>Coping with crisis</h2> <p><strong>How other countries gripped by the eurozone\u2019s problems have fared</strong></p> <p><strong>Italy</strong> In the wake of the British referendum, Italy is Europe\u2019s most pressing problem. The country has lost competitiveness since joining the euro and has experienced two lost economic decades during which growth has barely risen. The country\u2019s banks are awash with bad debts. Prime minister Matteo Renzi has called a referendum on constitutional reform for October. Defeat on this would spark a political crisis, and probably an economic crisis as well.</p> <p><strong>Spain </strong>Along with Italy, this was the country that looked to be in the most trouble in 2012, when interest rates on its bonds rose to dangerously high levels. Since then, Spain has performed the stronger, and in the second quarter of 2016, its economy grew by 0.7% compared with Italy\u2019s 0.1%. Spain has squeezed domestic costs and taken advantage of a weaker euro to boost its exports. Loose fiscal policy has also helped stimulate activity.</p> <p><strong>Portugal</strong> Like Spain, Portugal\u2019s fiscal policy contravenes eurozone rules; both countries face Brussels sanctions as a result. In most respects, though, Portugal is more akin to Italy than to its Iberian-peninsula neighbour, with a recent record of slow growth, weak productivity and a shaky banking system. As in Italy, the public debt ratio is too high for comfort, and rising.</p> <p><strong>Ireland </strong>Of all the countries to receive bailouts during the euro crisis, Ireland has done the best. Strong growth has resumed, albeit partly thanks to the activities of US-owned multinationals, and unemployment has come down. Two potential problems loom, however. First, the housing market \u2013 the source of Ireland\u2019s financial problems during the crisis \u2013 has started to exhibit bubble-like tendencies again. Second, Ireland is the country most exposed to Brexit.<br><strong>Larry Elliott</strong></p>",

However, the 23-year-old insists that after an impressive campaign for himself and the Wolves he is approaching his best form.</p> <p>\u201cI was coming off the back of such a good year and playing for England and winning the Man of Steel, it was tough,\u201d Clark says. \u201cI had to deal with the challenge of then stepping into a new environment and a new challenge at Warrington and it\u2019s only natural for things to take a while to adjust.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s stood me in good stead for this year, though. I feel much more comfortable here now and I\u2019m getting back to somewhere like the form of two years ago. I know what went wrong last year and it\u2019s great to overcome that but there\u2019s still more to come.\u201d</p> <p>Clark also believes there are several members of the Warrington\u2019s squad \u2013 who will aim to strengthen their position in Super League\u2019s top four with victory at Wakefield on Sunday \u2013 who could follow in his footsteps. \u201cKurt Gidley and Chris Sandow are two who immediately stand out when it comes to that kind of thing but someone like Chris Hill has to be included too,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s always gone under the radar but the work he does for the team is astonishing.\u201d</p> <p>Clark says that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/st-helens-warrington-wolves-super-league\" title=\"\">after defeat by St Helens last Thursday</a>, it is vital Warrington begin to piece some form together with their Challenge Cup final against Hull a fortnight away. \u201cWe need to try not to think about Wembley but it will be tough to completely forget about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to hit momentum going into Wembley and it all starts for us at Wakefield this Sunday, which is vital for our league campaign and our aim of making the Grand Final.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>At some point in the 1980s, mainstream culture gave up on the future. Now, all we get are dystopias, environmental catastrophes or zombie apocalypses.

His first novel, <em>The Time Machine</em>, was published in 1895, and he saw the coming century clearer than anyone else. He anticipated wars in the air, the sexual revolution, motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a proto-Wikipedia he called the \u201cworld brain\u201d. He foresaw world wars creating a federalised Europe. Britain, he thought, would not fit comfortably in this New Europe and would identify more with the US and other English-speaking countries. In his novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/world-set-free.html\" title=\"\"><em>The World Set Free</em></a>, he imagined an \u201catomic bomb\u201d of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes. This was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913, and it made a deep impression on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/churchills-bomb-graham-farmelo-review\" title=\"\">Winston Churchill</a>.</p> <p>For Wells, imagining a viable version of the future was an intellectual game. It&#xa0;was a chance to show off, and a seemingly respectable way to be deeply subversive. Writing to his friend Elizabeth Healy, he described <em>Anticipations, </em>his 1901 book of predictions, as \u201cdesigned to undermine and destroy the monarch, monogamy, faith&#xa0;in God and respectability \u2013 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/british-empire\" title=\"\">British empire</a>, all under the guise of a&#xa0;speculation about motor cars and&#xa0;electric heating\u201d. Futurology, for Wells, was exhilarating. The idea that writers would give up even trying was&#xa0;so implausible that Wells never imagined it.</p> <p>The sudden disappearance of worthwhile futures from our culture coincided with the rise in our understanding of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\" title=\"\">climate change</a>. Global warming indeed appears inevitable and apocalyptic, but is this reason enough to remove all hope from our visions of the future? Rising sea levels, the need to decarbonise the&#xa0;economy, and chaotic shifts in ecosystems are all difficult problems to&#xa0;engage with, but we are a species that lived through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/23/eye-watering-scale-of-black-deaths-impact-on-england-revealed\" title=\"\">the Black Death</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/the-somme-during-the-first-world-war-and-now-interactive\" title=\"\">the Somme</a> and the threat of global thermonuclear war. It seems odd that we would give up now.</p> <p>I suspect the real problem is as much a rejection of originality as it is a reaction to climate change. In a hypermediated age where we are constantly engaged in filtering out the irrelevant, the last&#xa0;thing we want is to tackle the genuinely new.</p> <p>But originality was Wells\u2019s calling card. In a six-year stretch from 1895 to 1901, he produced a stream of what he called \u201cscientific romance\u201d novels, which included <em>The Time Machine</em>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=The+Island+of+Doctor+Moreau&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>The Island of Doctor Moreau</em></a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man-12.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Invisible Man</em></a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=The+War+of+the+Worlds&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>The War of the Worlds</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=The+First+Men+in+the+Moon&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\" title=\"\"><em>The First Men in the Moon</em></a>. This was a dazzling display of new thought, endlessly copied since. Unfortunately, Wells wanted to be taken seriously. Scientific romances were hardly respectable, so he moved into more established literary forms. While some of his later novels such as <em>Kipps </em>(1905) and <em>Tono-Bungay</em> (1909) have their admirers, the majority are now all but forgotten. A book like <em>The War of the Worlds</em>, in contrast, inspired every one&#xa0;of the thousands of&#xa0;alien invasion stories that followed. It burned its way into the psyche of mankind and changed us all forever.</p> <p>Wells\u2019s genius was his ability to create a stream of brand new, wholly original stories out of thin air. It is not&#xa0;those specific stories that we need now, but the imagination that spawned them. It is hard to find a contemporary author producing stories as new and unprecedented as Wells\u2019s early work, but we should try.

This means the current level of common agricultural policy (CAP) pillar one funding for farmers will remain the same until 2020, when a domestic system will take over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Universities and researchers will have funds guaranteed for research bids made directly to the European commission, including those to the EU\u2019s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/\">Horizon 2020</a> programme, an \u20ac80bn (\u00a369bn) pot for science and innovation. The Treasury said it would underwrite the funding awards even when projects continue post-Brexit.</p> <p> The Royal Society said the news was very welcome because it removed uncertainty while Britain negotiated its exit but still remained an EU member.</p> <p>However, its president, Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, said some researchers had already missed out on collaborative projects because European colleagues were worried about funding.</p> <p>\u201cI think that is why this measure is so welcome, because we have been hearing anecdotal reports of people not being willing to collaborate with certain UK collaborators because they weren\u2019t sure that they would be able to to stay for the full duration of the grant,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. </p> <p>\u201cPeople have been told that, so far there are anecdotal reports and we are trying to gather evidence to see the extent of this.\u201d</p> <p>Ramakrishnan called for an extension of the guarantee for projects approved after the autumn statement. He said: \u201cOur hope is that any grants that are awarded while we are still in the EU should be allowed to complete.\u201d</p> <p>The Local Government Association said the commitment was welcome but fell well short of the full guarantee it had urged the government to make. </p> <p>Its chairman, Lord Porter, said: \u201cLocal areas need certainty around the future of all of the \u00a35.3bn in EU regeneration funding promised to them by 2020. The continued uncertainty risks damaging local regeneration plans and stalling flagship infrastructure projects, employment and skills schemes and local growth.</p> <p>\u201cBetween now and the autumn statement, the government must pull out all the stops in working with local areas to get the hundreds of projects currently in development and at the cusp of funding agreements over the finishing line.\u201d</p> <p>The CLA, a lobby group representing about 32,000 farmers, landowners and rural businesses, said the move was vitally important, but called for a world-leading domestic funding policy to be drawn up and ready for 2021.<br></p> <p>The CLA president, Ross Murray, said: \u201cIt will provide a significant degree of reassurance to farmers and other landowners across the country. We have been clear, since the start of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum</a> campaign, that this is the first decision ministers had to make to reassure rural businesses in the advent of a Brexit vote. It is therefore a strong signal that will give confidence to businesses considering their future in a difficult agricultural market.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/national-trust\">National Trust</a> also called for backing for farming and environment projects that get under way after the autumn statement. A spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s decision to continue with funding for newly agreed and existing agri-environment schemes. But set against this is the continued uncertainty should new applications be restricted beyond this autumn. This would put at serious risk decades of effort by farmers and organisations like ours to protect and enhance our countryside.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers need certainty as we move to a more sustainable model of support for farming which puts the recovery and resilience of the natural environment at its heart. Better funded and more widely available agri-environment schemes would offer a bridge between the old and the new, helping farmers prepare for a future of new market opportunities whilst delivering greater public benefits from public money.\u201d</p> <p>Labour welcomed the move but called for clarity over whether Britain would remain a member of the European Investment Bank, which funds infrastructure investment in areas such as housing.</p> <p> The structural and investment funds that will be guaranteed include CAP pillar two, the European social fund, the European maritime and fisheries fund and the European regional development fund, including European Territorial Cooperation \u2013 also known as Interreg.</p> <p>Examples of projects that have received or are due to receive regional development fund money include the <a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/new-60m-engineering-innovation-centre-to-be-based-in-manchester\">Graphene Engineering and Innovation Centre</a> at the University of Manchester (\u00a35m), a manufacturing growth programme to support areas in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and the east of England (\u00a39m), and a new life sciences incubation and innovation centre at <a href=\"http://www.investinwiltshire.org.uk/major-business-sectors/life-sciences/\">Porton Down</a> in Wiltshire (\u00a33m).</p> <p> The environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: \u201cThis guarantee of funding is excellent news for our farmers and our environment. I\u2019m delighted we can provide this crucial certainty and continuity to our rural communities while we develop a new approach to supporting agriculture and protecting our precious countryside.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>It\u2019s clear by now that Whole Foods\u2019 march toward benevolent, organic, feel-good corporate dominance cannot be stopped. </p> <p>The grocery store \u2013 or \u201cAmerica\u2019s healthiest grocery store\u201d, as it <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/\">prefers to be known</a> \u2013 has more than <a href=\"http://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/fast-facts/\">435 outlets</a> across the US, Canada and the UK.</p> <p>And, just last month, Whole Foods plopped down its latest outlet \u2013 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</p> <p>Williamsburg is a place that, depending on your point of view, is a hub of culture, music and art, or a place that is home to wealthy ad agency workers who want to live in lavish, brand-new condos while still enjoying the \u201cauthenticity\u201d of Brooklyn life. </p> <p>Happily, both perspectives make the neighbourhood prime feeding ground for Whole Foods, given the company\u2019s target audience: an audience that wants the farm-to-table produce and aura of philanthropy you get at a farmers\u2019 market, but with more attractive packaging and nicer shopping baskets.</p> <p>On Friday morning the new store was predictably awash with customers. Whole Foods prides itself on offering local produce, and the Brooklyn plant is no exception. Upon entering, the first thing I saw were some beautiful white orchids. The second thing I saw was a sign above them. \u201cGrown in New Jersey,\u201d it said.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t stop there. There was a cabinet labelled \u201cbaked goods\u201d. It turned out some of the baked goods had been baked right here in Brooklyn. There was even a picture of the bakers. The store features more than 800 Brooklyn-made products from more than 75 Brooklyn suppliers. </p> <p>As I headed downstairs, into the belly of the beast, the store opened up. It is cavernous at 51,000 square feet. As you come down the escalator there is a sign bearing Whole Foods\u2019 \u201chigher purpose\u201d: </p> <p>\u201cNourishing the health and well-being of people and planet by being the authentic purveyor of food for the greater good.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly a noble idea, but I rather doubted the sincerity of the message, given it was displayed on one of those letter boards where you can change what it says at any given moment, like messages children craft on refrigerators with magnets. </p> <p>Moving forward, I encountered the fruit and veg section, where I was met by 11 different types of onion. </p> <p>Suffice to say, it is extremely comprehensive. Comprehensive and local. You can buy organic red onions from New York. Organic yellow onions from New York. Horseradish root from New Jersey.</p> <p>That said, there is foreign stuff too. Apples from Argentina. Pears from New Zealand.</p> <p>Sometimes two of the same products, one produced locally, and one produced abroad, are positioned next to each other, enabling shoppers to secretly vent their xenophobia.</p> <p>\u201cScrew you France, I\u2019m buying the New Jersey onion.\u201d \u201cGet stuffed, Holland, my Savoy cabbage is coming from Vermont.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/28/whole-foods-new-york-city-overcharging-food-labels\">Whole Foods to pay $500,000 to New York City for overcharging allegations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If one of the staples of Whole Foods is healthy, organic produce, another is the pricing. It is expensive. You can buy orange juice \u2013 a 16oz orange juice \u2013 for $7.99. Or 27 organic diapers for $11.99. Or 15oz of chia seeds for $13.99.</p> <p>If it proves anything, it\u2019s that people will pay whatever you charge them. Whole Foods could double the price of its sprouted buckwheat acai blueberry cereal and people would probably still buy it. Just as long as it still contains organic maqui, Himalayan crystal salt and coconut nectar. </p> <p>On Friday Manon Hallay, a 21-year-old dance student and Williamsburg resident, was among the Whole Foods patrons. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she said as she emerged from the store, blinking in the sunlight. \u201cBut it\u2019s so expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Hallay claimed to have been buying \u201cbreakfast food\u201d. I looked in her bag. It contained one loaf of bread and a bottle of lemonade.</p> <p>Nola Romano, 41, appeared to have done a more comprehensive shop. </p> <p>\u201cMeat and vegetables,\u201d she declared when I asked what she had purchased. </p> <p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s not many places to buy good vegetables round here,\u201d she said. \u201cOr meat.\u201d</p> <p>Romano was dressed in leggings, sneakers and a sports top. Whole Foods is perfectly placed to draw in the healthy-lifestyle crowd, given its location next door to an Equinox gym \u2013 think a normal gym, but priced like maintaining a racehorse \u2013 and many of the customers seemed to be dressed in workout gear. But appearances can be deceiving.</p> <p>\u201cOh it\u2019s a facade,\u201d Romano said when I noted her sporting attire.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done no exercise today. Except carry these,\u201d she said, motioning to her meat and vegetable bags.</p> <p>Romano also noted the high prices \u2013 \u201calthough if you buy their store brands it\u2019s cheaper\u201d \u2013 but a look around Brooklyn Harvest Market, a couple of blocks away, suggested Whole Foods prices aren\u2019t that different from other local options. The butternut squash was 50c cheaper in Harvest Market, sure, but then the organic diapers were $2 more. The chia seeds were $4 less in Harvest, but Whole Foods offered cheaper yellow onions.</p> <p>So there\u2019s competition. But it seems nobody else does the local produce thing quite like Whole Foods. Or at least nobody else assails their customers with local produce propaganda quite like Whole Foods. </p> <p>And it\u2019s not just that you can find \u201cover 30 cheeses made within 100 miles of here\u201d. It\u2019s that Whole Foods is really good at creating an environment where people want to spend time. </p> <p>In the Williamsburg store they\u2019ve created a faux neighborhood, like on a TV set where there\u2019s a precious manicured street with fake signs and fake store fronts. You can stand outside \u201cFine Cuts\u201d butchers and watch a real-life butcher handling his meat. You can sit in the \u201cN4 taproom\u201d and drink a local IPA while enjoying the sports on TV. You can flip through the New York Times style section as you drink a latte in the coffee shop. </p> <p>Or maybe you\u2019d like to pay a visit to the smoothie bar. Or visit Luke\u2019s Lobster \u201ctail cart\u201d \u2013 an old-fashioned wooden thing where someone who may or may not actually be called Luke sells lobster tails from Maine. You could even stop in at the vegan and paleo parfait bar for a chat over some chickpeas. The resulting atmosphere is more food hall than big-box grocery store.</p> <p>It is relaxing. It is homey. It is aspirational. It feels like a community.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t, though. </p> <p>\u201cAre you trying to sell me something? If you\u2019re trying to sell me something then don\u2019t fucking talk to me,\u201d said a woman leaving the store as I trotted over with my notebook.</p> <p>After spending an hour in Whole Foods I felt I knew how to talk to their customers. I opened my mouth to explain. </p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m locally sourced!\u2019 I wanted to say. \u2018I\u2019m 100% organic!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m expensive!\u2019</p> <p>I didn\u2019t get the chance. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry,\u201d the woman called over her shoulder as she ran across the street.</p> <p>Not even Whole Foods can ensure every customer leaves in a good mood.</p>",

There\u2019s more citizen awareness about women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>The march is just the beginning, according to Romero, 68, who twice served as the minister for women under the government of Alejandro Toledo, whose term as Peruvian president ran from 2001 to 2006. On average, 10 women are murdered every month in Peru, said Romero, while ministry figures indicate a further 20 are victims of attempted femicide.</p> <p>\u201cIf you add to those 10 who lose their lives the 20 victims who are saved by the skin of their teeth, then we are practically talking about one [attack] per day,\u201d she said. \u201cOf those 10 who are killed around six are under the age of 20.\u201d</p> <p>Romero began her latest stint with a bang by criticising remarks made by Peru\u2019s most senior Catholic cleric, Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, the Archbishop of Lima. Speaking on his weekly radio programme, Cipriani made remarks that appeared to tacitly blame women and girls for provoking sexual attacks by dressing provocatively, as if in a \u201cshop window\u201d. </p> <p>The incoming minister publicly repudiated his remarks, saying his statement \u201cremoves all responsibility from the attacker\u201d.</p> <p>The archbishop apologised for his comments, which the church in Peru claimed had been taken out of context. But Romero said there was no room for misinterpretation.</p> <p>Women\u2019s rights groups praised her comments, which suggested a change in attitude from her previous terms in office, when she appeared to be \u201cstrongly influenced by sectors of the church\u201d, said Sus\u00e1na Chavez, director of <a href=\"http://promsex.org/\">Promsex</a>. </p> <p>The incident has boosted public debate over gender violence and sexist attitudes.

However, the injuries she suffered at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, Ronny Garc\u00eda, were not enough to convince the judge that her life was in danger and Garc\u00eda was released after spending four years in prison.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases outraged people and ignited the movement,\u201d march organiser Sasa de la Cruz, said. \u201cBut they are just two examples which show women can\u2019t get justice.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, Peru\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Eduardo Vega, said the state treated female survivors of physical or sexual violence with \u201cabsolute neglect\u201d.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.defensoria.gob.pe/modules/Downloads/prensa/notas/2015/NP-268-15.pdf\">2015 study by Peru\u2019s ombudsman\u2019s office</a>, La Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo, in 81% of the studied cases no measures were taken to protect survivors of attempted femicide. As a result, 24% of those women who had sought help were murdered by the assailant they had reported to the authorities, the study concluded.</p> <p>Romero said the new government, which took office on 28 July, would train police to be more aware of the problem, ensure better provision of psychological support, open more women\u2019s shelters, and establish 245 emergency centres for women across the country.</p> <p>\u201cOur problem is not a lack of legislation, it is how we apply the law.

  "<h2><strong>Roy Mallows, 53, shepherd, Cambridgeshire</strong></h2> <p>The county council land we farm was originally allotments. My grandfather took them over as they became vacant. He farmed pigs and poultry, and the arable land was used to produce feed. When he died in the 1960s, my father took over and farmed pigs and cattle; I joined him after I left school in 1979.</p> <p>By this time, the pigs were gone and cattle prices were on their way down, so we started a pedigree sheep flock. We now run about 550 ewes and followers, producing rams for breeding and high-quality butchers\u2019 lambs. The arable land has been put down to grass as it no longer pays.</p> <p>Sheep are seven days a week, 24 hours a day: there is always one sick, dead, stuck in a fence or out on the road. You have to be a midwife at lambing time, a hairdresser for shearing and a doctor all year round. Only the other night, I met a ewe and her lambs in the middle of the high street at 9.30pm \u2013 but for once it wasn\u2019t one of mine. With my son and some friends, we managed to trap them until the owner arrived with his daughter and sheepdog to herd them home.</p> <p>June was a nightmare this year because of the rain, every day. I couldn\u2019t get the shearing done: wet sheep won\u2019t shear. Wool\u2019s not worth a lot (about \u00a32 a fleece) which just about covers the cost of shearing. Lamb prices are approximately \u00a375-\u00a385 per lamb, depending on the weight and grade \u2013 which, when you take subsidies and costs into account, is no better than when I left school. All of the farmers running small or middle-sized farms I know voted to leave the EU because they believe, as I do, that prices cannot get any worse; if they do, it will be the nail in the coffin.</p> <p>A shepherd like me has a very uncertain future. My father is still working at nearly 80, but many younger tenants are being made to retire at 65, which does not bode well for me. My job is extremely physical; I cannot see myself doing the work I do now in 10 years\u2019 time. We are living on low wages and have only the state pension to come. People who work in offices think they have a stressful life, but we have a responsibility for the welfare of our animals, whatever the cost to our health and pockets.</p> <p>Of course there are things I love. I see things that other people miss. I was talking to a friend, and I saw a <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/t/treecreeper/\">treecreeper bird</a> climbing one of his trees. I told him it was quite rare, and he hadn\u2019t any idea. I see butterflies that people say have died out. I might not know the proper name of a plant, but I can tell you exactly where it grows.</p> <p>I\u2019m never away from the river, and I see it change every day. The cricket club had a clear-up recently and they destroyed a kingfisher nest that had been there for 15 years \u2013 they thought it was just a hole in the bank. It was a shame: I used to like watching that kingfisher popping in and out. He\u2019ll be back, though.</p> <h2><strong>Kim Dixson, 28, footballer and community worker, south London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d6032afd5f0603a263dca9d147e0e64ba84b14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d6032afd5f0603a263dca9d147e0e64ba84b14d/0_0_4429_5906/750.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Dixson\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Dixson: \u2018You have to motivate other people to get outside.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been at Charlton football club since I was eight. I\u2019m now captain of Charlton Athletic women, and I played for England under-23s. I trained as a PE teacher, and I\u2019ve always wanted to do something outdoors and sporty.</p> <p>I work with young people who might have been in trouble with the police. A big part of my job is running sessions on estates, in areas with high levels of antisocial behaviour, crime and deprivation. We go into the community, set up games and try to encourage the young residents to get involved. Sometimes it\u2019s a struggle, especially if the weather\u2019s not good. A lot of them are more used to being inside with their mates, playing on PlayStations. But when they do come out, it\u2019s great to see the effect it has; they\u2019re just happier.</p> <p>Part of my job is office-based: there\u2019s admin around getting referrals for some of the young people I work with and arranging one-to-one mentoring. But I\u2019m out every afternoon: some days I coach the Charlton girls\u2019 under-16 side, then I\u2019ll train with the ladies\u2019 team until 10pm. Occasionally I\u2019m in the office 9-5, and I\u2019m not the best at coping with that. I don\u2019t like sitting still for long.</p> <p>It is challenging when you\u2019ve got snow and hailstones: you can\u2019t clear snow off AstroTurf. You have to stay positive, though, and motivate other people to get outside, so I just put on a brave face. Rain, I\u2019m not that fussed about. As long as I\u2019ve got a coat with a hood, it doesn\u2019t bother me.</p> <h2><strong>Becky Austin, 29, assistant warden at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/l/lochlomond/index.aspx\"><strong>RSPB\u2019s Loch Lomond reserve</strong></a><strong>, Scotland</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a863ca1c511e603592ebc521b856c770df5dca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a863ca1c511e603592ebc521b856c770df5dca2/0_1553_4912_5807/846.jpg\" alt=\"Becky Austin\" width=\"846\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Becky Austin: \u2018I pinch myself every day that someone\u2019s paying me to do this.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Hunter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I manage the residential volunteers who live on site at the lake. Throughout the winter we\u2019re cutting vegetation in the Aber bog, removing willow, sorting out the fences so the grazing cattle stay where they\u2019re supposed to. Putting up a fence by myself is one of the trickiest things I\u2019ve done. We also have a lot of survey work to do: getting up at dawn, watching the birds during breeding season, looking out for aggressive or nesting behaviour, or different species carrying food. You have to identify them all by song and call, which is something I\u2019ve had to learn.</p> <p>In the summer, you have to go out after sunset to do some of the observational work. Up here, sunset is after 11pm, and you can hear the <a href=\"http://www.wwww.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/s/spottedcrake/index.aspx\">spotted crake</a> calling to each other. You see <a href=\"http://www.m.www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/t/tawnyowl/index.aspx\">tawny owls</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/b/barnowl/index.aspx\">barn owls</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/o/osprey/\">ospreys</a> fishing on the loch. I saw my first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/first-encounter-pine-marten-country-diary\">pine marten</a> when I was out doing survey work.</p> <p>In the winter, it\u2019s a bit tougher. We have to be out at dawn to observe the geese, which roost on the flooded areas of the loch; we stand there until they all leave and try to count them. Sometimes all 10,000 birds go up at once so it\u2019s impossible \u2013 but the noise they make is just fantastic. I\u2019ve been pretty lucky with the winters so far, but it still gets very, very cold, and there are times when you\u2019re standing there, feet freezing, binoculars shaking; but good wellies, a flask and good company help a lot.</p> <p>We manage 237 hectares, and there\u2019s a whole range of habitats \u2013 wetland, woodland, ponds, the bog. My favourite spot is on one of the farm fields. There\u2019s an oak tree with a little nook that I fit into perfectly, and I can just sit there and read. It feels like home. I pinch myself every day that someone\u2019s paying me to do this.</p> <h2><strong>Angelo Daniel, 19, horticultural apprentice at the </strong><a href=\"http://heligan.com/\"><strong>Lost Gardens of Heligan</strong></a><strong>, Cornwall</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6be30d5e85a5374ede64b181f36f046b445d7d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6be30d5e85a5374ede64b181f36f046b445d7d0/0_197_5326_3196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angelo Daniel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angelo Daniel: \u2018My favourite space is the jungle.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Rees for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I left sixth-form college last summer, and was looking for an agricultural apprenticeship. I\u2019d never been to Cornwall before I came for the interview (I was living 300 miles away in Shropshire) but I fell in love with the place. I spent the entire day wandering about with my mouth open.</p> <p>The gardens used to be privately owned. At the beginning of the first world war, most of the gardeners were enlisted and killed and the gardens fell into disrepair. In the early 1990s, they started a restoration project. It\u2019s around 250 acres and now owned by a trust.</p> <p>My favourite space is the jungle \u2013 a large valley with a natural microclimate. The original gardeners planted it up with a lot of tropical and Australasian plants, and when it was abandoned it grew up into this completely bizarre space. The valley means it\u2019s always around five degrees warmer, with very little wind, so it\u2019s like stepping through a window into the tropics.</p> <p>I live about a mile away, on the edge of a village called Mevagissey. In the winter I\u2019ll ride my motorcycle to work, but in the summer I might run. There\u2019s a path about 50 metres from my front door that runs right up through the woods to the estate. I\u2019m quite into parkour, and there are lots of great places to free run on my way in and out of work, which is pretty great.</p> <p>My day starts at 8am, and we usually begin with a tidy-up, trying to clear the fallen petals and leaves. It sounds a bit boring, but it\u2019s a lovely way to start the day; there\u2019s something special about spending a portion of the early morning either on your own or in a small group, just silently getting in touch with what the day is doing. In the last week or so, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of harvesting in the veg garden, digging up potatoes, picking broad beans, raking over a new strawberry bed. The produce is taken to the tearooms, and the vast majority of it is used on site. We get to eat here, too.</p> <p>I work until 4.30pm, then my time is my own. Wandering down to the sea takes a couple of minutes. If I\u2019m not there, then I might go climbing. I like walking a lot. I have a Facebook account I check every couple of days, but apart from that, internet culture really doesn\u2019t interest me. I don\u2019t see the point.</p> <p>My apprenticeship is for two years. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do next, but I\u2019d like to study and become a dendrologist [an expert on trees and shrubs], if things go to plan. But I\u2019m content for now.</p> <h2><strong>Kristy Duncan, 38, wildlife conservationist trainee, London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fcc6df168e92de0678ddba0936b2214fcebd2e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fcc6df168e92de0678ddba0936b2214fcebd2e7/0_776_5906_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristy Duncan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristy Duncan: \u2018Doing this job is like an outdoor gym, but better.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was a dental nurse in Scotland for many years. I didn\u2019t realise I could have a career in the environmental sector; I\u2019d always thought of it as a hobby. But when I moved back down to London, I started volunteering with the <a href=\"http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/\">Wildlife Trust</a> and I saw an advert for the course I\u2019m now on.</p> <p>Most of the week, we\u2019re outside. There is a lot of grassland management, clearing scrubs, coppicing. Then, once a week we have to go to the devil\u2019s drawing room (that\u2019s how I think of central London) for classroom sessions. That\u2019s my least favourite day, but honestly there\u2019s nothing I would change about my current life. Every day I wake up and I feel blessed; I don\u2019t get that sense of dread any more.</p> <p>I had lost two stone before becoming a trainee because I hadn\u2019t been well, and at first I felt quite weak. But I soon became strong again, and now I\u2019m at my healthiest. Doing this work is like an outdoor gym, but better. It makes sense though, doesn\u2019t it? If you look at human beings in the past, they never exercised for fun. It\u2019s strange how we\u2019re more sedentary, how we\u2019re having to create environments for exercise when we could just be out in the world.</p> <p>Working outdoors has given me a bigger appreciation of the rain, which surprised me. When we started in October, it was torrential rain, really horrendous weather, and I loved it. You feel quite energised. It beats scraping the saliva out of someone\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>When I graduate, I want to work in woodland management. I\u2019d like to get involved in forest schools, and make sure we reach out into the community to show people what\u2019s on their doorstep. I\u2019m always urging my friends and family to get more involved, but it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s about having a certain mindset, and understanding that these spaces can build connections between different groups of people and benefit a whole community.</p> <h2><strong>Ben Rayner, 39, outdoor learning leader, Sussex</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da0f672fdd763073a9f2b900285580f506f4bdbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da0f672fdd763073a9f2b900285580f506f4bdbc/0_598_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Rayner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Rayner: \u2018It\u2019s amazing how spending a day in the country can transform people.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My official title is corporate training and developmental coordinator, which means I run courses for groups that involve a lot of physical activity: it might be kayaking, or climbing, or orienteering. We see a lot of people who have recently graduated who are great at computer work or interacting on social media, but they struggle with picking up a phone or talking face to face. It\u2019s amazing how spending a day in the country can transform people. You might see someone with a reputation for being really quiet in the office suddenly become the loudest, most proactive person when they\u2019re faced with a challenge course. Today I had a team of adults who all had behavioural problems as children and were struggling with employment. We did a day out on the pond, kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, and everyone was just so relaxed and engaged; it was great.</p> <p>I used to be a mobile phone salesman, working in the City of London and the home counties. It was a very target-driven, stressful job, and I was on my laptop till 10pm. I always had this thought in the back of my head that I should be doing this instead.</p> <p>I ended up taking a voluntary role in the Lake District for six months. They took me under their wing and paid for a lot of my qualifications. In my spare time I was kayaking and climbing, just to clock up the hours.</p> <p>My wife calls me a winter husband. During the summer, I\u2019m often working from 8am until 10 at night, or I\u2019m away on an overnight session. But I can take three weeks off at Christmas. We do work all year round. A couple of years ago, a lake froze over completely and we had a group of teenagers who were meant to be out on the water. We just put them in dry suits and got them to use the canoes as icebreakers. They had the best time, and I think some of the best work we do is in the winter \u2013 when people are up against it in the rain and at their wits\u2019 end. That\u2019s when people have life-changing experiences.</p>",

  "<p>Six years ago, I was a professional video games tester. I\u2019d go out at the weekend with a few mates, then sit at home all night playing computer games. I was bored, and I was getting depressed. I happened to be reading The Traveller by John Twelve Hawks and one of the characters did capoeira. It sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try. Within six months I\u2019d quit my job and gone to university. I\u2019ve never looked back.</p> <p>Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art with music. You learn how to kick and how to throw yourself about, and you get fit. But it\u2019s also a conversation. Your personality is reflected in how you move, and you can get to know someone instantly just by doing capoeira (which we call playing) with them, or watching them play. During a game, everyone forms a circle called the roda, with two players standing in the middle. On one side stand people with instruments. Whoever holds the largest berimbau (a stringed instrument shaped like a bow) dictates the speed and feeling of the game. Some rhythms instruct you to play nicely, others to be more aggressive. People start playing a certain song, and without even realising it you start moving differently.</p> <p>It\u2019s intense. You might do cartwheels and kicks at high speed while someone tries to put their foot on your head \u2013 you have to use your entire body to keep your stance strong and balanced. I was always thin, but now I\u2019ve broadened out, got definition. I can do sideflips, walk on my hands and move my body in ways that I\u2019d never have dreamed of.</p> <p>There\u2019s a huge community around capoeira, and it is very social. I was quite insular, so it was a bit overwhelming going into that environment. But the group was so inclusive, dragging me out to parties, that I\u2019ve become completely confident. Before capoeira, I wouldn\u2019t have gone anywhere on my own. Now I\u2019m happy to visit new places and meet new people. It\u2019s taken me all over the world. Capoeira has changed my life.</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have a passion for exercise?

Standing with your legs apart, step one foot back, staying on your toes. Step that same foot back to its starting position, then repeat with the opposite foot.</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>Cartwheels, handstands and high kicks feature a lot, and people are often scared to try them when they first start.

But in reality, the practical impact is impossible to quantify. As with so much else in the gloomy soup of post-referendum Britain, no one seems able to explain what Brexit means.</p> <p>The real dent caused by the result is&#xa0;to the Premier League\u2019s image, to the&#xa0;brand it has built over more than&#xa0;two decades.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest that the league has been an unalloyed force for&#xa0;good, by any means. There are plenty of unwanted side effects, from the historic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/feb/10/premier-league-tv-rights-grow-sky-sports\" title=\"\">lack of trickle-down investment</a> in the rest of the football pyramid to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/02/twentys-plenty-premier-league-football-supporters-federation-ticket-prices\" title=\"\">rampant ticket inflation</a> that has threatened to price out whole sections of the match-going public.</p> <p>But in the mix of cosmopolitan flair and homegrown grit that characterise the Premier League\u2019s appeal, it has been an undeniable success story on its own terms. I was once given a guided tour of the expansive studios on the fringes of west London from which the Premier League brand is beamed to the world. Amid legions of worker bees tweeting live updates to China and packaging clips for sub-Saharan Africa, two things were apparent. One is the extent to which footballers from all corners of the globe are present, allowing far-flung viewers to claim a slice of the league for themselves. And, second, the extent to which the atmosphere and fans are central to the package, their chants turned up high in the mix amid endless cutaways of rapt, packed stands.</p> <p>In his ultimately fruitless pre-Brexit intervention, Scudamore spoke of how the Premier League was \u201copen for business, open for discussion, and open&#xa0;for cooperation\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is an openness about the Premier League which I think it would be completely incongruous if we were to take the opposite position.\u201d</p> <p>The league is a rapacious animal of&#xa0;ruthless logic, but in defining its appeal in those terms he hit upon a wider truth. By accident or design, it has&#xa0;become a true league of nations, at&#xa0;odds with the inward-looking mentality stirred by Brexit.</p> <p>With the Olympics under way there is now another potentially troubling side effect of the Brexit vote for sport in the UK. It is not one driven by the bottom-line business logic of the Premier League but by a threat to the very rationale for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/aug/13/olympics-2012-cost-per-medal-team-gb-funding\" title=\"\">pouring hundreds of millions of pounds</a> of public money into Olympic sport, a process that propelled Britain from 36th to third in the medal table in 16 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/britain-take-silver-rugby-sevens-phelps-wins-again-olympics-rio-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qg88\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2649410\"            data-video-name=\"Britain take silver in rugby sevens as Phelps wins again in Rio \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ad6111e4b024cdec3d6c7f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/12/160812olympics_KP-28701470_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/12/160812olympics_KP-28701470.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/12/160812olympics_KP-28701470_V4.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/britain-take-silver-rugby-sevens-phelps-wins-again-olympics-rio-video-highlights\">Britain take silver in rugby sevens as Phelps wins again in Rio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And it is one being purposefully downplayed as Team GB, lubricated by \u00a3350m of lottery and exchequer funding&#xa0;over four years, compete at a Rio Olympics itself troubled by uncertainty and dislocating doubt in light of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/rio-2016-brazil-political-crisis-games\" title=\"\">travails of the hosts</a> and the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/31/ioc-russia-doping-athletes-rio-olympics\" title=\"\">Russian doping scandal</a>.</p> <p>Part of the reason the then chancellor Gordon Brown in 2005 said yes to a huge uplift in the amount of money poured into the British high-performance system \u2013 apart from the fear of being embarrassed at our own party \u2013 was the argument that each medal would do something for the nation.</p> <p>It was a vision that Britain\u2019s athletes&#xa0;began to deliver on in Beijing and then spectacularly realised in London four years ago amid a feel-good&#xa0;orgy of pride.

  "<p>A decision to proceed with plans to sail the first huge cruise liner through the Northwest Passage on Tuesday with 1,000 passengers on board has rekindled rows with environmentalists about the Arctic.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk\">The wildlife charity WWF</a> has accused <a href=\"http://crystal.cruiselines.com\">Crystal Cruises</a> of putting at risk \u201cthe very thing that tourists would come to see\u201d \u2013 a pristine wilderness and home to endangered species such as polar bears and walrus.</p> <p>\u201cThis voyage symbolises the risk of large-scale cruise ships operating in the Arctic. The unique wildlife is already stressed by a warming climate and the loss of sea ice, and the arrival of mega-cruise ships in this part of the world could push it further towards the edge,\u201d said Rod Downie, WWF-UK Polar programme manager.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise the positive steps that Crystal Cruises have taken to minimise their impact, working with local communities and in particular choosing not to burn heavy fuel oil in the Arctic, which is more persistent and damaging to wildlife if spilled. But if tourism is not sustainable, we risk ruining the very thing that tourists would come to see.\u201d</p> <p>The Crystal Serenity will set sail from Seward, Alaska, for New York on a 32-day, near 1,000-mile journey through the famous Northwest Passage waterway via Canada and Greenland. </p> <p>Arguments around the Arctic have more recently centred on oil company drilling such as Shell\u2019s controversial and now abandoned attempts to explore off the coast of Alaska and new plans to open up the Norwegian far north.</p> <p>But the increasing scope for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Opposites-Opportunities-threats-Guardian-ebook/dp/B0076KWQ7M\">industrialising the region</a> as the ice melts has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/jun/16/drilling-oil-gas-arctic-alaska\">triggered geopolitical tensions and talk of a new cold war because the legal status of who owns what up there is uncertain</a>.</p> <p>Michael Byers, a professor of politics and law at the University of British Columbia, says the Crystal Serenity <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-trudeau-should-move-now-to-safeguard-the-northwest-passage/article31382232/\">should be used to spur new talks between the Canadian and US governments about disputed waterway rights in the Arctic</a>.</p> <p>On its website, Crystal Cruises describes the cruises as a  \u201cworld away from the sunny Mediterranean and the Caribbean\u2019s white sandy beaches, cruises around the polar regions offer an entirely different adventure.</p> <p>\u201cSince these are luxury cruises, you could spend your days at sea in a hot whirlpool out on deck, glass of wine in hand \u2013 or head ashore on an expedition, learning more about these remote ecosystems with the help of expert guides,\u201d said the Los Angeles-based company.</p> <p>In a statement, Crystal Cruises said it was taking great care with the sailing. It had been \u201cworking on this project since 2013 and will be implementing a number of additional precautions to ensure the safety of all guests and crew, as well as to protect the pristine environment. </p> <p>\u201cWe have taken many extraordinary operational and equipment-related measures to ensure a safe voyage. The typical conditions along the planned route during the Arctic summer are substantially free of ice and within Crystal Serenity\u2019s safe-operating parameters.</p> <p>\u201cOf note is our intention to use ultra low-sulphur content marine gas oil, which far exceeds the current requirements in that region. This, along with a relatively slow transit speed, will achieve our goal of minimising our carbon footprint.\u201d</p> <p>The Crystal Serenity will carry 1,000 passengers \u2013 some reputed to be paying up to $120,000 (\u00a392,000) \u2013 plus 650 crew members. There is a casino, six restaurants and a cinema on board. The vessel is by far the largest luxury cruise ship to sail through these remote, icy waters.</p> <p>Crystal Serenity will be accompanied by an ice\u2013strengthened polar logistics vessel, RRS Ernest Shackleton, for safety backup. The vessel is normally used by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a publicly-funded organisation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36541583\">Concerns have been raised</a> about this but a spokesman for the BAS said it had no authority over how the vessel was employed in the summer months and made no financial gain from the Crystal Serenity work.</p>",

Tonight the teams are competing against each other rather than simply riding their own race one at a time. That brings an advantage for the faster team in the pairing, because they can benefit from what British Cycling (BC) refer to as \u201ccirculating air mass\u201d. In other words, slipstream. The faster team can get into their rivals\u2019 slipstream, even if they are still some way from lapping them. The boffins at BC reckon the advantage can be worth 20-30watts. That\u2019s what they call a marginal gain.</p> <p>2. Someone might have shut the velodrome doors. It certainly feels hotter in here tonight. Dame Sarah Storey reportedly reckons she narrowly failed at breaking the women\u2019s hour record because someone opened the doors in the velodrome in London. </p> <p>3.

I personally think there\u2019s far two many opportunities to win multiple medals as apart from breaststroke you don\u2019t need to be a specialist, whereas in pretty much all the other sports you do. I\u2019ve always thought a good idea would be to have a \u2018championship\u2019 for each stroke- each swimmer does each distance in a particular stroke, they get a certain number of points depending on where they finish in each one, and you then get one overall winner for the four disciplines. It\u2019d certainly make the watching less interminable as you\u2019d have a running score each day and you could still have relays to keep up the nationalism.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9ea2e4b024cdec3d6d6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T10:02:29.459Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=become_supporter\" data-alt=\"Support the Guardian\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=become_supporter\">Support the Guardian</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9c0ee4b0fe7550975124\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:51:52.960Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I think somebody may mean business \u2026</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/caster800m/status/764028255867441152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/oHyeoCUCzH\">pic.twitter.com/oHyeoCUCzH</a></p>&mdash; Caster Semenya (@caster800m) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caster800m/status/764028255867441152\">August 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:53:10.349Z\">at 10.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9b52e4b0fe755097511d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:49:10.887Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Now then, I mentioned a little earlier that we\u2019ve got the culmination of the team dressage competition</strong> with the grand prix special, having had the grand prix yesterday.

  "<p>It\u2019s a scene worthy of the grounds around the most cultured of stately homes. An expanse of tranquil water faithfully reflecting back the glorious blue of a cloudless summer sky while a spread of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/white-water-lily\">white waterlilies</a> rests serenely on its surface. Yet this is no planned garden but just one of the many lochs and lochans on the moorland and rough grazing which, for a short period each year, becomes something almost magical.</p> <p>The contrast with the wiry grasses and the stands of scratchy, leggy heather itself soon to come into bloom only emphasises the waxy perfection of the waterlilies. Each layered ruff of white petals curves gently upward, cradling the mass of yellow anthers in the centre of the flower. There is a touch of the purity of the lotus about them, yet also somehow a hint of danger and mystery, existing as they do in two worlds, coming to flower in the sunshine and open air while rooted in the murky waters of the loch. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/11/humble-daisy-brings-smile-face-country-diary\">The humble daisy brings a smile to my face</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><a href=\"http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Nymphaea+alba\">Nymphaea alba</a></em> has several alternative names in Gaelic, the most common of these being <em>duilleag bhaite bhan</em> (drowned white leaf), and most seem to suggest that a watery fate awaits those who try to pick the flowers. But there was another, more practical reason for venturing after waterlilies: their underwater roots, buried in the fine mud, were prized in many areas. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.marariley.net/celtic/SentToKass/Dyes.htm\">Prepared with an alum or iron mordant, they could produce a dark brown, almost black, dye</a> to colour wool. Collecting them was not always straightforward, though. Ideally, the roots would be gathered when exposed by low water levels, or, on the many occasions when this was not possible, from lochs known to be relatively safe. </p> <p>If the roots were not visible, the only way to find them was by wading barefoot into the treacherous mud and feeling around to locate them, then heaving and tugging at them until they came free. But the unexpected release could precipitate dangerous slips and tumbles into the cloudy water for the long-skirted gatherers. </p> <p><em>Follow Country diary on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnCountryDiary\">@gdncountrydiary</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Jessica Ennis-Hill remains on course to retain her Olympic heptathlon title after she ended a brutally long first day with a lead of 72 points over her nearest rival, Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium.</p> <p>On the first day of the athletics programme Greg Rutherford also kept alive the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/greg-rutherford-jessica-ennis-hill-mo-farah-athletics-rio-2016\">a repeat of Super Saturday at London 2012</a> by qualifying for the long jump final with a leap of 7.90m on his final attempt.

But Ennis-Hill, who gave birth to her son Reggie in 2014, has been determined to join these two unique clubs.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson was the first of the major contenders to appear in the 100m hurdles, in the penultimate heat, and produced a solid time of 13.48 sec. It wasn\u2019t quite as quick as her performance at the world championships in Beijing last year, but it was good enough to score 1053 points.</p> <p>Then it was Ennis-Hill\u2019s turn. Outside her was the Canadian world number one, Brianne Thiesen-Eaton. Both looked nervous: Ennis-Hill slapped her hamstrings and shook her shoulders, trying to release the tension, Thiesen-Eaton managing only the thinnest of smiles. But when the gun went off, Ennis-Hill was out of the blocks fastest and over the hurdles smoothest, coming through to win in 12.84 sec. It wasn\u2019t quite a season\u2019s best \u2013 she had run 0.08 sec faster at the Anniversary Games last month \u2013 and it was 0.30 sec slower than her time when she won gold at London 2012 but the 30-year-old from Sheffield was happy to take the time and the lead with a points score of 1149. Thiesen-Eaton, meanwhile, was sixth in 1,097.</p> <p>Enni-Hill then cleared 1.89m in the high jump \u2013 her best since the UK indoor trials of February 2012. But Johnson-Thompson kept the pressure on as she recovered from a so-so hurdles to make a series of first-time clearances than culminated in a brilliant personal best of 1.98m in high jump \u2013 a height equalled by Thiam.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12597088cc05e8cc1634a5e748cfc25d65ba7b22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12597088cc05e8cc1634a5e748cfc25d65ba7b22/0_183_4152_2490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the shot put.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the shot put.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It meant that after two events Johnson-Thompson led with 2,264 with Ennis-Hill just behind on 2,242. Akela Jones from Barbados was third on 2178, with Theisen-Eaton fourth on 2151.</p> <p>However the third event of the day, the shot put was to prove a disaster for Johnson-Thompson. Her first throw was so poor that it barely went 10m, although it didn\u2019t count because she stepped out of the circle. Her second was a little better, at 11.68m, but her third effort was disastrous by her stands at 11.19m. It left her with a score of just 640 points from the event and slipped to sixth on 2904 points.</p> <p>Ennis-Hill has been throwing 14.50m in training but was frustrated after failing to reproduce that form. After only managing 13.86m \u2013 nearly a metre down on her personal best \u2013 she had her head in her hands. Still, it at least scored her 785 points which moved her up to second on 3,027 points behind Thiam, whose excellent competition continued with a throw of 14.91m, the best of the competition to take her to 3107 points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/the-athletics-elite-turns-up-on-time-but-rio-seems-still-to-be-in-bed\">The athletics elite turns up on time but Rio seems still to be in bed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two British women were one and two in the final event of day one, the 200m, with Johnson-Thompson winning in 23.26 sec to score 1053 points.

  "<p>One of Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/08/government-could-use-little-known-power-to-stop-shenhua-mine-says-expert\">biggest mining battles</a> could be drawing to a close, with the enormous Shenhua Watermark coalmine looking set to be stopped by the state government after relentless community pressure.</p> <p>In a major victory for the uneasy coalition of environmentalists, farmers and conservative politicians and commentators, the New South Wales government said it was moving to stop mining in the fertile farming soils of the Liverpool Plains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/state-buys-back-controversial-bhp-mining-licence-on-liverpool-plains\">State buys back controversial BHP mining licence on Liverpool plains</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW premier, Mike Baird, said mining under the most fertile soils in the country \u201cposes too great a risk for the future of this food bowl and the underground water sources that support it\u201d.</p> <p>It came with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/state-buys-back-controversial-bhp-mining-licence-on-liverpool-plains\">two announcements late on Thursday afternoon</a>.<br></p> <p>First, Baird announced the government was paying $200m to buy back BHP\u2019s licence to build a huge underground coalmine at Caroona.</p> <p>Second, the government also revealed it was negotiating with Shenhua to excise parts of its licence that encroached on the \u201cstrategic agricultural lands\u201d of the Liverpool Plains.<br></p> <p>The statements were grand, but also carefully hedged. The government avoided saying they were moving to end coalmining in the Liverpool Plains more generally. Rather, it was just the \u201cfertile black soils\u201d and the \u201cstrategic agricultural lands\u201d that would not be mined.</p> <p>But the distinction seemed like a strange one for the government to make.</p> <p>These interventions were driven by a vigorous community campaign. And that campaign will not settle for Shenhua\u2019s mine merely being shrunk to avoid falling on one type of soil rather than another.</p> <p>\u201cThe only solution that the people will accept is that the Liverpool is preserved, like a national park for agriculture,\u201d says Tim Duddy, a farmer from the region and head of the Caroona coal action group.</p> <p>Jeremy Buckingham, the NSW Greens mining spokesman, said the distinction between the two soil types was meaningless.</p> <p>\u201cNo one believes them for a minute that slightly reducing the footprint of the mine will in any way ameliorate the impact that a 20km long, 200m deep open-cut coalmine will have on an incredibly sensitive and interconnected water and agricultural system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe expectation in the community is that that mine will be bought out too.\u201d</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t just the locals and mining opponents who were not fully on board with Baird\u2019s language. BHP denied that any of its mine was actually going to occur under the fertile black soils.</p> <p>\u201cWe carried out extensive planning to ensure there would be no mining under the black soil plains, consistent with the conditions contained in our exploration licence,\u201d BHP Australia\u2019s president, Mike Henry, <a href=\"http://www.bhpbilliton.com/investors/news/bhp-billiton-to-cease-progression-of-caroona-coal-project\">said</a>. They \u201caccept the government\u2019s decision\u201d but insist the the mine could have proceeded sustainably.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/18/doubt-cast-on-future-of-shenhuas-1bn-watermark-coalmine-in-nsw\">Doubts over future of Shenhua's $1.2bn Watermark coalmine in NSW \u2013 reports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And for the Shenhua mine, despite categorical community opposition to mining anywhere on the Liverpool Plains, a spokesman for Baird told the Guardian the negotiations with Shenhua were focused only on excising those areas of the title that are on the strategic agricultural land.</p> <p>Shenhua was not willing to comment. But commentators <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/business/mining/coal/bhp-billiton-sells-coal-license-in-liverpool-plains-back-to-nsw-for-220-million-20160811-gqqi0a?login_token=xF2hJvyswDtaUSuEskHwKgXvtEbOkv8vti7QSoZxB90vgMtJT2xeVke1mW28pAb7xC4uSUg7X5JfVt3yIKmKCQ&amp;expiry=1470961273&amp;single_use_token=0HSv2KoYud6pN-LFlCrS87BFXz4pCsvN6vWJpzgNQRBLleo6MyxfPu4VmMS5yYeh1whI7j-lFVCjCfabYSYLZQ\">have speculated</a> the mine could not go ahead without encroaching on the black soils of the region. And now with the Caroona mine gone, it will not be able to share any infrastructure, and all the community\u2019s energy will be focused squarely on them.</p> <p>The state government has been walking a thin line between <a href=\"http://www.nswmining.com.au/menu/media/news/2015-(1)/april/premier%E2%80%99s-visit-to-hunter-mining-communities-welco\">supporting a declining coal industry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/mike-baird-changes-tack-on-coal-as-nsw-starts-to-prepare-for-industrys-decline-20160119-gm9ll4.html\">recognising the need for a transition</a>. And the hedged language could be a way of managing that manoeuvre \u2013 moving to end coalmining in the Liverpool Plains while saying it is doing something slightly more limited.</p> <p>Unusually, neither the Minerals Council of Australia nor the NSW Minerals Council were willing to comment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter between the government and a private company,\u201d a spokesman for the NSW Minerals Council said.</p> <p>A financial analyst, Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics &amp; Financial Analysis, said both projects are commercially unviable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think BHP has taken the NSW government and taxpayers for a ride demanding $220m compensation</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Buckley, financial analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo me they are clear stranded assets,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think BHP has taken the NSW government and taxpayers for a ride demanding $220m compensation.\u201d</p> <p>Buckley said it also meant the government had shown its hand to Shenhua, before it had a chance to close negotiations with it, having paid out 1.8 times what BHP paid for its licence. If it followed the same path with Shenhua, it would be up for more than half a billion dollars.</p> <p>\u201cShenhua has spent the last 18 months closing coalmines in China to reduce Chinese oversupply,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely Shenhua will turn around and invest over $1bn to build yet more greenfield capacity when they have excess coal coming out their ears and Chinese national coal demand is down over 5% this year after a 4% decline last year and a 3% decline the year before.</p> <p>\u201cChina passed peak coal in 2013 and as the largest coalminer in China, Shenhua totally understands this.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham said the government needed to confront the reality of a declining industry. \u201cThe NSW government have today woken up to the reality that new coalmines are unviable and the Greens are calling on Mike Baird to commit to a transition plan away from coal,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And while the Liverpool Plains might be the first place in NSW to see coalmining stopped, the Greens are pushing to see it spread around the state.</p> <p>\u201cThe next step must be the cancellation of the neighbouring Shenhua Watermark mine which continues to threaten the Liverpool Plains, as well as KEPCO\u2019s Bylong project and Hume Coal\u2019s Berrima proposal.\u201d</p> <p>Duddy said the writing was on the wall for Shenhua, and that the focus on one type of soil could just be a way for the government to minimise the amount of money it will have to pay the company to pull out.</p> <p>\u201cIt may come to a point where they\u2019ll say \u2018Well the mine is no longer viable\u2019 and they can gracefully back out of it,\u201d he said.</p>",

Their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://smudgeeats.com.au/recipe/green-breaky-bowl/\">\u201cgreen brekky bowl\u201d</a> is an Instagram favourite among people who use the \u201c#cleaneating\u201d hashtag. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Van Vuuren and Boshier look like the hipsters but different \u2013 certainly more \u201cnormcore\u201d than their characters\u2019 special t-shirt range, the Double V, two \u201cv\u201d collars cut into a shirt, would suggest.</p> <p>\u201cYour eyes are amazing!\u201d Van Vuuren tells me immediately, possibly or possibly not in character.</p> <p>\u201cOh wow. So many great colours \u2013 amber and \u2026 \u201d says Boshier, leaning closer with something approaching awe.</p> <p>\u201cGreen \u2013 and ringed with \u2026.something \u2013 what is it?\u201d asks Van Vuuren.</p> <p>\u201cWow \u2013 yeah really great. I love your eyes!\u201d</p> <p>We get a table and order. I get a plate of $20 mushrooms. Boshier gets some sort of gigantic roasted root vegetable and a piccolo. Van Vuuren gets a beer from one of the more obscure Brooklyn boroughs and a kombucha (weird fermented Chinese drink). I get a green juice and a glass of wine.</p> <p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Van Vuuren is talking to the waiter. \u201cYour eyes are so great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re amazing,\u201d says Boshier.</p> <p>The waiter is flattered. \u201cOh thanks man, one is slightly different from the other \u2013 chromosome thing, mum and dad\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOmg \u2013 that\u2019s so great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, they are beautiful man.\u201d</p> <p>The waiter is still talking about his chromosomes. Boshier and Van Vuuren are gazing at him adoringly.</p> <h2>TB to TV</h2> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The story of the Bondi Hipsters began when Van Vuuren had become seriously ill in South America with TB and returned to Australia. His weight had dropped so low \u201call my friends were calling me the Machinist because I was like Christian Bale. Skin on bone.\u201d He spent six months in quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cI was taking a lot of drugs and the environment was pretty bleak but my results started vastly improving when I accepted I was sick and owned it. At my low point \u2013 I was just looking down the corridor at all these sick people and I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not in the right place\u2019 and one day I looked at myself in the mirror \u2013 pale with long hair, dark eyes and a Jesus beard and and I thought, \u2018no, I was a patient and I was sick.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBecause I sat in a hospital room for six months in the CBD \u2013 my window looked out at the city and I was watching people going to and from their work \u2013 looking depressed, fucking hating their lives. From my cynical view point I thought \u2013 you know \u2013 I don\u2019t really love my job [in advertising]. I\u2019m just walking around and holy shit, I\u2019m 27 years old \u2013 how much time have I spent working doing stuff I don\u2019t enjoy?\u201d</p> <p>The six months \u201cliterally reset my whole life\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In quarantine he and his brother made videos under the moniker Fully Sick Rapper, that went viral. Out of quarantine Boshier and Van Vuuren metat a YouTube conference in 2011 after each had been working on his own web series. Boshier, a former music manager had been trying to make it as an actor in LA, living on $1.50 a day and surviving off bags of peanuts from the nearby Mexican grocer. With Connor Van Vuuren they created the characters Dom and Adrian. </p> <p>Even though the team have created new and interesting characters for the ABC series, the hipsters endure \u2013 kinda like hipsterdom itself. Boshier says, \u201cThe reason why they endure is their central thing revolves around being cool and trying to stay cool and now. And anytime a thing is a thing or before a thing is a thing, we can weave that into their story.\u201d</p> <p>The Van Vuurens and Boshier pick up storylines just by being attuned to what\u2019s going on around them, and what they\u2019re seeing in the Facebook news feeds.<br></p> <p>Says Van Vuuren: \u201cIn this season we involve Vipassana in the story and to me it\u2019s one of those things where you have one friend who says: \u2018I did Vipassana, it\u2019s a silent mediation retreat\u2019. And then you have more and more friends doing it. And then you think it\u2019s funny people go away for 10 days for silence and self reflection and then not shut the fuck up about it.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The waiter with the \u201cbeautiful eyes\u201d comes over.<br></p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m still going on my beer, my juice is sick, the food is beautiful,\u201d says Van Vuuren.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a double piccolo this time \u2013 scale it up a bit,\u201d says Boshier. He hasn\u2019t been sleeping because he has a crying baby in the upstairs flat. </p> <p>The pair live around the Bondi beach area and say that the show wouldn\u2019t have had the same impact if the brand of Bondi wasn\u2019t attached to the project.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we first started creating the show, it was just called Hipsters,\u201d says Van Vuuren. \u201cI went to a conference and met one of the guys from Bondi Rescue \u2013 and he said as soon as he attached Bondi as a location to it \u2013 it just gave it wind and legs and got it into other markets.\u201d</p> <p>Could it have been the Manly Hipsters?<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s a tad obnoxious about Bondi,\u201d says Boshier. \u201cYou either live here and know the obnoxiousness or you don\u2019t live here and it\u2019s like: \u2018Eugh \u2013 Bondi.\u2019 People are so beautiful here.\u201d<br></p> <p>Van Vuuren interrupts \u201c \u2026 and sad. There is a sense of sadness here \u2026 it\u2019s no easier to like yourself when you have an epic rig \u2013 your rig does not make you any more satisfied. If anything most people you meet who are extremely beautiful are really insecure. There is also literal pressure to be hot because of social media. Look at those beautiful yoga girls running Instagram pages \u2013 even the pressure of taking three photos a day holding fucking body butter is enough to cave.\u201d<br></p> <p>There is a lot to satirise in this small corner of Sydney.<br></p> <p> \u201cEveryone has to do seven side projects,\u201d says Van Vuuren. \u201cWhen everyone else at the bar or caf\u00e9 is saying: \u2018I\u2019m so fucking busy and I\u2019m starting my own green juice company and we\u2019re selling out shirts at the market and I have a coffee van and I\u2019m starting a music festival.\u2019 It makes you think you should be busier. It\u2019s this fabricated urgency.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But Van Vuuren and Boshier have made it according to the very value system they satirise. They have a second series of a successful TV show, they do commercial work \u2013 but ironically without selling out, they are busy, and due to the crying baby, Boshier is on his yoga matt most days by 6am.<br></p> <p>They are killing it, the Bondi way.<br></p> <p><em>Soul Mates II airs Wednesday night on ABC2 at 9:30pm.
