  "<p>The huge disparity in youth unemployment rates across the UK has been laid bare by a new report that found over a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds in Bradford, Middlesbrough, Swansea and Wolverhampton are now unemployed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Issues/Business-environment/Financial-markets-and-economy/Youth-unemployment-in-the-UK\">The study</a> commissioned by the accountancy firm EY found youth unemployment rates range from 18.3% in north-east England to 11.2% in the east of England. Coventry had one of the lowest youth unemployment rates out of the 48 UK cities reviewed, at just 8.2%. </p> <p>The study found youth unemployment rates vary far more around the country than overall rates of employment. </p> <p>Young people find it significantly harder to find work than their older peers in the east Midlands, where Leicester\u2019s 23.6% youth unemployment rate was more than double the average for all workers. </p> <p>Youth employment levels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure\">declined</a> by 166,000 from 2004 to 2015, the report found, with the biggest fall \u2013 28% \u2013 seen in the manufacturing sector over the same period. In the last decade, the construction, financial and business sectors have also reduced their employment of young people \u2013 those aged under 24.<br></p> <p>The two sectors that currently employ the highest proportions of young people \u2013 hotels and restaurants \u2013 are still set to grow, researchers concluded. It forecasts that between 2015 and 2030 the UK\u2019s employment in these areas will grow by an average of 0.4% a year, meaning more roles.</p> <p>Mark Gregory, EY\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cYouth unemployment rates have fallen from the peaks we saw during the recession, when 40% of the UK\u2019s 16- to 17-year-olds were facing unemployment. However, a stubbornly high number of young people remain excluded from the labour market, which could be further exacerbated by a period of weaker economic growth in these uncertain times ahead. History has shown us that young people are more exposed to economic volatility and industry restructuring than the population as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>He said the skills agenda is fast becoming one of the biggest priorities for UK business, with Brexit also likely to impose some restrictions to the free movement of labour in the future. </p> <p>\u201cIt has never been more important to ensure the UK has the right mix of skills and talent, both nationally and locally, and young people are core to this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While youth unemployment in the UK compares relatively well with that in most other countries in Europe, the UK rate is almost double that in Germany. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/youth-unemployment+world/europe-news\">Youth unemployment rates seen in France, Italy and Spain reach almost 50%. </a></p> <p>Maryanne Matthews, chief executive of EY Foundation, an independent UK charity set up to help young people who face barriers in the labour market, said: \u201cIt is imperative that UK employers open their doors to invest in developing the skills of young people. By offering paid work experience opportunities to young people, this could lead to jobs in the future, reduce unemployment rates and help to address the UK skills gap. The more that employers play an active role in developing young people, the more we can help every young person to have better working prospects now and in the future.\u201d</p> <h2>Young people\u2019s debts</h2> <p>Young people are building up debt and worrying about money in their first few years of adult life, but far too few are seeking advice when they fall behind, according to research by National Debtline, which is run by the Money Advice Trust.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s report, Borrowed Years, reveals that 18- to 24-year-olds are building up significant debts at a relatively early age and suffering widespread money worries, despite most trying to budget and actively manage their personal finances. It found that 37% are already in debt, owing an average of just under \u00a33,000 which excludes any student loans or mortgages. Over half of adults under 25 report that they regularly worry about money, with 21% admitting they lose sleep as a result.</p>",

  "<p>When we hear talk about taxation, it is naturally assumed to refer to those taxes which are levied by the government. After all, no individual or business can charge anyone else a tax, right?</p> <p>From the 1980s onwards in the neoliberal era, there has been an effort by policymakers globally, including Australia, to reduce both the total public tax take and marginal tax rates. The standard arguments revolve around promoting economic growth and investment, and reducing disincentives to work.</p> <p>The debate in Australia is curious given what is not discussed: private taxes. These are sanctioned by government policy (implicitly or explicitly) and levied by market participants upon others. Private taxes come in three forms: intellectual property rights (IPRs), rising asset prices and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative\">negative externalities</a>. Unlike public taxes, they are not labelled as taxes, even though they have the same economic welfare effects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/29/scott-morrisons-car-crash-logic-and-the-real-story-behind-the-taxed-nots\">Scott Morrison's car-crash logic and the real story behind the 'taxed-nots' | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The monopolistic pricing of IPRs acts as a very narrowly-based consumption tax with higher deadweight losses than general consumption taxes (a bad GST/VAT). One of the ironies of the modern economy is that while neoliberal policy has reduced tariffs to minimal levels, it has strengthened IPRs which often results in \u201ctax like\u201d mark-ups into the thousands of per cent above marginal cost.</p> <p>Today, IPRs saturate every corner of modern economies, reaping monopolistic profits. A major element of so-called free trade agreements, for instance the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_intellectual_property_provisions\">TPP</a>, will act to enforce these highly protectionist measures worldwide.</p> <p>Rising asset prices, especially those that inflate well above economic fundamentals, impose a form of private tax on new buyers. In Australia, the obvious example is that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/how-australian-households-became-the-most-indebted-in-the-world\">housing prices</a>, which have ballooned over the last two decades. First home buyers must fork out an increasing amount of household income to service mortgages and expenses or miss out, which has the same effect as if homes had simply been taxed.</p> <p>If appropriate housing-related policies pertaining to debt, tax and planning had been implemented, the housing price inflation may have been avoided, hence keeping purchase costs down. Germany is a rare example of this in the OECD.</p> <p>Negative externalities result from economic activity which imposes costs onto third parties which they cannot avoid; again like a tax. These effects are widespread and becoming more obvious, especially given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a>, poisoning of the oceans, resource depletion, pollution, and widespread financial sector meltdowns.</p> <p>One study placed<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Bottom-Line-Corporations-People/dp/1881052753\"> uncorrected negative externalities</a> at 34% of US GDP in 1994. A more <a href=\"http://www.trucost.com/_uploads/publishedResearch/TEEB%20Final%20Report%20-%20web%20SPv2.pdf\">recent estimate</a> is a whopping $US7.3tn or 13% of global GDP in 2009. A <a href=\"http://www.biofuels.coop/archive/realpricegas.pdf\">1998 report</a> demonstrated the total social cost of a gallon of gas was between $US5.60 and $US15.14, rather than the then market price of $US1. Many industries would not be viable if not for <a href=\"https://c4ss.org/content/44957\">externalising costs</a>; industry profits are often <a href=\"http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/15975-how-big-business-robs-us-with-externalities\">maintained by this perverse dynamic</a>.</p> <p>Former prime minister, Tony Abbott, had denounced the Labor government\u2019s carbon tax as a \u201cgreat big tax on everything\u201d. This is false. Carbon emissions result in pollution and climate change; enormous negative externalities imposed upon individuals and the environment. The effect of the carbon tax was to convert a portion of the already existing inefficient private tax into an efficient public tax; hence it was not a new tax.</p> <p>While progressive parties such as the Greens are typically associated with advocating high public taxes, they could be potentially imposing the lowest total tax take given their economic policies, some of which reduce private taxes. For instance, they seek to <a href=\"http://greens.org.au/policies/climate-change-energy\">mitigate negative externalities</a> by taking action on pollution and climate change, lower land prices via modifying housing <a href=\"http://greens.org.au/housing\">tax expenditures</a> and <a href=\"http://greens.org.au/policies/science-technology\">limit the concentration</a> of IPRs.</p> <p>In contrast, the neoliberal Liberal National party is openly hostile to policies which reduce private taxation. They oppose measures to deal with climate change, to lower dwelling prices or to mitigate the growing monopolisation inherent in IPRs.</p> <p>Although the wealthiest households and businesses pay the majority of public taxes, they are also the largest recipients of private taxes. While national accounts often provide estimates of public taxes down to the dollar, this is unfortunately not the case with private taxes. This grey area is a gift to its beneficiaries. Given the sum of public and private taxes, it is possible the wealthy pay no net tax while the middle class and poor face significant net tax burdens as a result of the widespread imposition of private taxes.</p> <p>When neoliberal proponents promote support for lower taxes, they only ever refer to public, not private, taxes. Neoliberals have misled the public into supporting the reduction of public taxes while massively increasing private taxation in its three forms by stealth, without nominating it as taxation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/a-piece-of-string-a-banana-and-a-cassowary-walk-into-scott-morrisons-bar\">A piece of string, a banana, and a cassowary walk into Scott Morrison's bar | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Australia, the greatest economic threats to our welfare come from climate change and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/banks-have-treated-our-housing-market-like-a-ponzi-scheme-and-its-about-to-bust\">housing bubble</a>; direct consequences of allowing runaway private taxation. Nationwide, aggregate private taxation could well measure into the several hundreds of billions of dollars given the suggestions from the aforementioned reports on external costs, revenue from IPR-dependent industries and inflating land prices.</p> <p>Solutions are readily available to us; the trick is to convert inefficient private taxes into efficient public taxes. Doing so would allow for the removal of many inefficient public taxes which penalise competitive, productive labour and enterprise. The Ken Henry Tax Review <a href=\"http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/Paper.aspx?doc=html/publications/papers/report/section_2-03.htm\">estimated</a> Australia has 419 tax and tax-like fees!</p> <p>Inflating asset prices can be reduced via hefty capital gains, land value and Tobin taxes while extensive \u201cPigovian taxes\u201d mitigate negative externalities. For IPRs, there has been much discussion in recent years into alternative mechanisms for funding R&amp;D and creative arts without resorting to monopolistic pricing.</p> <p>The neoliberal tax agenda should be exposed for what it really advocates: big, regressive and inefficient private taxes that benefit the wealthy to the detriment of the public. Whenever calls are issued for reducing taxes, typically from the corporate sector and ideologically-aligned think tanks, we should agree \u2013 but with a twist \u2013 reducing and removing inefficient and regressive private taxes should be at the top of the agenda.</p>",

The problem is that people are easily fooled by fake news too, and a plethora of tricky-to-distinguish fake news sites have emerged. Facebook\u2019s hoax detection system relies on user-submitted notifications that a link is fishy; if users don\u2019t spot a story is a dud, neither does Facebook. </p> <p>This problem becomes more pernicious as it leaks out into the real world.

The value of the project dropped because the price it gets for the exported gas is tied to the price of crude oil, which has dropped.</p> <p>But according to an analysis by the pro-renewables financial activist group Market Forces, that write-down of its assets relied on an optimistic prediction for how the oil price will change, with Santos\u2019s projections significantly higher than those of competitors Woodside and Beach Energy, brokers such as Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, as well as analysts at the World Bank.</p> <p>According to Santos\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.santos.com/media/3400/160819_half-year_report_incorporating_appendix_4d.pdf\">explanation of how</a> its asset\u2019s value is tied to oil prices, if it had used Goldman Sachs\u2019 projected oil prices rather than its own optimistic ones, the value of its assets would be US$3.5bn less in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/australian-gas-40-cheaper-japan-than-australia-despite-export-costs\">Australian gas 40% cheaper in Japan than in Australia despite export costs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alternatively, if it followed the World Bank\u2019s forecast to 2020, its assets would take more than a US$2bn hit that year.</p> <p>Even its peers in the market, Woodside Petroleum and Beach Energy, projected oil prices to 2021 that would result in Santos\u2019s assets taking more than a US$1bn write-down most years.</p> <p>Santos\u2019s write-downs have led some <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/business/energy/oil/santos-takes-us15b-writedown-on-value-of-glng-project-20160814-gqsg6g\">analysts to speculate</a> that parts of the brand-new facility would be mothballed within a year or two.</p> <p>The latest company update from Goldman Sachs on Santos recommended investors sell their stock in the company, noting long-term expectations for the price of oil.</p> <p>Santos declined Guardian Australia\u2019s request to comment on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt just seems fanciful,\u201d said Daniel Gocher from Market Forces, who prepared the analysis. \u201cThey\u2019re a good $5 to $15 above the median forecast price per barrel. </p> <p>\u201cThe comparison is pretty representative \u2013 we\u2019ve got the brokers in there, and the World Bank, who you\u2019d think would be rather conservative.

When the company declared its recent write-down, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said if oil prices stayed low, Santos could start selling its assets to meet its debt obligations.</p> <p>Bruce Robertson from the pro-renewables financial analysis group, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said if Santos did declare a multibillion-dollar write-down, it \u201cwould be in all sorts of trouble\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn my opinion it would make financing of the business very problematic,\u201d Robertson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/if-energy-ministers-bow-to-gas-industry-theyll-be-deciding-in-the-dark\">If energy ministers bow to gas industry they'll be deciding in the dark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the large discrepancy in forecasts showed Australia needed consistent reporting of the value of gas reserves and resources, as in the US.</p> <p>The inconsistent reporting made it hard for investors to judge the value of a company, he said, but it also made it hard for policymakers to judge how large the country\u2019s available reserves were. \u201cThere\u2019s no transparency or consistency.

So on Sunday, my friends and I went to hear The Suffers, for no other reason than we thought the lead singer, Kam Franklin, looked cool. She was one Afroed black woman among an ensemble of mostly white men, singing her heart out. The jumbotron showed us what our mere eyes could not: she and all her bandmates wore T-shirts that read Eleanor &amp; Tarika &amp; Aiyana &amp; Rekia &amp; Miriam &amp; Renisha\u2026 all names of black <em tabindex=\"-1\">women</em> killed by the police, women whose stories, and sometimes whose names, we don\u2019t know. It was a small, powerful gesture, as was what she asked us to do before she performed their hit Make Some Room \u2013 hug the person we came with, and tell them <em tabindex=\"-1\">thank you</em>. And if we came by ourselves, find another solo person and hug and thank them. With just these two small moves, Franklin nicked open what is possible at Afropunk \u2013 the opportunity to connect with and influence people with your words and presence.</p> <p> In addition to The Suffers\u2019 T-shirts, I found myself inspired by all the things festivalgoers wore. I thought I was cool, but I had no idea where people had gotten T-shirts that said \u201cBlack Girls Got the Juice\u201d and \u201cBlack Girls + Magic = Very Real\u201d and the Afropunk sign with its rules of acceptance (No Sexism. No Racism. No Ableism., etc) to include No Donald Trump.</p> <p> The festival organizers did their part by making it clear that there were no male- or female-designated bathrooms. Above the rows of port-a-potties read this sign: \u201cThis bathroom has been liberated from the gender binary.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/25/afropunk-2016-family-reunion\">Afropunk 2016: 'It always felt like a family reunion to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> If you live in New York, Brooklyn in particular, you can find a way to always be immersed in a forward-thinking, cultural experience; you can see bathrooms, or any number of things, that have been liberated from all the binaries on Earth. But many people who attend the festival come from elsewhere; and this sign, unromantic as it was hanging above plastic toilet stalls, was another one of those small gestures to welcome the many individuals who don\u2019t fit in to just one stall, or just one life.</p> <p> Or, as Janelle Mon\u00e1e called from the stage Sunday night, this was for the \u201coutcasts, the misfits, the weirdos\u201d. After her set, during which she performed her own hits, as well as Prince\u2019s Let\u2019s Go Crazy, I wound up talking to a friend from college who, despite having gone to our historically black institution and living in nearby Jersey City, still needed all-black spaces like this one in order to just <em>be</em>. To be weird and different, whatever that might mean, inside or outside of the park gates.</p> <p> Across the wide swath of performers, one common element was the influence of original black American music. Both Mon\u00e1e and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Roman GianArthur performed James Brown songs, complete with the simple, clean choreography that\u2019s so ingrained into black showmanship. At the Bad Brains-Living Color-Fishbone \u201cPowerjam\u201d on Sunday night, George Clinton, perhaps the godfather of weird, and the natural link between Brown\u2019s funk and Bad Brains\u2019s and co\u2019s punk, performed again \u2013 age 75, and about to release a new album on fellow festival performer Flying Lotus\u2019s Brainfeeder label.</p> <p> Closing out the festival was none other than Ice Cube, perhaps the least punk headliner in recent memory. \u201cI\u2019m a b-boy,\u201d he said. \u201cAin\u2019t no band up here.\u201d Just him, a DJ, and soon after, NWA members DJ Yella and MC Ren. That was Cube being <em>his</em> weird and different self, in a space where drums and guitar were the law of the land. He assured us he wasn\u2019t just a dude in kids movies, and that he\u2019d never left hip-hop. And then he crip-walked.</p>",
  "<p>The phone in your pocket gives you powers that were hard to imagine even five years ago. It can talk to you, listen, and give sensible answers to questions. It knows your fingerprint and recognises your face and those of all your friends. It can buy almost anything, sell almost anything, bring you all the news you want, as well as almost all the books, films and music you might want to look at. What\u2019s more, it will even allow you to&#xa0;talk to your friends and to communicate with almost anyone.</p> <p>The problem is that these powers are not yours \u2013 at least they don\u2019t belong to you alone. They belong to whoever controls the phone and can be used to serve their purposes as well as yours. Repressive governments and criminal gangs are all contending to break into phones today, and this kind of hacking will increasingly become the preferred route into all of the computer networks that we use \u2013 the&#xa0;ones we don\u2019t call \u201cphones\u201d.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/apple-ios-update-arab-activists-iphone-spyware\" title=\"\">sudden forced upgrade</a> to the iPhone operating system last week was a response to these anxieties. A dissident in the UAE appears to have had his iPhone hijacked by a very sophisticated piece of malware produced by a security company and sold legally, if in secret, to regimes that want to spy on their enemies. This offers its controllers complete knowledge of anything the infected phone is privy to: that\u2019s all the contacts, all the messages of any sort, whether chats, texts or emails, all the calendars and even, potentially, any voice conversation that it overhears. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a more assiduous or intimate spy. And once one phone has been subverted, it becomes a tool for spying into all other the networks to which it or the owner has access.</p> <p>This is not exclusively Apple\u2019s problem. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/google-stagefright-megabug-patch-nexus-phones-samsung-android\" title=\"\">much more widespread Android system</a> is reasonably secure only on some Samsung and LG models and Google\u2019s own-branded Nexus phones, which are updated frequently and automatically to keep abreast of security vulnerabilities. Other manufacturers have access to the updates but few get them installed in a timely fashion. In the poorer parts of the world, where Android has an overwhelming market share, the problem is&#xa0;especially acute. The Iranian secret police bug their dissidents using a tool (in the jargon of the trade, an Android RAT) called <a href=\"http://blog.rigotechnology.com/2016/08/25/increased-use-of-android-malware-targeting-journalist/\" title=\"\">KrakenAgent</a>.</p> <p>Beyond rogue nation states there is an unpleasant and insufficiently regulated market of legal firms that specialise in finding security vulnerabilities and selling them to the highest legal bidder, which normally means oppressive regimes; then there is a second tier of entirely illegal operators who sell tools to criminal gangs. Little of this is used for spying (though there is a market among jealous and abusive men for software that will enable to them to track their partners, one reason why some women\u2019s shelters are reluctant to allow smartphones inside). Much more damage is done by \u201cransomware\u201d, which encrypts and in effect steals all of a user\u2019s data, to be released only on payment. Such assaults are becoming increasingly common.

  "<p>Theresa May is being urged to consider reviving the principle of social insurance to help struggling low-paid workers, as she prepares to flesh out her vision of \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-conservative-immigration-human-rights-education\">What does Britain's next prime minister Theresa May believe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister, who will hold the first cabinet meeting since the summer break at Chequers this week, is keen to show that social reform and tackling \u201cburning injustice\u201d remain a priority, despite the urgent need to clarify what the new government hopes to achieve from Brexit. </p> <p>May is under pressure, not least from her own back benches, to give a clearer signal as to what kind of deal her government hopes to negotiate with the other EU member-states as the government moves to implement the voters\u2019 decision to leave the European club.</p> <p>Ministers appear to have taken distinct stances on the best deal Britain can hope to strike with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, stressing the importance of retaining access to the single market, including for financial services firms, while Brexiters Liam Fox and David Davis, both of whom will have key roles in the negotiation process, are thought to prefer a go-it-alone approach.</p> <p>Another knotty issue in May\u2019s back-to-work inbox is Hinkley Point C, the nuclear reactor due to be built by state-owned French firm EDF with Chinese backing, in a complex deal signed by Osborne.</p> <p>The prime minister has launched an inquiry into the project before giving it the go-ahead, amid concerns about security and value for money. But the Chinese ambassador has warned that a decision to cancel it could affect diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p> <p>The new business and energy minister, Greg Clark, is also known to be keen to scrutinise the details of the deal and one potential option is to try to separate agreement on Hinkley from a second reactor, at Bradwell in Essex, that China hopes to build. A decision on Hinkley is expected in September.</p> <p>May will visit China next weekend for her first major international summit \u2013 a G20 leaders\u2019 meeting in Hangzhou, in the east of the country, where she is expected to hold her first face-to-face meetings with Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Her fellow leaders are likely to urge her to push ahead with the Brexit process, to minimise the risk that a prolonged period of uncertainty saps economic confidence.

  "<p>After five years of conflict in Syria, the figures speak for themselves. More than 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed \u2013 and another 11 million displaced from their homes.

The government was then given permission to remove references to sieges and violence as a reason for displacement. </p> <p>UN insiders have told the Guardian the negotiation process between the UN and the Syrian government for the 2017 plan has begun, but they do not expect a significant change in the process or outcome.</p> <p>In response to the Guardian, eight UN agencies explained in detail why they had to work with the Syrian government. They insisted they have rigorous compliance systems and say they only have to steer clear of people on UN sanctions lists \u2013 not those compiled by the EU and the US. </p> <p>However, no such sanctions exist for Syria. And privately some UN insiders admit they are reluctant to push back too hard against Assad for fear of being kicked out of the country completely; two years ago, the international NGO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/23/aid-group-mercy-corps-forced-to-close-damascus-operations-syria\">Mercy Corps left Damascus after threats from the government</a>.</p> <p>But in internal correspondence seen by the Guardian it is clear some UN staff have qualms about what is going on. And last year a letter from a number of Syrian medical practitioners raised concerns about the UN\u2019s impartiality. It was sent to the office of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in October 2015 and the same issues were reported to his <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sga1558.doc.htm\">High Level Panel on Global Health Crises</a>. As yet, little, if anything, has been done. One insider conceded the UN faced \u201cconstraints at every turn\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe alternative is stark,\u201d a spokesman for Unicef said. \u201cMany more children dying or suffering. This is the dilemma that Unicef and humanitarian agencies face on a daily basis. </p> <p>\u201cChildren in Syria are hurting because of the failure of politicians to reach a peaceful solution to the war. We cannot let them down. We must do everything to alleviate the suffering of children.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Government departments</strong></h2> <p>A number of ministries in Assad\u2019s government have been supported by UN agencies in recent years, even though they are all affected by the EU sanctions regime. UN departments report close working relationships with the Syrian ministries of education, health and justice as part of the humanitarian response. </p> <p><strong>Defence </strong>The World Health Organisation has spent $5,134,685 on blood bags and kits since the beginning of the conflict but, unusually, Syria\u2019s national blood bank, which is responsible for providing services for the total population, is operated by the Syrian Department of Defence, raising concerns about how the blood supplies are being distributed.</p> <p>WHO had concerns about the issue in 2013 when it drafted the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Syrian government.</p> <p>At the time, senior WHO insiders questioned the legality of working with the ministry of defence rather than a health administration, and admitted there were \u201cconcrete concerns\u201d about whether the blood supplies would reach those in need, or be directed to the military first. </p> <p>Documents seen by the Guardian show that blood supplies for one fiscal year were paid for by donations from America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us\">Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) </a>and Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development\">Department for International Development (DfID)</a> \u2013 and both countries have imposed economic sanctions against the Syrian government.<br></p> <p>Early in the conflict, medical centres calling for blood supplies found themselves and their patients under increased scrutiny by Syrian security services, and in some cases requests for supplies led to the arrest of those protesting or fighting against the government. </p> <p>Blood bags and testing kits are not included on UN aid convoys from Damascus to areas outside of government control.</p> <p><strong>Agriculture </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/home/en/\">UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)</a> has bought $10,875,167 worth of seeds from the general organisation for seed multiplication (GOSM) in the past three years (2013-15), and another $2,396,782 from the general organisation for fodder (GFO).</p> <p>Both organisations are run by the Syrian government\u2019s ministry of agriculture, which is on the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012D0634\">EU sanctions list</a>. The FAO says it has to buy this material in order to deliver humanitarian assistance, and that importing \u201cthe required quantities of seed or feed into Syria from elsewhere would not be feasible or cost-effective\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9b9a636cf0c1ab7a8f6f5c8c8c5e3dcfedb5689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9b9a636cf0c1ab7a8f6f5c8c8c5e3dcfedb5689/0_97_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian officials inspect boxes of apples from the Red Cross at the Syrian-Israeli border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian officials inspect boxes of apples from the Red Cross at the Syrian-Israeli border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Al-Hariri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fuel </strong>UN agencies have also bought at least $4m of fuel from the state-owned company, <a href=\"https://www.unsceb.org/CEBPublicFiles/Procurement%20Network/Public%20Document/ASR_2004.pdf\">Sadcop/Mahroukat</a>, which is also subject to sanctions. The UN argues it \u201cneeds fuel to operate its programmes in Syria\u201d. It says Sadcop/Mahroukat is the sole provider in Syria of the gasoline coupons that are used to purchase fuel safely and securely.</p> <p><strong>Tourism </strong>Syria\u2019s ministry of tourism seems also to have benefited from the UN\u2019s use of the <a href=\"http://www.fourseasons.com/damascus/\">Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus</a>, which has been the central base for the relief mission since 2013. The ministry is understood to have a 35% stake in the hotel, so will probably have been paid more than $3m in the last two years. UN agencies spent $9,296,325.59 at the hotel in 2014-15.</p> <p>The UNHCR appears to have been its biggest customer.

Those could include control over all territorial fisheries, agriculture and social rights, as well as the European convention on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights\">human rights</a> and EU academic programmes such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/23/erasmus-scheme-exclude-british-students-brexit\">Erasmus</a>. At the same time, a UK-wide constitutional convention was needed to investigate new structures, including a UK senate for the nations and English regions.</p> <p>His speech deliberately echoes similar remarks by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/kezia-dugdale\">Kezia Dugdale</a>, the Scottish Labour leader, over the weekend, when she told the Sunday Post there was an obvious case for Holyrood to have full control over international fisheries and agriculture after a Brexit, strengthening its devolved powers in both areas. </p> <p>In extracts released before his speech, Brown said those reforms would require the carefully constructed deal by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/27/scottish-devolution-smith-commission-key-points\">Smith commission</a> to give Holyrood extra tax and policy powers after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2014/sep/18/-sp-scottish-independence-referendum-results-in-full\">2014 independence referendum</a> would also need to be ripped up. </p> <p>Brown couched these proposals as the most sophisticated alternative to two entirely competing stances: the unchanging support for the union of the Tories, and the quest for Scottish independence, which first minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to rekindle later this week. \u201cWe enter autumn with two entrenched positions which are polar opposites: the UK government wants Scotland in Britain but not in Europe and the Scottish government wants Scotland in Europe but not in Britain,\u201d Brown\u2019s statement said.</p> <p>New circumstances require a constitutional breakthrough that transcends the sterile standoff between a non-change conservative unionism and an unreconstructed nationalism, both of which would cause Scottish unemployment to rise, he said. \u201cNow is the time for fresh thinking and not a replay of the tired old arguments and slogans. [I] believe that we should examine a way forward that offers a more innovative constitutional settlement, more federal in its relationship with the UK than devolution or independence and more akin to home rule than separation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/boundary-changes-are-not-a-democratic-reform\">Boundary changes are not a democratic reform | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brown said that overhaul would also include the Treasury sending up to \u00a3750m more to Holyrood: his advisers estimate the EU programmes, including agricultural subsidies, academic grants and regional funds, are worth \u00a3750m in Scotland.

The villagers moved into tents and caves on their own farmland, but were evicted from there as well by the Israeli army in 1991. No reasons were given. They now live on another part of their farmland, sandwiched between a hostile Israeli settlement and one of its outposts.</p> <p>For several decades now, the villagers of Susiya have lived under the constant threat of becoming homeless once again. Mass demolition of their homes and forced evictions took place in 2001 and 2011. Israel claims it has no planning permits to build on the farmland, but at the same time makes it impossible for Palestinians to obtain permits.

These are among the most vulnerable people in Palestine. Most of them are Palestinian refugees, forced out of southern Israel following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p> <p>Israel wants much of this land in Palestine for its own settlements \u2013 which the international court of justice and the UN security council have repeatedly said are illegal. Not surprisingly, the communities are resisting their expulsion, knowing that without their land, they lose everything. But the Israeli authorities are fighting hard to remove them: the Bedouin are not permitted to build anything on this land \u2013 not a hut, school, kindergarten or health clinic \u2013 and are denied access to essential services such as electricity and water, on land they have inhabited for generations.</p> <p>Every week somewhere in the West Bank a family watches while their home is demolished by bulldozers. In 2016 there has been a dramatic rise in forced evictions across the West Bank.

We urged them to halt the plans to forcibly transfer these already vulnerable people \u2013 a serious violation of international law. Despite the seriousness of our concerns, we received inadequate responses and not only have the plans not been halted, the situation has worsened: demolitions of their structures have increased three-fold.</p> <p>The Bedouins and the villagers of Susiya have been let down by the international community in the past. Their rights to adequate housing and to non-discrimination have been systematically ignored.

The international community must recognise the grave human rights implications of Israel\u2019s plan to forcibly evict and transfer these communities.

If this is so, it will be the first time in the history of the planet that a living species will have impacted the environment in this way. The defining features of the anthropocene era would be an abnormally high level of CO2 in the atmosphere, and its corollary, rising sea levels. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much data,\u201d says Jan. \u201cIt occurred to me that one way I could respond to this complex load of information was to make a moving bar graph.\u201d</p> <p>During Art Basel, Jan was approached by a young Cuban immigrant who had recently arrived in the US. She was an aspiring actor working three jobs, one of them cleaning windows. \u201cShe identified with the performer in the chamber. She wanted to know if she was swimming in her own tears.\u201d He also felt compelled to intervene in a three-way argument between a group of children over whether the piece was about dreams, mermaids or death. \u201cThey were all right,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People feel this enormous anxiety about the water: that it keeps coming.

Or it never goes away.\u201d </p> <p>Spectators needn\u2019t feel too guilty. The water is kept at skin temperature and Saunders insists she loves the experience. \u201cWe do a lot of very long exhalations, so we can sink to the bottom of the tank. And that puts your body in a very zen state. So we\u2019re really blissed out in there.\u201d Being submerged for an extended period flips a primordial, water-mammalian switch, she says. \u201cFor the first 10 minutes, we just look like people in water, and then, around 10 minutes in, something just shifts.

  "<p>When Theresa May calls the cabinet to order on Wednesday morning, amid the chintz of Chequers, the roses will be past their best and the lawn covered with dew. After Britain\u2019s mad summer, the May administration will convene in Buckinghamshire finally to face the chill autumn reality: Britain voted for Brexit without a plan and the Europeans intend to shaft us.</p> <p>They may not have actually used the word \u201cshaft\u201d when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ventotene-summit-france-italy-germany-eu-brexit-vote\">they met on the Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi last week</a>, but German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi know they hold all the strongest cards. French civil servants are trained at the <em>grandes \u00e9coles</em>, like diplomatic special forces, to spot and ruthlessly attack the weakness of negotiating partners. And May\u2019s administration goes into this critical negotiating process with an obvious weakness. It does not know whether it wants to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to want \u201cpartial\u201d single market access, to keep the City\u2019s passporting arrangements into the eurozone. If, in order to get it, Britain has to soft-pedal on immigration controls, that would be no disaster for the Treasury, whose growth projections in this year\u2019s budget relied on the impact of a million EU migrants over the next five years.</p> <p>Brexit minister David Davis and international trade secretary Liam Fox are champing at the bit to begin the article 50 process \u2013 naturally they have drawn up rival timelines \u2013 but have so far failed to produce any kind of blueprint for their preferred outcome, which is to quit the single market and end free movement. This leaves May struggling to assert control over the process of even coming to a negotiating strategy \u2013 hence Wednesday\u2019s away day \u2013 and in severe danger of floundering once she has to deliver her Brexit plan to the other EU heads of government.</p> <p>It is a real, serious and material split in the government of a major country. And it is backed by rival forces in society. Those for whom Brexit became a religion in the spring of 2016 do not care about the niceties of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. They voted to leave all of it and to \u201ctake control\u201d of migration. But the economic elite of Britain, which has the strongest voice both in the Conservative high echelons and in the civil service, simply does not want Brexit. Above all it wants to maintain market access for the City, and for the major global service firms headquartered in London. For them, it is logical to hope that Europe stonewalls all May\u2019s requests for flexible market access, and that \u2013 by the end of the process, and with the economy suffering \u2013 the public will be ready to accept staying in the EU, with some minor variations on migration.</p> <p>Labour, too, is racked by the same dilemma. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/01/john-mcdonnell-brexit-will-end-free-movement-of-people\">John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d on Europe</a> do not, and cannot, include keeping free movement, but do include keeping the City\u2019s financial passport and single market \u201caccess\u201d. For Jeremy Corbyn the additional problem is that the European left wants Britain out of the EU pronto, before it can negotiate any dilution of the social chapter.</p> <p>Both main parties, then, are trapped between what is possible and what the British people voted for. Owen Smith may be wowing his rallies with talk of a second referendum, but the party leaderships are beginning to realise this will only be sorted out in parliament. It will be complex, messy and reputations will be minced. The only democratic way of doing it is to say \u2013 if necessary with May, Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon standing shoulder to shoulder somewhere symbolic \u2013 that Britain\u2019s aim is to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Until the delusion of the giant flounce-out is killed off \u2013 and until Liam Fox and David Davies are told to stop dreaming about it \u2013 those negotiating with Britain from the other side will have a massive incentive to force us into it. If they think it is our secret desire, or our plan B, for Britain to quit the single market cleanly, Europe will not take seriously any UK government demands for variations to single market rules, designed to keep us on the inside the market, though outside the EU itself.</p> <p>May should seek cabinet agreement for a baseline request: to remain as part of the EEA, with a humane, time-limited restriction on free movement as Britain\u2019s one demand, and then get on with it. She should make a statement to the commons that rules out leaving the single market. Any confusion that is allowed to fester over this will corrode her own authority as the Europeans sensibly deploy every trick in the book \u2013 a book going back to the era when <a href=\"http://www.hyperhistory.com/online_n2/people_n2/persons6_n2/metternich.html\">Prince Metternich</a> ran rings round Britain in post-Napoleonic Europe \u2013 to make her squirm.</p> <p>There will be uproar in Ukipland \u2013 but there always is. Not only is there no clear mandate for leaving the single market, but the negotiating positions of our major partners are now clear. They have not said \u201cgo ahead, pick and mix\u201d from the EU goodie-bag: they have said the single market plus free movement or get lost. The British negotiators\u2019 job is to prise that position apart \u2013 not rubberstamp it, which is what Fox, Davies and other hardcore Brexiters want.</p> <p>May wants to serve a full term. But both logic and principle dictate that were she to give in to the \u201cclean break\u201d brigade within the cabinet, she would have to schedule an election and fight for a mandate to lead Britain into this particularly stupid form of economic suicide. If so, whoever leads Labour should be salivating at the prospect. The Brexit moment caused many in the City to question the long-term direction of centre-right politics. By finessing May into power without a vote, and surrounding her with the grey men and women of provincial Toryism, the grandees of the party restored the impression that they could \u2013 just about \u2013 hold the line for the City, the big law firms, the service giants and big pharma.</p> <p>But if Tories want to go into an election promising to destroy 30 years of European financial integration in order to assuage the xenophobes and climate deniers of Ukip, that would be a different prospect.</p> <p>For the opposition parties, if they can recover their nerve, any confusion coming out of Wednesday\u2019s cabinet \u2013 still better any open revolt \u2013 will be a big opportunity. They should state, simply, that they will seek a vote in parliament to veto any Brexit strategy that tries to remove Britain from the single market. That principle \u2013 which needs no further elaboration since these are opposition parties, not a parallel government \u2013 could become the rock upon which Theresa May\u2019s soaraway ratings are broken, and her majority ground down.</p>",

  "<p>On Christmas Eve 1968, the Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders took a photograph of the view outside the window as his spaceship orbited the moon. The now iconic Earthrise image shows our half-moon blue planet under a decoration of clouds rising from the blackness of space over the lunar surface.</p> <p>The picture encapsulated Earth\u2019s precariousness in the cosmos and, for many, contained a message of humility and stewardship for our home.</p> <p>We\u2019ve had Earthrise and images like it from the Apollo missions for half a century now. But suppose some aliens had been viewing our planet for its entire 4.5bn-year history. What would they have seen?</p> <p>Over nearly all that immense time, changes would have been very gradual: continents drifted; the ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct during a succession of geological eras.</p> <p>But visible change has accelerated rapidly in the past few thousand years \u2013 a tiny sliver of the Earth\u2019s history. Now geologists have decided those changes have been so profound, so global and so permanent that our catalogue of the Earth\u2019s history needs to change accordingly. Since the last ice age, around 11,000 years ago, human civilisation has flourished in the climatically benign Holocene. Now they believe that epoch has come to an end and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">we have entered a new human-influenced age, the Anthropocene</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The changes that our aliens could observe from space are not hard to spot. In just the last few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. These human-induced changes signalled the start of agriculture. </p> <p>And human activity manifested itself in other ways that will leave traces in the geological record. Constructs of concrete and metal sprawled across the continents; domesticated vertebrates numerically overwhelmed wild ones; the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose anomalously fast; traces appeared of plutonium and other \u201cun-natural\u201d substances.</p> <p>The imaginary aliens watching our world would have noticed something else unprecedented in geological history. Rockets launched from the planet\u2019s surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around the Earth; some journeyed to the moon and planets.</p> <p>What do these trends portend? Should we be optimistic or anxious? It\u2019s surprising how little we can confidently predict \u2013 indeed, we can\u2019t predict as far ahead as our forebears could. Our medieval ancestors thought the Earth was only a few thousand years old, and might only last another thousand. But they didn\u2019t expect their children\u2019s lives to be very different from theirs. They built cathedrals that wouldn\u2019t be finished in their lifetime.</p> <p>Our time horizons, both past and future, now stretch billions of years, not just thousands. The sun will keep shining for about another 6bn years. But ironically we can\u2019t forecast terrestrial trends with as much confidence as our ancestors could. Their lives and environment changed slowly from generation to generation. For us, technological change is so fast that scenarios quickly enter the realm of wild conjecture and science fiction.</p> <p>But some things we can predict, at least a few decades ahead. By mid-century, the world will be more crowded, and our collective footprint will be heavier. World population is now 7.2 billion and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/jun/28/over-populated-or-under-developed-real-story-population-growth\">forecast to rise to around 9 billion</a> by 2050. Experts predict continuing urbanisation \u2013 and huge growth of megacities such as Lagos, S\u00e3o Paulo and Delhi. Population trends later this century depend largely on what happens in Africa, where some UN predictions foresee a further doubling between 2050 and 2100.</p> <p>Moreover, if humanity\u2019s collective impact on nature pushes too hard against what <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/johan_rockstrom_let_the_environment_guide_our_development?language=en\">Johan Rockstrom calls \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d</a>, the resultant \u201cecological shock\u201d could irreversibly degrade our biosphere. And if global warming reaches a tipping point that triggers melting of Greenland\u2019s ice, coastlines a millennium hence would be drastically different. Extinction rates are rising. We\u2019ve only identified about two million of the (estimated) 10 million living species: we\u2019re destroying the book of life before we\u2019ve read it. To quote the great ecologist EO Wilson, \u201cmass extinction is the sin that future generations will least forgive us for\u201d.</p> <p>The darkest prognosis for the next millennium is that bio, cyber or environmental catastrophes could foreclose humanity\u2019s immense potential, leaving a depleted biosphere. Darwinian selection would resume, perhaps leading, in some far-future geological era, to the re-emergence of intelligent beings. If this happens, or if there are aliens out there who actually visit and study the Earth, then, digging through the geological record (and applying archaeological techniques as well) they would uncover traces of a distinctive transient epoch, and ponder the all-too-brief flourishing of a species that failed in its stewardship of \u201cspaceship Earth\u201d.</p> <p>But there is an optimistic option.</p> <p>Human societies could navigate these threats, achieve a sustainable future, and inaugurate eras of post-human evolution even more marvellous than what\u2019s led to us. The dawn of the Anthropocene epoch would then mark a one-off transformation from a natural world to one where humans jumpstart the transition to electronic (and potentially immortal) entities, that transcend our limitations and eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth.</p> <p>Even in a cosmic time-perspective, therefore, the 21st century is special. It marks our collective realisation that the Anthropocene has begun \u2013 and it\u2019s a century when human actions will determine how long that epoch lasts.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 30th August 2016. It originally stated there are an estimated 10 billion species. The correct figure is 10 million.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>Humanity\u2019s impact on the Earth is now so profound that a new geological epoch \u2013 the Anthropocene \u2013 needs to be declared, according to an official expert group who presented the recommendation to the International Geological Congress in Cape Town on Monday.</p> <p>The new epoch should begin about 1950, the experts said, and was likely to be defined by the radioactive elements dispersed across the planet by nuclear bomb tests, although an array of other signals, including plastic pollution, soot from power stations, concrete, and even the bones left by the global proliferation of the domestic chicken were now under consideration.</p> <p>The current epoch, the Holocene, is the 12,000 years of stable climate since the last ice age during which all human civilisation developed. But the striking acceleration since the mid-20th century of carbon dioxide emissions and sea level rise, the global mass extinction of species, and the transformation of land by deforestation and development mark the end of that slice of geological time, the experts argue. The Earth is so profoundly changed that the Holocene must give way to the Anthropocene.</p> <p>\u201cThe significance of the Anthropocene is that it sets a different trajectory for the Earth system, of which we of course are part,\u201d said Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester and chair of the <a href=\"http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/\">Working Group on the Anthropocene</a> (WGA), which started work in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cIf our recommendation is accepted, the Anthropocene will have started just a little before I was born,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lived most of our lives in something called the Anthropocene and are just realising the scale and permanence of the change.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Colin Waters, principal geologist at the British Geological Survey and WGA secretary, said: \u201cBeing able to pinpoint an interval of time is saying something about how we have had an incredible impact on the environment of our planet.

The dawn of the Anthropocene epoch would then mark a one-off transformation from a natural world to one where humans jumpstart the transition to electronic (and potentially immortal) entities, that transcend our limitations and eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/07/human-impact-has-pushed-earth-into-the-anthropocene-scientists-say\">evidence of humanity\u2019s impact on the planet is overwhelming</a>, but the changes are very recent in geological terms, where an epoch usually spans tens of millions of years. \u201cOne criticism of the Anthropocene as geology is that it is very short,\u201d said Zalasiewicz. \u201cOur response is that many of the changes are irreversible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3641c6ee259eef72934250150aadc7a7bcbe044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3641c6ee259eef72934250150aadc7a7bcbe044/0_140_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Human activity has left a permanent layer of airborne particulates in sediment and glacial ice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Human activity has left a permanent layer of airborne particulates in sediment and glacial ice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To define a new geological epoch, a signal must be found that occurs globally and will be incorporated into deposits in the future geological record. For example, the extinction of the dinosaurs 66m years ago at the end of the Cretaceous epoch is defined by a \u201cgolden spike\u201d in sediments around the world of the metal iridium, which was dispersed from the meteorite that collided with Earth to end the dinosaur age.</p> <p>For the Anthropocene, the best candidate for such a golden spike are radioactive elements from nuclear bomb tests, which were blown into the stratosphere before settling down to Earth. \u201cThe radionuclides are probably the sharpest \u2013 they really come on with a bang,\u201d said Zalasiewicz. \u201cBut we are spoiled for choice. There are so many signals.\u201d</p> <p>Other spikes being considered as evidence of the onset of the Anthropocene include the tough, unburned carbon spheres emitted by power stations. \u201cThe Earth has been smoked, with signals very clearly around the world in the mid-20th century,\u201d said Zalasiewicz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c4b5cc0d83fe53da591103594caa09aeb773c2b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4b5cc0d83fe53da591103594caa09aeb773c2b7/0_107_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another candidate to be considered as evidence of the Anthropocene is plastic pollution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another candidate to be considered as evidence of the Anthropocene is plastic pollution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other candidates include plastic pollution, aluminium and concrete particles, and high levels of nitrogen and phosphate in soils, derived from artificial fertilisers. Although the world is currently seeing only the sixth mass extinction of species in the 700m-year history of complex life on Earth, this is unlikely to provide a useful golden spike as the animals are by definition very rare and rarely dispersed worldwide.</p> <p>In contrast, some species have with human help spread rapidly across the world. The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists. \u201cSince the mid-20th century, it has become the world\u2019s most common bird. It has been fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world,\u201d said Zalasiewicz. \u201cIt is is also a much bigger bird with a different skeleton than its prewar ancestor.\u201d </p> <p>The 35 scientists on the WGA \u2013 who voted 30 to three in favour of formally designating the Anthropocene, with two abstentions \u2013 will now spend the next two to three years determining which signals are the strongest and sharpest. Crucially, they must also decide a location which will define the start of the Anthropocene. Geological divisions are not defined by dates but by a specific boundary between layers of rock or, in the case of the Holocene, a boundary between two ice layers in a core taken from Greenland and now stored in Denmark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8fefb8d64ede01c7f9d65c77b2169c1fa34f535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8fefb8d64ede01c7f9d65c77b2169c1fa34f535/0_96_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scientists are focusing on sites where annual layers are formed and are investigating mud sediments off the coast of Santa Barbara in California and the Ernesto cave in northern Italy, where stalactites and stalagmites accrete annual rings.

He refused.</p> <p>Federal officials fined Cliven for every day he refused to pay, but his cattle continued to graze \u2013 and multiply. By 2011, the BLM <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/2011.7.26_IntenttoImpoundNotice.pdf\">told</a> Cliven that it intended to impound his cows.</p> <p>In response, Cliven publicly <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/322115646/United-States-v-Cliven-Bundy-2016\">stated</a> his family motto \u2013 that he \u201cwould do whatever it takes\u201d to stop the BLM. </p> <p>In March 2014, the agency told him it would soon proceed with its mass seizure operation.

But Cliven had hundreds of supporters at his back, and he and his sons quickly orchestrated a plan. </p> <p>Cliven told a crowd of followers that \u201cGod [is] going to be with us\u201d and that it was time \u201cto take our land back\u201d.

They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I\u2019ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\u2019t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\u201d </p> <p>The backlash was swift and brutal. US senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada, who had expressed support for the Bundys\u2019 cause, were forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/25/cliven-bundy-saga-republicans-far-right-rand-paul\">dissociate themselves with the rancher</a>.

A fellow inmate recently told him: \u201c\u2018Bundy, you know, I see what they did to you.

Cliven\u2019s cousin, Kim Bundy, who records show is based in Ruth, Nevada, owns 120 acres of land that he <a href=\"http://images.water.nv.gov/images/Protests/81065/kim%20g%20bundy.pdf\">calls</a> the \u201cNigger Abe\u201d place.

He briefly worked construction in Las Vegas but soon after moved to Cedar City, Utah, for college.</p> <p>After a few semesters, Ammon dropped out and started a small repair business, which he ran when he met his now wife, Lisa.</p> <p>\u201cHe was really flirtatious,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had dated lots of boys, but none of them were men. This guy was a man. He was mature.\u201d</p> <p>Ammon and Lisa married in July 2001 and eventually moved to Arizona, where he ran Valet Fleet Service. But after the 2014 Bunkerville standoff, the family relocated to Idaho, in part because they \u201cwere hoping to get away from the spotlight\u201d, Lisa said.</p> <p>But in 2015, Bundy supporters began sending the family stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/oregon-militia-standoff-occupation-dwight-steven-hammond\">Dwight Hammond and his son Steven</a>, two Harney County, Oregon, ranchers convicted for multiple arson <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/eastern-oregon-ranchers-convicted-arson-resentenced-five-years-prison\">offenses</a> that federal prosecutors said they committed on public lands.

  "<p>Last week, the California state senate passed <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AJR43\">Assembly Joint Resolution 43</a>, urging the federal government to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>WHEREAS, A national carbon tax would make the United States a leader in mitigating climate change and the advancing clean energy technologies of the 21st Century, and would incentivize other countries to enact similar carbon taxes, thereby reducing global carbon dioxide emissions without the need for complex international agreements; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to enact, without delay, a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels; and be it further Resolved ... That all tax revenue should be returned to middle- and low-income Americans to protect them from the impact of rising prices due to the tax<br></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Copies of the Resolution were sent to President Obama, Vice President Biden, House Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, and to all members of Congress representing California. The document specifically calls for the type of revenue-neutral carbon tax advocated by the grassroots organization <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby</a>. Studies have shown that a rising carbon tax with all revenue returned to taxpayers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">would have a modestly beneficial impact on the economy</a>, while cutting carbon pollution at faster rates than current policies.</p> <h2>California exerts its climate leadership<br></h2> <p>California has become the US leader in tackling global warming. 10 years ago, the state passed <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm\">the Global Warming Solutions Act</a>, requiring that its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 be no higher than 1990 levels. California achieved that goal in 2010, 10 years early, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions\">among the lowest per-capita carbon polluting states</a>. <br></p> <p>On the same day last week, the state legislature also <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article97383292.html\">passed a bill expanding the Global Warming Solutions Act</a>, requiring a 40% cut in California\u2019s carbon pollution from 1990 levels by 2030. In other words, California isn\u2019t just calling on the federal government to take action on climate change; the state is leading the way.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether any climate legislation can survive in the current toxic partisan political climate of Washington DC. However, a revenue-neutral carbon tax has the best chance due to <a href=\"http://www.carbontax.org/conservatives/\">its bipartisan appeal</a>. Its requirement that carbon polluters pay for the costs of their pollution appeals to the political left, while its free market, small government approach appeals to the political right. <br></p> <h2>Revenue-neutral carbon tax is hard to dislike<br></h2> <p>By returning 100% of the taxed revenue to American households, the policy blunts the rising costs of energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In fact, studies project that <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/household-impact-study/\">a majority of Americans would receive a rebate larger than their increase in energy bills</a>; only those who use the most fossil fuel energy would see costs rise more than the rebate.</p> <p>It\u2019s a policy that\u2019s hard to dislike. It makes polluters pay, goes a long way toward tackling the immense threat of human-caused global warming, results in cleaner air and water by reducing the burning of dirty fossil fuels, and has a modestly beneficial overall economic impact. However, many in the fossil fuel industry oppose the policy for obvious reasons, and through campaign donations they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">a solid grip on the Republican Party</a>. In fact, pressure from fossil fuel lobbyists convinced House Republicans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">pass their own Resolution condemning a carbon tax</a> less than three months ago.</p> <p>Thus it\u2019s difficult to see California\u2019s urging having much impact on Congress. Perhaps if the 2016 elections are a disaster for the Republican Party, they\u2019ll change direction away from extreme partisanship and climate denial. <a href=\"http://citizensclimatelobby.org/ccls-promise-we-will-pass-a-carbon-fee-bill-by-the-end-of-2017/\">Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby is optimistic</a> that with enough grassroots lobbying, they can convince Congress to pass a revenue-neutral carbon tax in 2017.</p> <p>It may take more states following California\u2019s lead in calling on Congress to address the climate threat. California is certainly influential - it has the world\u2019s 6<sup>th</sup>-largest economy, on par with that of France. The state put a price on carbon pollution via a cap and trade system in 2012, and since then <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=CARGSP,\">its economy has continued to grow</a> while <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000_2014/ghg_inventory_trends_00-14_20160617.pdf\">emissions have fallen</a>. <br></p> <h2>An opportunity the GOP must take<br></h2> <p>It would certainly behoove Republican Party leaders to reverse their climate denial platform. This is an issue on which - as with civil rights and gay marriage - they\u2019re on the wrong side of history, and the electorate is quickly moving in the opposite direction. Climate denial is <a href=\"http://thebulletin.org/climate-change-generation-gap9351\">predominant among old, white men</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2921195/young-conservatives-to-gop-on-climate-hello-are-you-listening/?utm=share_twitter\">young conservatives want the government to take climate action</a> to preserve their future.</p> <p>In 2012, the GOP published <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/\">an \u2018autopsy report\u2019</a> that concluded young voters are \u201crolling their eyes at what the party represents.\u201d Focus groups called them \u201cscary,\u201d \u201cnarrow minded,\u201d and an \u201cout of touch\u201d party of \u201cstuffy old men.\u201d The report perfectly encapsulates the party\u2019s stone-age stance on climate change.</p> <p>Of course, the report also concluded that \u201cmany minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country,\u201d and the party proceeded to nominate Donald \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">ban all Muslims</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/backing-wall-republican-donald-trump-gop\">build a wall</a>\u201d Trump for president. <br></p> <p>In other words, the Republican Party correctly identified its problems in 2012, and has since proceeded to make those problems even worse. But it\u2019s only a matter of time until they\u2019re forced to shift away from the current extreme, including on climate denial, or risk permanently alienating a majority of American voters. <br></p> <p>California\u2019s Resolution is urging them to move in that direction. Don\u2019t be surprised if more states follow suit and turn up the heat on GOP climate denial.<br></p>",

This exhibition revisits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley\">the most intoxicating four years in modern cultural history</a>, from 1966 to 1970, when some of the best rock music of all time was recorded and it seemed that youth and love were about to change the world.

The Malawi-born artist and author has also been selected for an artist commission at the upcoming Frieze art fair this autumn.

If so, then Wifredo Lam is a startling subversive who turned this cultural arrogance upside down. This Cuban painter moved in avant-garde circles in pre-second world war Paris, joined the surrealist movement, then returned home to paint his masterpiece The Jungle (1943) in which masked dancers move in a dreamlike space. Lam is a truly powerful modern artist who deserves to be much more famous. This is a much-needed retrospective for the man who painted Cuba into the story of modern art.<strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong>\u2022 14 September to 8 January, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-wifredo-lam\">Tate Modern, London</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Richard Serra </strong></h2> <p>Old man Serra, he just keeps rolling out the steel. There are very few things in today\u2019s art that can hold a candle to the formidable and moving sculpture of this great American artist \u2013 except perhaps his drawings. The Gagosian Gallery is showing both, in a two-site stunner that combines Serra\u2019s latest colossal creation with his savagely bleak works on paper.

This promises to be a fascinating encounter between two great British artists who share a straight-talking beauty of voice and vision. Emin is the most creative and authentic of all the British artists who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/12/tracey-emin-sarah-lucas-shop\">leapt to fame in the 1990s</a>. What she most shares with Blake, who created his radical art in the age of the French Revolution, is a desire to change how we see and how we live. <strong><br></strong>\u202216 September to 3 September 2017, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-liverpool/display/tracey-emin-and-william-blake-focus\">Tate Liverpool</a>.</p> <h2><strong>William Kentridge: Thick Time </strong></h2> <p>Growing from his excoriating hand-drawn animations about apartheid in his native South Africa, William Kentridge\u2019s art has developed and diversified into lecture/performances, full-blown installations and even opera direction. Kentridge\u2019s exhibition features works about Leon Trotsky, the inexplicable nature of time, and models for his forthcoming production of Alban Berg\u2019s Lulu (1935) for <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/lulu/\">English National Opera</a>. <strong><br></strong>\u2022 21 September to 15 January, <a href=\"http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/william-kentridge/\">Whitechapel Gallery, London</a>.</p> <h2>Lucia Nogueira</h2> <p>Brazilian-born sculptor Lucia Nogueira was a maker of delicate, violent, and psychologically intrusive and unstable objects. This rare UK exhibition, including work never shown before, is a reminder of just how inexplicably complex and rewarding her art was, and how her sculpture and drawing could both raise the hairs on the back of your neck and make you burst out laughing. <br>\u2022 22 September to 29 October, <a href=\"http://www.annelyjudafineart.co.uk/exhibitions/lucia-nogueira\">Annely Juda Fine Art, London</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Jannis Kounellis</strong><br></h2> <p>The man who made live parrots an art material reveals his latest work. At the age of 80, this Greek-born artist is very much of the moment, his installations with their often unpredictable elements and ecological sensibilities in tune with much younger artists. History will see him as the greatest artist of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/03/giuseppe-penone-arte-povera-whitechapel-gallery\">arte povera</a> movement that came together in 1960s Italy. It is not just that he is edgier than other arte povera artists: there is a profound sense of the history of things in his work, a gritty, poetic feel of the rural past and rage at the industrial present. There\u2019s so much more to him than an undead parrot.<strong> <br></strong>\u2022 23 September to 29 October, <a href=\"http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/jannis_kounellis_masons_yard_2016/\">White Cube, Mason\u2019s Yard</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67a789687f05ee3251af5f2f29ee618dc72ed6ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67a789687f05ee3251af5f2f29ee618dc72ed6ae/205_99_3045_2156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senza Titolo by Jannis Kounellis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senza Titolo by Jannis Kounellis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Westoby/White Cube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mike Kelley: Framed and Frame</h2> <p>The uneven, sprawling work of troubled and talented LA artist Mike Kelley shows an endless curiosity and dark humour, and frequently had an autobiographical source.

Abstract expressionism is a mystery to this day \u2013 how did a nation that had seemed artistically provincial suddenly speak so powerfully and with such soul? Where did this grand and tragic sensibility come from \u2013 and where did it go? Today, a reality TV star spouts terrifying idiocy, and it is called politics.

The Image as Question: An Exploration of Evidential Photography</strong></h2> <p>Though photographers as diverse as Peter Beard and Weegee, Harold Edgerton and Simon Norfolk, this exhibition looks at how documentary photographs were used in the past to illustrate facts or provide evidence and how, over the years, those same images have accrued new meanings and become unmoored from their original contexts.

  "<p>The global coalition for a total ban on the trade in ivory is taking shape. In Africa calls for the ban are led by the 29 nation African Elephant Coalition (AEC). In the consumer countries, both the US President Obama and China\u2019s President Xi have made commitments to close the domestic markets which will have a huge impact on demand. </p> <p>To be sure, progress towards building the coalition is uneven. Key African nations such as Zimbabwe and Namibia are opposed to the ban, and have even petitioned CITES for a relaxation of current restrictions. In Europe, while the French Environment Minister S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal has signed a decree banning the trade, in the UK the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says it is still \u201cworking\u201d on its pledge to implement a total ban on ivory sales. </p> <p>Conservation organisations used the occasion of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), held in Nairobi on 27 and 28 of August to call for Japan to throw its considerable weight behind the campaign to ban the ivory trade.</p> <p>Their statement, published in <a href=\"http:// https://gallery.mailchimp.com/3020c8a54e53b0491d74af64c/files/Final_Joint_conservation_Statement_TICAD.pdf\">English </a>and <a href=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/3020c8a54e53b0491d74af64c/files/Joint_Statement_Wildlife_Direct_TAE_TICAD6_.pdf\">Japanese</a> and signed by representatives of 21 African, Japanese and international conservation groups, concluded as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japan is one of Africa\u2019s most important development partners. They have made major contributions and commitments to support conservation. Now the conservation community call for 5 actions to be agreed at TICAD:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Japan to permanently close legal domestic markets of ivory, and aggressively close down online trading sites that deal in ivory, all to crush demand.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Japan to suspend ivory registration immediately, to prevent loopholes that allow fraudulent registration and laundering of illegal ivory.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Japan to support the Elephant Protection Initiative.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Japan to strengthen cooperation on elephant conservation initiatives and combating the trafficking of ivory to Japan through joint investigations and mutual legal assistance.<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Japan\u2019s Prime Minister and First Lady to jointly issue statements to discourage the selling and buying of ivory in Japan and to initiate an education and outreach campaign to Japanese citizens on the importance of saving elephants by stopping poaching and ending ivory trade.</p> <p>Kenya is proud to be hosting the first TICAD conference in Africa and we look forward to positive outcomes of the discussions that the conservation community.</p> </blockquote> <p>Japan\u2019s support is important for three reasons. Firstly, Japan is a highly respected and influential development partner in Africa. If Japan speaks up for elephants, its voice will be heard and listened to, in ivory producer and consumer countries alike. </p> <p>Secondly, Japan\u2019s willingness to take the politically difficult decision to close down the domestic ivory trade in support of calls by AEC will provide further evidence of her commitment to \u2018African ownership\u2019 of its development.</p> <p>The third reason is that banning the ivory trade is essential to fulfil Japan\u2019s long-term commitment to fostering peace and stability on the African continent. While the spotlight has been on China, the world\u2019s largest market for ivory, Japan\u2019s contribution to fuelling the poaching and ivory trafficking epidemic in Africa has remained in the shadows.</p> <p>In fact, the situation in Japan provides one of the clearest examples of why elephants can only be saved by banning all trade in ivory, not just the \u2018illegal\u2019 trade. Sales of ivory are legal in Japan but recent evidence has highlighted how it is impossible to distinguish legal and illegal ivory. </p> <p>Speaking on the Kenyan TV programme \u2018NTV Wild Talk\u2019 Airi Yamawaki, co-founder of the Japanese-Kenyan NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 described how an ivory tusk can be registered as \u2018legal\u2019 in Japan simply by asking a neighbour to sign a document vouching that is has been in your family for a long time. Registered tusks are not marked, so that same registration form can be used for multiple tusks, again and again. No registration at all is required for pieces of ivory weighing less than 1 kg.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvsj21F_FI4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cvsj21F_FI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Airi Yamawaki of the NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 talks about Japanese involvement in the ivory trade on the Kenyan TV series NTV Wild Talk. The interviewer is Smriti Vidyarthi. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Statistics from National Geographic show that as at 2014, Japan had registered 6,000 tusks, up from 500 in 2010. Yahoo Japan also closed sales worth $7 million in 2014, up from $2 million four years earlier. According to <a href=\"http://eia-global.org/images/uploads/EIA_Japans_Illegal_Ivory_Trade_12102015.pdf\">a recent report by Environmental Investigation Agency,</a> there is no meaningful control of the illegal ivory trade in Japan even at the most basic level. </p> <p>Airi Yamawaki described how in Japan, as in China, ignorance of consumers is the biggest problem that needs to be overcome. Ivory is used mainly to manufacture \u2018Hankos\u2019, personal seals that are required by law in order to conduct business transactions. These seals can be made of many materials, but ivory is supposed to bring luck, so people choose ivory without even thinking about it\u2014and without any knowledge of where the ivory comes from.</p> <p>Tears of the African Elephant has been working hard to change this situation by raising awareness among Japanese consumers through its project \u201cNo Ivory Generation\u201d, as well as reaching out to conservation organisations in Kenya. Airi told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important that the international community does not underestimate Japan\u2019s role as an ivory consumer and the effect of legal ivory trade. With Kenya having hosted TICAD6, I hope that Kenya will use their friendship with Japan, to win their support on elephant conservation.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476e96267bf05bfe56cbf7007ed33fbad8631290\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476e96267bf05bfe56cbf7007ed33fbad8631290/0_94_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors and activists pose at a stall set up by the NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 to raise awareness in Japan about the threat to elephants from the ivory trade.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors and activists pose at a stall set up by the NGO \u2018Tears of the African Elephant\u2019 to raise awareness in Japan about the threat to elephants from the ivory trade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tears of the African Elephant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now elephants have a new and influential ally in Akie Abe, wife of the Japanese Prime Minister. While the politicians (almost all of them men, of course) were talking on Sunday, the first ladies of Japan and 6 African countries braved a cold morning in Nairobi to visit the elephant orphanage run by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), where they were received by Angela Sheldrick and the First Lady of Kenya Margaret Kenyatta. </p> <p>It was an emotional visit. I have been to see the baby elephants many times, and I\u2019ve fallen in love with and adopted four of the orphans, but this was a particularly moving experience. </p> <p>The First Ladies stood and waited as the hungry babies ran towards them hungry for their milk.

I spoke about the powerful bond that Kenyans have with elephants, which are revered as sacred in some tribes. Some people believe that we came from elephants and that is why we must aspire to be like them, empathetic and fiercely protective of one another. I also explained their keystone role in the ecology of Africa.</p> <p>Following her visit, Mrs Abe posted the following comment on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/akieabe\">her Facebook page</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was invited by First Lady Mrs Kenyatta, who is also doing a lot of conservation work, to visit the Sheldrick\u2019s animal orphanage.

Research suggests that up to 60% of consumers would pay more for environmentally or socially responsible products. Interestingly, the proportion of people who actually pay more for these products is significantly lower than those who say they will. I know of a leading American company that bases their investments on 15% of their target market paying more for a product with a positive sustainability story.

It\u2019s nudges, pokes, prompts, subtleties \u2013 and more nudges.</p> <p>The cold hard truth is that businesses will invariably want to explore any potential commercial benefit of more ethical operations, looking at opportunities to \u201csell\u201d sustainability either by charging a slight premium (\u201crenewable only\u201d energy tariffs) or by outcompeting a rival (two bars of chocolate at the same price, but one is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/fair-trade\" title=\"\">Fairtrade</a>).

  "<p>Sperm donor 9623 looked good on paper. An IQ of 160. A bachelor\u2019s degree in neuroscience, a master\u2019s in artificial intelligence, en route to a PhD in neuroscience engineering. A passion for \u201ccrystallography, algorithms and fitness\u201d. Ontario couple Elizabeth Hanson and Angela Collins thought they had found the perfect father for their baby.</p> <p>Seven years after their son was born, Collins and Hanson discovered that donor 9623 was a college dropout with schizophrenia, a narcissistic personality disorder and a criminal history. He had spent eight months in prison for burglary, and 10 years on probation.</p> <p>The sperm bank had inadvertently included the donor\u2019s name, <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/06/07/bc-families-sue-sperm-bank-after-genius-donor-turns-out-to-be-felon-with-mental-health-issues\">Christian Aggeles</a>, in an email to the couple. A Google search did the rest. His stepfather had testified in court that Aggeles\u2019s psychotic episodes began aged 19, well before he started donating in Georgia. Aggeles\u2019s sperm led to the birth of at least 36 children worldwide.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a dream turned nightmare in an instant,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2016/04/09/he-was-the-perfect-sperm-donor-then-26-families-found-out-he-wasnt.html\">said Collins</a>. The couple, alongside at least three other families, have filed lawsuits against the Georgia-based sperm bank, Xytex Corporation, which also supplied sperm to British couples. <a href=\"http://blog.xytex.com/an-open-letter/\">Xytex denies wrongdoing</a>.</p> <p>Such cases are not unique. Like Collins, Hanson and their son, many families and individuals are now coming to terms with vital information that their donors withheld.</p> <p>The ramifications of such discoveries can be immense. \u201cThe most important entity to me is [my son] potentially facing a very debilitating lifestyle,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI felt like I was duped by Xytex and I failed my son for having chosen Xytex. In hindsight, a hitchhiker on the side of the road would have been a far more responsible option for conceiving a child.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee090bc39f6b519c318bce0ed61259c6b10ee0ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee090bc39f6b519c318bce0ed61259c6b10ee0ca/0_296_5608_3365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xytex Corporation website\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families have filed lawsuits against the Georgia-based sperm bank, Xytex Corporation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Goldman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What level of risk do Aggeles\u2019s genes confer? The architecture of mental health disorders is complex. The genetic component of schizophrenia, explains Professor Cathryn Lewis, professor of genetic epidemiology and statistics at King\u2019s College London, is not a single gene, but is combined across many genes. \u201cThere are likely to be thousands of inherited variants that control risk of schizophrenia. Each change slightly increases or decreases our risk, but none of them alone will enable us to predict whether someone is likely to develop schizophrenia.\u201d</p> <p>Even exciting new <a href=\"http://www.broadinstitute.org/news/7823\">findings in the C4 gene</a> require careful interpretation. \u201cIt\u2019s a single piece in a large genetic jigsaw puzzle,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cTesting one gene tells us nothing about an individual\u2019s risk of developing schizophrenia.\u201d</p> <p>Mental health conditions also reflect a mix of <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/hhhermh\">interacting environment and social factors</a>. Not to mention that many people with schizophrenia <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/178/6/506\">respond to treatment and live full, productive lives</a>.</p> <p>Donor anonymity was abolished in the UK in 2005. Donor-conceived offspring are now legally entitled, at the age of 18, to information on their donor\u2019s identity. However, this was not retrospectively applied: those conceived before April 2005 (that\u2019s 21,000 people born between 1991 and 2004 alone) cannot identify their donor unless the donor steps forward voluntarily. Some are never even told they were donor-conceived in the first place.</p> <p>Tyler Blackwell discovered as a teenager in Maryland that he has 35 half-siblings. His second surprise: having the same <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/sperm-donors-24-children-told-fatal-illness-medical/story?id=14115344\">condition that his donor father, John (not his real name) had not revealed</a>. John\u2019s sister found the Blackwells through a family ancestry site. It transpired that John, who had not replied to their correspondence, had an aortic aneurysm, which had ruptured at the age of 43. He had survived. At least three other family members were similarly affected. Tyler saw a cardiologist as a precaution, was diagnosed with an aneurysm and underwent surgery. Without an operation on an aneurysm of this type, the mortality from rupture is up to 97%. When rupture occurs, patients usually <a href=\"http://patient.info/doctor/thoracic-aortic-aneurysms\">die within six hours</a>. \u201cThere is no one who knew about it,\u201d said his mother of the sperm bank involved. \u201cIf I could foretell the future, I would have picked a different donor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/sperm-donation-laws-can-lead-to-untold-heartache-for-both-donors-and-recipients\">Sperm donation laws can lead to untold heartache \u2013 for both donors and recipients | Margaret Ambrose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Financial incentives could underlie some instances of deception. However, the UK\u2019s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/\">(HFEA)</a> sets the limit for sperm donors at \u00a335 per clinic visit and egg donors at \u00a3750 per cycle of donation, plus expenses. These limits, it states, aim to reward altruism and discourage coercion. Rules vary internationally. One California cryobank \u201creimburses your time and expenses with compensation of up to $1,500/month\u201d with \u201cperiodic incentives such as movie tickets or gift certificates for extra time and effort expended by participants\u201d.</p> <p>Danish sperm donor 7042 unwittingly <a href=\"http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_186023.asp\">passed on neurofibromatosis</a> to at least 11 of his children, after his sperm was used in clinics across the US, Canada, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Thailand and the UK. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1109/\">Neurofibromatosis</a> is associated with brain and nerve tumours, bone deformities, visual impairment, high blood pressure and learning difficulties. Offspring have a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1109/\">50% risk of inheriting it</a>. Denmark has since mandated that donor sperm can be used in a maximum of 12 inseminations. In the UK, no more than 10 families can be created using egg or sperm from a single donor. Donated eggs are not risk-free, but sperm donors usually have more offspring who can pass on inherited conditions to the next generation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a point where you have to draw the line, and say we\u2019re not creating designer babies here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is no such thing as reproduction without risk. There is, however, an ethical responsibility towards the child to be conceived and their hopeful parents. If a donor develops a genetic condition years after donation, there is no system at present that enforces disclosure.</p> <p>Donors now must test negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, with further screening informed by ethnicity \u2013 such as cystic fibrosis in those of Caucasian descent and sickle-cell disease in African and Afro-Caribbean populations. <a href=\"https://britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/press-release/new-guidelines-for-screening-of-sperm-egg-and-embryo-donors-in-the-uk/\">Guidelines</a> state that potential donors should be assessed for conditions with a genetic component \u2013 cleft palate, spina bifida, congenital heart malformations, psychosis and others \u2013 but that decisions on eligibility should be individualised.</p> <p>These screening regulations do not always apply to the unknown number of UK citizens who travel abroad to find donors, use unlicensed clinics or buy home-insemination kits online. Although psychological evaluation is required by most international authorities, this will not bar donors who have not yet developed symptoms of a serious mental health disorder. For them, the diagnostic tool is time.</p> <p>Genetic screening is more affordable and comprehensive than ever before. So, should we turn away from the donor\u2019s account and towards the laboratory? Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, is wary. \u201cI think the perfect genome probably doesn\u2019t exist, so it\u2019s really a question of where the line should be drawn. Only about 4% of men who come forward to be sperm donors are accepted. If we were to impose a whole new set of exclusion criteria based on theoretical risks, it is possible there won\u2019t be any sperm donors at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"397c7812f7553fb56e0c1687a0b3ef49260087b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/397c7812f7553fb56e0c1687a0b3ef49260087b3/0_311_5086_3052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen sperm stored in a sperm bank\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen sperm stored in a sperm bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: monkeybusinessimages/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With enhanced screening, donors might be diagnosed with genetic conditions that would have remained undiscovered for ever, or are untreatable. Perhaps there is an argument for not knowing.</p> <p>Kevin, who works in photography in London, is not only a donor-conceived person but a donor himself. He believes that prospective parents should know as much as possible about the donor\u2019s medical history. \u201cBut there is a point where you have to draw the line, and say we\u2019re not creating designer babies here,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>He understands the distress of Elizabeth Hanson and Angela Collins, yet worries about reading too much into specific cases. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame if people let it overshadow the industry and take it to be some sort of wide-reaching corruption. It is one story. Every day there are lots of babies being born to couples who have fertility problems and that\u2019s much more important to remember.\u201d</p> <p>Eleven offspring have been born from his donations. Why did he donate? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if someone hadn\u2019t donated. Somebody did that and that\u2019s why I am here.\u201d</p> <p>Jess Cresswell discovered aged 28 that she was donor-conceived. Seven years later, she still does not know who her biological father is, but feels her parents gave her the best life they could. Since some of her own family medical history is missing, how does she feel about donor screening?</p> <p>\u201cI think they should be screened but I also think that, just because they have some sort of hereditary condition, they shouldn\u2019t necessarily be excluded. It\u2019s the parents\u2019 discretion; some people would rather have a child knowing there\u2019s a risk of picking something up than not, if that was their only option.\u201d</p> <p>It is now easier than ever for donor-conceived people to find their genetic family. The <a href=\"https://www.donorsiblingregistry.com/\">US Donor Sibling Registry</a> has helped connect more than 10,900 people with their half-siblings and/or their donors. Nearly 70% of those who sign up match with a biological relative, and almost 80% of this group match instantly. The UK has a <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/donor-sibling-link.html\">Donor Sibling Link site</a>.</p> <p>Direct-to-consumer genetic tests have revolutionised this space. In 2005, a 15-year-old sent a saliva sample to an online service, had his genetic code uploaded, used a tracking website and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/nov/03/genetics.news. FamilyTreeDNA\">met his biological father 10 days later</a>. Kevin found a half-sister through a donor-sibling registry and two half-siblings through ancestry sites. He later inadvertently discovered some of his donor\u2019s details. Two hours on, Google revealed his donor\u2019s name. The two have since stayed in contact.</p> <p>One last thing: Aggeles received mental health treatment and picked up a degree in cognitive science two decades after he first registered at university. He is now working on a master\u2019s in artificial intelligence.</p>",

It is also a symptom of the disconnect between the traditional capital-shuttling model of diplomacy in an age when non-state groups, with the proliferation of ever more extreme militias in Syria, are driving the course of events.</p> <p>Shuttling between capitals, and convening meetings in Geneva or Vienna, looks more and more detached from the brutal and complex diplomacy on the ground. Getting on a plane, issuing a statement, and chairing high-level negotiation has become a displacement activity for influencing events on the ground.</p> <p>The old-school nature of UN diplomacy may be a generational problem. Since the first UN mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte, was dispatched to Palestine in 1948, the average age of UN special envoys appointed to resolve global conflicts is 64. Brahimi was nearly 80, and De Mistura is approaching 70. Of&#xa0;the 52 envoys in that period, only three have been women. The rationale, if any, is that elder statesmen win the respect and face-time needed in often patriarchal states, but the relative success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/catherine-ashton\" title=\"\">Catherine Ashton</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/aug/30/portrait-federica-mogherini-eu-foreign-policy-chief\" title=\"\">Federica Mogherini</a> in the role of EU foreign policy chief casts doubt on such blanket assumptions.</p> <p>Fielding a younger generation of mediators with more women in their ranks, however, is not going to overcome the challenge of seeking peace on battlefields where the main protagonists are extremists with a vested interest in violence and chaos. Efforts at engagement are likely to be both pointless and a trigger for moral repugnance, as Owen Smith found in the Labour leadership debate when he raised the possibility of Isis sitting at the negotiating table.</p> <p>But the fact that a task has become harder and more complex is not the same as saying it should not be done. In the field of diplomacy, it means the opposite. There needs to be more of it, in the knowledge that most of the effort will end in failure. On Syria\u2019s borders, UN officials are having to talk to shifting alliances of shadowy groups in order to negotiate deliveries of humanitarian aid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/syria-crisis-first-aid-convoy-enters-besieged-daraya-since-2012\" title=\"\">besieged cities</a>, and at the same time their colleagues have to keep making the rounds of the Middle Eastern capitals where the militias go for their funds, as well as keeping the pressure up on Damascus and its backers in Moscow and Tehran to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/syrian-rebels-suffer-intense-air-attacks-after-breaking-siege-of-aleppo\" title=\"\">murderous aerial bombing</a> of cities.</p> <p>Such work often seems futile, and is undoubtedly dangerous. The UN secretary general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/dag-hammarskjold-un-secretary-general-crash\" title=\"\">Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld</a>, was killed in a mysterious air crash while flying between the warring parties in Congo in 1961. The circumstances of his death are still being investigated by the UN.</p> <p>A decade or more ago, in the Middle East, the Balkans and Africa, the effective mediators would mostly have been Americans, with US economic and military clout held in reserve in case sweet reason failed. In a more multipolar world, the peacemakers more often come from the continents in turmoil, under multilateral flags of the UN or the EU. The more powers that have a say in the outcome of conflicts, the more diplomatic travel there is to do.</p> <p>We may not see another US secretary of state as willing to jump on a plane as Kerry, but there is a strong argument that the next UN secretary general should be as indefatigable in their willingness to get to the nub of conflicts, even at the expense of frustration and humiliation.</p> <p>It may be a paradox of the age that, despite the multiplicity of small-scale actors and the proliferation of secure and efficient ways to communicate electronically, the need for face-to-face diplomacy seems only to grow. Whatever the technology, the decisions to go to war or make peace are made by people, and people are best judged and cajoled in the flesh.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to figure out what is the other guy\u2019s bandwidth,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/joe-biden-interview/497633/\" title=\"\">Biden told the Atlantic last week</a>. \u201cYou have to figure out what is realistically possible ... so that you can begin to make more informed judgments about what they are likely to do or what you can likely get them to agree not to do.\u201d</p> <p>Foreign policy, Biden added, is \u201ca logical extension of personal relationships, with a lot less information to act on.\u201d The price of giving up is not always obvious, but it can be severe. A report by the <a href=\"http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">European Leadership Network</a>, a thinktank led by former ministers and generals from the old east and west, shows how a lack of personal experience of adversaries can have severe consequences. It argued that \u201cthe deep lack of empathy between Nato member states and Russia\u201d could lead to miscalculations as grave as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/02/nato-war-game-nuclear-disaster\" title=\"\">Able Archer</a>, a cold war incident in 1983 when Moscow mistook a Nato exercise as preparations for an all-out attack.</p> <p>Diplomacy, with all its many wasted air miles and protracted hotel stays, always looks expensive, but the costs are tiny compared to what is spent every day on military campaigns. Look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/us-promoting-war-crimes-yemen-saudi-bombing-obama\" title=\"\">Yemen</a>. A diplomatic initiative would not be an instant panacea, but the absence of a serious effort to engage Saudi Arabia and Iran and their Yemeni allies is appalling, in the face of the daily human suffering. In a darkening world, to persist in dialogue and reason is to rage \u2013 politely and diplomatically \u2013 against the dying of the light.</p>",
  "<p>Over the coming weeks, around 40 newly elected members of parliament will be crafting their first speeches. Those who bemoan the quality of speech writing and public oratory in Australian political life may not be excited about this prospect.</p> <p>However, the new media environment is rapidly increasing the rewards for MPs who invest in the art of speech making and the best of these speeches may soon be finding their way to a handset, tablet or computer screen near you.</p> <p> All MPs have a strong incentive to make their first speech in the parliament a good one. For many MPs, it will be the oratorical high-water mark of their parliamentary service. It\u2019s a relatively rare occasion in which a backbench MP speaks before a full chamber and public gallery.</p> <p>It\u2019s also the only occasion in which convention affords a member the ability to speak without interjection from the opposite benches and without an effective time limit (other than how rude you are willing to be towards the families and supporters of the MP following you).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/05/pauline-hanson-could-unleash-hatred-and-violence-says-tim-soutphommasane\">Pauline Hanson could unleash hatred and violence, says Tim Soutphommasane</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most importantly, it\u2019s the one speech that is most likely to be used to take the measure of the MP. In years to come, more than any other, this is the speech that people will use as the yardstick against which to judge that MP\u2019s parliamentary service. So all in all, it\u2019s an occasion that allows MPs to aim for a higher level of rhetoric than they would otherwise get away with in a late night parliamentary debate.</p> <p> The more savvy members of the Australian parliament\u2019s class of 2016 will also realise that the changing Australian media environment gives even the most junior backbencher a far greater incentive to invest in the quality of their parliamentary speech making more than their recent predecessors did. </p> <p>In the 1970s it was not unheard of for a particularly noteworthy second reading speech from a backbencher to get a mention in the next day\u2019s newspaper. But over the next 40 years, as political power concentrated in the executive, and media attention followed it, it became rare for the parliamentary contributions of any but the most senior ministers and their shadows to be followed outside the chamber. A cynic might say they were rarely followed inside the chamber either.</p> <p>That\u2019s no longer the case. The relatively new ability for MPs, indeed for any member of the public, to capture and share parliamentary speeches online, has opened new channels for notable parliamentary speeches from any MP to reach interested audiences. </p> <p>Powered by social media and a proliferation of content-hungry online journalists, today it\u2019s not uncommon for the video of a timely, engaging and well delivered parliamentary speech to be watched by tens of thousands of people. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Maiden speech by Nova Peris\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O-VWPgKNUH8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>When the very best speeches \u201cgo viral\u201d, they can be watched by hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Australians. The same speeches would only have been seen by a mere handful of others working in the same building just a decade ago. While the changed modern media environment has made it more difficult for politicians to shape public opinion in many ways, this is one area in which MPs who are willing to put in the effort to master the art are able to have a bigger impact than ever before.</p> <p>Fifty years ago, Donald Horne claimed: \u201cIt is doubtful if there are any parliaments anywhere in the world where the standard of speaking is lower than it is in the parliaments of Australia\u201d. </p> <p>The reality is that it would have been hard for most Australians to tell. </p> <p>Today, the internet has given all MPs a platform to show their wares. As the enduring appeal of the YouTube clips of Paul Keating\u2019s best parliamentary performances can attest, a good speech can go a long way online. </p> <p>There\u2019s now a new incentive for ambitious MPs to invest again in the art of speech making; the new media environment is rewarding some old political skills.</p>",

  "<p>When Meg was 12, her mother, Annie, found herself unable to look at her. Seeing her daughter made Annie feel unsettled, at times almost angry. At first, she couldn\u2019t figure out why. </p> <p> \u201cAnd then, Meg turned 13 and suddenly, everything slid into place for me,\u201d Annie says. </p> <p>\u201cI found myself thinking, \u2018She\u2019s so tiny. She is so little.\u2019 And I realised I was actually talking about myself, not her. </p> <p>\u201cIt felt like something just broke. It was something big and ugly, and it just broke.\u201d</p> <p> Annie was 13 in 1987 when an Anglican priest began sexually abusing her, over a period of eight to 10 months. Seeing her daughter turn the same age was a trigger that not only bring back memories of the abuse, but that also helped her to comprehend just how small and innocent she would have been. </p> <p>He was in his mid 30s, and used Annie\u2019s vulnerability after the acrimonious divorce of her parents and his knowledge that she had been sexually abused by a family member to his advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f7f82994f65d74791a0e463fce71bedc9e6d98e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f7f82994f65d74791a0e463fce71bedc9e6d98e/0_0_2136_2836/753.jpg\" alt=\"Annie, who was abused for many years as a child from 1979 onwards by a priest.

But it is the experience of her family members she wants to highlight. They are the secondary victims, whose stories are often lost.</p> <p>Annie and her family believe abuse pervades the lives of secondary victims but support for them is haphazard and scarce. They hope that by sharing their experiences, religious and other institutions will do more to recognise and address the impact of abuse beyond the primary victim. </p> <p>Meg said at first she was unsure why her mother had begun to treat her differently. She did not know the extent of her mother\u2019s abuse at the time.</p> <p>\u201cI guess it was always obvious that something had happened to Mum, because sometimes she would cry or blank out but I didn\u2019t know exactly what she was upset about,\u201d Meg, now 14, says.</p> <p>\u201cBut when I first turned 13 that\u2019s kind of when I knew something more was going on. For a while though, I thought I\u2019d just done something wrong, I thought I\u2019d upset Mum in some way and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t really talk to me any more.\u201d </p> <h2>Robbed of a childhood</h2> <p>Annie was first raped when the priest lured her alone into the church where he preached. Knowing that Annie was devastated about the death of her dog, the priest told her that if she looked toward the altar and prayed to God, she would see her beloved pet again. He made her lean towards the pew and, as she did, he pulled down her underwear and sexually abused her.</p> <p>Annie\u2019s police statement was made last year, when she was 42. </p> <p> \u201cAfter I got home there was a lot of blood there and it hurt for a while,\u201d it said. \u201cFor around two weeks, I remember I had a lot of trouble going to the toilet.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time. The Nauru files show how secrecy hides abuse | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Annie recalls the priest raping her five times. She is unsure why the abuse eventually stopped. But it she says it robbed her of her childhood and left her without an identity, unable to accept love, her victim impact statement said. </p> <p>By the time she was in year 12, Annie had a nervous breakdown. Her former high marks at school crashed. Her mother threw her out of home for several weeks, forcing Annie to steal food from garbage bins to survive. </p> <p>When her mother accepted her back home, Annie was terrified of starving again, and began to eat as much as she could and to hide food in her bedroom. Between 1991 and 1992, Annie gained 30kg. </p> <p>In 1994 Annie\u2019s mother made her talk about her withdrawn and surly behaviour to a bishop her mother was friends with.<strong> </strong></p> <p> Annie brought up the name of her perpetrator to the bishop. He told her: \u201cI\u2019m going to stop you here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to think very carefully about coming forward with this,\u201d Annie recalls him telling her. \u201cThink of the lives that could be ruined by this.\u201d </p> <p>The bishop questioned Annie\u2019s memory of what happened and told her that if she told anyone else, people would think she wanted it, that she was partly responsible. </p> <p>Letters written by church officials at the time and seen by Guardian Australia reveal that senior members of the church knew of the priest\u2019s abusing but did nothing.</p> <p>Annie\u2019s mother called her a slut and a whore. She accused her daughter of breaking up the family by causing trouble.<strong> </strong>Though she was awarded a scholarship to attend a prestigious college in 1994, Annie dropped out after less than a year. That same year, when she was 21, she tried to take her life. </p> <p>She has since worked in low-level jobs where people half her age serve as her boss. She cannot go near churches, even for funerals or weddings. She dreads sleep because of the nightmares she knows will come. She has considered and attempted suicide more than once.<br></p> <p>Annie\u2019s husband, Mark, and her three children, Robert,Meg,and Ella, do not know the full extent of her abuse, though they know most of the crucial details. As the years go by, they learn more, sometimes accidentally, such as when Annie talks in her sleep. Or sometimes, by necessity, as the calls from detectives and from the church require an explanation.</p> <h2>\u2018If you hide something like this \u2026 it\u2019s wrong\u2019<br></h2> <p>Dr Judy Courtin, a lawyer representing victims of institutional sex abuse at Angela Sdrinis Legal, published research last year into justice outcomes for <a href=\"http://arrow.monash.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/monash:162364\">sexual assault victims abused within the Catholic church</a>.</p> <p>She interviewed 18 secondary victims \u2013 defined as immediate family members \u2013 and found an admission of guilt by the perpetrator was important to them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/02/was-george-pell-now-scourge-of-the-vatican-once-hoodwinked-by-all-around-him\">Was George Pell, now scourge of the Vatican, once hoodwinked by all around him? | David Marr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut an even bigger concern I found from them was their anger at the ongoing way the church concealed the crimes, and a need for those people to also be held to account,\u201d Courtin says.</p> <p>\u201cThey felt that those who knew about paedophiles and yet kept quiet fundamentally enabled the activities of paedophiles. They protected them, they covered up their crimes, and they were often not held to account, and that\u2019s something that really upsets secondary victims.

He learned about the abuse of his mother just before Christmas, after he had finished his year 10 exams. Annie and Mark had been talking to detectives and representatives from the Anglican church and they felt it was time Robert knew what was going on. He is angered most by the fact that no one had helped his mother.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost worse, not helping when you can see something is wrong,\u201d Robert says. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that if you see or know about something wrong you have to do something. If you hide something like this happening to someone it\u2019s wrong.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThey [the church] should also know that the effect isn\u2019t just on that one person. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a web. Like a spider that keeps on building its web, things like this just keep building. I\u2019m not the only one who has been affected, my friends have, too, even if they don\u2019t know it, because they see how I am affected. They don\u2019t know what the cause is, and they won\u2019t for a while. But they see something is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Robert says he feels angry that he cannot always talk about the problem with friends or adults who \u201cthink the world is safe and simple\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not. Because sometimes I come home and I\u2019ve got Mum going through this. I\u2019ve got Ella, who doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, but who is asking questions every day. She\u2019s always confused and always wants to know more. And I\u2019ve got Meg, who is lashing out because of it. And it\u2019s painful at times.\u201d</p> <p>There is no support group, no place to go outside his family, Robert says, for other teenagers like him. He thinks a safe environment for other children of survivors to meet and talk in would help. \u201cIt\u2019s something I would like to be involved in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Annie has looked into it. But she says there are significant gaps in accessing support and even counselling for survivors and their families. Survivors often have to bear substantial costs of private counselling, while civil claims against the church may also be draining their funds.</p> <h2>\u2018There\u2019s stuff I still don\u2019t know\u2019</h2> <p>Annie\u2019s husband, Mark, says he learned about Annie\u2019s abuse shortly after they started dating in 1996, though she wasn\u2019t necessarily upfront about it. He would hear her call out in her sleep, and ask her the next morning about some of the things she had said.<br></p> <p>Over the years, Annie has gradually told Mark more. Since Annie first told her story to police last year, Mark has learned about the extent her perpetrator went to to harm her. But there were times while giving her statement that Annie would not allow Mark to stay in the room.</p> <p>\u201cI was very stressed by that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were just two cops and a video camera, and she\u2019s telling them things she doesn\u2019t want me to hear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/07/if-royal-commissions-worked-children-and-families-would-be-safe-by-now\">If royal commissions worked children and families would be safe by now | Carolyn Curtis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018These are the points where she\u2019s at her most vulnerable and that\u2019s the moment she really needs someone she trusts and knows loves her to be there with her.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s stuff I still don\u2019t know,\u201d Mark says. </p> <p>It took Annie 19 years of Mark gently encouraging her before she went to police in January last year. Mark had to walk a delicate line between supporting Annie in whatever choice she made, while also navigating his own anger towards the perpetrator and the church. </p> <p>She was fearful that if she went to police, Mark would learn the full extent of her abuse, and that knowing the details might prove too much for him to bear. \u201cMark\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d Annie says. \u201cYou don\u2019t muck around with that.\u201d</p> <p>He replies: \u201cThis is what it\u2019s like to be someone who supports a survivor. </p> <p>\u201cI know what I can\u2019t handle. Of course there are things that will break a human. But this isn\u2019t that. The things that I\u2019m vulnerable to aren\u2019t these things. But despite 20 years of trying, Annie can\u2019t trust me when I say that. </p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s my struggle. I\u2019ve got to live with the fact that Annie can\u2019t completely trust me the way I\u2019d like her to, the way I trust her. And I just have to accept that. That\u2019s part of the package. She can\u2019t completely trust me. She can\u2019t completely trust anyone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s very important that the victim or survivor have control over what happens, and if and when they take action</p> <footer> <cite>Shireen Gunn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still convinced that there are things, when I hear about them, that will be it. \u201cThat I\u2019ll never be able to look at her again.\u201d </p> <p>Mark says he feels a certain sense of relief now that Annie\u2019s attacker has been charged with 16 offences. He will face court next month. He had been jailed before, in 1996, for child sexual abuse offences unrelated to Annie.</p> <p>\u201cI found it\u2019s easier for me since Annie came forward than it was before, because now it\u2019s out in the open. While I\u2019m not telling everyone I know, I feel I can talk about my feelings about how angry I am with the church and the people who covered this up more safely.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Everything suddenly makes sense\u2019</h2> <p>Shireen Gunn is the manager of the Centre Against Sexual Assault in Ballarat, a town that has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/20/ballarat-prepares-for-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-while-cardinal-pell-stays-away\">deeply affected</a> by child sexual abuse within religious institutions.</p> <p>As well as primary victims, the centre works with the family members of those who were abused. </p> <p>Disclosure often comes as a relief to them, she says.</p> <p>\u201cFor many family members of survivors, especially the children of parents who have been abused, everything suddenly makes sense to them once the victim discloses that abuse,\u201d Gunn says.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly certain aspects of their childhood or behaviours from their parent start to make sense, it helps them to make sense of their experience.</p> <p>\u201cThe other response from secondary victims is, of course, anger. They want to do something to hold their family member\u2019s perpetrator to account. But it\u2019s very important that the victim or survivor have control over what happens, and if and when they take action or go to police.\u201d</p> <p>There is little research on the impact of sexual assault on secondary victims, the Australian Institute of Family Studies says.</p> <p>\u201cTo the extent that secondary victims are considered in the literature, the focus is usually on the manner in which their response to the victim/survivor\u2019s experiences helps or hinders the primary victim\u2019s recovery,\u201d the institute says.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an important concern. Higher levels of unsupportive behaviour by family members has been found to be more likely for sexual assault victims than for victims of non-sexual assaults.\u201d But few studies had examined the trauma experienced by someone finding out a family member had been sexually abused, the institute says.</p> <p>The royal commission into institutional responses into child sexual abuse acknowledges the lack of research.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have a right to have peace in your life. And you have the right to be able to look at your own kids</p> <footer> <cite>Annie</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A commission spokeswoman told Guardian Australia a comprehensive research program is under way looking at survivors and their families. But the commission does not yet have statistics about how many secondary victims of abuse survivors there might be.</p> <p>\u201cThe research projects under way are exploring a number of questions: what are the impacts of child sexual abuse on families of minors? What are the impacts of child sexual abuse on the intimate partners and children of child sexual abuse survivors? And what are the support needs of the families of child and adult child sexual abuse survivors?\u201d she says.</p> <p>Annie says there is not enough acknowledgement of the quiet role secondary victims play in trying to be supportive while grappling with their anger and sadness. While telling her family about the extent of her abuse has been difficult, especially while also repeating her story to members of the church, the royal commission and police, Annie says the experience has ultimately proved worthwhile.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a certain kind of freedom that comes with coming forward,\u201d she says. \u201cThe process is flawed, it\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not OK, and survivors and their families deserve better. Supporters need to know the way you say things has the potential to horribly damage a survivor who is already struggling under the weight of coming forward.</p> <p>\u201cBut you can also help amplify a silent voice. I am a person coming forward and coming forward means that you are saying you are a person.
