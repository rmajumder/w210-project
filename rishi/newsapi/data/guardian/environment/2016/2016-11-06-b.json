So what is their purpose in that space other than to continue to extract and burn coal?\u201d</p> <p>Bragg says those groups have a role to play in the implementation of the rules set by nations but no legitimate role to play in the setting of the rules themselves.</p> <p>The role many fossil fuel companies play in policy debates as the world attempts to curb carbon emissions has been clear:</p> <ul> <li>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968\">series of ongoing revelations</a> have shown the fossil fuel industry was aware of climate change for decades but publicly denied its scientific basis.</li> <li>Analyses of the limited amount of public information about the lobbying efforts of fossil fuel companies <a href=\"http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/04/07/big-oil-spent-115m-obstructing-climate-laws-in-2015-ngo-says/\">suggests</a> that ExxonMobil, Shell and others spend millions of dollars to manipulate public discourse on climate change.</li> <li>When Peabody went bankrupt this year a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/peabody-energy-coal-mining-climate-change-denial-funding\">Guardian analysis</a> of court documents revealed America\u2019s biggest coalmining company was funding at least two dozen groups that cast doubt on human-made climate change and oppose environmental regulations. Peabody will be represented at the meeting by six bodies with observer status.</li> </ul> <p>In a striking irony, the climate change COP at which these corporate interests will be welcome will happen at exactly the same time as another UN COP, where the exclusion of corporate interests has been hailed as a fundamental ingredient to its success: COP7 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, starting today in Delhi, India.</p> <p>At that meeting, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/fctc/cop/cop7/FCTC_COP_7_6_EN.pdf\">a report will be presented</a> analysing the impact of the tobacco control treaty.

And the inclusion of non-state actors must go through a revision of conflict of interest. This is a standard request, a legal request and a moral request. It is unacceptable for our delegation that the concept of conflict of interest was not even considered as the fundamental basis for the ethical integrity and the effective implementation of the Paris agreement \u2026 It is a concern for the majority of the world represented here at this conference and the discussions in the contact room. We are astonished that this issue was completely overturned in the conclusions.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the EU, Australia and the US rose to speak against any exclusion of fossil fuel lobbyists.</p> <p>The Australian delegation framed the issue as one where developing countries were trying to make the process less \u201copen\u201d, despite supporting measures in the tobacco control treaty to lock out the tobacco industry:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parties are merely the custodians of this issue.

Refusing to accept that Brexit is happening makes it very difficult, but the vote for Brexit has happened. Its particulars could range from the merely destructive to the outright disastrous, and depend on many more variables than the qualities and decisions of our own politicians (it is paradoxical that we have never been more reliant on the kindness of the continent than when we try to assert our independence from it).</p> <p>It is possible, as many have pointed out, that when the full consequences start to emerge, we will find parliamentary means to water them down. But nobody \u2013 not Tony Blair, not Nick Clegg, not John Major, not any of these once-vilified figures who periodically pop up as a voice of reason \u2013 is going to act the saviour here. No technicality will be found to stop Brexit, nobody will snap their fingers and wake us up.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough to point to looming catastrophes and say what we don\u2019t want; it\u2019s not enough to concentrate on what we might lose. We need to consider what could be better, in a Brexited Britain.

Are there new ways of discussing old issues \u2013 the role of occupational segregation in pay inequality, for example \u2013 that would take us beyond simply upholding the law? At a practical level, all organisations whose income partly depends on the ESF have to come together and build a detailed picture of what they need from the Brexit negotiations, as well as a&#xa0;plain, unified argument explaining why they need it. This should be fruitful, as the pressure of the coming crisis forces a new articulation of shared aims and values.</p> <p>And what of workers\u2019 rights? If we\u2019re building a new framework for employee rights, we can do more than ensure that leaving the EU doesn\u2019t intensify inequality.

We categorically do not need to take a vote to leave as a mandate to re-toxify everything, especially given that the Brexiters scarcely mentioned the environment. The pressing danger is that environmental matters simply slide off the agenda, on a slope of anti-science innuendo and deliberate avoidance.

  "<p>William Chaloner, who has died aged 87, was one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on fossil plants. He pioneered new methods for their study and is considered one of the founders of the research field of palynology, which uses fossil pollen and spores from ancient rocks to interpret plant evolution and to reconstruct environments of the past.</p> <p>His research was wide-ranging and included work on some of the earliest plants to colonise the land, fossil plants of the coal age, and the use of plant fossils to infer ancient climates and the composition of the atmosphere in the distant past.</p> <p>Born in London, Bill was the son of journalists, Lenore \u201cLen\u201d (nee Barling) and Ernest Chaloner. He attended Kingston grammar school and evening classes in geology at Chelsea Polytechnic before going to Reading University in 1947, to study botany, chemistry and geology. He graduated with first-class honours in botany in 1950 and remained at Reading to study extinct plants with Tom Harris, who influenced him greatly, including encouraging the importance of fieldwork as the main way to gain new and interesting fossil material.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20a9387d420935df1f9569ff6b10d8495eb0f2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20a9387d420935df1f9569ff6b10d8495eb0f2c/0_124_661_396/500.jpg\" alt=\"William Chaloner\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Chaloner became fascinated by the link between carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and climate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For his doctorate, Chaloner studied spores from the extinct club-moss trees of 300m years ago, showing that these strange plants were highly diverse, and using them to understand the ecology of the vegetation that formed some of the world\u2019s most important coal deposits. In 1953 he accepted a Commonwealth Fund fellowship (now a Harkness fellowship) and travelled to North America to work with one of that continent\u2019s premier palaeobotanists, Chester A Arnold, at the University of Michigan, on the spores of similar plants to those he had studied in Britain. On the voyage home he met Judith Carroll, whom he married in 1955.</p> <p>In 1956, Chaloner was appointed an assistant lecturer in the botany department at University College London. He was promoted to lecturer in 1958, and then reader in palaeobotany in 1963, spending a year as a visiting professor in the geosciences department at Pennsylvania State University and teaching at the University of Nigeria at Nsukka in 1965-66, which gave him new insights into tropical vegetation. This phase of his career included his important 1970 review on the colonisation of the land by plants, which integrated information from plant fossils of all kinds into an influential overview that showed the stepwise accumulation of the features, such as water-conducting tissues and leaves, that today characterise almost all land plants.</p> <p>Chaloner was appointed to the chair of botany at Birkbeck College, London, in 1972, where he remained until 1979. During this period he pioneered the use of scanning electron microscopy to study fossil plants at high magnifications and in three dimensions, which opened up many new fields of study, including the possibilities of detailed work on spores and ultimately the study of fossil flowers. He also became interested in forest fires in ecosystems of the past, and the use of fossil charcoal to estimate the concentration of oxygen in ancient atmospheres.</p> <p>In 1979 Chaloner moved to the chair of botany at Bedford College, University of London. There he pioneered the use of growth rings in fossil woods to reconstruct ancient climates. He showed that forest growth, mainly of conifers, was possible close to both poles during the global warmth of the Cretaceous period, about 100m years ago, and hence that these ecosystems were capable of supporting a diverse fauna, including dinosaurs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b7e128b4b6db6521958c7fcf9f0abb349460c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b7e128b4b6db6521958c7fcf9f0abb349460c55/0_0_1414_2098/674.jpg\" alt=\"The trunk of a fossil known as Lepidodendron, an extinct coal-forming tree found in Radstock, Somerset.

There he developed the use of stomata (gas exchange pores) on fossil plants to reconstruct levels of carbon dioxide in ancient atmospheres. It had been shown that the number and density of these pores bore a direct relationship to the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Chaloner was able to document differences in stomatal number and density in fossil leaves at different times in the past, creating a record of changing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that related to warming and cooling of the climate. He became passionately interested in the link between carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and climate, believing that knowing more about past changes would help us to understand the future.</p> <p>Chaloner received numerous honours for his services to science, including election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. He was a trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, president of the International Organisation of Palaeobotany and president of the Linnean Society in its bicentennial year. He received both the Linnean and the Lyell medals and also served as vice-president of the Geological Society of London.</p> <p>After retirement in 1994, he continued to publish research up until his death, including editing a volume on the past, present and future of fire in the history of the Earth, including recommendations for future research as well as for policymakers. With a warm sense of humour and a self-effacing manner, he was ever approachable, especially for young researchers. His thoughtful, polite and generous approach won him many friends.</p> <p>He is survived by Judith, their three children, Caroline, Michael and Sarah, and six grandchildren.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>William Gilbert Chaloner, palaeobotanist and palynologist, born 22 November 1928; died 13 October 2016</p>",

Today three-quarters of us end up in an urn.</p> <p>Roger Kaiser recently triggered an inadvertent terror scare when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/sweet-gesture-gone-wrong-met-opera-forgives-man-who-spread-friends-ashes\">scattered ashes into the orchestra pit at the Met</a>. The Texan opera buff had done it before. The ashes were those of his mentor, his Facebook page later revealed. \u201cIt was just part of our deal that I would leave bits of him in all the houses I visit,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/arts/music/opera-fans-last-wish-led-to-terror-scare-at-the-met.html\">he wrote</a>.</p> <p>Police said that Miller perhaps breached health regulations, but there were no charges to be brought. And while sprinkling white powder in a prominent venue in New York is, perhaps, inadvisable, it can be hard to know when scattering is OK (never if you\u2019re Catholic; the Vatican ruled last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/vatican-bans-catholics-cremation-ashes-loved-ones-home\">ashes must be stored in a sacred place</a>).</p> <p>\u201cAnywhere inside, such as an opera house, is crazy,\u201d says Richard Martin, who runs <a href=\"http://www.scattering-ashes.co.uk/\">Scattering Ashes</a>, an online advice centre and shop based in Devon. Martin, a former pollution consultant, started the company with his wife, Karen, in 2010 after a bad experience while scattering his father\u2019s ashes on a golf course.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no information out there and we were made to feel unwelcome,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cFuneral directors don\u2019t want much to do with you after they give you the ashes, so too many people end up with them in a wardrobe not knowing what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Martin advises restraint. According to a recent <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/16/majority-people-want-be-cremated-when-they-die/\">survey</a>, almost 80% of those of us who wish to be cremated want to be scattered. That would equate to about 750 tonnes of ashes a year (each adult produces an average of 2.2kg). \u201cIf you leave a big pile in a beauty spot, it\u2019s not great for the next person who wants a picnic,\u201d he says. \u201cSo just scatter a little bit that won\u2019t impact on anybody but fulfils the wishes of your loved one.\u201d</p> <p>And check with the landowner. The Martins catalogue the advice of several locations, including the National Trust (<a href=\"http://www.scattering-ashes.co.uk/help-advice/permission-2/\">no policy, but get permission</a>) and Royal Parks. (\u201cWe would prefer that you don\u2019t.\u201d)</p> <p>Sports grounds are popular choices, but bans have been put in place at <a href=\"http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20110720/st-james-park-upgrades-continue_2281670_2397139\">Newcastle United</a> and Aston Villa, <a href=\"http://www.scattering-ashes.co.uk/help-advice/law/football-clubs/\">among others</a>, while others happily accommodate requests. Considerate scatterings in waterways are generally OK, the <a href=\"http://www.scattering-ashes.co.uk/help-advice/permission/sea-river/\">Environment Agency says</a>.</p> <p>Terror alerts are rare but not unheard of. In 2013, a man <a href=\"http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Man-Sprinkled-Fiancees-Ashes-at-LensCrafters-Causing-Florida-Malls-Evacuation-Sarasota-Police-228075171.html\">caused a Florida shopping mall to be evacuated</a> when he scattered ashes outside an optician\u2019s. In 2009, another Texan sent his wife\u2019s ashes to embassies in Rome, Paris, London and Paris with instructions for them to be spread because the couple had \u201chad a nice holiday\u201d in the cities. One of the packets <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2009/07/16/Cremation-ashes-set-off-anthrax-scare/UPI-32261247777919/\">caused an anthrax scare</a> in Rome, where Barack Obama was visiting.</p> <p>Above all, don\u2019t risk your own life to honour someone else\u2019s. People have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9686182/Microlight-instructor-dies-after-crash-while-scattering-friends-ashes.html\">died in air accidents</a> while scattering ashes and \u2013 more commonly \u2013 after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/01/man-washed-out-sea-scattering-ashes-cornwall-tintagel\">washed away while scattering at sea</a>.</p> <p>Martin has noticed a big rise in the popularity of alternatives to conventional scattering, meanwhile, including the increasingly popular loading of ashes into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/07/we-sent-mums-ashes-up-in-a-firework\">fireworks</a> or the pressing of ashes into gemstones. \u201cYou can put a tiny amount of ashes into tattoo ink now, or you can even get yourself pressed into a vinyl record and play your own soundtrack,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I prefer the more traditional approach.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 7 November 2016. An earlier version stated that of those people who wished to be cremated, 80% wanted their ashes scattered, which would equate to about 750,000 tonnes of ashes a year based on each adult producing at least 2kg of ashes. It would be about 750 tonnes, calculated using the average of 2.2kg of ashes. This has been corrected.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul>",

The No. 1 ranking is just the cherry on top of a very big, well decorated cake, and just reward for the years of dedication and hard work that he has put into his game. He\u2019s already a truly great champion, and were he never to win another match he would remain one of Scotland, Britain and the world\u2019s best ever sportsmen. If, however, as seems entirely possible, he was to, say, double his Grand Slam tally over the next three years, adding the Australian and French titles, maybe another Wimbledon or US Open, he would join the true legends of the game.

  "<p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.unido.org/news/press/energy-central-to-so.html\">UN Secretary Ban Ki-Moon highlighted</a> the role of hydropower in boosting the use of renewable energy globally, when he visited a nonprofit institute in China that helps emerging nations develop and build hydropower plants. Many countries consider hydroelectricity a clean source of power because it doesn\u2019t involve burning dirty fossil fuels. But that\u2019s far from true. Hydropower is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions: a new study shows that the world\u2019s hydroelectric dams are responsible for as much methane emissions as Canada.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/10/02/biosci.biw117\">study</a> from Washington State University finds that methane, which is <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/\">at least 34 times more potent</a> than another greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, makes up 80% of the emissions from water storage reservoirs created by dams. What\u2019s more, none of these emissions are currently included in global greenhouse gas inventories. These are already revealing a worrisome future in which rising global temperatures will likely cause environmental changes such as rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes, which could uproot communities and intensify competition for food and other resources.</p> <p>\u201cI think this study shows that dams as a source of energy aren\u2019t without their greenhouse gas costs,\u201d says Bridget Deemer, a research ecologist at the US Geologic Survey, who led the study during her prior position as a research associate at Washington State. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a renewable source of energy, people should keep the greenhouse gas side of the picture in mind when making planning and policy decisions regarding dams.\u201d</p> <p>The research, which examines 100 recent studies on greenhouse gas emissions from 267 large reservoirs around the world, also calls into question the wisdom of building more hydroelectric dams as countries try to nix their dependence on coal, natural gas and oil. An estimated<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00027-014-0377-0\"> 3,700 new dams</a> are proposed or under construction around the globe, the study reports. It suggests the hydropower industry will need to control its emissions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology\">This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But industry officials in the US say the study misrepresents the benefit of hydropower in the fight to rein in global warming.</p> <p>\u201cSingling out hydropower is irresponsible and inaccurate, to say the least,\u201d says LeRoy Coleman, a spokesman for the<a href=\"http://www.hydro.org/\"> National Hydropower Association</a>, based in Washington DC. \u201cHydropower is needed to meet federal and state clean energy goals.\u201d</p> <p>Hydropower represents 6% of all energy generation in America, according to the<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&amp;t=3\"> US Energy Information Administration</a>. For newly built power plants, hydropower\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf\"> total cost</a> of construction and operation runs about $68 per megawat-hour, which is comparable to solar, slightly more expensive than wind, and cheaper than coal and natural gas when those sources incorporate technology to capture carbon emissions.</p> <p>Hydropower is often considered a source of renewable electricity because its fuel, water, is constantly replenished by nature. By that standard, hydropower produces 52% of all renewable electricity in the US, according to the<a href=\"http://www.hydro.org/\"> National Hydropower Association</a>.</p> <p>Only 3% of reservoirs in the US are equipped to produce hydropower, Coleman says. Others are limited to water storage and flood protection duties, and some of them are good candidates for electricity generation, he adds.</p> <p>\u201cThe responsible and logical approach would be to capture the energy potential of these reservoirs and combat climate change by installing hydropower equipment,\u201d Coleman says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd62943799f3d876ca8109c3c991d8612788095d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd62943799f3d876ca8109c3c991d8612788095d/0_0_1453_830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"power plants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top 10 power plants in the world/</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ucilia Wang/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As recently as a decade ago, little was known about emissions from water storage reservoirs. But understanding has evolved rapidly. For instance, researchers initially thought shallow reservoirs in tropical regions were the largest emitters because their stored water was more prone to heating up, which could fuel greenhouse gas production.</p> <p>But analysis by Deemer and her colleagues shows that the latitude and depth of water are not leading factors. Instead, \u201cbiological activities\u201d in a reservoir \u2013 such as decaying vegetation and nutrient runoff from watersheds upstream \u2013 are more important indicators of greenhouse gas emissions. The nutrient runoff can be from natural processes or from farming, logging and land development.</p> <p>Using data from the 267 reservoirs, the authors estimate total emissions from all reservoirs worldwide and conclude that those water storage facilities account for 1.3% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Another new<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161947\"> study</a> published by the journal PLOS One reaches similar conclusions, although it finds carbon dioxide to be a bigger share of emissions than methane. After examining data from more than 1,400 dams worldwide, it identifies the rate of soil erosion into a reservoir as a leading predictor of carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>Led by Laura Scherer, a research associate at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, that study concludes the \u201ccarbon footprint of hydropower is far higher than previously assumed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese are massive emissions, and we can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d says Kate Horner, executive director of the environmental group<a href=\"https://www.internationalrivers.org/\"> International Rivers</a>, based in Berkeley, California. \u201cThere are a massive number of dams that are currently proposed to be built. It would be a grave mistake to continue to finance those with the impression that they were part of the solution to the climate crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Coleman contends that it\u2019s premature to use data from these studies to criticize hydropower because the science remains uncertain.</p> <p>It is challenging to measure reservoir emissions because so many factors can play a role, Deemer acknowledges. The scientific community also doesn\u2019t follow a standard practice for counting emissions, even though the International Hydropower Association and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) published a set of<a href=\"https://www.hydropower.org/sites/default/files/publications-docs/GHG%20Measurement%20Guidelines%20for%20Freshwater%20Reservoirs.pdf\"> guidelines</a> in 2010.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/31/california-wind-farm-energy-trident\">Can America's first floating wind farm shake off environmental concerns?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Emissions vary according to a wide variety of factors, including water and air temperatures, season and time of day, vegetation and soil types in both the reservoir and the upstream watershed, and watershed management practices.</p> <p>Hydropower dams constantly manipulate water levels to make electricity, a process that also affects the amount of emissions that make their way into the atmosphere from the reservoir. As water levels decline, the hydrostatic pressure on submerged soils also lowers and allows gas bubbles to escape. Sometimes the methane in these bubbles is absorbed by the water column and never reaches the surface. Other times it makes the great escape into the air.</p> <p>Deemer and her colleagues note that many studies don\u2019t sample emissions thoroughly enough both across reservoir surface area and over time. As a result, she says, the emissions estimates in her study are probably low.</p> <p>The challenge in measuring emissions also makes it difficult to figure out how to reduce them. Researchers speculate it may be possible to reduce emissions by managing water levels in a reservoir differently. This, however, could affect electricity generation, fishery and flood protection, and other operations.</p> <p>Protecting watersheds to reduce erosion into reservoirs could also reduce emissions as well as improve water quality, forest health and aquatic habitat.</p> <p>Global greenhouse gas inventories currently do not include emissions from reservoirs at all, but that is changing.</p> <p>At an October<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session44/l3_adopted_outline_methodology_report_guideline.pdf\"> meeting</a> in Bangkok, a committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change took a first step by agreeing to include reservoirs, which it categorizes as \u201cflooded lands\u201d, in an updated guidance document that instructs nations on accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions. But it may be several more years until that document is formally approved.</p> <p>The US government does not account for reservoir emissions in its own greenhouse gas inventory. The country is dotted with <a href=\"http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/mld/dams00x.html\">roughly 79,000 dams</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.hydro.org/why-hydro/available/industrysnapshot/\">more than 2,200 </a>private and public hydropower plants. The<a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/projects/dams.jsp\"> US Bureau of Reclamation</a>, for example, manages 337 reservoirs, and a science advisor to the agency, Dave Raff, says the bureau is taking on the emissions accounting task.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged in trying to understand what the different mechanisms are for reservoirs as they generate these greenhouse gases,\u201d Raff says. \u201cAnd ultimately, what are the management levers we have to pull that could mitigate those. I do think we feel a sense of urgency to be on that path.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The article was amended on 6 November 2016 to show that the cost of building and operating a hydropower plant is about $68 per megawtt-hour, not kilowatt-hour. </li> </ul>",
  "<p>When Hugh Whitemore\u2019s play based on the life of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alan-turing\">Alan Turing</a> first appeared in 1986, the man with a key responsibility for deciphering the German Enigma code was something of an enigma himself: a hero to computer scientists but barely acknowledged in the public eye following his prosecution for homosexuality and suicide in 1954. A great deal has changed since then. In the past three years Turing has been officially pardoned by the Queen, become the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/13/the-imitation-game-review-cumberbatch-turing\">Oscar-winning film</a>, two operas and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/20/pet-shop-boys-alan-turing-enigma-proms-tribute-interview\">late-night electronic Prom</a> devised by the Pet Shop Boys, who first became aware of Turing through Whitemore\u2019s play and the biography by <a href=\"http://www.turing.org.uk/\">Andrew Hodges</a> on which it is based. The exponential growth of the Turing industry inevitably casts Whitemore\u2019s drama in a very different light; though <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/robert-hastie-appointed-artistic-director-of-sheffield-theatres/\">Robert Hastie</a>\u2019s revival does not appear remotely dated. Indeed, our foreknowledge of Turing\u2019s fate elevates the piece from an understated biographical portrait into a compelling modern tragedy.</p> <p> If tragedy requires the hero to be undone by a fundamental flaw, Whitemore suggests that it may have been Turing\u2019s autism that brought about his fall. In a key scene set at Bletchley Park, a colleague laments that Turing is incapable of speaking anything but the plain truth where a lie might be less hurtful. Whitemore frames the action around a fateful police interview in which Turing, having arrived to report a robbery, haplessly incriminates himself with the admission that he had been having sex with the robber.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2615aa681f71d5e7910770880aebf64484eadbdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2615aa681f71d5e7910770880aebf64484eadbdf/0_302_3298_4123/800.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Dew as Pat Green with Daniel Rigby playing Alan Turing.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A composite of his female admirers\u2019 \u2026 Natalie Dew as Pat Green with Daniel Rigby playing Alan Turing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Davenport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/15/daniel-rigby-favourite-tv\"> Daniel Rigby</a>\u2019s stuttering central performance is almost self-defeatingly diffident but intensely charismatic nonetheless. His awkward posture and scruffy tweeds suggest a giant intellect trapped within the body of an overgrown schoolboy \u2013 indeed the only time he becomes truly eloquent is during an old-boy\u2019s address in which he likens the grey matter of the human brain to the tepid porridge served up by his alma mater. One is similarly struck by the child-like regression with which Turing falls into animated discussion with his superior at Bletchley (played with deft, professorial daffiness by Raad Rawi) about his admiration for Walt Disney\u2019s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Did this ultimately influence the macabre, fairytale manner of his death, by coating an apple in cyanide? (When Stephen Fry asked Steve Jobs if this had been the inspiration for the company\u2019s logo the Apple chief replied \u201cGod, we wish it were\u201d). </p> <p>Though Turing became the object of at least two unrequited infatuations, Natalie Dew plays a composite of his female admirers with devastating poignancy. Phil Cheadle portrays the prosecuting police officer with the surprise of an angler astonished to find such a large fish has unexpectedly jumped into his net. The clean, minimalist lines of Hastie\u2019s production are enhanced by gentle, pianistic renderings of Radiohead tunes; while Ben Stones\u2019s design is a mesmerising light installation formed of a constantly shifting matrix of suspended rods. It is beautiful and beguiling but, rather like the the computational genius of the central character, rather above most people\u2019s heads. </p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/breaking-the-code\">Royal Exchange</a>, Manchester, until 19 November.

It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-online-troll-tells-samantha-bee-why-she-prefers-donald-trump_us_58184cafe4b0990edc3340d2\">One told Samantha Bee</a> that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska.

Even the <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/special/2010-02/503820.html\">state-owned Global Times</a> reported with approval on the practice in 2010, citing Changsha\u2019s party office as the source of the name after it paid a team of commenters 600 yuan a month in 2004, plus half a yuan \u2013 hence \u201c50 cent\u201d \u2013 for each glowing post they made.</p> <p>Since then, paying stooges to praise your work online has become about as routine for local government in China as hiring traffic wardens. <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf?m=1463683069\">A recent study at Harvard University</a> found that the Chinese authorities were placing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/chinese-officials-create-488m-social-media-posts-a-year-study-finds\">448m phony comments on the internet each year</a>. In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings.</p> <p>Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it. In January 2014, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://quartz.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1478195655507000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGs17wVP9NmQflJocJOU2xhA8V12g\">quartz.com</a> found many stooges <a href=\"http://qz.com/311832/hacked-emails-reveal-chinas-elaborate-and-absurd-internet-propaganda-machine/\">simply cutting and pasting a suggested question into an online discussion</a> with a party secretary in Ganzhou. \u201cIt seems like taxis are far more orderly than in past years,\u201d they all wanted to tell him.</p> <p>Two years before, however, Ai Weiwei interviewed an anonymous 26-year-old with very sophisticated methods. The young man, whose own family knew nothing of his work, estimated that 10-20% of the comments he saw were left by the 50 Cent Party. He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government\u2019s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. \u201cSometimes I feel like I have a split personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like it or hate it.

Employees were expected to post on news articles 50 times a day. Those who wrote blogs had to maintain six Facebook accounts and publish at least three posts daily. On Twitter, they had to have at least 10 accounts, on which they would tweet 50 times.

In Hebrew it\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.541142\">\u201chasbara\u201d, literally meaning \u201cexplanation\u201d</a>, and it involves trying to improve the world\u2019s opinion of the country and its causes. Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/idfonline/\">even has its own Pinterest page</a>, featuring photo collections with themes such as \u201cSoldiers\u2019 Stories\u201d and \u201cIDF Style\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit \u201ccovert units\u201d however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. \u201cWe need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Government-to-use-citizens-as-army-in-social-media-war-322972\">Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post</a>. \u201cThat is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.\u201d Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships.</p> <p>Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/israel-hamas-clash-social-media\">Israel Under Fire</a> emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. \u201cWe counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. \u201cSocial media is another place where the war goes on. This is another way to tell our story.\u201d We do not know whether Israel Under Fire was itself one of these covert units, or whether Ben-Yosef got a scholarship.

The i-army.org site itself, where volunteers can join, is certainly <a href=\"https://meduza.io/\">not very appealing to outsiders</a>. It is a crazed and relentless jumble of unflattering stories about Russia \u2013 from details about the MH17 air crash, to doping by its athletes, to unsubstantiated allegations from the western media that Putin is a paedophile. \u201cDo not let yourself be deceived \u2013 spread the truth!\u201d the site says, rousingly.</p> <p>More obvious signs of life can be found on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i_army_org\">i-army\u2019s Twitter page</a>. This is very active, with 12,800 followers, which isn\u2019t bad, and retweets regularly runs into dozens or hundreds. Clearly some of its followers have been arguing Ukraine\u2019s case online, but the tweets themselves are not very persuasive, offering photographs of captured Russian military hardware, dry political statements and sudden comic memes about Russia\u2019s federal reserves, for example.</p> <p>The account\u2019s wallpaper perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Information Policy Ministry \u2013 or the \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d, as some Ukrainian wags prefer. It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry\u2019s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24). No matter how sympathetic one might feel towards the Ukrainian cause, it is hard not to feel that this particular region of the conflict needs a lighter touch.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> A few hundred.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.</p> <h2> UK</h2> <p>The so-called \u201cTwitter Troops\u201d of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade\">the 77th Brigade</a> were somewhat misunderstood by the media when the new army unit was created last year. In fact social media was just one example of many non-military skills that the specialist soldiers were intended to bring to the army. And in any case, the MoD informs me, it would not be a soldier\u2019s job to launch a disinformation campaign on the battlefield, even if they had the time.</p> <p>You don\u2019t hear much about JTRIG in Britain, however, and they do just this kind of thing. Indeed the very existence of the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group was a national secret until documents from Edward Snowden were published <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/controversial-gchq-unit-domestic-law-enforcement-propaganda\">by Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman in 2014</a>. And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/\">Some of JTRIG\u2019s tactics</a>, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual \u201choneypot\u201d stings, sound more or less like conventional spying. Others were carefully designed to manipulate and deceive. <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2015/06/22/behavioural-science-support-jtrig/\">In the words of the leaked document</a>, these included \u201cUploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages; establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum memberships \u2026 sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this sounds reasonable, and frankly welcome, such as disrupting the online activities of terrorists or child abusers. Indeed, if it still exists, JTRIG seems to target specific groups or individuals, rather than trying to influence public opinion. Which groups, however, and who chooses them, might be a legitimate concern. The document mentions the English Defence League, for example, whose members were no doubt not happy to be included.

Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416970\">launch their own version of Facebook</a>, as some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/13/a-rare-glimpse-of-north-koreas-version-of-facebook/\">believe they plan to</a>.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081300891.html\">about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with</a>, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That\u2019s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8/0_0_2362_3283/719.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Joe Magee\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang\u2019s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south \u2013 such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users.</p> <p>Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/asia/south-korean-agents-accused-of-tarring-opposition-before-election.html?_r=0\">strayed into attacks on South Korea\u2019s own opposition parties</a>. Last year the country\u2019s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north \u2013 and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, <a href=\"https://revolution-news.com/south-korea-50k-protest-national-intelligence-service-election-rigging\">to smear President Park\u2019s opponents</a>, who were described as, among other things, \u201cleftist followers of North Korea\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> 200 (north) 9 (south).</p> <p><strong>Favourite subject</strong> Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid.</p> <h2> Turkey</h2> <p>President Erdo\u011fan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/elections/2015/05/11/ak-party-founded-new-turkey-digital-office-for-the-general-elections-on-june-7\">a team of 6,000 social media operatives</a>. \u201cWe aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323527004579079151479634742\">a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time</a>. \u201cAnd when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.\u201d But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined.</p> <p>Sadly for Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-twitter-trolls/\">their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let\u2019s say, under-subtle</a>. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-elections-akp-mulls-dumping-social-media-trolls.html#\">showered with far from positive remarks</a>. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/11/akp-social-media-twitter-facebook.html\">Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government\u2019s handling of a hostage negotiation</a> in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of \u201cZionism\u201d.</p> <p>At times the \u201cAK Trolls\u201d, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about \u201chis\u201d tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur\u2019s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from \u201cour trolls\u201d. When recordings allegedly showing Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down.</p> <p>Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn\u2019t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkish-president-s-social-media-campaigners-deny-being-a-troll-army-10301599.html\">New Turkey Digital Office</a>, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. \u201cAll of our accounts will be officially announced,\u201d spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. \u201cOur messages will be determined at the party headquarters.

The stakes are therefore quite high in terms of who will fill his seat.

Median incomes have gone up and the poverty rate is falling. People are not wrong that there has been a long period of economic stagnation and increasing inequality, but we seem to be turning a corner. This is exactly the wrong time to adopt policies that are going to throw the economy into a tailspin.</p> <p>Threatening to shut down trade negotiations or promising to renegotiate settled trade agreements, for example the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), makes no sense if the imperative is to build on the gathering momentum of the US economy. The case for the TPP has as much to do with America\u2019s political influence and interest in Asia as it does with economics. Abandoning the TPP would be a huge gift to China. The other Asian countries will make accommodations to China, and America\u2019s influence will plummet.</p> <p>That is the situation Hillary Clinton will inherit if she wins. The question, then, is how to reconcile the need to tap into those growing Asian markets with her shift on trade during the campaign.</p> <h2>Middle East: <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/anthony-h-cordesman\">Anthony Cordesman</a></h2> <p><em>Arleigh Burke chair in strategy, Center for Strategic and International Studies</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6361bbf82c998f93f92b4509093356aa58b95cdf/61_0_403_504/400.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Cordesman.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Cordesman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Center for Strategic &amp; International\u200b Studies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next administration will confront serious security challenges across the Middle East. Some are obvious and longstanding: the rise of Islamic State, the impact of the US invasion of Iraq, the fighting and instability in Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen.</p> <p>It is also true that by the time the next president takes office, the game will probably have a changed. If Isis is defeated in Iraq, which it may well be by the time the next administration is in place, that immediately means he or she will have to decide how to secure Iraq and how to proceed in Syria. </p> <p>Isis has never been the only \u2013 or even the dominant \u2013 terrorist threat in the region. In 2015, estimates indicate that Isis accounted for about 20% of the terrorist incidents in the region. So when Isis is defeated as a proto-state, we will have to consider new threats. Do people migrate to other extremist movements? Do we see al-Qaida, which has made serious gains in Yemen and has a strong affiliate in Syria, grow? Does this expose new sectarian, ethnic or tribal tensions?</p> <p>There is a need to restructure US-Arab cooperation, with a consideration toward creating lasting civil stability. The Arab spring showed how civil forces \u2013 poor governance, lagging economic development, high youth unemployment \u2013 exacerbated regional upheaval and violence.

This shift has been under way for some time but will be more marked in the coming years.</p> <p>The No 1 challenge a President Trump or a President Clinton will face is Russia. Mr Trump thinks he can get a \u201cdeal\u201d but there is reason to believe that will prove far more challenging that he anticipates, and in the process he could upend a lot of relationships with US allies.</p> <p>For Secretary Clinton, given the series of hacks on the Democratic party and her campaign, she will probably take a very different position. The question then is: how much tougher will she get and how specifically she will engage with Russia? This will probably result in much more of an emphasis on countering disinformation and lead to much more intelligence gathering in collaboration with Europeans.</p> <p>Another major challenge for the US will be to get Europe to focus on something other than its own internal affairs: Brexit, slow economic growth and domestic politics, which have taken a sharp turn to the right.</p> <p>Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany hold elections. If Mr Trump is elected, I believe there is more of a chance that rightwing parties will come to power. In a sense, his election gives permission to these movements to become more anti-American, creating a political dynamic in Europe that is more rightwing and more hostile to the US.</p> <p>Brexit has put the US in a position of trying to remain friends with both parties in a messy divorce. The US will have to build new relationships with Europe and with the UK, and this will take effort.</p> <h2>Women\u2019s healthcare: Heather Boonstra</h2> <p><em>Director of public policy, Guttmacher Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96043a37130998bd79d1037b43e94eefa770cd2c/0_0_288_360/288.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Boonstra\" width=\"288\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather Boonstra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guttmacher Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abortion has been legal throughout the US for more than 40 years, but it remains one of the country\u2019s hottest political flashpoints. Donald Trump certainly has stumbled on the issue, especially when he said in a TV interview that if abortion were made illegal, women seeking one should be criminally punished \u2013 a statement that he later tried to reframe as \u201cpro-life with exceptions\u201d. </p> <p>The Republican platform, however, is quite clear: it affirms \u201cthat the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\u201d and it supports a human life amendment to the constitution. The Democratic platform supports a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion \u201cregardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured\u201d.</p> <p>In addition to abortion, access to contraceptive services and reproductive healthcare generally is also at stake. The Republicans have called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and have also targeted the Title X national family planning program and Planned Parenthood health clinics. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for the reproductive health and rights of women. We should recall that she coined a now famous phrase \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d.</p> <h2>Poverty: Caroline Ratcliffe</h2> <p><em>Senior fellow and economist, Center on Labor, Human Services and Population at the Urban Institute</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d68254cee48d7b29e69f306c69e746e854bdfde/18_0_264_330/264.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Ratcliffe\" width=\"264\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Ratcliffe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urban Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost 14% of all Americans, and nearly 20% of American children, are poor. <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/low-income-working-families/projects/children-persistent-poverty\">Child poverty can have lifelong consequences</a> for health, education, earnings and more. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/seven-things-you-should-know-about-childhood-poverty\">Addressing the needs of poor young children and their parents is key</a>.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/06/14/fact-sheet-universal-preschool/\">to double the investment in Early Head Start</a> would expand the reach of educational and other supports for younger children and their families, such as home-visiting programs for new mothers.

  "<p>Sitting in a studio in Kensington, London, the designer Sebastian Conran walks me through a worst-case scenario. \u201cBasically, what it\u2019s looking for is a break in routine,\u201d he explains, pointing to a drawing of an elderly woman, collapsed on the floor of her home. \u201cThere\u2019s an event. The e-sensor in the room notices that you\u2019ve fallen over. MiRo goes to investigate.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://consequentialrobotics.com/\" title=\"\">MiRo</a> is a robotic dog. There is an early model close to where we are sitting. Its head sits above a torso without arms or legs, and its cartoonish eyes stare out below alert ears embedded with speakers. Conran\u2019s company describes it as a biomimetic companion robot, and says it will eventually work with facial recognition technology to make life easier for its owner \u2013 to prompt them to take medicine, or to remind them of visitors\u2019 names, or to question them if it thinks they\u2019re in trouble. Conran tells me to think of it as a cross between a pet and Radio 4\u2019s John Humphrys.</p> <p>\u201cIt tries talking to you,\u201d he continues, \u201cand then it will send a signal to the hub saying there seems to be a problem. The hub will then broadcast on the home speaker, asking again if you\u2019re all right, and telling you to slap your wrist.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The thing about human care is, unless you\u2019re particularly disabled you don\u2019t need someone there all the time</p> <footer> <cite>Sebastian Conran</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Conran points at the wristband the woman in the picture is wearing. It is another key part of his system, monitoring the vital signs of its wearer 24 hours a day. \u201cIf you slap your wrist the process will stop but will be logged,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t slap your wrist it will break through security, and go to a carer, who can see your heart rate and body temperature, and rewind your life using the cameras in the home to see what happened. So when the ambulance gets there, they\u2019ll know what they\u2019re working with.\u201d</p> <p>In this scenario all aspects of the house come together \u2013 the sensors in the room, the wristband, the biomimetic companion robot, the data hub, the cameras embedded in the ceiling\u2026 At other times, however, the system coalesces less firmly around the person living inside the home. Elsewhere in Conran\u2019s studio is a robot table being developed with Sheffield University. The table adjusts itself to suit the user\u2019s size and moves on four wheels across the floor directed by voice commands and tracking optics in the ceiling. The eventual aim is to attach a robotic arm to it, so that the table can move around the home, picking things up from shelves and bringing them to the user. Order a dinner from the apartment canteen, and the table will scoot through the building to deliver it.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about human care is, unless you\u2019re particularly disabled you don\u2019t need someone there all the time,\u201d Conran says. \u201cBut you do need to deal with loneliness and fear. If a carer comes to see you twice a week for an hour, what\u2019s happening in between? What\u2019s happening to people when a carer isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be977f64fc4e0767e453eea4ec3ec374ca77bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be977f64fc4e0767e453eea4ec3ec374ca77bfd/0_246_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan\u2019s Robear, which is capable of lifting patients.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan\u2019s Robear, which is capable of lifting patients.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conran is not the only one to ask these questions and look for answers in the use of robots and smart systems. In Japan, for example, where <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS?locations=JP\" title=\"\">26% of the population is aged 65 years or older</a>, Dr Toshiharu Mukai of Meijo University has been developing a robot capable of lifting patients out of beds and into wheelchairs. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/robear-bear-shaped-nursing-care-robot\" title=\"\">Robear</a>, is designed to look like an approachable white bear, and could, if successful, do a job that would normally involve several care workers. Closer to home, in Grantham, a prototype care robot was recently introduced to a sheltered housing centre. Part of an <a href=\"http://www.enrichme.eu/wordpress/\" title=\"\">EU-funded project</a> dedicated to investigating the ways technology can improve the day-to-day lives of elderly people, the robot is designed in part to \u2013 much like Conran\u2019s MiRo \u2013 combat loneliness, and to offer reminders for tasks such as taking medicine.</p> <p>Many of these visions are nascent, but at a time of rising elderly populations and dwindling public resources, they raise important questions about where we are going with care. Can robots serve as a useful supplement to human contact, or do economic realities mean technology is pushing us towards a future where some of society\u2019s most vulnerable are passed into the loving arms of machines?</p> <p>Travel up the A1 from London to a leafy parish in the home counties, and you\u2019ll find a house owned by the University of Hertfordshire. The two-storey building looks from the outside just like any other suburban home in Hatfield. There is a doorbell beside the front door, there are sofas, chairs, beds. There is food in the kitchen, there are pictures in frames. It isn\u2019t until you glimpse a monolithic, 200kg care robot that you can tell this isn\u2019t exactly a normal household.</p> <p>\u201cWe first did studies on campus. As researchers, that\u2019s what you usually do \u2013 lab experiments,\u201d says Kerstin Dautenhahn, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat we found is that participants in the experiment didn\u2019t really buy into the idea. What we realised is that we need to provide a more naturalistic environment. Something real.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/automated-city-robots-run-public-services-councils\">The automated city: do we still need humans to run public services?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Conran\u2019s vision of robotic companions and autonomous tables, Dautenhahn\u2019s home is angled towards a future where machines play a large part in how we care for the elderly. She says her coterie of robots provide a number of functions, from physical and cognitive assistance to social help. Some of the technology in the home is designed to help users fetch objects, some is made to remind them to take their medicine, some of it is designed to remind a person exactly who is standing beside them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also equipped as a smart home,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have more than 60 sensors in that house, not only omnidirectional cameras that can identify and track people, but also various sensors, such as ones for temperature, attached to all the hot and cold water taps, so we know when someone is in the bathroom and using the taps or flushing the toilet.</p> <p>\u201cWe have sensors attached to all the electrical devices, such as the TV, the kettle, the toaster and the fridge, so again we can detect when someone opens the fridge door, or puts on the kettle,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve also developed some algorithms for activity recognition, so based on the patterns of \u2013 for example \u2013 when someone makes a typical dinner or breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>Dautenhahn explains that the home observes a person\u2019s activities, and then makes judgments based on those observations. If the house can tell that a person is making breakfast, it could send a robot to approach and offer help. The sensors, with their ability to track activities and log this in a central data hub, allow the system to make predictions about a person\u2019s routine, and to notice if the routine has changed \u2013 if they are eating or exercising less, for example, or sleeping more. Sit in front of the TV for too long, and a robot could come around to encourage you to move.</p> <p>The last thing the researchers want is for people to feel bossed around, though Dautenhahn admits it\u2019s a difficult balance to strike. If you have a system that is created to protect an elderly person, and it notices that the homeowner hasn\u2019t drunk a glass of water for six hours, should it say something? Should it tell a neighbour?</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I have a PhD student who is specifically investigating our sense of control,\u201d says Dautenhahn. \u201cFor me, as a researcher, this issue has been part of our whole research agenda all the way. If you have a system in your house that is with you 24/7, monitoring everything that you do, then what you really don\u2019t want is to have the feeling that there\u2019s this super robot in the house \u2013 that you\u2019re no longer in control. If you have someone all the time criticising you, telling you that you haven\u2019t had anything to drink for five hours, you\u2019ll ask yourself: whose house is this?\u201d</p> <p>So whose house is it?</p> <p>When you consider the possibility of homes hosting a small army of integrated sensors and robots that may or may not be modelled on large white bears, you have to ask yourself whether these solutions conflict with the layout of, say, Edwardian terraced houses or postwar tower blocks. Dautenhahn bought a suburban home to test robots in a real-life living environment, but even she acknowledges that the clutter of everyday life isn\u2019t best suited to robots doing their job.</p> <p>\u201cFew people only have laminate flooring, no carpet or rugs, where everything is nice and clean and smooth,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s usually lots of things people have in their environment that make it more complex for robots. This is why some people argue that it might be better in the future for newly built homes to accommodate the requirements of technological solutions.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoS-40Xe75Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoS-40Xe75Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoS-40Xe75Q\">Toyota\u2019s human support robot.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With this comes a big question: should the homes of the future be designed around robots?

Such systems will presumably become less clunky over time, but image living in a house where you have to put everything you own into plastic boxes with labels for a robot to recognise. What will that do to a person\u2019s sense of control, not to mention personal identity?</p> <p>There is clearly a balance to be struck, but if we\u2019re thinking about radical changes to the architecture of our homes, what other sorts of structures we should be looking at? One nursing home in the Netherlands, for example, offers rent-free apartments to students in exchange for 30 hours of work each month with their elderly neighbours. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-dutch-village-where-everyone-has-dementia/382195/\" title=\"\">village of Hogewey</a>, on the outskirts of Amsterdam, has been built from the ground up to accommodate dementia patients. The 23 buildings in Hogewey are designed to be exact replicas of homes from the 1950s and the 1970s, each built to fit a person\u2019s perception of reality.</p> <p>Both of these, in very different ways, show that there is scope for social architecture that reconfigures the position of the elderly in society without technology. Instead of designing the architecture of our future around smart systems, should we be looking at structures that encourage cross-generational interaction, or that shape themselves in response to diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s? Perhaps, but there are, as always, economic issues.</p> <p>\u201cThere are fantastic examples of supportive, dignified care, and examples of carefully building community links between generations that function as a support system with benefits for both sides,\u201d says Lydia Nicholas, a digital anthropologist who has worked with the likes of Nesta, the Science Museum and the BBC. \u201cUnfortunately right now these are in conflict with enormous pressure to immediately cut costs.</p> <p>\u201cThese dementia villages employ a lot of people; they are expensive to run and have very long waiting lists. For a system under pressure it can be tempting instead to turn to technology solutions where potentially one nurse could look after many people because she has so much data on how all of them are moving and sleeping, whether they\u2019re eating on schedule, etc. In the short term sensors are cheap and people are expensive. But people can provide that essential human touch and connection that supports our health over the long term.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas tells me that it is unwise to think about future care for the elderly in terms of mutually exclusive visions. The aged population is not a monolithic entity but a varied range of age groups with different needs, different levels of ability and independence. It\u2019s not a question about all-in with technology or all-in with new social architectures, but rather a discussion about how these things can work together. That said, there are concerns about how machines can work with the current human-based care system, especially when you\u2019re dealing with councils facing increasingly precarious balance sheets.</p> <p>\u201cAs costs rise we could end up with the system either spending more and more on getting the same level of human care, or ending up with a lot less, and having to work with that in different ways,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cWe need to be ambitious, creative and careful in these new systems.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d personally be afraid if systems are being used to replace human contact</p> <footer> <cite>Kerstin Dautenhahn, professor of AI</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The technologists are keen to impress that their creations are designed to work alongside human care, not to replace it. And yet they also admit that they don\u2019t have a great deal of say in how their technology will actually be implemented. There\u2019s a sense that, in spite of good intentions, these techno-utopian visions could find themselves undermined by economic obstacles, not to mention fissures in our social fabric.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a kind of crisis,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cThe question is whether you can build systems that enable people to build their own support networks. Using technology and system change as much as possible, are there ways you can connect people up to their local community? Of course health and social care challenges don\u2019t exist in a vacuum; these issues must be addressed in the wider context of urgently needed work on community building and social cohesion in post-Brexit Britain.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Dautenhahn, as someone who designs robots that may one day be commonplace in care homes, whether there are concerns about how her machines may be used. \u201cI completely see that there is a danger for formal carers,\u201d she says. \u201cThe NHS for example could at some point decide the robots are doing a really good job, so maybe they can cut costs. Rather than having two visits a day, we could have just two visits a week, because, as you say, they have all the data.</p> <p>\u201cThis is certainly not something I\u2019d advocate,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019d personally be afraid if systems are being used to replace human contact, because there is a lot of misunderstanding about what robots are \u2013 that robots could have human-like qualities and give emotional support. For me, this is absolutely out of the question.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/rise-of-robots-evil-artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeley\">The rise of robots: forget evil AI \u2013 the real risk is far more insidious</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dautenhahn says she is against the idea of robots that resemble humans precisely for this reason. She tells me that there are things humans are good at, and there are things machines are good at. Posing a robot as a human could dangerously confuse these lines, potentially misleading authorities facing a strong drive to cut costs and automate processes. \u201cI can see this danger,\u201d she says. \u201cTherefore it is very important that we have this public discussion.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Conran\u2019s studio, he runs me through his vision of a smart home for an independent elderly person. He shows me a sketch of a single-floor flat. Sensors are dotted throughout, an autonomous table tends to the kitchen and a pair of MiRos wait attentively, close to the home\u2019s occupants. If one of them should fall, the robot dog will be on hand to ask them if they are OK. The sensor on their wrist will confirm if they aren\u2019t.</p> <p>Putting aside the question of whether the potential success of such a system would inadvertently dissuade authorities from investing in human carers, is a home like this something a person would actually want? Conran mentions an interesting point. For the generations now growing up that are accustomed to digital culture, centred on their whims and aspirations, the idea of 24-hour attention may even be desired.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are going to have completely different expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cWe expect the state to provide for us in a way that previous generations maybe didn\u2019t. Life has constantly got better and better, and we\u2019re coming up against the fact that, instead of getting better and better, things are dropping off. Ageing is not to be recommended.\u201d</p>",

It would do the Germans good to see it\u201d \u2013 Lindgren recounts the commotions of the grand theatres of war alongside the domestic dramas playing out in her life. By and large, the former preoccupies her attention.</p> <p>She gleans her information from a variety of written sources: daily newspapers (her original diary was full of pasted-in press cuttings), the news of which she reports fastidiously, demonstrating a keen understanding of the complex global political machinations at play; and the private post sent to, and coming from, other countries. She worked as a censor at the postal control division, describing it before she starts as \u201csecret \u2018defence work\u2019\u201d, but by the time it finishes in 1945, \u201cmy \u2018sordid job\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Rare personal distractions appear in the form of her daughter Karin\u2019s persistent ill health \u2013 it was she for whom Pippi was invented, to entertain the 10-year old while bedridden with measles \u2013 and a crisis in Lindgren\u2019s marriage in the summer of 1944: \u201cBlood is spilt, people are maimed, misery and despair are everywhere.

  "<p>Here we go again. The Equal Pay Act was introduced 46 years ago and yet from Thursday this week the UK\u2019s female workforce will effectively be working for free until 31 December, due to the scale of the gender pay gap.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/equal-pay-day-2/\" title=\"\">This year\u2019s \u201cequal pay day\u201d, which highlights the difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s salaries, is only one day later than it was last year</a>. This reflects the glacial pace of change in reducing the gulf between the genders in earnings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/26/weekly-uk-earnings-rose-2015-biggest-increase-since-financial-crash\" title=\"\">Average pay for full-time female employees is still 9.4% lower than for full-time male employees</a>, according to <a href=\"http://visual.ons.gov.uk/the-gender-pay-gap-what-is-it-and-what-affects-it/\" title=\"\">the latest official figures</a>. That gap is only slightly better than the 9.6% recorded in 2015 but at least an improvement on 17.4% back in 1997.</p> <p>Women continue to be penalised with lower pay and fewer promotions when they return to work after taking time away to care for children and because they tend to work in jobs with lower salaries, such as caring and administration. There is also a penalty for working part-time where pay, on average, is less per hour than in full-time work. And a far higher proportion of women work part-time \u2013 41%, compared with only 12% of men.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, when compared with other countries\u2019 records on gender equality, the UK has slipped down the global rankings. <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2016/\" title=\"\">It was the ninth most gender-equal country in 2006 but by this year had slipped to 20th place</a>, according to tables compiled by the World Economic Forum.</p> <p>At this pace, it will take decades to close the gender pay gap. On one estimate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/24/gender-pay-gap-wont-close-until-2069-says-deloitte\" title=\"\">equal pay will finally be achieved 99 years after the 1970 Equal Pay Act</a> was enacted.</p> <p>That\u2019s bad news for a government that has vowed to close the gap within a generation.</p> <p>To be fair, ministers have made some encouraging noises and even some meaningful changes. They include flexible parental leave and the national living wage, of which two-thirds of recipients are women.</p> <p>The government is also increasing the amount of free childcare on offer to working parents and \u2013 in a bid to put pressure on employers \u2013 from April next year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/12/gender-pay-gap-reporting-big-firms-start-2018\" title=\"\">all those with more than 250 staff will have to publish their gender pay gap</a>. There are also moves to get more women on boards.</p> <p>Even so, rather than celebrating the latest marginal improvement in the pay gap, as ministers did when the figures came out, it is time to come up with more radical moves to stamp out workplace discrimination, support women\u2019s careers and get more young women into higher-paying sectors.</p> <p>At the moment, girls and boys are let down by inadequate careers advice, and when they get into the workplace they are let down again by a chronic under-investment in training that traps far too many people in low-paying, low-skilled jobs.</p> <p>In placing employers under more scrutiny, the new rules in April should be helpful. But it is not enough to name and shame the worst offenders. Workers need more means to challenge those inequalities. Companies must be made to explain themselves.</p> <p>The government could start by scrapping the tribunal fees that stand in the way of many women getting justice from employers who have discriminated against them.</p> <p>In most cases, the pay gaps that come to light under the new disclosure rules next year will be down to the usual factors of more men than women being in the top jobs, as opposed to outright discrimination and men earning more than women for the same work. But if we accept those differences in seniority, we might as well give up on hopes of closing the pay gap. Instead, offending firms should be made to re-assess how they train and promote people, how they hire new staff and what kind of flexibility they offer.</p> <p>Theresa May called for gender equality when she set out her <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\" title=\"\">pledge for a \u201cBritain that works for everyone\u201d</a>.

The Pensions Regulator is the organisation best placed to rule on how to financially support an ailing pension scheme \u2013 the key is in the name. Yet, Green cannot bring himself to meet the watchdog\u2019s demands and is proposing a complex deal that would involve the BHS pensions becoming part of a new pension scheme that is not secured by a sponsoring company.</p> <p>The billionaire promised to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme, but we are still waiting for a settlement. It is now clear Green wants to \u201csort\u201d it on his terms, but as the size of the BHS deficit shows, he is not the ideal person to be dictating the terms of a pension rescue.</p> <p>The Pensions Regulator and its boss, Lesley Titcomb, are fighting for their future after the criticism they have received because of the BHS scandal. This, and the febrile political atmosphere around Green, add an extra dimension to their work. But at least their remit is focused on getting the best deal for BHS pensioners, who will ultimately have to pick up the bill if it enters the Pension Protection Fund, funded by a levy on other schemes.</p> <p>That is why the regulator is right to press ahead with formal action against Green, even if it could take years to resolve. In the meantime, hopefully Green will face up to his responsibilities to the 11,000 BHS workers who lost their jobs and agree to the regulator\u2019s demands. It should not be forgotten that while they have lost their jobs and some retirement benefits, Green has only lost his reputation.</p> <h2>M&amp;S faces bitter conflict on store closures</h2> <p>Get ready for a brutal battle between Marks &amp; Spencer, MPs and trade unions. The high street retailer clashed with politicians and union leaders when it tried to make changes to pay and pensions, but wait and see what happens when it announces next week that is closing dozens of shops and downsizing its clothing offer in others.</p> <p>M&amp;S may no longer produce the lucrative profits it did in its heyday in the late 1990s, but its shops are still the bastion of high streets across the country. Each of its shops can employ more than 100 people, and they offer towns a reliable collection of high-quality food and clothing.</p> <p>So, when M&amp;S proposes shutting a shop it is a big deal. The company tried to close nine last year, affecting 430 workers, sparking petitions and rows in places including Aldershot in Hampshire.</p> <p>Steve Rowe, the M&amp;S chief executive, is right to take action \u2013 the company has way more shops and retail space than its rivals. But M&amp;S is a British institution, and he won\u2019t find this an easy task.</p>",

Advocates like him, and many others who champion tobacco control, stand with the WHO to support governments in this fight.</p> <p>I am also heartened by progress on standardised or \u201cplain\u201d packaging \u2013 a measure introduced by the treaty and pioneered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/12/plain-packaging-to-thank-for-australias-decline-in-smoking-says-labor\">Australia, where smoking rates have now fallen to record lows</a>. The early evidence from Australia shows that plain packaging, as part of a comprehensive approach to tobacco control, is diminishing the appeal of tobacco products, increasing the effectiveness of health warnings and reducing the ability of the pack to mislead. France and the UK have begun implementing plain packaging laws, and New Zealand and Hungary have recently passed legislation. Many other countries are close behind.</p> <p>We have made great strides, but we have so much more to do. Tobacco use remains one of the most vexing challenges we face in the global health arena.</p> <p>I urge global leaders convening in India to see this moment as an opportunity to bend the course of public health history and commit to returning home with a renewed dedication to fully implement the WHO framework convention. To make the event effective, it is vital that governments recognise the inherent conflict between public health and the interests of the tobacco industry. Representatives from the latter should be completely excluded from government delegations. </p> <p>Every death from tobacco is an avoidable tragedy. It is our task to reverse the tide, effecting an irreversible decline in the number of such deaths.</p> <p>We need history to show us that the turning point in the tobacco epidemic is now. We know what to do and we know how to do it. We now need to ensure that every country moves forward and no one is left behind. Future generations depend on us.</p>",
  "<p>In the unlikely event that Alan Bennett, playwright and national treasure, and Chris Ware, comic artist extraordinaire, were to collaborate \u2013 I suppose there\u2019s still time \u2013 the result might turn out a bit like the winner of the 2016 <em>Observer</em>/Jonathan Cape/Comica graphic short story prize. <em>Colin&#xa0;Turnbull: A Tall Story</em>, the charming and rather plangent tale of a man who longs only to win Lancashire\u2019s Tallest Milkman competition, took its creator, Matthew Dooley, only two weeks to draw. But you\u2019d never know it. Look beyond its slightly surreal humour \u2013 it pokes fun at the silly, overblown language of sport \u2013 and you\u2019ll see that it also pays quiet tribute to the now rapidly diminishing army of men (and women) who continue, against the financial odds, to deliver a daily pint to doorsteps everywhere. Even as it makes the reader laugh, then, it has the quality of an elegy, which is perhaps why it won this year in spite of some exceptionally tough competition.</p> <p>Dooley, who works for the parliamentary education service at the Palace of Westminster, doesn\u2019t have a background in art: he studied classics at university, and laughs that it might be \u201cpushing it\u201d to suggest the friezes on classical Greek buildings can be seen as an early form of cartoon strip. Nevertheless, he has been trying to win the <em>Observer</em>/Cape/Comica competition for a while. This is, in fact, his fifth attempt. \u201cI drew incessantly as a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I read Asterix, Tintin and <em>2000AD</em>. But when I was about 15 or 16, I stopped. I didn\u2019t come back to comics or to drawing until my 20s when \u2013 I don\u2019t suppose this is an unusual story \u2013 I discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/aug/28/comics.politics\" title=\"\">Art Spiegelman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2014/sep/13/-sp-chris-ware-the-last-saturday-graphic-novel\" title=\"\">Chris Ware</a>. After that, I started dabbling again, which was difficult at first because I was so out of practice. The first proper comic I ever drew was the first one I put in for in the <em>Observer</em> competition, which I\u2019ve entered four times before. But that worked for me: I need some kind of external pressure to get going.\u201d</p> <p>Is he thrilled to have won at last? \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m pleased. But I\u2019m also very&#xa0;surprised.\u201d</p> <p>His idea wasn\u2019t a new one. \u201cYears ago, me and my friend, Chris, were knocking about ideas for sketches, and I had one for a milkman who was obsessed with being tall. I found it in an old notebook, and revived it: the combination of the mundane and the obsessive seemed like it would be just right for a comic. I set it in Lancashire, in a place like the one I grew up in: Ormskirk, which was quite bland and suburban\u2026 extraordinarily normal, I suppose you\u2019d say. I\u2019m a sports obsessive. I tend to live vicariously through the achievements of various sports people. But I do see that sport is inherently ridiculous, too.\u201d</p> <p>What about his drawings? The influence of Chris Ware seems obvious. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t dispute that, except my hands must be a lot more wiggly than his. I really like Chris Ware, but I\u2019m not deliberately trying to be like him. I think I\u2019m still looking for my own style. Finding one that\u2019s completely my own is a work in progress.\u201d Dooley hopes that winning the competition will open doors for him, though he has already begun contributing to small-press anthologies. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a go at something longer, and I\u2019m very aware of past winners like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/06/observer-graphic-short-story-prize-greenberg\" title=\"\">Isabel Greenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/07/observer-graphic-prize-stephen-collins\" title=\"\">Stephen Collins</a> [both bagged publishing deals with Jonathan Cape after winning], who are truly, truly brilliant.\u201d He also, of course, takes home \u00a31,000.</p> <p>This is the ninth year of the prize and the standard was as high as ever; among the stories\u2019 themes were the housing crisis and mass tourism on Mount Everest. The judges \u2013 our regular panel was joined this time by the cartoonist Steve Bell, and the novelist Sebastian Faulks \u2013 felt that half a dozen entries could ultimately have gone on to win, and certainly to be a runner-up. In the end, though, we gave the second prize to <em>Of Ice and Men</em>, a multilayered tale of global warming that comes with a ghastly (and topical) twist \u2013 the work of \u201cDoulos Nezblanc\u201d, better known as David Ross, a Zimbabwean-born former lawyer who now works in a London cinema. Exquisitely beautiful and thought-provoking, too, its final frame provoked explosive guffaws all around the judging table.</p> <p><em>An exhibition of the stories shortlisted for this year\u2019s competition can be seen at </em><a href=\"http://www.orbitalcomics.com/graphic-short-story-prize-competition-exhibition-and-winner-announcement/\" title=\"\"><em>Orbital Comics</em></a><em>, 8 Great Newport Street, London WC2, until 17 November </em></p>",
  "<p>When Sidhant Pai visited a local rubbish dump in his home city of Pune, India, he was struck by the size and intensity of the operation. Large black crows swooping overhead, roaming pigs, overwhelming odours and groups of waste pickers collecting plastic bottles in large white sacks. </p> <p>There are an estimated <a href=\"http://www.innovationseeds.eu/Network-Library/Core-Articles/Global-Alliance-Of-Waste-Pickers.kl\">15 million people</a> globally who currently make their living from waste picking and many earn less than a dollar a day. A key problem, says environmental engineer Pai, is that workers only capture a tiny proportion of the value of the waste they collect, separate and transport to scrap dealers.</p> <p>Together with his parents, Suchismita and Jayant Pai, he founded social enterprise Protoprint in 2012, one of a number of organisations trying to address the twin issues of poor conditions for waste pickers and plastic waste pollution. More than<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/plastic-new-epoch-human-damage\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/plastic-new-epoch-human-damage\">300m tonnes of plastic</a> are produced globally every year, with much ending up in the ocean (one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/more-plastic-than-fish-in-the-sea-by-2050-warns-ellen-macarthur\">refuse truck\u2019s worth every minute</a>), in landfill, or on city streets.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE1uHxIzU5E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QE1uHxIzU5E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>ProtoPrint video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cOur focus was on looking into different ways to add value to the waste, we were agnostic about the specific product,\u201d Pai says. After experimenting with making a few different products, Protoprint settled on making the plastic filament \u2013 the \u201cink\u201d \u2013\u00ad for 3D printers. \u201cIt added a tremendous amount of value to the waste plastic while still being relatively simple to manufacture at the dump.\u201d</p> <p>Protoprint partnered with SWaCH, a Pune-based cooperative wholly owned by waste pickers. Together they have set up a low-cost filament production facility at a local rubbish dump in Pune operated by SWaCH waste pickers to convert plastic waste \u2013 specifically high-density polyethylene (HPDE) mostly used for plastic bottles \u2013 into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to Indian or international 3D printing companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cc6fd79b3eac1c0ebe5a574f23fed3c85b8c5f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc6fd79b3eac1c0ebe5a574f23fed3c85b8c5f9/0_0_1328_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protoprint waste pickers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"542\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protoprint waste pickers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Protoprint</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Protoprint buys filament from SwaCH for 300 rupees (\u00a33.50) per kg \u2013 if waste pickers sold the plastic waste directly to scrap merchants the pickers would receive around 19 rupees (23p) per kg, says Pai. \u201cAfter factoring in the costs of production and the various other expenses, there is still a six to eight times multiplier per kilogram of filament,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The market for filament, the majority of which is made from virgin plastic, is growing rapidly. A <a href=\"http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/3d-printing-materials.asp\">report</a> by a leading markets analyst predicted the 3D printing materials market would grow by nearly 266% over the next five years, to be worth \u00a31.07bn by 2021. </p> <p>However, most of it is expensive because of production and export costs, says William Hoyle, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.techfortrade.org/\">TechforTrade</a>. The British charity is working to promote and standardise an ethical way for filament to be made from the plastic collected by waste collectors. <br></p> <p>Ethical filament will be cheaper to buy than commercial filament, Hoyle says, because waste plastic is free resource and production costs are lower in developing countries.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe ethical filament standard is an open standard,\u201d says Hoyle. \u201cWe see the certification process happening in two ways. First, the social, environmental and economic assessment would be done by the waste collection organisation ... Second, the technical quality standard will be assessed by an independent third party and we are in discussion with a specialist assessor that will undertake this task.\u201d</p> <p>Amsterdam-based ReFlow, a social enterprise based in the Netherlands, works with one of TechforTrade\u2019s printing partners in Tanzania, STICLab, on a pilot project in Dar es Salaam.</p> <p>Co-founder Jasper Middendorp compares the potential of 3D printing to the development of mobile banking or solar in Africa, both of which flourished because infrastructure was broken. </p> <p>\u201cTanzania is highly import dependent and has very little of its own production infrastructure,\u201d he says, and 3D printing decentralises production without a huge capital expense or a great deal of specialised knowledge. This, he says, helps \u201cmake countries more self-sufficient instead of importing products from abroad that may not be suited to the local context\u201d.</p> <p>Previously supported by seed funding and the founders\u2019 own money, ReFlow has just closed off a Kickstarter campaign, raising \u20ac26,000 (\u00a323,000) and plans to launch the product in Amsterdam in February 2017. However, it is still working on quality control. \u201cWe haven\u2019t produced market quality filament yet,\u201d says Middendorp, \u201cbut we are hoping to do so within a month.\u201d </p> <p>The quality of the filament made from recycled waste plastic is a challenge for the whole 3D printing industry, says Pai.

Much of the recycled filament is destined for \u201cthe open source market for low-end products,\u201d he says, \u201cthey may not look glamorous but they are still functional products that can be used in development contexts\u201d.</p> <p>The greatest potential 3D printing offers the developing world is not for the products made, but for \u201cputting the means of production into the hands of the local people\u201d, says Jeremy Faludi, a sustainable design strategy consultant and teacher at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. The market for ethical filament is a small one, he adds, but \u201cif the quality can match virgin filament at a similar price point, then it can be a large market.

Creating \u201chotspots\u201d to relocate refugees in other countries, she said, would \u201cprotect Italian citizens\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/italy-five-star-movement-protest-problem-solving-elections\">Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement now has to translate protest into problem-solving | Francesco Grillo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about some of the less mainstream theories the party has supported, Ferrara denied M5S opposed vaccinations, but said it wanted to urge parents to be more vigilant about which vaccines they gave their children, saying that both the flu vaccine and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8925.pdf?ua=1\">varicella</a> \u2013 or chickenpox \u2013 vaccine were portrayed by doctors as obligatory even though they were not mandatory by law.

  "<p>Alicia Keys has taken over Times Square, bringing five blocks of one of the busiest areas of the western world to its knees. Her \u201csecret\u201d gig tonight is not so secret. She\u2019ll commandeer the epic digital billboards and her face \u2013 lightly freckled and without makeup, as is her way these days \u2013 will flash all over American Eagle Outfitters.</p> <p>Times Square is Keys\u2019s back yard. She was born in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 1981 and grew up in a one-bedroom apartment on 43rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenue. Her teenage years coincided with the tenure of Mayor Rudy Giuliani: the street is now quietly gentrified, and features the Manhattan Plaza Health Club.</p> <p>She has booked the entire 57th floor of the W hotel to dress for the gig, rest, and do this interview in promotion of <a href=\"http://www.aliciakeys.com/alicia-announces-new-album-and-debuts-new-single/\"><em>Here</em></a>, her first album in four years. Her complicated management system functions like an onion. There is an outer layer of nervy young people glued to Samsungs, a middle layer of big characters in bomber jackets who emerge before show time and hand out laminates, and an inner layer \u2013 Key\u2019s confidants and partners in her company, AK Worldwide: longtime manager and co-writer Erika Rose (headscarf and curly haired child in sling), and DJ Walton \u2013 who is, among many things, a vocal coach and boxing coach with two full sleeves of tattoos.</p> <p>The machinery around the star exists as a shock absorber, and Alicia\u2019s suite is almost temple-like in its serenity. Four shadowy figures sit on high-backed chairs, like guests at a strange, gloomy dinner party. Two cameramen swoop around the room, filming the proceedings \u2013 everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Janelle Mon\u00e1e has their own personal film team these days, capturing your interview for their \u201cpersonal archive\u201d, or their legal department.</p> <p>In the corner is a girl in a headscarf and jeans who looks so unassuming I think it\u2019s another assistant. Alicia Keys moves to the sofa in her socks, pulls her knees up, and begins talking in her soft, low, boyish voice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>New York wasn\u2019t like a\u00a0beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTimes Square was dark \u2013 gee, it was dismal,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 80s, when I was a little girl, this whole Midtown area was a different world. These are the streets that I walked, and learned my lessons on, and heard the music, and witnessed disenfranchised people, and people who just had dreams and hopes. Every pimp, every prostitute, every drug dealer, every Broadway dreamer wishing they could be a writer, or a musician, or an actor.\u201d</p> <p>Her white, Italian-Irish mother, Terria Augello (now Joseph), raised her alone, working as a legal assistant at the Chadbourne and Parke law firm at the Rockefeller Center from the year before she was born until 2001, when her daughter\u2019s debut album, <em>Songs in A Minor</em>, was released (it went on to sell 12m copies). Mum had attended NYU\u2019s School of the Arts and worked on and off as an actor. She started her daughter young: at four, Alicia got a part in <em>The Cosby Show</em>, as one of Rudy Huxtable\u2019s sleepover guests, and can be seen, small and giggling, riding Bill\u2019s leg like a bucking bronco.</p> <p>At 12, in 1993, she attended the newly created, publicly funded Professional Performing Arts School, 10 minutes walk from home and just off Broadway. Claire Danes and Britney Spears were pupils at one time. She was tutored by \u201cMiss Aziza\u2026\u201d she says wistfully. <a href=\"http://www.azizamiller.com/\">Aziza Miller</a> \u2013 \u201cOne of the most phenomenal women jazz instructors ever to be born. She was a pianist, an arranger, a producer, a composer, and she had so much vocal prowess. She was badass. And I know for a fact that she influenced a large part of what I became.\u201d</p> <p>The school kept her off the streets. \u201cYou walked out the door, you had to be ready to protect yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cBe covered up, just get to where you were going. I couldn\u2019t wear skirts, I couldn\u2019t wear heels. On the other hand, it was kind of the area where whoever didn\u2019t belong anywhere else could come, and belong.\u201d</p> <p>From mean streets to stage school to the big time, all by the age of 20, it was the American dream. When Keys released her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc\">Fallin\u2019</a>, in 2001 she already had a certain kind of pedigree. She\u2019d been taken on by Clive Davis, who\u2019d signed Janis Joplin and mentored Whitney Houston. Her songs, filled with jazz chords and tinkling Moonlight Sonata-style intros, appealed to a mature audience as well as a young one; another big hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8Hr50Ckwk\">If I Ain\u2019t Got You</a>, sounds like a thumping Motown classic now. She was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8RrY_HZH9c\">beloved of Stevie Wonder</a>, and Bob Dylan got all soppy about her, writing in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RPkJeziNyI\">Thunder on the Mountain</a>, \u201cI was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn\u2019t keep from crying/ When she was born in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, I was living down the line\u2026\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DWACsH1f2So?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\">Listen to Alicia Keys\u2019s Blended Family (What You Do for Love).</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Today, at 35 but looking 25, she is \u2013 strangely \u2013 an elder stateswoman of the sound that has dominated pop in the 21st century. She judges <em>The Voice</em> alongside Miley Cyrus but her own lacks the melismatic warble of modern R&amp;B. Even her new album <em>Here</em> \u2013 full of ice-cool songs celebrating life\u2019s confusions and compromises \u2013 bears a closer relationship to neo-soul than the songwriting teams of Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna.</p> <p>She\u2019s already had one comeback \u2013 2010\u2019s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3xkxcbnc7G3XYuZt6eUnI5\"><em>Empire State of Mind</em></a>, with her friend Jay Z, is the biggest New York song since Sinatra\u2019s. And she has remained, quietly, part of the hip-hop elite: she\u2019s known Beyonc\u00e9 since they were 16, and was one of the first artists to sign to Tidal; she\u2019s struck up sponsorship deals with everyone from BlackBerry to American Express, and has a formidable philanthropy career. Then there\u2019s the politics: she performed between Bill and Hillary Clinton at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/26/democratic-convention-day-two-clinton-nominee-sanders\">Philadelphia\u2019s Democratic National Convention in July</a>. Which was a difficult day all round, apparently.</p> <p>\u201cReally, it was pretty emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cBernie was coming up to support Hillary at that time, and there was this real disappointed energy \u2013 because Bernie is so beloved, and he has such powerful thoughts and ideas that really resonate with people. There was this energy to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a huge divide within the party, because that would have been devastating. I remember just wanting to relay that.\u201d</p> <p>She says she sees in Clinton the possibility for \u201chow powerful women can be\u201d, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s emotional for me as a black woman, wanting to make sure that all the issues are addressed in America when it comes to race, when it comes to black people \u2013 wanting to make sure that message isn\u2019t lost. And that it is continuously on all our agendas \u2013 particularly Hillary\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Is she confident (we are talking four weeks ahead of the election) about the outcome?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just refuse to believe that anything else is going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also know it\u2019s only going to happen if we\u2019re getting out and registering to vote. We have hope, we have potential; that I do believe in.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, Keys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/15/aliciakeys.urban\">told <em>Blender</em> magazine</a> she thought the Black Panther movement would have gone global if they\u2019d had the platform musicians have today. She might have to start something herself, she mused at the time \u2013 then Black Lives Matter came along and she didn\u2019t have to. Tidal donated $1.5m this year, on what would have been Trayvon Martin\u2019s 21st birthday. In July, Keys\u2019s charitable foundation, <a href=\"http://weareheremovement.com/\">We Are Here,</a> put together a protest film \u2013<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_VaNhI4CLo\"> \u201c23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\u201d</a> \u2013 which featured Rihanna and Pharrell Williams.

Artists reach people at their heart; it\u2019s the only time we meet in one place and put our differences aside. When you\u2019re in a forum listening to music, all you feel in that moment is love and the understanding.\u201d</p> <p>Keys has known her husband, the producer <a href=\"http://www.swizzworld.com/\">Swizz Beatz</a> (Kasseem Dean), since she was about 16, though they took years to get together. Kanye West once called Dean, 38, the best rap producer of all time. His more unusual accolades include global ambassador for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a place at Harvard Business School. Dean already had three children when he married Keys in 2010. His first son, Prince Nasir, with Nicole Levy, is 16. There\u2019s another, Kasseem, with Harlem songwriter Mashonda Tifrere, singer of the song <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/30612707\">No Panties</a>. And a girl, Nicole, by Jahna Sebastian, whose website claims she helped bring grime to Russia.</p> <p>Keys faced her share of scandal with the relationship, and covers it in the new single B<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\">lended Family (What You Do for Love)</a>, which includes a direct address to her stepchildren: \u201cI know it started with a little drama/ I hate you had to read it in the paper/ But everything\u2019s alright with me and your momma\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my personal journey with my family, and creating a family that\u2019s built on compassion and understanding,\u201d she says, in her broad, new age-y way. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy road. A lot of the modern family is children from different relationships. That\u2019s what family is today, and there\u2019s never been a song about how beautiful it is. There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love for the kids. \u201d</p> <p>Her stepchildren, she says, call her Umi, which is Arabic for mother. Kasseem Dean is Muslim: \u201c4 years of greatness and cheers to 100 plus more inshallah\u201d he Instagrammed, on their anniversary. I ask her if she has converted to Islam. There is a pause, then she says:</p> <p>\u201cI love learning about different religions, and discovering the different ways to worship, and to love the greatness and the higher being that surrounds us all. I definitely believe in a bigger presence, and I really respect all religions; at their core they all teach the same message \u2013 community and kindness and looking out for each other.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HazJhPnrB8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\">Watch the video for Alicia Keys\u2019s In Common.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Growing up, she rarely saw her own father, Craig Cook \u2013 an air steward of Jamaican background, who became a masseur \u2013 but she maintained a close relationship with his parents (though her father\u2019s absence was not, she points out, \u201cexactly a topic for the dinner table\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cI did have a deeper relationship with my nana than I did with my father, and again, that\u2019s how life goes. There\u2019s no rulebook. My grandmother was a very loving woman. The table would be filled with Christmas cards. She could cook really well too \u2013 and then one day, she just decided to stop. My grandfather had passed. Something just changes, you know?\u201d</p> <p>When her grandmother became terminally ill in 2006, Keys took off for Egypt for three weeks by herself. That a single holiday had such a formative impact on her reminds you how young she was when fame hit. She named the first of her two sons Egypt, five years later. Like his namesake with its \u201cimpossible structures\u201d, Egypt Dean loves to build. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s obsessed. He\u2019s like an architect.\u201d</p> <p>At five years old, the tot already has a co-credit producing a song for Kendrick Lamar \u2013 untitled 07, on Lamar\u2019s <em>untitled unmastered</em> album (sample lyric: \u201cshut your fucking mouth and get some cash you bitch!\u201d). He was <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/6898221/swizz-beatz-son-egypt-dean-kendrick-lamar-untitled-unmastered-project\">posted on Instagram by his father</a>, playing a piano intro. \u201cHe really did it,\u201d she assures me. \u201cHe came up with it, heard the melody, picked it out on his piano, and brought it to the studio. Played it, programmed it.

The stuff made her feel like a \u201cchameleon\u201d, she says. Going without it is a terrific marketing trick: she even wrote a lyric that goes, \u201cMaybe all this Maybelline is covering my esteem\u201d. And her makeup artist recently revealed that the no-makeup look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/alicia-keys-no-makeup-look-not-quite-real\">actually requires quite a bit of makeup</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8/0_0_6208_6934/895.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Keys\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Keys: \u2018Mary J Blige really resonated with me because she was from New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Kudacki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the campaign certainly suits Keys\u2019s muted, delicately retro R&amp;B persona. Like an American Neneh Cherry, what she was doing 15 years ago feels significant now. Compared with the modern-day vogue for ironic sluttiness, and the subsequent nail-biting over what it means to be feminist in pop, Keys and many of her contemporaries around the millennium offered something comparatively nuanced. Like TLC, her style was boyish \u2013 trousers, boots and braids \u2013 but her lyrics examined love and its vulnerability. One of her signature songs, You Don\u2019t Know My Name, feels almost quaint now, as she poses as a waitress and rings the guy in the \u201cfly blue suit\u201d to ask him out: \u201cI know girls don\u2019t usually do this\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was a relaxed kind of self-possession, girl power without a soapbox. When I ask her what was going on, she lights up.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, it was so good,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1990s, with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, those really big female artists were very glamorous, it was all about the glamour at that time. And so there was a big switch, the desire to be more who you were, not so beholden to this whole standard of beauty. It was a liberation. You see Mary J Blige \u2013 she did the same, wearing the combat boots.\u201d</p> <p>So it was an attitude, as much as a fashion?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, definitely. Mary really resonated with me because she was from New York, and that\u2019s what New York looked like: it wasn\u2019t like a beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly. That represented the type of girl that I was, so that worked for me.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think there\u2019s been a change, in the way female R&amp;B looks now?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/alicia-keys-review-roundhouse-london\">Alicia Keys review \u2013 soul singer opens door to blistering basement bash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes. To me, it just seems like there\u2019s a lot less variety,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the TLCs, or the Marys, you had a chance to see women in different orbits. [TLC\u2019s] Chilli was one way, T-Boz had a whole other style. Now, I think we see almost only one thing when it comes to female performers. Obviously they\u2019re beautiful, so you want to emulate that. But I think there\u2019s some confusion as to what beauty looks like \u2013 it can only be oversexualised. What\u2019s refreshing is when you see people who know how to express themselves in a multitude of ways.</p> <p>\u201cWe think \u2013 or maybe we\u2019re shown \u2013 that the only way to express ourselves is through that very sexy energy. I think there\u2019s more than that which shows our power. For me, I sometimes feel the most sexy when I\u2019m totally covered head to toe.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in the week that it was revealed that Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-howard-stern-tapes-women-35_uk_57fa46e1e4b01fa2b904368b\">acknowledged that his daughter is a piece of ass \u2013 and that 35 is the age he tends to check out on a woman</a>.</p> <p>She cracks her knuckles unnervingly loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to anything that he says.

  "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live\" title=\"\">landmark legal decision last Thursday</a>, the high court upheld a legal challenge brought against the government by Gina Miller and others, and ruled the government cannot use the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, and so formally commence the process to leave the EU, without parliamentary approval.</p> <p>The court\u2019s judgment means that the process must be subject to parliamentary control and oversight. Importantly (especially in the light of some recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">media comments</a>), the court stressed that this is purely a question of law and that the court is not concerned with, and does not express any view about, the merits of leaving the EU. That is a political consideration.</p> <p>In brief, the case arose because article 50 allows the UK to withdraw from the EU \u201cin accordance with its own constitutional requirements\u201d \u2013 but there was disagreement as to what the UK constitution actually requires.</p> <p>The government argued that it could use royal prerogative powers (namely, that residue of monarchical authority now exercised by ministers) to authorise the UK\u2019s withdrawal. While it is clear that prerogative powers cover international relations and the conclusion of treaties, it is settled UK constitutional law that an act of parliament \u2013 in this case the European Communities Act (ECA) 1972 \u2013 cannot be supplanted by the exercise of a prerogative power.</p> <p>The court accepted the claimants\u2019 arguments that, once notice is given under article 50, some rights under EU law (as incorporated into domestic law by the ECA) would inevitably be lost on completion of the article 50 process. Therefore, the government cannot give notice under article 50 without reference to parliament. This judgment can be seen as a victory for parliament. During the EU referendum, voters were constantly urged to \u201ctake back control\u201d and regain parliamentary sovereignty from the EU.</p> <p>Yet in what sense is parliament taking back control, if the government is able, using its ancient prerogative powers, to manage the whole EU withdrawal process without any significant parliamentary involvement? That would be extremely undemocratic \u2013 and democracy is what we are told the EU referendum was about.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every UK national has been endowed with rights under EU law. Some of these will vanish on triggering article 50</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, the court\u2019s judgment makes clear that the exclusion of parliament in the process is not only undemocratic, it is illegal. There is a wealth of case law supporting the claimants\u2019 case, some of it dating back to the 17th century and the English civil wars. Those wars, and the ejection of two kings during that century, established that parliament is sovereign and that the executive cannot ignore it, where it has no legal authority to do so.</p> <p>This judgment makes clear that the government does not have any such legal authority in the context of triggering article 50. However, it must be stressed that the judgment also makes clear the importance of rights in the Brexit process. Much of the judgment concerns legal arguments over the ECA, which can seem arcane. Yet they are of vital importance to every citizen.</p> <p>The EU has been described as a \u201cnew legal order\u201d and it is in many important aspects different from ordinary international law. One such aspect has been the extent to which it confers rights on individuals. Through the ECA, every UK national has been endowed with rights under EU law \u2013 rights of free movement and residence in other EU countries, but also many other types of rights, such as employment rights, consumer rights, or rights to information. Some of these will vanish as a result of triggering article 50 and the withdrawal process.</p> <p>The government has said it will transfer some EU law into UK law through a \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d, and then decide in future whether or not to retain it. Thursday\u2019s judgment makes clear that decisions that inevitably remove rights may not be taken by the executive alone. Parliament must be consulted.</p> <p>What are the practical consequences of this judgment? First, a government spokesperson has said the government will appeal, in which case it will be fast-tracked and heard very quickly by the UK supreme court. The government might try to change its position, and argue that a notification under article&#xa0;50 could be revoked \u2013 this would be the opposite of its high court concession that triggering article 50 would inevitably result in the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (and so lead to loss of individual rights). At present both government and claimants are treating the triggering of article 50 as the inevitable point when it becomes clear that the ECA will be repealed.</p> <p>But if it were acknowledged that such a move is reversible, the point would be that, in triggering article 50 by&#xa0;executive act, the government would not be subverting statute at that point, it would not be rendering the ECA a dead letter, inevitably leading to a loss of rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/05/barristers-urge-liz-truss-to-condemn-attacks-on-brexit-ruling-judges\">Liz Truss defends judiciary after Brexit ruling criticism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some believe a notification under article&#xa0;50 is revocable. But this would involve a question of EU law, and the final answer could only be given by the&#xa0;European court of justice. Moreover, such a reversal of the government\u2019s arguments would be politically risky, as it would amount to acknowledging that the UK might decide not to leave the EU, and that Brexit does not mean Brexit after all, perhaps not a very likely position for the government to take.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s ruling is a strong judgment, by a powerful trio of judges including the lord chief justice, and its reasoning looks hard to overturn. If the ruling stands, it will be necessary for a bill to be introduced in parliament. Although it is highly unlikely parliament will vote against triggering article&#xa0;50, parliament may well seek to impose certain conditions on the government.</p> <p>The June referendum resulted in a vote for the UK to leave the EU. However, it did not determine the way in which the UK leaves the EU. The court\u2019s judgment means that the elected parliament will have a role in debating and deciding many matters, rather than their being determined in private by the executive.</p> <p>Finally, the judgment raises a question of the role of the devolved nations. If Westminster is to be involved, what about the devolved parliaments? By constitutional convention, devolved parliaments are asked for their consent when Westminster either legislates with regard to devolved matters (see section 28(8) of the Scotland Act) or where it legislates to increase or reduce their powers. If a bill is introduced allowing article&#xa0;50 to be triggered, would this require legislative consent motions, and, if so, would the devolved nations give their consent? Conflicting answers have been given on this point, and the issue is highly politically charged.</p> <p>One thing is clear \u2013 Brexit is constitutionally fascinating, as well as constitutionally problematic. It also raises as many difficult questions for our understanding of the British constitution as it does of the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union.</p> <p><em>Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott is anniversary chair in law and co-director at the Centre for Law and Society in a Global Context, Queen Mary School of Law, University of London</em></p>",
  "<p>I came down to an empty kitchen one morning and saw my everyday knife sitting alone on the work surface. With the early morning light glancing off its blade, it looked, well, lethal.

A \u00a36,000 <a href=\"http://www.secretsofsushi.com/yanagiba\">Japanese yanagiba</a> might tell a glorious saga of samurai blades, of complex hand-forging by arcane methods, of a culture that treats the slicing of fish as an art form, but even each of my own knives, lying in the back of a drawer, embodied a little narrative of their culture, place and time.</p> <p>The first knife I remember was my nan\u2019s bread knife. Made by Prestige, it had a chromed steel serrated blade with a tiny length of tang stuck into a wooden handle. It was jazzily painted in those colours that spoke of the postwar boom but, if you ever clambered up the class ladder far enough to put it in a dishwasher, the blade would rust, the handle split and the paint peel off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adbc2be9afe48cae60fa423a9433fb85169ab7ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbc2be9afe48cae60fa423a9433fb85169ab7ba/0_233_8717_5233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cut to the quick: a selection of old knives whose blades have been sharpened so many times they are gaining new shapes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cut to the quick: a selection of old knives whose blades have been sharpened so many times they are gaining new shapes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Terry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bread knife is a peculiarly British confection. We had the industrial revolution before anyone else and were the first to mass-produce bread. Artisanal loaves required skilled hand-shaping but baking in tins didn\u2019t. The boxy shape of a British loaf told a story of de-skilling a craft; its whiteness and soft crust symbolised deep-seated class aspirations. And, unlike a crisp baguette, our loaf could no longer be torn. It had to have a special serrated knife to cut the doorstep slices which, to this day, define the national bacon sandwich.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know where Mum got a <a href=\"http://www.sabatier.com/\">Sabatier</a> from. I don\u2019t remember having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/08/elizabeth-david-first-lady-of-food\">Elizabeth David</a> books on the shelf as a child and there were neither<a href=\"https://www.lecreuset.com/\"> Le Creusets</a> nor <a href=\"http://www.agaliving.com/\">Aga</a>s in my early years. It must have been some time in the 1970s that it arrived, along with sophisticated p\u00e2t\u00e9 spooned from big ceramic pots at Sainsbury\u2019s and the oil and vinegar which, one day, mysteriously supplanted the salad cream. We had moved to a new town after Dad was promoted, and there were new influences on the family.</p> <p>I remember it was incredibly easy to get a wicked edge on the Sabatier by dragging it along a steel, but it was blackened by cutting lemons and made onions go a weird grey colour. I think Mum actually hated it. She was certainly diligent in blunting it on the same steel every time I sharpened it, in case anyone got hurt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"637e082ddefd83157a6eb062602dddc45b8ed41c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/637e082ddefd83157a6eb062602dddc45b8ed41c/0_96_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To the point: sharpening a blade using traditional techniques.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the point: sharpening a blade using traditional techniques.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Terry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around 1998, when Gordon Ramsay first graced our screens, I was an obnoxious foot-soldier in an ad agency and was fully bought into the idea of \u201ccooking as a lifestyle statement\u201d.

It had become clear during the Conservative party conference that the government was intent on a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, involving the removal of the UK from the customs union and the single market, and that it believed the referendum gave it a mandate, if not a democratic duty, to deliver.</p> <p>There had been a period of sniping from the Remainers, but it had been judged of little consequence, Flynn suggested.

A No 10 spokesman said May had explained to European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel that \u201cwhile the government is disappointed by the judgment, we remain of the firm belief that we have strong legal arguments ahead of the case which will be moving to the supreme court next month\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister also confirmed that the planned timetable for notification of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">article 50</a> remains the same,\u201d the spokesman added. Whether that proves to be the case \u2013 May has promised to trigger article 50 by the end of March \u2013 is very much open to question.</p> <p>The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has confirmed that a parliamentary bill will most likely be necessary if the high court\u2019s ruling is upheld, and such a bill could be amended with stipulations over everything from a second referendum on the terms of the final deal to mere reassurances on general goals. The proposed legislation may bounce between the Commons and the Lords over weeks and months. \u201cWe will make sure that we build into that bill a referendum that will take place before the UK leaves the EU to give us the opportunity to endorse or reject that deal,\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d3248d4a96ec690cebe272b9d2daff67cf5deb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3248d4a96ec690cebe272b9d2daff67cf5deb7/0_65_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, the prime minister\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, the prime minister, has told European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel that she believes the government has strong legal arguments to take to the supreme court next month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sign of the import</strong> of the moment, for the first time since the court was established in 2009, all 11 justices of the supreme court will now sit to hear the government\u2019s appeal over four days in early December.</p> <p>On which way the judges will fall, every politician has a view. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and justice secretary, said he felt that the verdict was \u201cin line with modern constitutional law\u201d. \u201cNobody starts a war nowadays without getting parliamentary approval, and nobody should completely break economic and trade links with our closest allies without parliamentary approval\u201d, he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThe referendum was always supposed to be advisory.\u201d</p> <p>The former cabinet minister, John Redwood, one of John Major\u2019s famous Maastricht \u201cbastards\u201d, who made the then prime minister\u2019s attempts to sign that EU treaty such a torture, insisted that the decision would be swiftly seen as a piece of \u201cshoddy work\u201d and rejected. \u201cI assume the government is right and they will reverse the lower court\u2019s decision, because it is such a bad decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe passage on the referendum is just laughable. They just assert that it is advisory when every household was sent a letter making it very clear that we [the people] are making the decision and parliament will implement it for you. It was in the Hansard record and the prime minister repeated it. The supreme court has every reason to say \u2018You haven\u2019t understood referenda\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On Monday the government</strong> will make a statement in parliament on the matter, and a cross-party meeting of MPs who had campaigned for Remain concluded that they would wait until the new ruling to take any decisions on the way forward. But already even those who say they will not block article 50 out of respect to their constituents are citing an array of reassurances that they will require in any upcoming bill. Parliament has been jolted back to life. \u201cCentral government is dominated by the London perspective and the London economy,\u201d said Andy Burnham, the MP for Leigh who is standing to be the mayor of Manchester. \u201cWe can\u2019t have trade deals that protect the City of London but sacrifice other sectors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4176f00b2eb62e77540e25da5bccf14b3bb9ec9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4176f00b2eb62e77540e25da5bccf14b3bb9ec9d/0_199_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We can\u2019t have trade deals that protect the City of London but sacrifice other sectors,\u2019 says former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke added: \u201cI will vote against article 50. That shouldn\u2019t shock anybody. I have believed it is in the national interest to be in the EU for the last 50 years, and big events have proved me overwhelmingly right over that period. The key thing is where we move on from that. To start holding the government to account.</p> <p>\u201cThe referendum decided we would leave but no two ministers are agreed on what steps are and what alternative we are putting in place. Once the government has agreed on a policy on our economic and trading relations with the wider world, it seems to be plain that it is accountable to parliament for that policy.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative MP Stephen Phillips, who campaigned to leave the EU, quit his seat on Friday in protest at the government\u2019s attempt to sideline parliament\u2019s role in shaping Brexit.</p> <p><strong>But as parliament stirs</strong>, so have many of the people who voted for leaving the EU but who came to believe last week, with encouragement from some in the media and political classes, that something undemocratic is afoot. It is even believed by some that those who are celebrating last week\u2019s victory may come to reap a whirlwind, especially if the prime minister feels that she needs a general election to change the nature of parliament in favour of her goals. \u201cThe Lib Dems think defying the referendum result is an electoral ticket back to the big time,\u201d said former justice minister Dominic Raab. \u201cTheir antics just look like irresponsible opportunism, precisely when the country needs to see some unity of purpose behind the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>In the country at large, the mood has become newly toxic. Waiting for his wife outside Gloucester\u2019s historic New Inn on Friday, Ray Marchmont said he was fed up with politicians, politics, the judiciary and probably the media. Gloucester voted Leave by 58.5% to Remain\u2019s 41.5% in June, and Marchmont supported the winning side. \u201cMy vote\u2019s gone out of the window,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken it away from us. I didn\u2019t know anything about this court case. It was a shock when I heard about it, I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. They\u2019ve just said, stuff it, we\u2019re going to do what we want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67fbbd655c624f336dd047f7b31535de1ee27084\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67fbbd655c624f336dd047f7b31535de1ee27084/806_0_2419_3024/800.jpg\" alt=\"MP Stephen Phillips\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Conservative MP Stephen Phillips quit his seat in protest at the government\u2019s attempt to sideline parliament\u2019s role in shaping Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 66-year-old Ukip supporter, added: \u201cI think a lot of it is sour grapes. They\u2019ve said \u2018you have your vote, now we\u2019re going to decide\u2019. If they do vote to turn it over, then I think there could be repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqui Robins, who like Marchmont lives in the city and was one of the 37,776 people to vote Leave in Gloucester, also expressed bewilderment. \u201cIf it\u2019s the people\u2019s choice, then the politicians shouldn\u2019t go against it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy ask the people if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do? It seems like a waste of money and time.\u201d</p> <p>Robins had been intending to vote Remain but had changed her mind during the campaign. \u201cI was going to vote to stay, but then I thought change is good. But if we\u2019re going to go out, then out means out,\u201d she declared, echoing the prime minister\u2019s Brexit utterance.</p> <p>Back in Green Park, O\u2019Flynn, who since leaving Farage\u2019s side has become a Ukip MEP for the East of England, said there was no need for the newspapers to apologise for their attacks on the judiciary \u2013 in fact, he wants more of it. \u201cJudges have this particular conceit of themselves that they\u2019re so lofty that they\u2019re immune to the vulgarity of public opinion. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true\u201d, he said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I was delighted by the newspaper coverage. We need to harness the public outrage. What can Ukip do? I\u2019ve come to the rather happy conclusion that it is our solemn duty to be shamelessly populist.\u201d</p>",

There will not be another Breeders\u2019 Cup here for at least three years \u2013 it moves down the coast to Del Mar next year, and then across to Churchill Downs, the home of the Kentucky Derby, in 2018 \u2013 and yesterday\u2019s opening card drew a record attendance for a Breeders\u2019 Cup Friday of nearly 46,000. They will hope to beat the 61,000 attendance for the Saturday card here two years ago, and the two-day total should easily surpass 100,000 for the first time. </p> <p>The all-important betting \u201chandle\u201d on Friday\u2019s four Breeders\u2019 Cup races was also up significantly on the same four events when the meeting was held at Keeneland 12 months ago, despite a significant drop in the number of runners (from 53 to 43). And best of all, the crowd were treated to a race for the ages in the feature event, the Distaff, as Beholder ended her outstanding career by inflicting a first defeat on Songbird after a brilliant duel down the home stretch.</p> <p>If there is another race to match that on today\u2019s nine-race card, we will indeed be very privileged. It is a far from impossible, though, as there has been widespread agreement around the barns this week that this year\u2019s meeting is the best and most competitive that the Breeders\u2019 Cup has seen.</p> <p>The highlight for the American fans this evening is undoubtedly California Chrome\u2019s attempt to win the Classic, a race in which he was touched off by Bayern and Toast Of New York here two years ago, another race that few who saw it will ever forget. Arrogate, who broke a long-standing track record with an exceptional front-running performance in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga, is seen as his main opponent, and many here hope, or even expect, to see the two horses lock horns at the top of the stretch and fight all the way to the wire.</p> <p>The Europeans drew a blank here on Friday, though we had runners in just two of the four races, but it will be a huge disappointment if that run continues later today. There a big hopes in all four of today\u2019s events on turf, including the Turf Sprint, a race that has been somewhat overlooked by European trainers in the past. Washington DC goes in that race for Aidan O\u2019Brien, and he certainly seemed quietly confident about his chance earlier in the week.</p> <p>Found, the Arc winner, is the biggest name on the card from a European point of view, and she will probably be making the last start of her career in the Turf. She faces tough opposition from her stable companion Highland Reel, however, as well as Flintshire, who was very useful for Andre Fabre earlier on in his career and is now the best middle-distance turf horse in America by some way.</p> <p>Limato and Alice Springs are the leaders of a strong challenge to Tepin, the US-trained Queen Anne Stakes winner at Royal Ascot in the summer, in the Mile, which is the penultimate race on the card. And Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s Queen\u2019s Trust is a live contender for the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, alongside yet another O\u2019Brien star, Seventh Heaven.</p> <p>All-in-all, it should be a frantic and compelling afternoon of action. The Breeders\u2019 Cup card starts at 19.05 GMT with the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 and it will be a non-stop rollercoaster ride from there. I look forward to bringing you all the news, results, reports and post-race quotes as they happen, and tweets and comments would be greatly appreciated too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581dc16fe4b029b92ca45c87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-05T11:30:03.496Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg will be along shortly. </strong>On Friday, Songbird surrendered her unbeaten record to Beholder in an epic Breeders\u2019 Cup Distaff at Santa Anita.

  "<p>Highland Reel, the winner of the King George at Ascot in July, gave Aidan O\u2019Brien his first winner at this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting on Saturday under an outstanding front-running ride by Seamie Heffernan.</p> <p>With Ryan Moore, O\u2019Brien\u2019s No1 rider, aboard Found (the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe winner), Heffernan had an excellent opportunity to record his first success at the Breeders\u2019 Cup and he seized the initiative from the early stages of this mile-and-a-half contest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/23/ryan-moore-highland-reel-ascot-king-george-frankel-fair-eva-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Highland Reel</a> was in front within a few strides, and led Ectot as the field turned away from the stands with a circuit to run while Found raced much further back with only a couple of opponents behind her. Heffernan then kicked even further clear down the back stretch, and was six lengths to the good going into the final turn.</p> <p>Heffernan still had a healthy lead at the top of the straight, and though his opponents were now well aware that they had handed a multiple Group One winner a soft lead, it was too late to do anything about it. Flintshire, America\u2019s best middle-distance turf horse, closed the gap in the straight under Javier Castellano, but he was still one-and-three-quarter lengths adrift of the winner at the line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/04/highland-reel-breeders-cup-turf-aidan-obrien-horse-racing\">Highland Reel can land Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf for dominant Aidan O\u2019Brien yard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Found, who will now retire to the paddocks, ran on into third place without ever looking entirely at ease on the quick ground, while Ulysses was fourth for Sir Michael Stoute.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew that he gets a mile-and-a-half well, that he handles fast ground and doesn\u2019t mind dictating,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSo it was straightforward really, but Seamus executed it brilliantly. He controlled the race perfectly. He kicked at the right time, and really the race was over from a long way out.</p> <p>\u201cHe has two options now, in the Japan Cup and a race in Hong Kong. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to take in two or take in one, but we\u2019ll see how he is. But he\u2019s an incredibly versatile horse that loves travelling.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on the card, Stoute, already the most successful British trainer in Breeders\u2019 Cup history, added a seventh victory to his record as Queen\u2019s Trust and Frankie Dettori edged ahead of the favourite Lady Eli on the line to win the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf.</p> <p>Dettori was at his outstanding best to snatch victory from Lady Eli and Irad Ortiz, having broken from a wide berth in stall 11 which forced him to sit well off the pace. Queen\u2019s Trust had not enjoyed much luck in running in several previous races this season, but there was no danger that she would be blocked here as Dettori pulled her to the middle of the track at the top of the stretch and set out to run down the leader, Avenge.</p> <p>Lady Eli was nearly three lengths in front of Queen\u2019s Trust as Dettori launched his challenge, and Ortiz\u2019s mount only got to Avenge well inside the final furlong. Queen\u2019s Trust was finishing even faster than the favourite, however, and Dettori\u2019s perfectly timed pursuit ensured she had her head in front when it really mattered.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we got to the backstretch, basically I tried to find a spot where I could get into a challenging position,\u201d Dettori said.</p> <p>\u201cI was very fortunate mid-turn because I got behind the favourite, and then she got a jump on me and my first thought was, well, I\u2019ll be a good third.</p> <p>\u201cThen she started to motor and it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s a short straight but those last hundred yards make a big difference. She got into top gear, and we flashed past the line and I was pretty much sure we\u2019d won.\u201d</p> <p>Stoute has now won the Filly &amp; Mare Turf three times, to go with four victories in the Turf, a record that stretches back to Pilsudski\u2019s victory in the latter race in 1996.</p> <p>But European hopes were dashed in the Mile when Henry Candy\u2019s Limato faded from a furlong out behind Bill Mott\u2019s runner Tourist, with last year\u2019s Mile winner Tepin in second place. Midnight Storm completed a 1-2-3 for US-trained horses.</p> <p>The Turf Sprint also went the way of the Americans, with O\u2019Brien\u2019s Washington DC out of the frame behind Obviously, a veteran eight-year-old who has lined up for the Mile three times in the past. Home Of The Brave, from Hugo Palmer\u2019s stable in Newmarket, was also unplaced, along with Undrafted, who took the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot for his American trainer Wesley Ward in June 2015.</p> <p>The feature event of the meeting produced another exceptional finish as Arrogate, the second-favourite, got up to beat the market leader California Chrome after a protracted duel down the straight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/27/california-chrome-dubai-world-cup-american-meydan-global-appeal-horse-racing\" title=\"\">California Chrome</a> made the running and looked to be going easily as he turned for home, but Mike Smith had Arrogate a couple of lengths behind and the three-year-old showed tremendous courage to eat into California Chrome\u2019s lead before passing him a few strides before the line.</p> <p>The winner carried the pink, green and white colours of Prince Khalid Abdullah so familiar to European fans thanks to the exploits of horses like Dancing Brave and Frankel, and gave Bob Baffert his third consecutive success in the Classic.</p>",
  "<p>He has lurched from crisis to crisis, insulted the world and been repeatedly accused of racism and sexual assault \u2013 but more than one in 10 Britons would still vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a>, a new poll has revealed.</p> <p>An Opinium/Observer poll has found 12% of UK adults would vote for the Republican candidate if they were able to take part in next Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, compared with 49% for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p> <p>Opinium surveyed 2,001 adults between 1 and 4 November, a week in which polls narrowed amid the fallout from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump\" title=\"\">FBI\u2019s decision to review a new batch of Clinton\u2019s staff\u2019s emails</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, men are more than twice as likely to support Trump, with 16% expressing a preference for him compared with just 8% of women. However, in a reflection of both candidates\u2019 underlying unpopularity, almost a third of respondents (32%) said they would not vote for either.</p> <p>The findings also suggest that the election is widely considered a foregone conclusion despite a late surge in support for Trump: 48% of UK adults expect Clinton to win the presidency, while 18% think a Trump victory is most likely.</p> <p>Of supporters of the major UK parties, only among Ukip voters did supporters of Trump outnumber those of Clinton: 43% of the party\u2019s voters would back the divisive billionaire, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\" title=\"\">enlisted the support of Nigel Farage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\" title=\"\">compared his campaign to the Brexit movement.</a></p> <p>The survey shows the Democratic candidate soundly beating Trump on a range of issues, including relations with Britain and global security. The Republican candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/hillary-clinton-trump-unpatriotic-scary-putin\" title=\"\">who has praised Vladimir Putin</a> and suggested the US could withdraw from Nato under his presidency, is deemed a risk to international stability by 62% of Britons.</p> <p>Similarly, few voters believe a Trump victory would be good for Britain\u2019s so-called special relationship with the US. Just 16% of those surveyed said he would be a friend to the UK as president, compared with 41% for Clinton. Meanwhile, 53% think the British government should seek to improve its relationships with countries other than the US if Trump wins.</p> <p>Widespread dislike for Trump among the British public is also reflected by the words most commonly associated with the candidate.

  "<p>Medical and addiction experts, charities and parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of time children are spending playing online games as figures show that UK spending on titles such as <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\"><em>Grand Theft Auto </em></a>will top \u00a33bn this year.</p> <p>Dr Aric Sigman, a freelance lecturer in child health, said he had heard from a number of doctor\u2019s surgeries that parents were asking for sleeping pills for their children. \u201cWhether you call it an addiction or not, this is an enormous and growing problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The charity Action for Children says that a quarter of parents rank their children\u2019s screen time, and how to control it, as their greatest challenge \u2013 bigger than the traditional issues of homework or healthy eating.</p> <p>\u201cWe were surprised it came top. We hadn\u2019t picked up that it was such a big issue,\u201d says the charity\u2019s managing director, Carol Iddon. \u201cWith gaming, children get a lot of satisfaction and positive reinforcement, it can build their confidence. But that can make it become addictive.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Jones (not his real name) a gamer known by his online persona of Onibobo, is part of the growing sub-culture of young people, particularly male, who appear to have become hooked on internet gaming. \u201c<em>League of Legends</em> is my poison. I play it until pretty late,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His gaming sessions normally last about nine hours and typically run right through the night. Aged 27, he\u2019s been a heavy usage player since he was 15, and it has taken its toll. At college he spent more time gaming than studying, and since leaving he has found it tough to hold down a job. \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing I know every hour I could be doing something else with my life, but it gives you a weird sense of fulfilment, like you\u2019re achieving something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jones worries he is probably addicted \u2013 his gaming in part led to the break-up of a relationship this year \u2013 but he thinks he could stop if he really wanted to. \u201cIt\u2019s like smoking or drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad habit.\u201d</p> <p>The gaming industry is a reluctant to acknowledge any social responsibility, but brands are cashing in on growing demand. Data group Euromonitor calculates that UK spending on games will top \u00a33bn this year, 10 times more than households spend on traditional board games such as Monopoly or Scrabble.</p> <p>\u201cThe games are designed to keep you playing,\u201d said Peter Smith, a director at Broadway Lodge, an addiction treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare.</p> <p>Broadway has been helping people with drug and alcohol-related problems since 1974, and for the past three years has opened its doors to people struggling with gaming dependency. Smith says that parents have few places to turn to if they are worried about their children\u2019s gaming. There is no telephone helpline, and GPs and schools, while increasingly aware of the problem, have limited expertise in dealing with it.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a parent with a 15-year-old who\u2019s playing endlessly, staying up late, not eating properly and then missing school because of it, where would you go for help? There isn\u2019t anywhere,\u201d &nbsp;he said.</p> <p>Most experts agree that the escapism and socialisation aspects of online gaming are a big part of the appeal. In <em>League of Legends</em>, for example, there is a clan system whereby players can invite others on to their list of friends, and then play as a group against other teams.</p> <p>But it is not necessarily a friendly environment. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing and make a mistake, you can have four people on your own team screaming at you, wishing you had cancer or your mother and father were dead,\u201d said Jones. \u201cPeople take it so seriously, they lose touch.\u201d</p> <p>Children losing touch with reality is the biggest concern for parents, perhaps. But gaming dependency \u2013 unlike gambling dependency, for example \u2013 is yet to be recognised with a formal diagnosis, and there is limited funding for research.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re under-aware of it, and we\u2019re therefore minimising what the potential problems are,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>When pressed, Jones said he felt bad for his parents, who were concerned about the amount of time he spent in his room online. \u201cYou can lose a lot of cash, let alone time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not really a transferable skill. It\u2019s a strange world to be in.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We made history in Ukraine last week. For the first time ever, more than 100,000 top officials, including the president, members of the cabinet, MPs, judges, prosecutors and civil servants, declared their assets under our new e-declaration system. In a statement endorsed by all of Ukraine\u2019s leading civil society organisations, none of whom has been shy to criticise the authorities, they&#xa0;hailed the system as \u201ca truly revolutionary step towards eradicating corruption\u201d.</p> <p>Activists and journalists are already investigating the origins of cash and assets that have been declared by officials. This has shone a light on the highest levels of power and things will never be the same again. Achieving this was not easy and on our path to greater transparency we encountered many obstacles.</p> <p>The media, civil society and the public were sceptical until the last moment. The guardians of the old system were doing everything possible to prevent this and other changes that we have made to stamp out corruption.</p> <p>I well remember the difficulties that we had pushing this law through parliament, as I was the speaker of parliament at the time.</p> <p>Last summer, the e-declaration system was delayed and for a moment it looked as though it would fail, but the government stayed firm. I was one of the first top-level officials to declare his assets on the system. I will also be the first to say that I am ready for my declaration to be scrutinised. I believe that all Ukrainian public servants should have to explain the origin of their assets and, in cases where violations are uncovered, they should be punished under the law.</p> <p>The e-declaration system allows us to draw a line between politicians of the past, who have never explained the origins of their assets, and politicians of the future of Ukraine, who from now on will be accountable to the people and who must explain where they got their money.</p> <p>The new system is an important step in the process of stamping out corruption in Ukraine, but it is far from the final step. My cabinet will provide absolute support to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which our government created.</p> <p>As my declaration has shown, I am not the poorest man in Ukraine, though I am far from the richest. I entered politics in 2006 as a successful businessman, since which time I have declared my income. However, I am well aware that many people in my country still have very few economic opportunities and some live below the poverty line. The gap between rich and poor is a large part of what has made the declarations shocking for many Ukrainians.</p> <p>Improving this situation is my government\u2019s top priority. There is still much work to be done, but we are making real progress in implementing our reform agenda, with the ultimate goal of improving economic prospects for all Ukrainians.</p> <p>In addition to the reforms we have made to combat corruption, Ukraine has also taken steps to modernise our judiciary, transform the national police force and cut red tape to improve the environment for business and foreign investment.</p> <p>We have liberalised our energy markets, an important reform also intended to combat corruption and one that faced considerable opposition from vested interests. This year, the economy will grow by 1.5%, with 3% growth predicted for 2017. Inflation has fallen dramatically, from 43% in 2015 to 12% this year and 8% forecast for next year. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between Ukraine and the European Union came into force on 1&#xa0;January, creating substantial economic benefits for both sides, and last summer we signed the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement.</p> <p>As prime minister, my top priority is stabilising the country and growing the economy so that all Ukrainians can have the chance to succeed and improve their standard of living. To achieve this, we must lay down strong foundations on which we can build a modern European state. The e-declaration system is a milestone in this process.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>Melania Trump appears to have spent the entire US election as a sort of anti-Michelle Obama \u2013 whatever she does, however hard she tries. Not that she\u2019s been that visible \u2013 her husband has mainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/ivanka-trump-speech-republican-convention-women-gender-pay-mothers\" title=\"\">put his daughter, Ivanka,</a> in the first lady spot on his campaigning chain-gang. When Melania has been thrust into the spotlight, it\u2019s been to do a manifestly sub-par nerve-racked turn, before scurrying back into the shadows, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\" title=\"\">accusations (at the mildest) of speech-plagiarism.</a></p> <p>Now Melania has made another so-so speech (keeping to the relatively safe topic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/melania-trump-cyberbullying-campaign-speech\" title=\"\">childhood bullying</a>). There have also been further allegations about Melania <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/melania-trump-was-paid-modeling-before-work-visa-records-show#img-1\" title=\"\">working as a model</a> before officially obtaining her US work visa. Does it matter? Of course it does (it makes a mockery of her husband\u2019s relentless anti-immigrant rhetoric). Another question could be: does Melania matter? After all this time, does she even exist as a legitimate separate entity outside of her husband\u2019s swirling toxic orbit?</p> <p>Throughout the Trump campaign, Melania has been simultaneously defined and eclipsed by her husband, which, considering his well-documented views on women, probably suits him just fine. With a man like Trump (an ego driven by a sonic blast of narcissistic personality disorder), it makes a weird kind of sense that his daughter (his issue, his blood) is given pole female position, validating his genetic grandiloquence (subtext: everything that is of Trump is magnificent!), while his third wife (with her \u201cchequered\u201d past) is given tasks and duties almost as an afterthought.</p> <p>Melania has been bounced down the Republican campaigning ranks from player to mere decorative human accessory, given as much significance and influence as Trump\u2019s choice of tie at a rally. At the same time, in every negative, dehumanising way possible, Melania has been completely defined by her husband. Of course, something similar also happened to Hillary Clinton \u2013 an actual candidate \u2013 who\u2019s spent her entire campaign being pelted by rocks for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\" title=\"\">\u201csins of Bill\u201d.</a></p> <p>The difference is that Hillary has at least (small mercies) also been attacked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton-why-hate-unlikeable-us-election\" title=\"\">who she is</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\" title=\"\">what she\u2019s done.</a> Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/29/michelle-obama-we-need-an-adult-in-the-white-house-video\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama,</a> whose charisma seems at once amplified by her husband, while also robustly being independent of him. By contrast, from start to finish, the pressure has been on Melania to atone publicly for all her husband is and everything he represents, her every word and deed viewed and judged entirely via the omnipresent prism of the Donald.</p> <p>So what? you might ask. As the saying goes, if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. But although associations are important, ultimately, only Donald Trump should be attacked for being Donald Trump.</p> <p>Certainly, it seems too easy and dangerous to assess women solely via the medium of their men. You can already see it happening with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/02/when-harry-met-meghan-markle-and-dragged-the-royals-into-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Prince Harry and his new partner, Meghan Markel</a>, a successful, attractive biracial actress being systematically reduced to how she, her heritage and achievements fit in with The Almighty Him. As a feminist, it makes me feel uneasy watching Markel being defined via her \u201csuitability\u201d for Harry, as if this were her only pertinent characteristic, all other nuance and agency of a living, breathing, thirtysomething individual cheapened or obliterated.</p> <p>If this makes a soul uneasy, then perhaps the same courtesy should be extended to Melania Trump. Melania probably wouldn\u2019t make a great first lady. (Not so much the anti-Michelle, as simply inadequate). However, the fact remains that during a wild, dirty election, Hillary Clinton emerged hurt by Bill, but not felled by him, Michelle gloriously stepped out of Barack\u2019s shadow and even Ivanka is relatively unscathed. Only Melania wafts around like an election phantom whose only function is to be viewed and judged entirely via the medium of her husband. While it\u2019s not surprising that this happened, it\u2019s telling that nobody seems to mind a bit.</p> <h2>Salute Sting for relaunching the Bataclan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c/0_134_4770_2862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatan Syuflana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sting will be the first musician to perform at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan theatre</a> in Paris since the terrorist attacks last November that killed 130 people, 89 of them at the venue.</p> <p>A separate event has been planned, according to ed reports, to mark the anniversary of the attacks, attended by survivors and the band that performed on the night of the attack, the American group Eagles of Death Metal, whose roadie Nick Alexander died.

  "<p>During the first half of this decade, if you looked hard enough, any man with an interest in style was dressed like a Scandinavian. Fast-forward to this winter, and it seems that we are all Scandinavians now. When Topman launches a \u201cMalm\u00f6 collection\u201d, it\u2019s the same cosy aesthetic that helped make <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofie_Gr%C3%A5b%C3%B8l\" title=\"\"><em>The Killing\u2019s</em> Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l</a> a star that has clearly achieved total hegemony on the British high street.</p> <p>From chains like River Island to more upmarket retailers like Matches and Mr Porter, to a display at Harvey Nichols based on the lifestyle of the modern Nordic male, \u201cScandi\u201d is everywhere.

Kristian W Andersen, creative director of the <a href=\"http://ciff.dk/\" title=\"\">Copenhagen International Fashion Fair</a>, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cPersonally, I associate skinny jeans with [French fashion designer] Hedi Slimane more than something Nordic. When some Scandinavian brands are doing extremely well internationally, people will automatically associate all of Scandinavia with just those brands.\u201d To Andersen it\u2019s less about fashion and more about function and expression: \u201cDenmark has an old design tradition that came in the wake of industrialism. It was the idea of combining simplicity and functionality.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a part of the hype surrounding Scandinavia,\u201d explains Andersen. \u201cOur way of life is on the radar internationally at the moment. Many countries look to us when it comes to our values, our systems, and our successful work life. We are not only successful in fashion but in also architecture, furniture and design. I think people right now are really buying into the tales of Nordic countries.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our way of life is on the radar internationally at the moment</p> <footer> <cite>Kristian Andersen, director of the Copenhagen fashion fair</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A more mundane reason for the new mass appeal of \u201cScandi\u201d is that the outerwear is designed for the cold. \u201cIt\u2019s meant for the climate of those territories,\u201d explains Mr Porter\u2019s buying director, Fiona Firth. Martha Evans-Roden, menswear PR at Harvey Nichols, agrees on the importance of comparable climates. \u201cIt\u2019s unsurprising that this look has become normal in a country whose winters last longer than its summer.

The pieces are often the building blocks of casual wear.\u201d</p> <p>Evans-Roden thinks the full impact of Scandi\u2019s breakout into the world of mass consumption is yet to be seen, \u201calthough I suppose that basic style is more easy to spot, more based on trends than labels, so men tend to come in and look for a shearling jacket rather than \u2018something from Dior\u2019.\u201d</p>",

This summer Hodder &amp; Stoughton also brought out a book, <em>This is Grime,</em> to chart the sound\u2019s path from underground raves and pirate radio stations in London to success in the mainstream commercial market.</p> <p>This spring even the relatively staid Ivor Novello awards recognised grime again for the first time since 2011 with a nod for Skepta, and, last month Stormzy won the AIM innovator award.</p> <p>Ticket sales for live grime shows are also on the march. This year they are at their highest since 2011 and are predicted to beat the combined sales of 2012, 2013 and 2014, according to data from the online seller, Ticketmaster.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump is coming to the end of one of the most dramatic and unpredictable US presidential campaigns in living memory, scouring swing states for the undecided voters who might make a difference and who might be persuaded by his inflammatory message and swingeing assaults on his Democratic rival.</p> <p>But as he campaigned in Ohio, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania on Friday, a new side of the Republican candidate emerged. He was doing something no-one expected: he was being predictable.</p> <p>As Tuesday\u2019s vote nears, Trump\u2019s rallies are still raucous and he still fills them with wild accusations against Hillary Clinton. A recent favourite is that \u201cif she ever gets into the Oval Office, Hillary and her corrupt friends would rob this country blind\u201d. But his words have become more scripted and controlled, resembling less a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo, full of improvisation, more a jazz musician riffing off a standard tune from the songbook.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of Trump\u2019s crowds has not diminished \u2013 thousands swarm at every stop. On Friday they came to Atkinson, New Hampshire, Wilmington, Ohio, and Hershey, the home of the chocolate giant, in Pennsylvania. When the candidate asked \u201cwho is going to pay for the wall\u201d, they shouted \u201cMexico\u201d deliriously. Dressed in Trump merchandise, they were ready at the slightest provocation to chant \u201cLock her up\u201d or \u201cCNN sucks\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\" data-alt=\"pennsylvania\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=PA\">pennsylvania</a> </figure>  <p>But Trump seemed to sense something had changed. When trotting out his newest line, \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d, both a jibe at what he describes as a corrupt establishment in Washington and a description of his willingness to clean it up, the candidate seemed almost unenthusiastic. He has taken to apologising when the line comes up in speeches.</p> <p>\u201cI hated the expression,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s so hokey.\u201d</p> <p>Trump often notes how Frank Sinatra hated singing My Way, before he realised how much his audience loved it. For Trump the \u201cswamp\u201d slogan, which could come from almost any insurgent political campaign, mounted by either party, is the same thing. If his crowds chant it, he will go along.</p> <p>Yet he is by no means hostage to his crowds. On Friday he guided them along, ensuring they booed the correct villain at the right time, be it Clinton, the media or nondescript globalists intent on taking away US jobs and prosperity.</p> <p>Members of the press corps have become his unwitting accessories. They are penned in, surrounded, while Trump falsely insists that TV cameras are not showing the size of his rallies. That claim goads the crowd into booing the press, who he insists are \u201cthe most dishonest people\u201d. At times, he will even call out reporters by name.</p> <p>This has not provoked any incidents of physical violence \u2013 yet. The sensation is more like that of being an animal on display at the zoo. Trump supporters stand on the other side of the fence, gaping, making faces and occasionally shouting abuse.</p> <p>Things tend to intensify as the hour gets later and Trump, who has rarely been punctual in recent months, falls further behind schedule. By then the crowds, subjected to a loop of the same five songs for several hours, are ready to let loose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=OH\" data-alt=\"ohio\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=OH\">ohio</a> </figure>  <p>But for all the passion and rage that Trump stokes, there is a lack of the bizarre creativity that defined his early campaigning. The candidate who compared the acclaimed neurosurgeon Ben Carson to a child molester and falsely said Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/jul/22/donald-trump-denies-ted-cruz-father-assassination-jfk\">was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy</a> has been left claiming, wrongly, that Clinton is the subject of multiple criminal investigations. While he has made \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d a Homeric epithet to rival his labelling of former Florida governor Jeb Bush as \u201cLow Energy\u201d or his nicknaming Florida senator Marco Rubio \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and Cruz \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d, it has not had the same effect.</p> <p>The issue is perhaps the lack of any new villains to accompany Clinton, one of the most famous women in the world. Veering away from President Obama, Trump rails against nameless \u201cglobal special interests\u201d who he says ship jobs overseas and leave US borders open. But these attacks are not delivered with the gusto he uses for individuals. He is far more animated when calling for Clinton to fire her campaign chairman, John Podesta, because Podesta described his candidate as having \u201cbad instincts\u201d in a hacked email, than he is when reading a scripted attack on globalists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\" data-alt=\"new hampshire\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NH\">new hampshire</a> </figure>  <p>The overall effect is of an ageing rock star, living off the glory of past hits. Trump still takes time to recall 16 June 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">when he came down \u201cthat famous escalator\u201d</a> at Trump Tower in New York City to announce his campaign. He will often relive moments of glory in his bid for the Republican nomination. Ardent fans show up and buy the merchandise and the star is able to put on a show. But it is an increasingly mechanical exercise.</p> <p>Trump has always been an awkward fit, somewhere between entertainer and politician. After all, the best shows and the most applause-worthy lines don\u2019t always poll the best. At least for the next few days, though, he is willing to repeat his intent to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d, in order to maintain his shot at winning the White House.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/30/steve-hewlett-cancer-diary-ethical-choices-drugs\" title=\"\">Steve Hewlett\u2019s comments</a> about the refusal of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to approve an immunotherapy drug represents what I suspect is the tip of a very large iceberg of similar refusals in respect of immunotherapy drugs to treat various cancers. There is a lack of public awareness of this issue. Individual patients become aware of the drug that could help them. In my husband\u2019s case, that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/09/immunotherapy-drug-a-gamechanger-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" title=\"\">nivolumab</a>, which Nice has to date not approved for the treatment of advanced lung cancer despite its use elsewhere, including Scotland.</p> <p>Oncologists know immunotherapy and gene therapy are the future for cancer treatment. However, it seems to be the case that Nice, without either public debate about or awareness of the issue, is denying access through the NHS to a whole range of new drugs on costs grounds. That means this country will fall even further behind the rest of the first world in cancer survival rates than it already is. It also means access to what science can now offer to cancer patients is effectively already rationed, as only those like Steve Hewlett and my husband who can (just about) pay for the drugs, or those with health insurance, are able to receive treatment.</p> <p>There should be a full itemised statement from Nice of all such treatments that are not approved. I also believe that, in the face of the rapid advances in expensive treatments coupled with all the other pressures on the NHS, there needs to be a public debate on the question that politicians avoid: the need to look at alternative models of funding the NHS. Otherwise, we will end up with the current model offering increasingly developing world treatment to the majority, with only those who can afford them having access to modern effective drugs.<br><strong>Anne Braithwaite</strong><br>Leeds</p> <h2><strong>Proper support for industry</strong></h2> <p>You are right to highlight the importance of Britain\u2019s motor industry to our economic future (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/29/nissan-uk-car-industry-brexit-lifeline-gm-hit-the-road\" title=\"\">\u201cNissan throws UK a Brexit lifeline\u201d</a>, News) but you miss the key point: what matters most is our capacity to design world-beating products and dominate major markets.

  "<p>For a few days in October, bright blue skies bathed the French capital in a light so vivid that the streets resembled a hyper-real painting. Avenue Winston Churchill was empty of traffic but full of collectors, dealers, curators and other art world types, gathered for Paris art week. They milled about in the sun or clustered around food vans, coffee stands and pieces of sculpture.</p> <p>On either side of the esplanade that runs between the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Seine is Charles Girault\u2019s exquisite pair of beaux arts buildings, the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. The connection their architect had originally intended between the two buildings, in 1900, has been re-established across a space now usually occupied by cars and buses. At the foot of the Grand Palais, which houses the Foire International d\u2019Art Contemporaine (Fiac), white letters were painted on the road surface: \u201c<em>L\u2019art est ce qui aide \u00e0 tirer de l\u2019inertie</em>\u201d \u2013 art will help to pull us out of inertia \u2013 a phrase coined in 1971 by artist-poet Henri Michaux, reiterated here by nonagenarian French poster artist Jacques Villegl\u00e9.</p> <p>One year on from the Bataclan shootings the Paris art world is exhibiting a defiant response to that violence, the cultural face of a city determined to find its avant garde soul again. Armed soldiers and police patrol the streets and the M\u00e9tro; rigorous bag searches produce hour-long queues at every tourist attraction. But, says art consultant Laurence Dreyfus: \u201cWhen you are in difficulty, you are ready to fight. We are good at reinvention; we are creative.\u201d</p> <p>Fiac director Jennifer Flay is also bullish. \u201cAfter Bataclan and Nice, installing pop-up cafes on the street was a gesture, a statement of intent.

La Colonie mixes art, music, critical thinking, debate and cultural activism, with a focus on the stories of minorities. \u201cFor a while I thought French society, like many European societies, was fragmented,\u201d says Attia. \u201cBut I think there is a kind of repairing culture happening in Paris now.

They are now able to say \u2018we don\u2019t know\u2019 and find people who do. Paris understands it is in its best interests to open its eyes to the rest of the world, not just to America or Europe, but to the South American, the African and the Asian scene.\u201d</p> <p>The energy in Paris is palpable and growing, says Austrian gallerist Thaddaeus Ropac, who gave a party at his hangar-like space at Pantin, on the north-east edge of Paris, during Fiac. \u201cIt was so crowded I was afraid for the paintings,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that 750 people came all the way out to Pantin so late at night.\u201d</p> <p>Over coffee at his other gallery space in central Paris, which opened in 1990, Ropac explains that Paris doesn\u2019t need a lucrative market to support it; it has learned to survive. \u201cThe art market crash in 1991 took Paris further down than other cities. London reinvented itself with the YBAs [Young British Artists], New York bounced back, Berlin began to attract artists like a magnet, but Paris suffered. It has taken driving forces of contemporary art like the Palais de Tokyo and now the Monnaie de Paris to bring Paris back to life.\u201d</p> <p>What Ropac loves about Paris, he says, is its \u201camazing, loyal audience\u201d for art. \u201cThey\u2019re intellectual. And it is considered vulgar to mention money. You go to a dinner in London and people blast into your face how much their house cost, how much they earn.\u201d</p> <p>As we talk, India\u2019s most famous artist couple, Bharti Kher and Subodh Gupta, walk into the gallery. \u201cOnly the Americans did not come this year,\u201d says Ropac. \u201cOur biggest clients told us they were afraid. But this Fiac has been incredible, we did better than last year, without Americans, which is remarkable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A lot has happened since Nicholas Stern, then a permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">landmark review</a> of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming.</p> <p>Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\" title=\"\">such as south Florida </a>and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet\u2019s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world\u2019s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\">Stern report: the key points</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been too slow in acting on climate change,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIn particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming \u2013 like ice sheet and glacier melting \u2013 are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. \u201cWith hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\">Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\" title=\"\">Paris climate talks</a> last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: \u201cIt has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol</a>, into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved \u2013 in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example \u2013 would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review.</p> <p>Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. \u201cApart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThe consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day.</p> <p>\u201cWe are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.\u201d</p> <p>As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogot\u00e1 have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. \u201cWe have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,\u201d says Stern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51/81_0_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets, says Stern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure \u2013 roads, buildings, ports and airports \u2013 that will more than double what already exists.</p> <p>The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. \u201cIf it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/indigenous-rights-forests-climate-change-study\" title=\"\">talks in Marrakech</a>. India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives \u2013 but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created \u201cby and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive\u201d and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern\u2019s response is diplomatic: \u201cIt would make things very much more difficult,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771/0_241_3404_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plane takes off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK could still cut its carbon emissions from aircraft by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 \u2013 despite the \u201cpolicy wobbles\u201d of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-deal\" title=\"\">Green Deal</a> to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. \u201cTo behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThat is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government\u2019s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/heathrow-third-runway-davies-commission\" title=\"\">proposed new runway for Heathrow</a> is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. \u201cHowever, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK\u2019s targets are altered \u2013 as I believe they should be \u2013 to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,\u201d adds Stern.</p> <p>The Paris agreement remains central to Stern\u2019s sense of cautious optimism. \u201cIt was the honesty of the delegates\u2019 awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement\u2019s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sitting in the hushed and ornately gilded lounge of a Rome hotel, Carolyn Tamras perches on the edge of a well-stuffed pink velvet sofa. For three days last year, says Carolyn, she sat \u201clike this\u201d, leaning forward and wrapping her arms around her knees, head bent, gently rocking. \u201cThen I thought, I am no use to my family like this. This is my challenge.\u201d</p> <p>It is her husband Martin\u2019s 49th birthday and the couple can scarcely believe that he has just been wished many happy returns by Pope Francis in a private audience. They are still glowing from the experience, as any fellow Catholics would be. But there is a unique dimension to their joy: on this date last year Martin, their two sons, then teenagers, and their daughter, were being held in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/19/yazidi-survivors-isis-torture-rape-need-support-uk-promised\">Islamic State torture</a> centre. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit and waiting to be killed, having seen his cousin and two other men put to death in front of him.</p> <p>Syrian Christians, Martin and Carolyn lived with their three children in Tal Tamr, a little town 25 miles from the city of Hasakah, in the north-east of the country. On 23 February 2015 Isis arrived, bombing and burning homes and churches. Surrounding houses, the militants booby-trapped exits with explosives, trapping people inside while they took out any armed resistance. They then returned to usher 97 men, women and children out of their temporary prisons and into trucks.</p> <p>By chance, Martin and Carolyn were away shopping in Hasakah that day and the couple had decided to stay the night rather than drive back. As they prepared to go to bed, Martin got a phone call from his son, Tommy. \u201cDaesh are here! They have surrounded us!\u201d Martin persuaded his wife to let him drive back to the village alone. \u201cI lied to her,\u201d said Martin. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her what he said, I knew she would not stay in safety if I told her the truth.\u201d He arrived in time to be herded along with the others, Christian, Muslim and Hindu. They were held in brutal, overcrowded conditions, forced to witness electrocutions and beheadings, given water polluted with diesel and food that was infested with insects. <br></p> <p>Although the father and sons were held together, with the other men from the town, their daughter was held separately in a group of women who were constantly taunted that they were to become Isis \u201cbrides\u201d.</p> <p>For 12 months, Carolyn and religious groups were bombarded with demands for $16m (\u00a312m) in ransom. A video of three men being killed was sent to them as a threat. Martin was in the video, clearly marked out for future death. As a desperate effort began to raise money, Carolyn had to endure the taunting contact of an Isis negotiator through the messaging service WhatsApp. \u201cAt first I was disgusted, but then I realised he was human and through this humanity I might help my family. He began to trust me, to tell me about his sick baby. I looked up what medicines might help and sent him back details.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6bee88040703b0896b255b4c6972b6d2c949a30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6bee88040703b0896b255b4c6972b6d2c949a30/0_113_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"When Isis fighters entered Tal Tamr they took whole families as hostages for ransom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Isis fighters entered Tal Tamr they took whole families as hostages for ransom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple believe this human contact between Carolyn and Isis is what kept Martin alive. \u201cBecause Isis founded their actions based on religion, this is a challenge,\u201d said Carolyn. \u201cIsis may be Islamic, but it is unfair to judge Muslims by Isis. We have to judge on human values, meet on human values. I saw humanity in that man,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The family\u2019s release came as unexpectedly as their capture. Hearing a rumour that buses had been seen arriving in Tal Tamr, Carolyn and other relatives rushed to the desolated village.</p> <p>More than $5m had been raised and handed over, some via Catholic clergy in Syria, some via the Assyrian church \u2013 the family do not know the details and the issue of the ransom is difficult. \u201cSlaves, bought and sold,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI could not believe this. Going back 1,000 years to slavery. This is painful for me.\u201d</p> <p>As a middleman handed over sacks of banknotes to the Isis fighters, the 93 hostages stepped off the buses. Carolyn remembers: \u201cI was running, running, like a crazy woman! I saw Tommy first, then my youngest, and I had my arms around them both, hugging, hugging. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real.\u201d</p> <p>Martin grins: \u201cShe forgot me! So I had to tap her on the shoulder and say, \u2018Excuse me, madam, do you not recognise your husband?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The children had witnessed terrible barbarity \u2013 their daughter talked of decapitations where heads \u201cwere lined up like tomatoes\u201d on walls for children to play football with \u2013 but they are, her mother says, coping.</p> <p>The hostages all now suffer from kidney and lung complaints, after a year of water fed through pipes used for diesel, and days on end in packed cells in which no one had the space to lie down. One of Martin\u2019s first tasks after release was to talk to the families of the three dead. \u201cThe doctor, his sister, still will not believe it,\u201d he says sadly.</p> <p>Another captive \u2013 a girl picked out to be raped by a judge in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/isis-islamic-state-us-raqqa-mosul-syria\">Raqqa</a> who had looked among the hostages for a \u201cwife\u201d \u2013 is still missing. \u201cAnd, of course, we are still trying to help the father of this girl to find her.\u201d</p> <p>Their homes razed, the hostages cannot return to Tal Tamr. Of the 45 families affected, only two remain in Syria. \u201cI understand why,\u201d says Carolyn. \u201cYes, we lost everything, our home, everything we owned. But if we leave Syria you cannot stand up for peace. We lose our power. I hope we give Syrians courage.</p> <p>\u201cIt is my dream to rebuild our home in Tal Tamr. To say, \u2018we are here, we live here\u2019. This is my dream.\u201d</p> <p>Their story is one they now hope to use. By coming forward as peace campaigners, the family hope to begin working to bring unity to Syria\u2019s traumatised faiths even as the civil war rages on. \u201cIt\u2019s an important opportunity for us to be here because the business of our faith is peace, and so we have a duty to witness this fundamental conviction and to share the story and the message of mercy and love with others,\u201d says Martin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Syria is not unique.

Not the government. Not the executive or a self-selecting clique within it. Certainly not this prime minister, who lacks a personal mandate. Sovereign power resides with our elected, representative parliament. This state of affairs did not come about by chance.

The proposition that the monarch cannot rule without parliament\u2019s consent lay at the heart of England\u2019s serial 17th-century civil wars. The question was settled by the parliamentarians\u2019 victory at the battle of Worcester in 1651.

Their independent role is to interpret laws agreed by parliament, say what they mean and how and if they may be legally implemented. When Britain joined what was then the EEC, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">European Communities Act</a>, passed by parliament in 1972, incorporated many European laws into domestic law. Thus it is both illogical and ignorant to castigate the high court for doing its job and stating the constitutionally obvious: that having passed the act, only parliament can override it by consenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\" title=\"\">to activate article 50 of the Lisbon treaty</a>.</p> <p>Yet castigating the judges and by extension, anybody who has the effrontery to agree with them, is exactly what the hard Tory Brexiters and their accomplices in the lie factories of Fleet Street have resorted to with a venom, vindictiveness and vituperation remarkable even by their standards. The will of the people has been thwarted by an \u201cactivist\u201d judiciary.

It wilfully misunderstands the relationship between parliament, government and the judiciary. Partisanship is understandable, but this level of stupidity is unforgivable. It misleads and distorts \u2013 either deliberately or out of ignorance. As Hilary Benn pointed out yesterday, the high court judgment has nothing to do with defying the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. As he explained, \u201cthe judgment is not to do with the fact that we will be leaving the European Union. It was a ruling on who starts the process, who fires the starting gun and in upholding the principle of parliamentary sovereignty\u2026 the judges said that since it was legislation that took us in, it should be parliament that takes the decision to start that process and not the government.\u201d</p> <p>Or here is Conservative MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve speaking on <em>Newsnight </em>on Friday: \u201cI was horrified at the newspaper coverage, which reminded me of Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe. The judges did exactly what was asked of them \u2013 they highlighted that our constitution does not allow you to overturn statute law by decree.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The judiciary are at the heart of our commitment to the rule of law and those who question their legitimacy (because they disagree with their view) threaten to undermine a critical institution vital to our democracy. Yesterday, the Bar Council took the extraordinary step of asking the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to condemn the \u201cserious and unjustified\u201d attacks on senior judges over the Brexit court ruling. Senior judges having to appeal to the lord chancellor to defend them from unjustified attacks, in Britain, in 2016?</p> <p>Since 23 June, the country has loosed itself from tolerant, civil discourse - on both sides. The world has often looked to Britain as an example of a pluralist, inclusive democracy and a cultured, ordered and civil society. But that is changing. As the world looked at the response of politicians and the popular press to last week\u2019s court judgment, many will have concluded that it had more in common with Sisi\u2019s Egypt or Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey than the Britain they thought they knew. A&#xa0;country that hounds, demonises and implicitly threatens its independent judiciary is one that toys menacingly with the very tenets of democracy.</p> <p>We noted in these columns some weeks ago that Theresa May, who coined the phrase the \u201cnasty party\u201d to describe the Conservatives some years ago, was threatening to turn Britain into the nasty country. That is increasingly the message being sent across the world. It is also the message being sent to foreigners living here, including long-resident EU nationals now afraid to speak openly for fear of rebuke or worse.</p> <p>Many more reasonable Brexit supporters have rightly distanced themselves from campaign to demonise the judges responsible for last week\u2019s ruling. But the government\u2019s ill-advised decision to appeal to the supreme court means judges sitting on England\u2019s highest bench, who will consider the matter next month, may now also be subject to overt political pressure and similarly contemptuous, intimidatory invective. In Turkey or Burundi, such tactics by the state and its surrogates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">might not be considered surprising</a>. But here?</p> <p>What sort of country is Britain becoming that this sort of menacing behaviour is not only tolerated but implicitly encouraged by senior government ministers who fear, correctly, they are losing the argument? As has been repeated ad nauseam, the issue is not about reversing or somehow sabotaging the referendum result. It is about ensuring proper democratic scrutiny of the government\u2019s negotiating positions, about ascertaining whether its approach advances the national interest rather than sectional, business and City interests. It is about getting the best deal for Britain.</p> <p>The concerted assault on the judiciary comes in the context of wider institutional vandalism indulged by the hard Tory Brexiters and their international sympathisers and emulators. They would recklessly tear up nearly 45 years of carefully navigated British relationships with our European neighbours. The resulting damage to the economy and living standards is mounting fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59/0_0_4919_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much worse is to come. In America, Donald Trump runs a presidential campaign based on fear, prejudice, ignorance and xenophobia, which he claims represents change, not abject regression, and threatens to reject the election outcome if it goes against him. The dire cost of Trumpism to America\u2019s national unity and cohesion is already plain.</p> <p>Across Europe, iconoclastic extremist and nationalist parties compete to demonstrate who is most intolerant, most hateful and best at scaring people. In France, their vile message may be working as presidential elections approach and the Front National gains ground. But hard Tory Brexiters do not see the link, deny any crossover, cannot understand how their institutional dumpster fire stokes nihilism and chauvinism. They dwell in their Little England bubble, detached from the real world or, as the high court said of their article 50 arguments, \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. Anybody who disturbs their narrative, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">Stephen Phillips, who resigned as a Conservative MP on Friday</a>, is shunned as a blood foe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/legally-protected-uk-food-products-brexit-threat-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a>, for daring to add his voice to the democratic debate over Brexit, is ridiculed. Will these people who hound reasonable public figures ever understand what a mature democracy involves? Formidable, robust, intelligent and reasoned debate.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/theresa-may-told-to-act-to-calm-brexit-mob-anger\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve</a> said: \u201cDebate helps outcomes, suppressing it destroys it.\u201d Would they rather our public discourse \u2013 and hence, public life \u2013 be characterised by childish slurs, homophobia, distortions and vicious rhetoric? That is where Britain is being driven by a new hard Brexit elite.</p> <p>It behoves any sensible, reasonable public figure to recognise that a 52-48 referendum result is one where national cohesiveness matters. And while it delivered a mandate to exit the European Union, it did not give sweeping powers to brush aside challenges on the nature, timing and texture of that exit. There is a lack of reason on both sides of this debate and there is a danger that the public fissures that have opened up since June 23rd become wider still. We all have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen. As Iain Martin says elsewhere on these pages, \u201cNeither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483/0_93_2944_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister, Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister, Theresa May: \u2018She has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an unerring instinct for the bad call.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, hard Tory Brexiters are fearful of losing the argument. The truth is there is little confidence that May can keep her head and rein in the irresponsible fantasies of her more wild-eyed colleagues. The truth is, May has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an instinct for the bad call, as seen with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, child obesity and Nissan subsidies. She appears unable to grasp the EU\u2019s blunt insistence that access to the single market cannot be divorced from freedom of movement.</p> <p>The disdain, scepticism and bewilderment of Britain\u2019s EU partners is wounding. At last month\u2019s Brussels summit, her first, May was kept waiting until the early morning before being allowed to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\" title=\"\">short statement on Brexit</a>. She was listened to in silence. Nobody deigned to respond. On Friday, her calls to Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and the commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, when she tried to persuade them, implausibly, that her March deadline for article 50 still stood, were embarrassingly brief. Few in Europe now believe Britain\u2019s government has a roadmap.</p> <p>In such circumstances, it is imperative that parliament, now given its chance \u2013 and reminded of its duty \u2013 to shape Britain\u2019s future course by the high court, steps up to the mark. For too long, too many MPs who support continued EU membership (a majority overall) have been cowering in silence, fearful that any expression of unease over the Brexit process will be misrepresented as a bid to overturn the referendum result. No one disputes the result of the referendum, or the social, cultural and political tensions that delivered it, but it is right that the manner of our exit are properly scrutinised. That has yet to be decided. And parliament, rightly, has a role to play.</p> <p>To be worthy of its sovereign status, both Houses of Parliament should now inject themselves into the Brexit process. This means cross-examining ministers and demanding a green paper on the government\u2019s plans. It means proposing alternative strategies. It means amending and, if need be, discarding wrong-headed approaches. And it means the holding of binding votes not only on when article 50 should be triggered but also on the final terms of any eventual exit agreement.</p> <p>In short, parliament must be ready to exercise veto power over any Brexit deal that does not ultimately serve the national interest \u2013 because this government simply cannot be trusted not to deliver serious economic self-harm on the altar of blind ideology. It is a tall order. The growing prospect of an early general election, should May continue to trip, fumble and flop, presents many MPs with an existential dilemma: whether to vote with their conscience and uphold the democratic rights of parliament and their constituents or be pushed and pulled along by a populist tide, propelled by lies. Most Labour MPs, for example, represent constituencies where a majority voted Leave. It is still likely that last week\u2019s ruling proves a pyrrhic victory, by provoking an early election that, with the current dire state of the Labour party, will give May an enhanced majority. Thus, we will have a parliament with fewer teeth and providing less scrutiny or push-back than is required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/nicola-sturgeon-scotland-mps-joining-article-50-legal-battle-brexit-high-court\">Nicola Sturgeon deciding whether to join article 50 legal battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps prodded by the shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could be stirred from his lethargic ambivalence over Europe.
