  "<p>Greece\u2019s financial recession is leaving its footprint on the environment. This follows twenty years of huge improvements in Greece\u2019s air pollution. While most European countries struggle with the consequences of failure to control exhaust pollution from diesel vehicles, Greece benefitted from long-standing bans on diesel cars in the two biggest cities, Athens and Thessaloniki.</p> <p>This allowed the country to reap the full benefits of technologies to control petrol exhaust, without these being offset by the poor performance of diesel cars.

Amongst new car sales diesels leapt from less than 20% (around zero in Thessaloniki) to over 60%, but, so far, economic pressures have reduced traffic volumes averting a possible deterioration in air pollution.</p> <p>However, a tripling in the cost of heating oil brought about larger changes as hard-pressed Greeks have switched to burning wood.

That would represent an average of $41 for each licence holder.</p> <p>South of the Great Barrier Reef, the review recommended allowing the expansion of pelagic longline fishing (long fishing lines that sit near the surface).

But regardless, the review recommended it be allowed in many areas, including a near doubling of the area in the Coral Sea where the practice is allowed.</p> <p>The scientific part of the report also found that no-take zones should be included in every reserve, as well as in each provincial bioregion. Despite that finding, the recommendations include a dozen reserves with no no-take zones.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the minister needs to do is, rather than accepting recommendations from Abbott\u2019s review that erode protections, is take the opportunity to expand it,\u201d said Meeuwig. \u201cThere\u2019s no uncertainty about this \u2013 that\u2019s actually what needs to be done.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Australia\u2019s compulsory day of distraction is again upon us as they line up on Tuesday for the 156th running of the $6.2m Melbourne Cup, the world\u2019s richest handicap and in recent years the subject of scandal, intrigue, tragedy and even feminist fanfare.

Given that\u2019s precisely the Cup day mission, the move should prove a bonanza for state coffers. </p> <p>While the public focus is on form and fascinators, the race that stops a media cycle can\u2019t arrive too quickly for an industry desperate to shake off the troubles of recent years and build on last year\u2019s publicity coup of Michelle Payne\u2019s historic win, the first for a female jockey. </p> <p>Following the Damien Oliver betting scandal of 2012, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/04/protectionist-wins-melbourne-cup-2014\">deaths of two horses in 2014</a>, racing was effectively on trial in last year\u2019s Cup and managed to dodge a bullet, both literally and figuratively. Things looked grim when five days out from the race, the home of Victoria\u2019s chief steward Terry Bailey was peppered with gunfire. Come Cup day and enter Payne, whose frank advice to racing\u2019s male-dominated ranks to \u201cget stuffed\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/03/get-stuffed-how-michelle-payne-and-family-beat-odds-to-win-melbourne-cup\">catapulted her to feminist icon</a> and prompted a social media frenzy that lasted at least eight hours.</p> <p>Moreover, the unbridled post-race joy of the horse\u2019s strapper, Payne\u2019s brother Stevie, presented a stark contrast to racing\u2019s billionaire owners and tight-lipped hard men in suits. The Paynes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/27/stevie-won-us-the-melbourne-cup-the-story-michelle-paynes-2015-triumph\">revealed racing\u2019s unsung grass roots</a>: authentic, inclusive, family-oriented, and driven by a love of and intimate relationship with the animal. The Australian turf\u2019s mythic status as \u201cthe great leveller\u201d was confirmed, and for one brief afternoon \u2013 the one when everyone is watching \u2013 racing was a sport again, not an industry. The 2015 Cup touched an otherwise sceptical public in a way that clich\u00e9s, slogans and million-dollar marketing campaigns can never match.</p> <p>However, since last year\u2019s event, racing has reverted to type: the damaging cobalt doping saga has continued to drag through the courts; Racing Victoria\u2019s board is in turmoil after the sudden resignation of its chairman David Moodie and the opening of an investigation by the state\u2019s racing integrity commissioner; and colourful figures such as banned jockey Danny Nikolic <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/horseracing/racefixing-allegations-in-danny-nikolic-case-set-to-rock-spring-racing-carnival-20160927-grpm5t.html\">continue to attract</a> <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/jockey-danny-nikolic-alleged-victim-of-historical-sexual-assault-by-top-trainer-20161020-gs6qqv.html\">ugly headlines</a>.

After a vintage spring thus far, fans are still coming off the highs of Winx\u2019s Cox Plate and a superlative Derby Day on Saturday, and are approaching this Cup in zealous anticipation. </p> <p>As is now customary, international raiders from the great stables of Ireland, the UK, Europe and Japan have arrived in force and dominate betting for the 2016 edition of the race. Godolphin\u2019s UK trainer Charlie Appleby has already had a field day in his first spring sojourn down under, with his charges earning more than $1m with wins in the Geelong and Bendigo Cups and a placing in the Caulfield Cup. He will be the apple of his master\u2019s eye should Qewy or Oceanographer, who forced his way into the Cup with a stunning win in the Lexus Stakes on Saturday, finally break through for Sheikh Mohammed, who has tried and failed to win the great race every year since 1998.</p> <p>Indeed, Godolphin is launching a record five-horse assault this year and has already had the race favourite Hartnell in Australia under John O\u2019Shea\u2019s care since early 2015. Hartnell\u2019s spring target was last week\u2019s Cox Plate and after a punishing run behind champion Winx, there must be a query over whether he can back up on Tuesday. Irish trainer Willie Mullins, who brought Max Dynamite to run second in last year\u2019s Cup, is back with his impressive 2016 Irish St Leger winner, Wicklow Brave, as is Michael Bell with dual Goodwood Cup winner Big Orange, who ran a gallant sixth last year.</p> <p>Local standard bearer is the stout mare, Jameka, a punishing last-start winner of the Caulfield Cup for trainer, Ciaron Maher, and the only Australian-bred horse still in the race.

  "<p>No election has a global impact to match a US presidential contest. Few White House races have been more bitter than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">the current one</a> between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. So any public official who intervenes in it, 11 days before polling, needs to be very sure what they are doing. Such interventions don\u2019t come bigger than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\" title=\"\">FBI director James Comey\u2019s announcement</a> that the bureau is reopening its probe of Mrs Clinton\u2019s private emails. The potential impact is huge. Until last Friday, Mrs Clinton was looking on course to hand Mr Trump a decisive beating. It may still happen. But that is now all up in the air.</p> <p>Mr Comey\u2019s defence appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he didn\u2019t. It is certainly true that US politics has become so polarised and so riddled with paranoia that the FBI director faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fbi-guilty-political-act-crucial-moment\" title=\"\">an unenviable choice</a>. If he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the election, whatever the result, one or both sides would be certain to cry foul. Conspiracy theorists would have had a field day. Yet by making it public now, he makes the investigation itself into a red-hot pre-election issue in a contest that will shape not just America but the world \u2013 and that\u2019s awful.</p> <p>This is precisely why the US Justice Department, with which the FBI works, has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias. The department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election. A memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of US attorneys general every four years, including in 2016. Mr Comey has broken with this. Former Justice Department officials from both political parties have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comey-is-damaging-our-democracy/2016/10/29/894d0f5e-9e49-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.9ea156488389\" title=\"\">denounced him for this</a> over the weekend. The current attorney general is believed to have advised against it, too.</p> <p>Mr Comey has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways. First, the investigation is at an embryonic stage. It may go no further. In his Friday announcement he spoke of emails \u201cthat appear to be pertinent\u201d to the previous investigation he completed \u2013 concluding then that there was no case to answer \u2013 in the summer. But the emails come from a separate investigation, may not even be from Mrs Clinton at all and the FBI chief has not read them. His phrasing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\" title=\"\">extraordinarily vague</a>. Mr Comey has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo. There are echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/13/operation-midland-report-due-met-police-alleged-vip-ring\" title=\"\">British police blunders</a> over child sex allegations. Even louder are the echoes of anti-Clinton fanatics like <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org\" title=\"\">Judicial Watch</a>. This strikes at the democratic process, not just individuals.</p> <p>Second, Mr Comey should not have deferred to Congress, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">as he did last week</a>. The investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics. That\u2019s especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a polarised and acrimonious polity as the US Congress has become. One of the recipients of Mr Comey\u2019s report, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\" title=\"\">Jason Chaffetz</a>, announced even before the FBI director\u2019s move that he intends to begin oversight hearings into Mrs Clinton as soon as she is elected, if she is. Incredible though it may seem to the outside world and many Americans, impeachment efforts by Republicans against Mrs Clinton are already a serious possibility. Law enforcement officials have to be completely scrupulous in such a world. Mr Comey has not been. It is a step towards a lawless process.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton is in many respects the author of her own problems on the email row. But Mr Comey took exactly the wrong decision. If the emails needed investigation, he should have authorised one behind closed doors, carried it out thoroughly, reported it to prosecutors and made an announcement, if one was necessary, in the fullness of time. This is called due process and it is a bulwark of the rule of law, not rule by politicians \u2013 least of all rule by a potential tyrant like Mr Trump.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Comey has rocket-fuelled a venomous contest just when Mr Trump was desperate for a lifeline, just when Republican candidates in other races were craving something to energise their voters and just when some media were becoming bored with the predictability of the White House contest. His action was at best naive and at worst an abuse of office. It may, ultimately, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/29/fbi-email-probe-election-clinton-presidency\" title=\"\">rather less effect on the election outcome</a> than some suppose. Yet it is no consolation that Mr Comey has also guaranteed that, if no charges are brought, he will inevitably be accused of rigging the outcome.</p>",

The rise of Uber has affected the livelihoods of traditional taxi firms all over the country and the pressure to drive down fares has compromised passenger safety.</p> <p>Hedge-funded Uber\u2019s success started with the Tory-Liberal coalition government\u2019s deregulation legislation, which received the royal assent 18 months ago. While the consultation around the bill was going on, I supported the taxi trade here in Medway and many other drivers\u2019 associations and their trade unions who lobbied against deregulation because they knew it would drive down wages and weaken the powers of local councils to determine how many cabs were licensed, or to maintain safe working practices.</p> <p>In spite of the overwhelming consensus in the consultation that the new measures were a bad thing and the achievement of one of the highest responses ever recorded in a legislation consultation, the bill slipped through, demonstrating that the consultation was a sham. Drivers have endured loss of earnings and security, while passengers found themselves driven to their destination by out-of-town strangers, reliant on a sat-nav instead of a local driver who knew the shortest routes. If drivers have behaved badly or their vehicles are in poor condition, the deregulated environment has made it much harder to trace the culprits or to award sanctions against them.</p> <p>The latest court ruling gives me hope that things can change and will embolden other exploited workers to challenge their employers, but if we want a fair and safe taxi trade, then everyone has to play their part. The lure of a cheap fare costs our community much more than the few pounds we think we are saving by taking the Uber option.<br><strong>Cllr Teresa Murray</strong><br><em>Deputy leader of the Labour group on Medway council</em></p> <p>\u2022 The landmark ruling on Uber taxi drivers\u2019 employment rights shows that the development of the so-called gig economy has, to date, been at the expense of the workers. This is hardly a surprise. Alongside the growth in self-employed workers we have seen a rise in the number of freelancers starting co-ops in order to create more security for themselves \u2013 and they have been doing this precisely because employers and legislation do not do it for them.</p> <p>Whether the judgment on Uber will set a precedent for other employers remains to be seen. What is clear is that we need to find a way for self-employed workers \u2013 from taxi drivers to music teachers \u2013 to create greater financial security and less uncertainty for themselves.<br><strong>Ed Mayo</strong><br><em>Secretary general, Co-operatives UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 I applaud the court victory of the Uber drivers and hope it begins a trend to ensure that workers are not exploited by rapacious organisations through false self-employment, zero-hours contracts or employment via an agency. It should also be a reminder that as consumers ever seeking lower prices we are unwittingly complicit in this exploitation. Perhaps we all need to remember that our low price is another\u2019s low pay, and be willing only to buy from companies that treat their workers fairly, even if we have to pay a little more.<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The rise of self-employment in the UK predates apps and Uber. HMRC must play a leading role in stemming the tide of bogus self-employment forced on workers by firms who regard employment status as a matter of choice rather than tax law. HMRC has a simple to use online tool to determine employment status \u2013 the Employment Status Indicator. Why does HMRC not compel firms to use the ESI for each new worker taken on (with sanctions for wilfully answering the questions wrongly)&#xa0;and to record the results in their records?<br><strong>Malcolm Thick</strong><br><em>Harwell, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 We should welcome the Uber decision, but it is too early to celebrate. While there may be no obvious legal grounds for a challenge, the fact that the implementation of the decision will have widespread implications will not be lost on the government and employers. They will not be supportive. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that discreet pressure, behind the scenes, will be brought to bear to ensure that the appeals tribunal reverses the findings. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but I have little faith in the sanctity of the British legal system.<br><strong>Tim Webb</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Following on from the Uber drivers\u2019 employment status victory, the construction industry was also guilty of dubious practices. Persons seeking work on building sites were handed an officially-designed checklist designed to check their employed/self-employed status, and told to \u201cjust tick these boxes and sign it\u201d. Such men carried out exactly the same jobs as directly employed men on the same site. Although their registration with HMRC was essential, the absence of holiday pay was a constant issue and subject to legal challenges from time to time.<br><strong>Peter Green</strong><br><em>Rotherham, South Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Is the Guardian anti-union?

Heathrow Airport Holdings is owned by FGP TopCo, an international consortium led by Ferrovial, a Spanish Company based in Madrid, in partnership with Qatar Holdings, Caisse de Depot du Quebec, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and the China Investment Corporation, among others. Heathrow Holdings has previously admitted it makes more from being a shopping mall than from the flying business and now the taxpayer is likely to be told to stump up \u00a35bn-\u00a310bn for added road and rail infrastructure, according to former transport minister Stephen Hammond.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before the crucial debate on pollution and health. Heathrow has never taken responsibility for the dangerous pollution caused by the stacking of aircraft waiting to land and anxious to shed surplus fuel over hapless residents below. Heathrow must come clean; this whole affair is a dirty business.<br><strong>Anna Ford</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/the-guardian-view-on-heathrows-third-runway-climate-loses-out-to-growth\" title=\"\">26 October</a>) has it right: so long as the mania for economic growth possesses us, terrible decisions \u2013 such as that to expand Heathrow \u2013 will go on being made. Is it not, therefore, time to draw the logical conclusion: that our society needs finally to put into question the logic of such growth? Let\u2019s give it up \u2013 and substitute the goal of actually making our lives better instead. <br><strong>Dr Rupert Read</strong><br><em>Chair of Green House and co-author, The Post-growth Project</em></p> <p>\u2022 Unless fail criteria are published in advance of the public consultation on the third runway at Heathrow, it can only be a waste of time and money. Just what would those being consulted be required to demonstrate to halt this development? Is there any independent authority whose opinion could conceivably change their minds? If the government has already made up its mind then why not go ahead and build it right now?<br><strong>Dr Richard Turner</strong><br><em>Harrogate, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 So the transport secretary suggests the runway could be put on a ramp over the M25, which would be cheaper and quicker than a tunnel. But aren\u2019t there even cheaper options? How about traffic lights or a roundabout? Or, cheapest of all, perhaps, a zebra crossing, so that road vehicles pull up when they see a plane waiting to cross.<br><strong>Richard Norman</strong><br><em>Canterbury, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Far from demolishing hundreds of homes to build a new runway, we could be demolishing redundant airports to build new homes. Northolt is a complete, but scandalously underused airport just five miles from Heathrow; it could easily become a Terminal 6 for non-hub and domestic traffic. Only just outside the M25 lies Farnborough, another fully operational airport working at a fraction of its capacity. And just a little further out, Greenham Common has a runway big enough to be an emergency landing site for the space shuttle, and it is now completely unused. <br><strong>Martin Lyster</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tony Hodbod (Letters, 26 October), in proposing Thorne Waste for an English national airport, must be unaware that it is a nationally important nature reserve. But of course, it is far more important that we increase our greenhouse gas emissions rather than protect the environment.<br><strong>Catherine Goundry</strong><br><em>Retford, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Manchester Airport with two runways and excess capacity is the third largest airport in Britain and is far more central to Britain. Living only 10 minutes from this international airport, I resent having to go to Heathrow to access direct flights to some parts of the world. Perhaps the investment in Heathrow could be redirected to encouraging British Airways to use Manchester as a hub, as it once didhelping to rebalance the economy.<br><strong>Moira Sykes</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Driven grouse shooting (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/28/grouse-shooting-estates-shored-up-by-millions-in-subsidies\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 28&#xa0;October) is a minority \u201csport\u201d which uses live birds as target practice, yet its destructive effects are paid for by the public. Earlier this year, Dr Mark Avery, Chris Packham, and the League Against Cruel Sports launched a petition calling on the government to ban driven grouse shooting. Shortly after the start of shooting season, the petition passed 100,000 signatures.</p> <p>The effects of driven grouse shooting are wide-ranging and devastating. Birds of prey are relentlessly persecuted to the point where the hen harrier is facing extinction in England. Other animals such as foxes, hares and stoats are wiped out on grouse moors using a range of cruel and indiscriminate devices. The burning of heather contributes to flooding and reduces the effectiveness of moorland to act as a reservoir to store carbon in the ground. All of this is done with considerable subsidy from the public purse; astonishing in these times of austerity.</p> <p>The government needs to take an impartial, scientific look at the industry, and its wider impact. Millions of animals are suffering and our moorlands are becoming monocultures. This is too high a price to pay for a minority hobby. We believe it is time to treasure our natural environment. It is time for a ban on driven grouse shooting.<br><strong>Isobel Hutchinson</strong><em> Director, Animal Aid</em><br><strong>Eduardo Goncalves</strong><em> CEO, League Against Cruel Sports</em><br><strong>Dominic Dyer</strong><em> CEO, Badger Trust</em><br><strong>Philip Mansbridge</strong><em> UK director, International Fund for Animal Welfare</em><br><strong>Claire Bass</strong><em> Executive director, Humane Society International UK</em><br><strong>Elisa Allen</strong><em> Director, Peta UK</em><br><strong>Anne Brummer</strong><em> CEO, Save Me Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 Only agricultural land is eligible for Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments as determined by Defra\u2019s Rural Payments Agency (RPA), which administers the scheme in England. The RPA guidelines make it clear that moorland used primarily for shooting purposes is not eligible for BPS payments, and there is also an \u201cactive farmer\u201d test for claimants along with a range of other criteria to prove that the land is in agricultural use. The primary land use on many moors managed for grouse shooting is low-intensity grazing, often leased to a tenant farmer, and it is the farming side of the business which benefits from these payments, not grouse shooting.</p> <p>Defra may be surprised that anyone is trying to suggest that they are subsidising grouse shooting, but divisive, class-war rhetoric has been an unfortunate feature of the latest campaign against moorland management. This attempt to suggest that government subsidies are being used to pay for grouse shooting makes for sensational headlines, but doesn\u2019t reflect the truth on the ground.</p> <p>Subsidies in the uplands are used to support agricultural and conservation activities, just as they are in the lowlands. These attempts to politicise the debate over how we manage our moorlands are deeply unhelpful, our solutions need to be driven by evidence and based in cooperation between landowners, conservationists and the shooting community.<br><strong>Liam Stokes</strong><br><em>Head of shooting, Countryside Alliance</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>They were once the elitist domain of bohemians and the rich, places where Francis Bacon would entertain his conquests, Damien Hirst would serve drinks naked, and Tom Jones and Bono would duet Sex Bomb on the piano. But the exclusive appeal of private members\u2019 clubs may be in decline, with one of London\u2019s most prominent venues, Soho House, struggling financially, and commentators warning that the venues have become too mainstream. </p> <p>In order to inject an extra \u00a340m into the business, the Soho House group has sold its 50% stake in the restaurants Pizza East, Dirty Burger and Chicken Shop, as well as increasing its overdraft with Barclays. This comes on top of a costly and high-interest loan of \u00a340m that the company took out last year, and accounts show that the business lost \u00a317.4m in 2015 and the year before lost \u00a328.4m. Its credit rating was also downgraded last year. </p> <p>However, it is not declining popularity that has triggered the company\u2019s mounting debt, but a costly programme of expansion across the world, prompting some to question the future of exclusive clubs accessible by a handful of members. </p> <p>Founded by Nick Jones in 1995 and owned by the American billionaire Ron Burkle, it has grown from being a single club on Greek Street into a sprawling global empire, with private sites from Istanbul to Mumbai and Miami.

The proliferation of the private members\u2019 clubs has meant their exclusivity has become diluted, and unlike the now defunct notorious private clubs such as the Colony Room, favoured by Bacon, Dylan Thomas and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/08/em-forster-passage-to-india-rereading\" draggable=\"true\">EM Forster</a>, they are no longer the places once favoured by the famous and artistic. </p> <p>Peter York, a social commentator who wrote The Official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/jun/08/fashion\" draggable=\"true\">Sloane Ranger</a> Handbook, claims \u201coversupply has ruined the magic\u201d of such venues.</p> <p>Several new private members\u2019 clubs opened in London this year, including the Devonshire Club, which demands a \u00a32,400 annual fee as well as a \u00a32,400 joining fee, Quo Vadis, which costs \u00a3500 a year, and the Chess Club in Mayfair, which also costs \u00a3500. </p> <p>York said: \u201cThe whole point of private members\u2019 clubs is that exclusivity, that they are where the magic people will all gather. Soho House is a very efficient operation, but there is one at every turn now, and they have diluted their brand to, I think, their detriment.</p> <p>\u201cI have been going to Soho House since it opened, and going there now it feels like it has lost something. There\u2019s nothing special about it any more; they\u2019ve lost that sheen, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not where the magic people, the famous people, go any more.\u201d</p> <p>Soho House has attempted to maintain its appeal to artists and creatives, offering discounts for those under 27, and the only condition of joining is that people have a \u201ccreative soul\u201d.

A vote was cast in which a majority of people expressed their will for something, but nobody said what. It is not undemocratic to want a little more detail, to worry about the long-term feasibility of having to bribe companies to stay here, to think that the single market is no small thing from which to exile oneself. We must learn to take allegiance wherever we find it, because the alternative is, frankly, what lost the remain side the referendum: arguments in silos, all caveat and no driving purpose.</p> <p>There is a continuing terror of politicians in disguise. Is Olney a true Lib Dem, or is she a Tory in liberal clothing? Didn\u2019t she once tell <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/richmond-park-lib-dem-candidate-said-theresa-may-is-impressi?utm_term=.hykrVWX4x#.nbr5L1w8y\">Twitter that she found Theresa May impressive?</a> Why doesn\u2019t she just join the Conservatives, if she finds them so competent? Come to that, hasn\u2019t Marder called himself a socialist before, which is a little bit like being a Trotskyist, which is a lot like wanting a Soviet society of state-run industries and gulags, if you remove all considerations of proportionality and meaning?</p> <p>We have to let politicians vary quite widely in their views on personalities, issues and ideas, on the understanding that we\u2019re all tacking in the same direction. If that sounds unsettling and weak, again, consider the alternative: to keep on losing.</p> <p>Perhaps the most understandable fear is that any alliance, between any combination of centre-left to green-left parties, spells the end for Labour, whose internal tensions are only ever alleviated when it can promise electoral dominance. It may be comprehensible, but it\u2019s yesterday\u2019s politics, and traps us in this egregious dichotomy where either Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters must take the whole country with them, or he must be obliterated to make way for \u201csensible\u201d Labour. It\u2019s time to start considering a new reality in which the two wings of Labour, whether as two separate parties or within the same party, draw energy from one another and the vision they share.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There isn\u2019t so much a fear as a love affair, on the left, with intractable difference, the reassurance of a stalemate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, there isn\u2019t so much a fear as a love affair on the left with intractable difference, the reassurance of a stalemate.

Indeed, underneath them is one of the most profound questions dividing all politics: whether we should keep on chasing growth indefinitely \u2013 so that each generation may be richer than the last, in perpetuity \u2013 or whether we should start modelling for ourselves a future of no growth, where generations reap different rewards, of leisure or community or peace.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sound and reasonable question, but the developments of today\u2019s politics threaten jobs and climate, growth and the future, trade and equality. The strongest and most coherent voices of hard Brexit are openly seeking a bonfire of regulations. They are laying this fire in our sitting room while we fight over whether to save the sofa or the curtains. There is something fascinating in the comfort we take from the familiarity of irreconcilable differences.</p> <p>This love of division cannot be discarded lightly \u2013 loyalty, to a leader or a party, is a powerful galvanising force and it\u2019s unclear, on the progressive side, how it will function without its guiding principle: hating all the other parties.</p> <p>Yet now, with the Conservatives in the grip of their most awful ghouls, we have an opportunity without precedent to lay our own fears to rest.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 1 November 2016.

  "<p>The GMB union has accused Uber of misleading its drivers by claiming last week\u2019s tribunal decision on working conditions only affects two drivers involved in the case. </p> <p>In a long-awaited judgment, an employment tribunal agreed with two drivers for the ride-hailing app that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">Uber\u2019s drivers were not self-employed and should receive the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, annual leave and other benefits</a>. Uber has said it will appeal against the judgment.</p> <p>James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam brought the case on behalf of a group 19 Uber workers who argued they were employed by the San Francisco-based company and not working for themselves. Lawyers said the victory would affect their fellow Uber drivers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/uber-ruling-an-enormous-decision-says-employment-lawyer-video\">have implications for tens of thousands of workers</a> in the so-called gig economy.</p> <p>But the GMB said Uber sent an email to its 40,000 drivers on Friday, signed by its regional general manager for northern Europe, Jo Bertram, who was criticised by the tribunal judges for using \u201ctwisted language\u201d and for being \u201cgrimly loyal\u201d to her company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-gig-economy-obligations-not-excuses-to-workers-are-needed\">The Guardian view on the gig economy: obligations not excuses to workers are needed | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bertram\u2019s email to the drivers said: \u201cAs you may be aware, earlier this year a small number of London partner-drivers brought a claim to challenge their self-employed status with Uber. Although we have today heard that this challenge has been successful at this first stage, it\u2019s very important to note that today\u2019s decision only affects two individuals and Uber will be appealing it.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be no change to your partnership with Uber in light of this decision and we will continue to support the overwhelming majority of drivers who tell us that they use the Uber app to be their own boss and choose when and where to drive.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal judges dismissed Uber\u2019s claim that its London operation was a mosaic of thousands of small businesses linked by a technology platform as \u201cfaintly ridiculous\u201d. They said Uber resorted to \u201cfictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology\u201d to portray their drivers as self-employed.</p> <p>In their judgment, the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/aslam-and-farrar-v-uber-reasons-20161028.pdf\">tribunal judges singled out Bertram for criticism</a> and quoted from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet to cast doubt on her testimony.</p> <p>\u201cMs Bertram spoke of Uber assisting the drivers to \u2018grow\u2019 their businesses, but no driver is in a position to do anything of the kind, unless growing his business simply means spending more hours at the wheel. Reflecting on the case, and on the grimly loyal evidence of Ms Bertram in particular, we cannot help being reminded of Queen Gertrude\u2019s most celebrated line: \u2018The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>Maria Ludkin, GMB\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cEven after the judge found Ms Bertram\u2019s evidence lacked credibility and described her as \u2018grimly loyal\u2019, she continues to try and advance a misleading and false set of facts. The Uber judgment applies to 40,000 UK drivers, not two. Ms Bertram might be wise to think how this judgment reflects on her before she issues any more statements.\u201d</p> <p>Uber will take the case to the employment appeal tribunal, and following its decision there could be further hearings in the court of appeal and then the supreme court. Any payments due to drivers will not be calculated until that process is over.</p> <p>Other drivers with the firm will not automatically receive payouts but, if the company accepts the ruling, it will have to change its contracts to avoid more cases being brought by drivers. Lawyers say that Uber\u2019s terms and conditions are similar for all of its UK operatives.</p> <p>GMB also rejected Uber\u2019s claim that its drivers earned an average \u00a316 an hour and that most wanted to keep the flexibility their current contracts provide.</p> <p>Ludkin said: \u201cThis judgment in no way affects driver flexibility, it merely guarantees them basic employment rights. Uber\u2019s decision to appeal that is purely related to protecting their ample profits and nothing to do with protecting the drivers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Meanwhile other cases are likely to follow the Uber judgment. Cycle couriers are making similar claims against firms including CitySprint, Addison Lee, eCourier and Excel. Law firms are also talking to workers at Deliveroo, which delivers meals by cycle and motorbike.</p> <p>An Uber spokesman said: \u201cThe ruling would affect the two drivers that were the test cases in the tribunal. However, while we appeal this judgement drivers that use the Uber app remain independent and able to choose when and where they drive.\u201d<br></p>",

She argues that the new models\u2019 touch bar is the perfect feature to reposition the overall range towards the high end, as well as taking on competition from other computer manufacturers that have been building their own touchscreen devices.</p> <p>The shift has been rapid, and reflects the changing shape of the PC market, Apple\u2019s attempts to refashion its line-up of computers and mobile devices for that altered world, and some new competition from an old foe, says Ben Wood from the analysts CCS Insight.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that the last significant update to the MacBook Pro family was 2012,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real indication of the broader malaise in the notebook market that Apple was able to get away with selling a four-year-old product as successfully as it has.

Until last week, the most expensive iPad, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi and mobile data, was more expensive than Apple\u2019s cheapest laptop. That posed a problem for Apple, which struggled to explain what the two devices were for: if a laptop is best for work on the move, who would pay more for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad\">an iPad</a>?</p> <p>Now, it can more consistently structure its messaging: iPads are cheaper, hardier portable devices with all-day battery life, but if your main computer is to be portable, a premium laptop is the way to go.</p> <p>The downside for British customers is that Apple has picked perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/theresa-may-brexit-parliamentary-vote\">worst possible time</a> to enact the change. Thanks to the collapse in the value of the pound, the company repriced its entire line \u2013 even older, unchanged computers \u2013 raising the price of some by as much as \u00a3500 to account for the new exchange rate. That means customers who were holding off until new computers came out have suddenly found that the older computers are more expensive as well.</p> <p>Apple said: \u201cApple suggests product prices internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business.

Still, though, the danger appears averted until Bolasie appears out of nowhere and i a single movement slides in on Reid and crosses, setting up Lukaku for an open goal, and he nods home from two yards. Brilliant from Bolasie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51be2503c55cfb8780e624d9736383b68f97e4ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51be2503c55cfb8780e624d9736383b68f97e4ca/0_0_3234_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lukaku heads home the opener.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lukaku heads home the opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"243a50035e43ce2c6910e232871e19e89518f3bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/243a50035e43ce2c6910e232871e19e89518f3bc/0_0_3732_2191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"And celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"587\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-30T14:47:34.935Z\">at 2.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58160566e4b0219a00d3a4e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-30T14:36:46.857Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>48 min</strong> Payet loses possession then steps in front of Funes Mori for no reason.

Their key players are fit which means their key combinations are working; the best time to play them has already passed. </p> <p>Everton, meanwhile, are in the midst of their own dodgy run. Since beating Middlesbrough in the middle of last month, they\u2019ve not won a game, losing to Norwich, Bournemouth and Burnley and drawing with Crystal Palace and Manchester City. And yet, they are a team of formidable attacking ability. Ross Barkley is a transcendental talent - if he can learn the game, he will be a star - and on a good day, Romelu Lukaku is unplayable. Behind them, Gareth Barry and Idrissa Gueye know what to do, and on the wing, Yannick Bolasie and Kevin Mirallas are, well, wingers.

The 63-year-old Native American was one of hundreds of activists gathered to block construction of the Dakota Access pipeline on Thursday, when police with tanks and riot gear surrounded them and began making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">mass arrests</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">Dakota Access pipeline: Native Americans allege cruel treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The situation was sad and frightening, she said, but there was a fleeting moment of levity when one officer on the loudspeaker warned the demonstrators not to shoot \u201cbows and arrows\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe all laughed,\u201d Holy Elk Face said, noting that she wouldn\u2019t even know how to use a toy bow and arrow.</p> <p>For some Native American activists, the officer\u2019s comment was the latest sign that a highly militarized police force has little understanding of indigenous culture and is set on treating the protesters like violent rioters, regardless of their tactics.</p> <p>The notion that the criminal justice system is biased against Native American protesters came into sharp view hours later, when a jury in Portland, Oregon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-brothers-not-guilty-trial\">issued a verdict of not guilty</a> for white militia leaders who staged an armed occupation of federal land to protest government policies.</p> <p>The fact that protesters with guns were acquitted on the same day police arrested 141 \u201cwater protectors\u201d, who have often relied on indigenous songs and prayers to convey their message, sparked a firestorm on social media about <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/10/27/13447038/oregon-wildlife-refuge-verdict\">white privilege</a> and police brutality against people of color.</p> <p>At the Standing Rock camps in North Dakota, where the fight against the $3.8bn oil pipeline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">escalating</a> dramatically, Native Americans said the Oregon verdict was an infuriating and painful reminder that the law treats them differently \u2013 and that the odds are stacked against them in their high-stakes battle to save their land.</p> <h2>\u2018If native people were armed\u2019</h2> <p>On the surface, there are parallels between the Dakota Access pipeline protest and the Oregon militia standoff, in which the brothers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/oregon-militia-standoff-trial-begins-ammon-ryan-bundy\"> Ammon and Ryan Bundy</a> seized the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/03/oregon-militia-threatens-showdown-with-us-agents-at-wildlife-refuge\">Malheur national wildlife refuge</a> in a protest against the government\u2019s treatment of ranchers.</p> <p>In both cases, protesters declared willingness to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">risk their lives</a> to fight for land rights, and law enforcement responded that the protests were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-arrests-journalists-filmmakers\">illegal and dangerous</a>.</p> <p>The Oregon and North Dakota camps both grew organically in remote rural areas.

Admittedly, that\u2019s not an especially high bar, but with his record (he\u2019s won promotion in the last four seasons he\u2019s managed in this division), they could hardly have found a safer pair of hands.</p> <p><strong>After Villa\u2019s ropey start to the season under Roberto di Matteo,</strong> a fifth might look like a tall order, but they\u2019re only seven points off the playoffs and a win here would put Birmingham under some pressure. \u201cIt will certainly help if you can get the result,\u201d Bruce said this week. \u201cTwo weeks ago we were in the bottom three. If we do manage to turn them over we\u2019d be three points behind them and sitting outside the play-offs. That\u2019s got to be the long-term game and if we do make it three wins out of four it would be a smashing achievement for what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Opposite Bruce, the old stager and experienced hand, </strong><strong>will be Gary Rowett,</strong> one of the division\u2019s brightest young managers. Having guided Blues through years of uncertainty as their chaotic ownership situation precluded him from really spending any money of note, that is now (almost) sorted and he can get on with being a normal manager. Rowett usually has a glass of wine before games as his team are warming up, but given this is a noon kick-off, that might be more of a struggle. \u201cI might have a bottle for breakfast, I might even put it on my cornflakes!\u201d he joked the other day. Or, at least, I hope he was joking.</p> <p><strong>This game is usually pretty spicy,</strong> and we\u2019ll have some highlights from games past for you shortly.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 12.00 GMT</p> </div>   </div>",

Serves 4-6.</p> <p>For the pastry:<br><strong>plain flour </strong>100g, plus extra for dusting<br><strong>wholegrain spelt flour </strong>100g<br><strong>sea salt </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>butter, chopped </strong>75g<br><strong>skyr (quark) or fromage frais </strong>75g<br></p> <p>For the filling:<br><strong>Jerusalem artichokes </strong>200g<br><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br><strong>garlic cloves, chopped</strong> 2<br><strong>spinach</strong> 500g<br><strong>eggs, beaten </strong>5<br><strong>full-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche </strong>100ml<br><strong>feta cheese </strong>200g, crumbled<br><strong>freshly grated nutmeg</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>sea salt </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>Begin with the pastry. Mix both flours with the salt in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingertips. Mix in the skyr (quark) or fromage frais. Knead the dough lightly with your hands just until the ingredients are combined. (Alternatively, pulse all the ingredients together in a food processor, adding a little water if the dough does not come together.)<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was a child we had cauliflower raw with a dip: that memory inspired this great salad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Roll the dough out on a floured surface and butter a tart tin or dish, about 28cm in diameter. Use the pastry to line the tart tin, then refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and pour in baking beans or uncooked rice. Bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes, then remove the baking beans and parchment and bake for a further 5 minutes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, make the filling. Peel the artichokes and cut them into 1.5cm chunks. Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the artichokes and saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes, then add the garlic and let it cook for about 5 minutes; take off the heat. If using fresh spinach, rinse in cold water, then place in a separate saucepan over a medium heat and allow it to wilt. When it is just wilted, drain really well in a sieve.</p> <p>Put the beaten eggs, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, feta, nutmeg and salt and pepper into a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Fold in the drained spinach and Jerusalem artichokes. Pour the mixture into the pastry case, return it to the oven and bake for 30\u201335 minutes, or until the filling has set but retains a slight wobble. Serve right away with a nice salad.</p> <h2>Cauliflower, prawns and dill</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c70b949361fea013144989a0b7602856cbc8f179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c70b949361fea013144989a0b7602856cbc8f179/0_0_6200_8272/750.jpg\" alt=\"Cauliflower, prawns and dill salad in a pale blue bowl, the red of radish showing\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raw deal: cauliflower, prawns and dill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbus Leth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I was growing up we ate cauliflower raw with a dip.

The cream is partly inspired by my favourite Danish author, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/01/karen-blixen-nobel-prize\">Karen Blixen</a>. Serves 8.</p> <p>For the apple sauce:<br><strong>Bramley apples</strong> 600g<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 40g<br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>For the layers:<br><strong>soft butter</strong> 175g<br><strong>caster sugar </strong>175g<br><strong>egg</strong> 1<br><strong>plain flour</strong> 175g<br><strong>ground cinnamon</strong> 3 tsp<br><strong>ground cardamom</strong> 2 tsp<br></p> <p>For the cream:<br><strong>hazelnuts</strong> 100g<br><strong>double cream </strong>400ml<br><strong>single cream</strong> 100ml<br><strong>icing sugar</strong> 2 tsp</p> <p>Peel and dice the apples and put them into a pan with the sugar and lemon juice. Let them simmer for 15-20 minutes until you have a smooth sauce. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Draw a 20cm circle using a pencil on 7 sheets of baking parchment. Turn these over and arrange on as many baking sheets as necessary to fit (you may have to bake these in batches).</p> <p>Beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy, then beat in the egg. Mix the flour and spices together and fold into the creamed mixture. Using a spatula, spread the mixture as evenly as possible inside each visible circle on the pieces of baking parchment.</p> <p>Bake in the oven for 6-8 minutes or until the edges start to take on some colour. Set aside to cool on the sheets of parchment on a wire rack. While the layers are cooling, roast the hazelnuts. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast in the oven, then wrap them in a clean tea towel and give them a good rub, so the skins come off. Roughly chop them. Whip both creams with the icing sugar and stir in two-thirds of the hazelnuts.</p> <p>Assemble the cake immediately before serving. Place a crisp layer on a serving plate and add some apple sauce, then add another crisp layer, then some cream. Repeat this layer pattern twice, then add the last crisp layer and some apple sauce on top. Sprinkle the remaining chopped hazelnuts on top and serve right away.</p> <p><em>Scandinavian Comfort Food: Embracing the Art of Hygge by Trine Hahnemann is published by Quadrille at \u00a325.

  "<p>On 5 November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-berger\">John Berger</a> will turn 90. As I travel to Paris to meet him, I carry a bagful of books. There are recently published art historical writings, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/337806/s/portraits-john-berger-on-artists/\"><em>Portraits</em></a>, and, to coincide with his 90th birthday, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/landscapes-445290.html\"><em>Landscapes</em></a> (judiciously selected by Tom Overton for Verso), a fascinating series of encounters with the thinkers who have mattered to Berger, from Brecht and Walter Benjamin to Rosa Luxemburg. A marvellous miscellany of more recent work, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confabulations.html\"><em>Confabulations</em></a>, has just been published by Penguin, and <a href=\"https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/a-jar-of-wild-flowers/forthcoming/\"><em>A Jar of Wild Flowers: Essays in Celebration of John Berger</em></a><em> </em>(including tributes from Ali Smith, Sally Potter and Julie Christie) is coming soon from Zed books.</p> <p>The homage continues on film in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/16/the-seasons-in-quincy-four-portraits-of-john-berger-review-tilda-swinton-berlin-2016\"><em>The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger</em></a>, shot during his late 80s \u2013 a collage of informal conversation and political discussion, with offerings by Tilda Swinton, the writer and producer Colin MacCabe and others. It was shot in the hamlet in Haute-Savoie, in the French Alps, where Berger lived for more than 40 years. These jostling admirers show not only that the man is greatly loved, but an intellectual indebtedness behind the wish to say thank you. Critic, novelist, poet, dramatist, artist, commentator \u2013 and, above all, storyteller \u2013 Berger was described by Susan Sontag as peerless in his ability to make \u201cattentiveness to the sensual world\u201d meet \u201cimperatives of conscience\u201d. His book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ways-of-seeing.html\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a>, and the 1972 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dtnvm\">BBC television series</a> based on it, changed the way at least two generations responded to art. And his writing since then \u2013 especially about migration \u2013 has changed the way many of us see the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Berger still has the ability to give himself the slip, to turn perception into an out-of-body experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger now lives in Antony, a suburb seven miles outside Paris, where he stays with his old friend Nella Bielski, an actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/24/fiction.features1\">and writer</a> who grew up in the Soviet Union. They open the door together, and as we sit down to lunch, she turns to me and says: \u201cThe thing you have to understand about John is that he is not interested in talking about himself.\u201d While the chorus of approval gets louder on this side of the Channel, he is, unlikely as this might sound, barely aware of any fuss brewing. When I produce a proof of <em>A Jar of Wild Flowers</em>, he turns it over in his hands in delighted surprise. \u201cThat is a drawing by Melina,\u201d he exclaims, surveying the flowers with spindly stems on the cover, \u201cmy granddaughter.\u201d He gets up from the table and returns with an oil portrait, the size of a sheet of A4 paper. It is of an ageless face and yet Melina is only 13. (Berger has three children \u2013 Katya, Jacob and Yves \u2013 and five grandchildren.) He props it next to us and we look at her, as if she had joined us for lunch. \u201cIf you ask me who I am,\u201d Berger says, \u201cI\u2019d like to see myself through her eyes, in the way she looks at me.\u201d Her stare is disconcertingly level. She looks, we agree, as if she knows more than she could possibly know or have seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfafe60d160d6d1036e42899acf9b72b7c067218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfafe60d160d6d1036e42899acf9b72b7c067218/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"The painting of Berger's granddaughter, Melina, 13, by Jules Linglin\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The painting of his granddaughter, Melina, 13, by Jules Linglin, of which Berger says: \u2018If you ask me who I am, I\u2019d like to see myself through her eyes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jules Linglin/Kate Kellaway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two things that are wonderful about this moment. The first is the reminder that Berger is as interested as ever in ways of seeing; that he still has the ability to give himself the slip, to turn perception into an out-of-body experience. And second, it is characteristic that he is keen to champion the young artist who painted his granddaughter. \u201cFetch me a piece of card from that side table,\u201d he says. He writes in his not-quite-steady, attractively looping hand: Jules Linglin. \u201cHe is going to be very well known one day,\u201d he declares, handing the card back to me.</p> <p>In spite of his wish to be seen through his granddaughter\u2019s eyes, it is Berger himself I now observe. He is smallish, but his face is big \u2013 handsomely hewn, with blue eyes and thick white hair. I have recently watched <em>Ways of Seeing</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk\">on YouTube</a>, and it is extraordinary how commanding the four episodes still are. Berger had no time for ivory towers \u2013 his way of seeing was radical. Forty-four years ago he was a charismatic presence, looking into the camera with piercing eyes and a frequent frown, as if constantly on the edge of disagreeing with himself. The look was fitting because what the series did was to make people rethink. He never ducked difficulty: he described, for instance, how women, in traditional painting, were there to \u201cfeed an appetite, not to have any of their own\u201d. Unlike Kenneth Clark\u2019s patrician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/19/kenneth-clark-civilisation-bbc-review\"><em>Civilisation</em></a><em> </em>(1969), <em>Ways of Seeing</em> was never overbearing. In each episode, Berger sports the same groovy shirt with a geometric brown design on a cream background. His voice is clear and emphatic and fudges its Rs. His final words in the series are: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve shown, and what I\u2019ve said\u2026 must be judged against your own experience.\u201d That is what everything he has written asks us to do.</p> <p>For me, Berger will always be the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/to-the-wedding.html\"><em>To the Wedding</em></a> \u2013 a moving, unexpectedly affirmative novel about Aids, in which truth pursued fiction because he discovered only after he had started writing it that his daughter-in-law was HIV-positive. When I was a Booker judge in 1995, it was, out of 141 contenders, the novel I most wanted to win \u2013 although it possibly made for a quieter life that it didn\u2019t. Berger famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/09/lookingbackatthebookerjoh\">gave away half his Booker prize money</a> to the Black Panthers in 1972, when <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/g.html\"><em>G</em></a>, his postmodern novel about an Italian philanderer\u2019s political coming-of-age, secured the prize. A lifelong Marxist (although never a member of the Communist party), he disapproved of Booker McConnell\u2019s historical association with indentured labour in the Caribbean. The other half of the money went to funding Berger\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/seventh-man.html\"><em>A Seventh Man</em></a>, with the photographer <a href=\"http://www.jeanmohr.ch/image/oeuvre\">Jean Mohr</a>, about European migrant workers \u2013 a work he has since said is the one he would most like to survive him. Apparently, one of the Black Panthers went with him to the Booker ceremony and repeatedly advised him to \u201ckeep it cool\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm like the lookout guy on a boat who does small jobs, such as shovelling stuff into a boiler, but I\u2019m no navigator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now Berger is looking at my proof copy of <em>Confabulations</em> \u2013 a miscellany of his essays and drawings (he went to the Chelsea School of Art as a young man, studying under Henry Moore, and taught there before being hired as the <em>New Statesman</em>\u2019s art critic). We consider his lively sketch of half a dozen topsy-turvy mushrooms. Underneath, in his hand, is written: \u201cSee you later, Omelette\u2026\u201d People forget that Berger is funny. And curious. And that he listens \u2013 how he listens. Over lunch, the small talk is of artichokes and an incredible Georgian dish involving walnuts, but this then leads Nella to talk about Berger\u2019s American wife, Beverly Bancroft (mother of Yves; the older children are from an earlier marriage), who died in 2013, and of her artistry as a gardener. This makes me think of the most moving scene in <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>, in which Berger urges Tilda Swinton\u2019s teenage twins to pick raspberries because Beverly loved them. Berger suggests the twins gather photos of Beverly \u2013 and they go ahead and make a sort of homemade shrine and eat bowlfuls of raspberries alongside it. \u201cYour pleasure will give her pleasure,\u201d Berger tells them. Towards the end of lunch, Nella whispers to me, in an aside, that she has nicknamed her Parisian house \u201cHotel Spinoza\u201d \u2013 after Berger\u2019s favourite 17th-century philosopher. His book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bento-s-sketchbook-268205.html\"><em>Bento\u2019s Sketchbook</em></a> (2011) was inspired by Spinoza, whose day job was as a lens grinder. Like his hero, Berger prefers not to distinguish between the physical and spiritual. Spinoza\u2019s vision, he now tells me, is that \u201call is indivisible\u201d.</p> <p>After lunch we move into his study, a den of paintings, a place of light, its windows thrown wide, looking on to trees. He tries to make himself comfortable on the white sofa, an arthritic back giving him trouble. As a writer, Berger has that rare and wonderful gift of being able to make complex thoughts simple. He once said, in a BBC interview with Jeremy Isaacs, that he likes, in all his work, to follow the advice of the photographer <a href=\"https://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535353\">Robert Capa</a>: \u201cWhen the picture is not good enough, go closer\u2026\u201d His eye for detail remains unrivalled and consistently surprising (think of his irresistible observation that cows walk as if they were wearing high heels). Reading him is like standing at a window \u2013 perhaps a bit like the window of this study \u2013 with no one blocking the view. \u201cThe way I observe comes naturally to me as a curious person \u2013 I\u2019m like <em>la vigie</em> \u2013 the lookout guy on a boat who does small jobs, maybe such as shovelling stuff into a boiler, but I\u2019m no navigator \u2013 absolutely the opposite. I wander around the boat, find odd places \u2013 the masts, the gunwale \u2013 and then simply look out at the ocean. Being aware of travelling has nothing to do with being a navigator.\u201d</p> <p>Berger was born in Stoke Newington, north London. His father, Stanley, was a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who came from Trieste via Liverpool to London and was much affected by the first world war, in which he served as an infantry officer and was awarded the Military Cross. He loved painting and was self-taught (paternal conscience led him, when he found John reading Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em>, to confiscate the book, along with five others, and lock them up in his safe). In Colin MacCabe\u2019s film for <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>, Berger instructs Tilda Swinton (a friend for more than 20 years) on how to quarter and peel apples in the way his father used to do, and affectionately remembers how his father wanted him to be a lawyer, a doctor, an English gentleman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3b160689d23db595ce781fc9efe94527255ed87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b160689d23db595ce781fc9efe94527255ed87/0_0_928_523/500.jpg\" alt=\"Berger with Tilda Swinton in The Seasons in Quincy.\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berger with Tilda Swinton in<em> The Seasons in Quincy</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Berger\u2019s mother, Miriam, came from Bermondsey, south London (her father worked in the docks and looked after brewery dray horses). She had been a suffragette and, Berger has said, was a \u201cvery mysterious person, very secretive\u201d. But she was not secretive about her ambition that her son would one day become a writer. Berger prefers to avoid talking about his boarding school, St Edward\u2019s, Oxford, which he once described as \u201clunatic\u201d and with \u201csadism, torture, bullying\u2026 an absolutely monstrous place, a little totalitarian system\u201d. He was sent there aged six and ran away at 16. Was it at school he first understood that the world was unjust? \u201cI learnt even earlier,\u201d he replies, \u201cat about five.\u201d And he pauses and I wait. It is like watching a fisherman pulling on a line: \u201cMy mother \u2013 to make money to send me to school \u2013 made biscuits, sweets and chocolate to sell. I didn\u2019t see much of her as she was always in the kitchen, working. But once I was in the kitchen and a young man on a bicycle came in and asked for two bars of chocolate. She picked them up, told him the price and he said: \u2018Oh, forgive me, I\u2019ve not got this money, they\u2019re too expensive for me,\u2019 and walked out without any chocolate. And I was enormously struck by this incident. I did not judge. I did not judge my mother nor did I judge him for not having enough money.\u201d He pauses, \u201cI was just waiting for Karl Marx,\u201d and he laughs.</p> <p>In his essay Impertinence (in <em>Confabulations</em>), he describes the New Zealand governess (pre-school) who used to banish him into what she called \u201cthe Cry Cupboard\u201d whenever he wept. Sometimes his mother would come upstairs to see how he was doing and cheer him along with a box of her chocolate fudge. \u201cSchool, rather than confronting me with something, confirmed something I already felt because, from a very early age, I had this sense of harshness and the need for endurance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This landscape was part of my energy, my body. I loved it not because it was a view \u2013 but because I participated in it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1944 he joined up, refusing a commission with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, and became a lance corporal at a training camp. He preferred the company of working-class recruits, for whom he became a scribe, writing their letters home. In a sense, he has continued to do this all his life: telling other people\u2019s stories lest they vanish. In a conversation with Susan Sontag, he once said: \u201cA story is always a rescuing operation.\u201d And he has also said (in <em>The Seasons in Quincy</em>): \u201cIf I\u2019m a storyteller it\u2019s because I listen. For me, a storyteller is like a <em>passeur</em> who gets contraband across a frontier.\u201d</p> <p>In his 1975 book <em>A Seventh Man</em>, about migration, the rescuing impulse is clear. Berger writes in the preface: \u201cTo outline the experience of the migrant worker and to relate this to what surrounds him \u2013 both physically and historically \u2013 is to grasp more surely the political reality of the world at this moment. The subject is European, its meaning is global. Its theme is unfreedom.\u201d When he considers today\u2019s refugee crisis \u2013 no longer confined to Europe \u2013 does he see the first world as suffering from a failure of imagination? There is another extended pause, like a ravine into which one might fall. Eventually he replies: \u201cWhat two different people have in common will always, in all cases, be larger than what differentiates them. And yet for dozens of different reasons, circumstances blind people to that.\u201d</p> <p>And what does he think about Brexit? He leans back on the sofa (we have now shifted from the overheated study into a cooler parlour, a sofa crawl in operation) and admits it has always been important to him to define himself as European. He then attempts to describe what he sees as the bigger picture: \u201cIt seems to me that we have to return, to recapitulate what globalisation meant, because it meant that capitalism, the world financial organisations, became speculative and ceased to be first and foremost productive, and politicians lost nearly all their power to take political decisions \u2013 I mean politicians in the traditional sense. Nations ceased to be what they were before.\u201d In Meanwhile (the last essay in <em>Landscapes</em>) he notes that the word \u201chorizon\u201d has slipped out of view in political discourse. And he adds, returning to Brexit, that he voted with his feet long ago, moving to France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60577ec26b72ae2f91c7e80139b067e8bc9c5d36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60577ec26b72ae2f91c7e80139b067e8bc9c5d36/0_0_2184_2743/796.jpg\" alt=\"John Berger c1962, the year he moved to France.\" width=\"796\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Berger c1962, the year he moved to France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Keen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We talk about what it is for a person to adopt a foreign country as home, and about how it is possible to love a landscape like a familiar face. For Berger, that face is the Haute-Savoie. \u201cThis is the landscape I lived in for decades [he left only after Beverly died; his son Yves still lives there with his family]. It matters to me because during that time, I worked there like a peasant. OK, don\u2019t let\u2019s exaggerate. I didn\u2019t work as hard as they did but I worked pretty hard, doing exactly the same things as the peasants, working with them. This landscape was part of my energy, my body, my satisfaction and discomfort. I loved it not because it was a view \u2013 but because I participated in it.\u201d</p> <p>He explains: \u201cThe connection between the human condition and labour is frequently forgotten, and for me was always so important. At 16, I went down a coal mine in Derbyshire and spent a day on the coal face \u2013 just watching the miners. It had a profound effect.\u201d What did it make you feel? \u201cRespect,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cJust respect. There are two kinds. Respect to do with ceremony \u2013 what happens when you visit the House of Lords. And a completely different respect associated with danger.\u201d He says: \u201cThis is not a prescription for others, but when I look back on my life I think it\u2019s very significant I never went to a university. I refused to go. Lots of people were pushing me and I said, \u2018No. I don\u2019t want to\u2019, because those years at university form a whole way of thinking.\u201d And you feel free from that? \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even at my old age, I\u2019m still capable of getting very angry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berger \u2013 fittingly, given his work with peasants \u2013 means shepherd in French. Do the French see him as one of their own? \u201cMy writing in France has not had a huge impact. The countries where I\u2019m most read are Spain, Latin American and until recently, oddly, Turkey\u2026 and Italy.\u201d Nor has he lived up to his surname, except \u201cI\u2019ve occasionally taken a ewe on heat in the back of my 2CV to meet a ram\u201d. I say we don\u2019t call that shepherding, we call that something else. He laughs. He is a man of action: until a few months ago he was (a most dashing octogenarian) still riding a motorbike. Nella tells me they hope it won\u2019t be long before he rides again \u2013 and swims. Berger is a keen swimmer and, in <em>Confabulations</em>, writes brilliantly about the democracy of swimming \u2013 people stripped of telltale trappings, doing their lengths. \u201cWhen you are swimming,\u201d he says, \u201cyou become almost weightless, and that weightlessness has something in common with thought.\u201d There is also a wonderful account in <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/11/22/john-berger-on-%E2%80%98bento%E2%80%99s-sketchbook%E2%80%99/\"><em>Bento\u2019s Sketchbook </em></a>of a friendship he strikes up with a Cambodian woman who shares the same Parisian swimming pool. She gives him a painting of a bird and, he maintains, teaches him something about homelessness.</p> <p>As he nudges closer to 90, Berger feels his own way of seeing has changed surprisingly little, although, he points out, technology has changed the way younger generations explore art. He admits, then, to his enthusiasm for texting: \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan for a long while because it\u2019s like whispers \u2013 and with that goes intimacy, secrecy, playfulness\u2026\u201d But there is nothing fixed about the way he sees. He believes one never sees the same picture twice: \u201cThe second time I saw the <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Grunewald_Isenheim1.jpg\">Gr\u00fcnewald altarpiece</a> was after a terrorist attack \u2013 it was the same painting yet I saw it differently.\u201d The importance of certain painters has shifted too. He reveres Modigliani less, admires Vel\u00e1zquez more: \u201cWhen one is young, one likes drama, excitation, bravura \u2013 Vel\u00e1zquez has none of this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/12/john-berger-writing-is-an-off-shoot-of-something-deeper\">John Berger: \u2018Writing is an off-shoot of something deeper\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a writer, Berger has always had a gift for making absences present. Can he summon the people he has lost in his mind? \u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026 they are very present.\u201d I tell him how moved I was by his essay Krakow (in <em>Landscapes</em>), in which he remembers a New Zealand teacher, Ken, a huge influence on him. And his eyes fill as I speak. It was Ken who told him that whenever he could not sleep, he should \u201cimagine you are shuffling a pack of cards\u201d \u2013 advice he still follows. Ken also taught him the trick (not so useful now) of how to walk into a pub for a spot of underage drinking: \u201cDon\u2019t look back\u2026 don\u2019t doubt for a moment, just be surer of yourself than they are.\u201d And he advised against self-pity. \u201cWhenever I might have been filled with self-pity, I turned it into furious anger. Even at my old age, I\u2019m still capable of getting very angry.\u201d</p> <p>But Berger\u2019s greatest strength in old age is his ability to live in the present. \u201cI cultivated this early on \u2013 and this is the paradox \u2013 because it was an escape from prescriptions, prophecies, consequences and causes.\u201d The present moment is key to his thinking too. In <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, he suggests that paintings embody the present in which they were painted. Defining the secret of reading aloud well, he says it is \u201crefusing to look ahead, to be in the moment\u201d. And he says that a story puts its listener \u201cin an eternal present\u201d. He has also written about the circularity of time. Does he think that applies to an individual life? Is there, in old age, a way in which one starts to hold hands with one\u2019s younger self?</p> <p>\u201cTime is circular, and in relation to that portrait of Melina, that is exactly what I feel.\u201d He suggests I take a photo of the painting. We carry it into the sunlight, prop it against the back of a chair. I say the <em>Observer</em> will need a photograph to go with this interview and he asks with boyish mischief: \u201cCouldn\u2019t we use her instead?\u201d</p> <p>It is only after I get home that I realise I failed to ask him how he intends to spend his birthday. I text him and he rings straight back. \u201cListen,\u201d he says, \u201cI feel so grateful to have reached 90 \u2013 it is such an age \u2013 and to my friends for wanting to celebrate, but what I\u2019ve told them all is that what we ought to do on the day is be silent.

Her parents were Hungarian journalists, jailed by the Soviet regime in Budapest in the 1950s. Her father was kept in a secret police prison cell that once held Field, in a jail that also held Field\u2019s wife, Herta. When all concerned were free, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101850.html\">Endre and Illona Marton</a> were the first and only journalists to interview Field.

He was a Boston quaker, born in 1904, a brilliant mind who completed Harvard in two years and joined the state department.

It mines a rich seam: spies and spying, central Europe between the wars and after, the devastating effects of totalitarianism, fanaticism and betrayal.</p> <p>\u201cI have a fascination with espionage that goes back to my earliest childhood,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I first heard the word \u2018spy\u2019, the Hungarian word for it, when I was six years old when my parents were falsely accused of being spies \u2013 for being good journalists really, the last independent journalists in Budapest in the 1950s. And the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre.\u201d<br></p> <p>In precis, Field\u2019s bizarre saga is this. Appalled by the horrors of the first world war, an internationalist and pacifist, he was pushed left by the Great Depression, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1927/03/the-case-of-sacco-and-vanzetti/306625/\">the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti</a> and President Hoover\u2019s brutal treatment of <a href=\"https://zinnedproject.org/materials/the-bonus-army/\">the Bonus Army</a>. Seeking to correct the repressive course he thought his country was on, to prevent another war, Field began to pass documents to Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec11ad1ed2b76124bbf0ac875479c78e296b88bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec11ad1ed2b76124bbf0ac875479c78e296b88bb/165_0_756_945/400.jpg\" alt=\"Kati Marton: \u2018the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre\u2019\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kati Marton: \u2018the intersections between my saga and Noel Field\u2019s saga are bizarre.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Stringer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Spain during the civil war, he worked for the League of Nations. During the second world war, he ran aid for the Unitarian Service Committee \u2013 and channelled it to communists first. He also worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a predecessor of the CIA. In peacetime, he went to Prague. He hoped to find new purpose but he was seized, taken to Hungary, imprisoned and brutally tortured.</p> <p>Field became a pawn in the last Stalinist purges, his name deployed in show trials to incriminate others though he was never tried himself. As Marton tells in shattering sequence, in the most extraordinary passages of an extraordinary book, family members went behind the Iron Curtain to find him. They paid a terrible cost. Field\u2019s faith never wavered, though, and in Budapest in 1970 he was buried with full Soviet honours.</p> <h2>\u2018The fixed point has always been Budapest\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c38fda2ed1ec9e49157b947afb911d53c689bec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c38fda2ed1ec9e49157b947afb911d53c689bec/0_0_1200_857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An identification card issued in 1946, by the US war department for Noel Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Government</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Marton\u2019s last book but one, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/books/review/Furst-t.html\">Enemies of the People</a>, she told her parents\u2019 story: how they were taken from her when she was five, how they came back, how they fled to freedom. She then wrote <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/paris-a-love-story-by-kati-marton/2012/08/31/8b554d8c-f058-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_story.html\">Paris: A Love Story</a>, a meditation on her marriage to the diplomat Richard Holbrooke and her grief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/14/richard-holbrooke-obituary\">after his sudden death</a> in 2010. Then she turned homewards once more.</p> <p>\u201cMy life has been a rather turbulent one,\u201d she says, after <a href=\"http://www.womanaroundtown.com/sections/woman-around-town/woman-around-town-kati-marton-her-own-person\">40 years or more</a> as an award-winning journalist and writer, \u201cbut the fixed point has always been Budapest and what happened in those years, because they were shrouded in mystery. My parents did not fancy talking about either the communist period or even less the one that preceded it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I finished my last book I was looking for a way to get out of my own saga. And I picked up [the historian] Arthur Schlesinger\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/reviews/001126.26franket.html\">A Life in the 20th Century</a>, and up popped this name, Noel Field, as someone who had worked with Schlesinger and the OSS and whom Schlesinger had never trusted.\u201d</p> <p>Marton began work, quickly finding that \u201csurviving family members were very receptive to my research because they themselves didn\u2019t know very much\u201d. The Field family made available correspondence which \u201cforms very much the spine of this book\u201d.</p> <p>Marton discovered a truly extraordinary character, a man whose motives might genuinely be described as good who ended up working against his own country, in the service of a nightmare regime. Field suffered brutally for such loyalty. But he was directly implicated in the death of at least one person and his name was used to condemn many others. Throughout the book, the horrors of the Gulag loom large.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a human drama in a political context,\u201d Marton says, \u201cbut to me what\u2019s interesting is what motivates such a person \u2013 well-born, superbly educated with every privilege, poised on a dream career \u2013 to espouse one of the most violent, destructive ideologies?\u201d</p> <p>She cannot have imagined that her attempt to answer this question would be published at such a propitious time. For one thing, the book has come out in the midst of a presidential election in which one candidate\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">apparent ties to Russia and a brutal Russian leader</a> have been constantly, hotly and sensationally debated. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">Donald Trump and Russia: a web that grows more tangled all the time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the name \u201cDonald Trump\u201d comes up in conversation, Marton \u2013 a friend of the Clintons \u2013 grimaces and elides, though she alights on an issue nonetheless distinctly linked to the rise of the Republican presidential nominee.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very involved with refugee issues,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an overseer of the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> and I\u2019m a refugee myself, having benefited from American largesse. And [in the 1930s] as now the country was showing its worst side, its least generous side to refugees, in that case fleeing Nazism. And this played a big role in Field\u2019s radicalisation.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the connection to today\u2019s world is very interesting to me, regarding the power of an idea to blind a man and how fanaticism works. And when I finished writing this, I thought: \u2018Holy cow, how am I ever going to get the public\u2019s attention when the public is obsessed with Trump and the \u2018war against terror\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to write an essay and put it right at the front of the book, called The Capture of Minds, whereby I connect the capture of young, alienated, lost idealists today by a really destructive, toxic but addictive ideology, that is Islamic fundamentalism, with its 1930s equivalent, which was global communism and Stalinism, for another disenchanted generation which had basically given up on their own countries\u2019 ability to set things to rights.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica then was a nation that was deeply divided, and its youth had given up on politics as usual. So they were very susceptible to a messiah promising to right every wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Witches in the government</h2> <p>Inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/true-believer-kati-marton.html?_r=0\">reviewers</a> of Marton\u2019s book have cited the novels of John Le Carr\u00e9, presenting Field as a spy who did not come in from the cold. The sheer naivety of her subject, however, sometimes brings the book closer, in a bizarre way, to the comedies of PG Wodehouse. In one extraordinary scene, Field, intoxicated on his faith, bounds up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to sing the Internationale in Russian, horrified NKVD handlers milling embarrassedly about below. Imagine a great lost masterpiece \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/07/pg-wodehouse-creative-writing-leave-it-to-psmith-reading-group\">Psmith</a>: Stalinist Spy. </p> <p>But if there is comedy in Marton\u2019s larger story, it is pitch black. Somehow, while Field was spying for Stalin in 1930s Washington, he went undetected. Some suspected him in Europe but the story of how he went east \u2013 was arrested, jailed, tortured and finally released into carefully controlled retirement \u2013 is shot through with instances of remarkable human frailty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c3835e099ecce059b5cf44806678d7edf3d66a/82_0_4831_2900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alger Hiss\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two police photographs, circa 1949, of former US state department official and accused communist spy Alger Hiss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orwell also looms over Marton\u2019s tale, in Spain and in the cells and torture chambers of eastern Europe.

It\u2019s affectionate and nostalgic, all tea and crumpets, net curtains and scrubbed doorsteps. But the sweetly soft-focus approach, which involves Ernest reading headlines detailing various global news events and Ethel fretting about her soft covers and social standing, is ultimately a little unsatisfying. The animation style is appealing and unthreatening, but the film lacks the beguiling magic of <em>The Snowman</em> or the thematic potency of <em>When the Wind Blows</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXDlEw5u8u8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JXDlEw5u8u8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXDlEw5u8u8\">Watch a trailer for Ethel &amp; Ernest.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Some have mooted it might be habitable. What do you think?</strong><br>I\u2019d say we need to know a little bit more about nearby planets, like Mars, and some nearby moons within our solar system, like Europa around Jupiter or [Saturn\u2019s] Enceladus. These have tantalising properties that could support life as we know it, but in its extremes \u2013 extreme cold, extreme dehydration or extreme radiation. And if we find life in our solar system, that bodes very well for life being ubiquitous. Then practically any planet we find that has been around long enough, we\u2019d go there expecting to find life rather than simply wondering if it is there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama says we will put a man on Mars under a president yet to be determined with a budget not yet established</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>President Obama has reiterated the goal of </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/11/obama-mars-mission-nasa-habitats-space-travel-2030\" title=\"\"><strong>sending humans to Mars</strong></a><strong> by the 2030s and to bring them back. That seems ambitious, to say the least\u2026</strong><br>I am critical of it in a different way. Obama is saying we will put a man on Mars in 2030, under the leadership of a president yet to be determined, on a budget line not yet established. I like that somebody is dreaming that way, but I don\u2019t know the cost to him of making that promise. So I have my scepticism that it would actually come to pass.</p> <p><strong>Should we go back to the moon first?</strong><br>I think we should remind ourselves how to go to the moon, but I think Mars is vastly more interesting, biologically, because it has evidence of liquid, running water \u2013 it\u2019s had water for billions of years. I\u2019ve always wanted to keep Mars in our sights, even if we do choose to go back to the moon.</p> <p><strong>Would you go to Mars?</strong><br>I would, but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their mother first! I am not an early adopter of stuff that has never been done before, but I am glad we have bold people who live and walk among us who do take those risks. We would never have left the cave were it not for folks such as that.</p> <p><strong>Who is going to get to Mars first: Musk? Bezos? Nasa? Boeing? China?</strong><br>By my read of history, the only thing that will get to Mars first is a government-driven space programme, such as Nasa. And why? Because it has never been done before, not with people \u2013 it is expensive and it has unquantified risks. When all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish. I think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to Mars, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-space-exploration-the-final-frontier\" title=\"\">SpaceX </a>and other companies want to build the spaceship and Nasa pays them for it. Their business model is selling to the government.</p> <p><strong>There is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the universe; there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial intelligence or microbes. What\u2019s your bet?</strong><br>I like it all. If Earth is any kind of example at all, then most life you\u2019ll find would be microbial. But consider also that if you can make a robot that knows how to make a robot from natural resources and you sent this robot off to a planet and it lands and makes three more of itself and they want to go to three other planets, you could populate the entire galaxy in a relatively short amount of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b42a601cc15fa0897255f5b828f28e972a43b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b42a601cc15fa0897255f5b828f28e972a43b2c/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SpaceX chief Elon Musk unveils his plans to colonise Mars during the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SpaceX chief Elon Musk unveils his plans to colonise Mars during the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elon Musk and </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/19/stephen-hawking-ai-best-or-worst-thing-for-humanity-cambridge\" title=\"\"><strong>Stephen Hawking</strong></a><strong> have voiced concerns about AI. How about you?</strong><br>I am completely relaxed. I would claim that AI will rise up, solving bits of challenges that we have put in our way and those bits in total would be a sort of stunning application of computers in the service of human need. Is a self-driving car going to stand up, wield a weapon and shoot you? No!</p> <p><strong>Given how we have managed to damage the Earth, should we be looking for other places to live?</strong><br>If you want to ship a billion people to Mars and have them live there as they are living on Earth, you\u2019ll have to terraform Mars \u2013 and that means turning Mars into an oasis of some kind. If you had the power of geoengineering to terraform Mars into Earth, then you have the power of geoengineering to turn Earth back into Earth. So the argument that if we trash Earth we need another planet doesn\u2019t work. I am not convinced that escaping Earth and leaving others behind to die is the most sensible solution out there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn't, is to vote them out of office</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>With the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/24/new-era-of-climate-change-reality-as-emissions-hit-symbolic-threshold\" title=\"\"><strong>Paris agreement</strong></a><strong>, have climate change sceptics finally been overcome?

It was something like: \u201cPersonal truths are established by faith, objective truths are established by evidence and political truths are established by incessant repetition.\u201d So you can make anything true that you want, as long as you repeat it all the time. So Trump keeps calling her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/donald-trump-crooked-hillary-clinton-nickname-ignore-fight\" title=\"\">\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d</a>. That\u2019s just part of her new name now \u2013 the first bit is Crooked, her second name is Hillary. You repeat this often enough and then you go interview Trump supporters and they say: \u201cWell, she\u2019s crooked.\u201d A new political truth has arisen simply by repetition. With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn\u2019t, is to vote them out of office.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of the candidates?</strong><br>Again I have a slightly different view. You\u2019ll never see me complaining about someone who is running for office. Never. The issue is not who is running, or even what their thoughts are. The issue is that your fellow citizens are thinking one way versus another in the elections. So if you don\u2019t like Trump, your gripe is not with Trump \u2013 he\u2019s just a person. Your gripe is with the 40% of the electorate that wants to vote for him. That\u2019s who you should be talking to. If people think they are voting in their own interests \u2013 but are not \u2013 then they need to be trained how to think about claims made by politicians.</p> <p><strong>You </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/27/bob-stephen-neil-degrasse-tyson-flat-to-fact-flatline-rap-beef\" title=\"\"><strong>roasted rapper BoB</strong></a><strong> over his claims about a flat Earth on Twitter...</strong><br>There are too many people out there to waste that kind of energy on, so why was he different? Because he has millions of Twitter followers and he invoked physics to show the Earth was flat. Well, those are fighting words, so then I looked at the tweets where he said he\u2019d got physics and then I posted my tweets saying you need some more physics. And then I showed people how to calculate it all and where he went wrong. But I would rather train people to think straight in the first place than fix them later, when it is sometimes too late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/23/helen-czerski-physics-everyday-lives-quantum-weirdness-storm-in-a-teacup-interview\">Helen Czerski: \u2018Physics isn\u2019t all quantum weirdness.

Marked \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d, it states that \u201cunlimited exposure to risks relating to the costs of disposing of their waste in a GDF [geological disposal facility], could not be accepted by the operator as they would prevent the operator from securing the finance necessary to undertake the project\u201d.</p> <p>Instead the document explains that there will be a \u201ccap on the liability of the operator of the nuclear power station which would apply in a worst-case scenario\u201d. It adds: \u201cThe UK government accepts that, in setting a cap, the residual risk, of the very worst-case scenarios where actual cost might exceed the cap, is being borne by the government.\u201d</p> <p>Separate documents confirm that the cap also applies should the cost of decommissioning the reactor at the end of its life balloon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/hinkley-point-c-developers-face-72bn-cleanup-bill-at-end-of-nuclear-plants-life\">Hinkley Point C developers face \u00a37.2bn cleanup bill at end of nuclear plant's life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The level of the cap is unclear. But Dr David Lowry, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who made the FoI request, said it was clear that the risk of footing the bill for a significant cost overrun had been transferred from Hinkley\u2019s operator to the taxpayer.</p> <p>\u201cThis shows that the government cares more about the economic future of a foreign power generator than British taxpayers,\u201d Lowry said.</p> <p>In return for the cap, the document reveals that Hinkley\u2019s operator will pay the government a risk fee which \u201cis expected to be relatively low, reflecting the high level of confidence that the cap will not be breached\u201d.</p> <p>But Lowry pointed out that the nuclear industry had form when it came to sizable cost over-runs. He warned that an accident that could force the closure of the reactor, either because of problems with it or at another plant, as happened in Japan, would leave the taxpayer having to pay billions of pounds for the clear-up years after it ceased generating revenues.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cAll operators of new nuclear power stations in the UK are legally obliged to meet the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management and disposal costs. They will also pay the UK government to dispose of the waste produced at the end of a plant\u2019s life.\u201d</p>",

For one thing, the political situation is full of uncertainties. Businesses rightly ask whether Theresa May wants to stay inside the European Union\u2019s single market or the customs union or neither.</p> <p>There was a clue in the deal with Nissan, which was widely interpreted as signalling that she wants to stay in the customs union. But it could be that she panicked when faced with the closure of a world-beating car factory and carved out a special package offsetting the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>May has refused to shed any light on the details of her apparently cosy deal with the Japanese carmaker, and so speculation fills the void, emphasising the lack of coherent thinking at the top of her government. Worse, May and some former colleagues have painted Threadneedle Street as the enemy of good government, adding to the unease.</p> <p>Investors are also concerned about the impact of rising yields on government bonds, which determine the rate at which nations can borrow. UK gilt yields have doubled since the vote, forcing the Treasury to pay more to finance its debts.</p> <p>And there are more threats waiting in the wings.

If this feeds into higher import prices and ratchets up inflation, disposable incomes will slump even more.</p> <p>As we saw from the UK\u2019s third-quarter GDP figures last week, the economy is currently buoyant, but almost entirely dependent on consumer spending and without it will probably begin to slowly contract.</p> <p>If this all sounds overly gloomy, it doesn\u2019t to Posen and many other economists in academia and the City.

The aim was to create new competitors on the high street and, no doubt, inflict a bit of pain on the way.</p> <p>Roll on eight years from the drama of the bailouts, and one of those branch networks has emerged. Lloyds Banking Group stripped out TSB in 2013 and floated it on the stock market in 2014, before it was taken over by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/20/lloyds-sells-50-of-tsb-to-spains-sabadell\" title=\"\">Sabadell of Spain</a>. It is alive and kicking and grabbing market share in current accounts. It is still tied to its former parent by an IT system, but is trying to cut itself loose.</p> <p>Contrast that with Royal Bank of Scotland, which has now admitted it will not meet a deadline of the end of 2017 to carve out 300 branches, focused more on small businesses. It has been a messy affair and costs have reached \u00a31.7bn in attempting and failing to meet this deadline. A sale to Santander was aborted. Then there was to be an attempt to float the branches on the stock market \u2013 a bit like TSB \u2013 by reviving the old brand name of Williams &amp; Glyn. That was abandoned in the summer. Now hopes are on a trade buyer who might be able to cherrypick the most attractive branches.</p> <p>While this is a costly problem for RBS, which at one point deployed 7,500 on the task of creating a standalone branch network, it is one that has also deprived bank customers of an extra competitor on the high street. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, has admitted that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU is not a cue to give up on the process \u2013 and Brussels may not be in the mood to look kindly on Britain\u2019s bailed-out bank during the exit negotiations. It is a mess, and one which could get dirtier if the EU decides to impose its own rules on the selloff process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0b0ceaa4b4a2779e58f06030ee02eb8850f279b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0b0ceaa4b4a2779e58f06030ee02eb8850f279b/385_484_1781_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Nickolds will have her work cut out at John Lewis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Nickolds will have her work cut out at John Lewis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Funnell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>John Lewis mustn\u2019t become a soulless profit machine</h2> <p>She\u2019s landed one of the most coveted jobs in retail, but when new John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds takes the helm in January she\u2019ll have her hands full.

  "<p>Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has raised concerns about the unclear direction of US foreign policy if Donald Trump becomes president.</p> <p>She said the federal government had considered what a Clinton administration would mean for Australia and it knew what to expect.</p> <p>But if Donald Trump won the US presidency she indicated the government would have to work hard to ensure Australia\u2019s interests were still looked after.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">FBI director Comey faces fury for cryptic letter about Clinton email inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With less than two weeks to go before the US federal election, Bishop said Trump was a \u201cmuch lesser-known quantity\u201d than Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cI believe there will be continuity in foreign policy from the Obama administration, should it be a Clinton administration.

He sees the US as having got a raw deal from globalisation and he would focus more on domestic matters.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen Hillary Clinton, particularly as secretary of state, have a view that the US should take a leadership role in the Middle East, in hot spots around the world. She was the principal architect of the rebalance to the Asia Pacific in 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThe US became a member of the East Asia Summit with Australia, China and others. US engagement in our region is important for us. I believe that will continue under Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be up to our region, including Australia, to persuade a Trump administration to focus on the Asia Pacific,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bishop said she had met Clinton many times, and Clinton appeared to be pragmatic.

It is oddly reassuring to discover that there is still a place in the US not transfixed by Clinton\u2019s reckless emails or Trump\u2019s 3am tweets. Here sports comes first, politics nowhere. A baseball cap is still a baseball cap, not a marketing prop for making America great again.</p> <p>Thom Majka, a sales rep who keeps his Indians cap on through every game for good luck, said: \u201cThese fans couldn\u2019t care less about the election. Every day it gets nastier and uglier, not even talking about the issues. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to have something as easy as playing a baseball game. It\u2019s like taking a shower: you\u2019re all cleaned up.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic and Republican nominees have historically high unpopularity ratings. Their contest has been extraordinary rancorous, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">including a tense debate</a>in which Clinton castigated Trump over allegations of sexual assault and Trump threatened to jail his opponent. The blowhard billionaire\u2019s appeal to authoritarianism and cries of rigging have led some to fear an existential threat to the republic.</p> <p>But baseball, as American as jazz, as regular as the seasons, goes on. It is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">storied and soulful of US sports</a>.
