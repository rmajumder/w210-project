  "<p>Hillary Clinton used the global climate crisis as a weapon for another assault on Donald Trump on Tuesday, enlisting the help of her husband\u2019s former vice-president Al Gore to urge America\u2019s voters not to risk sending a \u201cclimate change denier\u201d to the White House.</p> <p>In a joint address in Miami, Clinton and Gore repeatedly hammered the Republican nominee for his stance on climate change and his belief that global warming is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">hoax initiated by the Chinese</a>.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is real, it\u2019s urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it,\u201d Clinton said, promising investment in clean energy.</p> <p>\u201cWe can transform our economy, we can rally the world to cut carbon pollutions and above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect the planet. Just remember what is at stake. My opponent is a guy who denies science, who denies climate change every day.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it was Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George W Bush by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/\">less than 500 votes</a> in Florida, who delivered the more powerful message about why the climate crisis is one of the most serious issues in this campaign, and why he believes Clinton is the only candidate who can help solve it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"597bdc1dc9bd1998dc47a43e38a4e515457ddaf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/597bdc1dc9bd1998dc47a43e38a4e515457ddaf2/0_120_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Al Gore campaigning in 1999.

Instead, she stuck steadfastly to themes of climate change and her policy proposals to \u201caccelerate the transition\u201d towards clean energy in the US.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see 500 million more solar panels installed in America by the end of my first term,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s generate enough clean energy to power America.\u201d</p> <p>Building more energy-efficient buildings and cutting the country\u2019s reliance on oil by one-third would also bring massive economic benefits, the Democratic candidate said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do all of this and create millions of good paying jobs as we do. The clean energy solutions are being created right here in America. And while we do that, make sure communities are ready for the effects of climate change that are coming right at us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That comment referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/hurricane-matthew-death-toll-shooting-north-carolina-florida-georgia\">the recent impact of Hurricane Matthew</a> on the Caribbean, where the storm killed hundreds, and in the US, which has seen more than 30 deaths, most of them in North Carolina, which is still suffering from significant flooding.</p> <p>Gore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/12/climatechange.internationalnews\">who won the 2007 Nobel peace prize</a> for his efforts to tackle manmade climate change, highlighted in his movie An Inconvenient Truth, blamed the severity of recent hurricanes on global warming.</p> <p>\u201cMatthew went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane in just 36 hours, and that\u2019s unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Nowhere are the effects of global warming more evident than Florida, Gore said. </p> <p>Just yesterday there were six more cases of Zika in Miami-Dade County. Changing climate conditions shift the places where these diseases become endemic. Mosquitoes incubate faster and bite more often.</p> <p>\u201cThese and many other consequences are really wake-up calls for us.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, too, referenced the threat to Florida, a key swing state. \u201cThe impact of climate change goes beyond severe events like hurricanes, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article70145652.html\">it\u2019s a daily reality in Miami</a>. In streets in Miami the ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. If you need proof climate change is real, there you go,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She warned: \u201cAt the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century.\u201d</p> <p>Global warming, she said, had also been cited by the Pentagon as a threat to national security, posing as an example flooding at the US navy base in Norfolk, Virginia, affecting the operations and readiness of the service.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford a candidate who doesn\u2019t accept climate change,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our security.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a president who believes in science and can lead America in fighting this threat, creating jobs and, yes, saving our planet.\u201d</p> <p>The final word, however, belonged to Gore, who Clinton said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait\u201d to have as a White House adviser on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans have the ability to bring about such a big and important change, the will to change and build a brighter future is itself a renewable resource,\u201d he said, drawing a loud: \u201cThat\u2019s a great line, I love that!\u201d from Clinton beside him.</p>",
  "<p>Overnight, the International New York Times has become The New York Times International Edition.

  "<p>Germany is taking steps to curb its booming windfarm sector in what it claims is a necessary move to stop the renewables revolution from undermining its own success.</p> <p>Critics, however, say the step will deal a blow to the country\u2019s reputation as a leader in green energy.</p> <p>According to leaked plans from the German federal network agency, published on Tuesday in the <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/erneuerbare-regierung-will-windkraft-ausbau-im-norden-bremsen-1.3198259\">S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</a>, the government has had to halve its original target for expanding its windfarms in the gale-beaten northern flatlands because it cannot extend its power grid quickly enough to the energy-hungry south.</p> <p>When Angela Merkel announced in May 2011 that Germany would seek to phase out its fleet of nuclear reactors by 2022, questions arose as to whether renewable sources of energy, such as wind or solar, could grow quickly enough to meet the requirements of German industry.</p> <p>Yet five years later, windfarms in the northernmost states are producing so much energy that in some cases the state has to pay renewable energy companies to switch off their turbines to stop congesting the power grid.</p> <p>In theory, the manufacturing sector in southern states like Bavaria or Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg would be supplied with green energy from the north. But plans for an ambitious north-south \u201cenergy highway\u201d between Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria have stalled, due in part to local protests against proposed \u201cmonster pylons\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/north-south-divide-threatens-germany-renewable-energy\">North-south divide threatens Germany's renewable energy highway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Revised plans for more costly underground cabling were <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-energy-power-idUSL8N12722320151007\">signed off last October</a>, but the project now runs approximately a year and a half behind its original schedule, leaving Germany\u2019s energy infrastructure lop-sided.</p> <p>In 2015, northern Germany produced 4,100 gigawatt hours in excess energy which couldn\u2019t been transported to the south \u2013 enough, in theory, to supply 1.2 million households with energy for a year.</p> <p>Protecting the national power grid from such imbalances is costly: in 2015, Germany paid \u20ac1bn, or \u00a3912m, towards system security measures, a cost which the federal network agency claims could rise to \u20ac4bn by 2022 if current trends continue.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s plans to phase out nuclear energy is creating diplomatic headaches, too. Cheap excess energy produced by German windfarms and coal power stations is often exported to neighbouring states such as Poland, the Czech Republic or Austria, where it plays havoc with local networks and impedes those countries from building up their own sustainable systems.</p> <p>\u201cGermany\u2019s renewables revolution is making it harder to have a renewables revolution in Austria and other European countries,\u201d Austria\u2019s environment minister, Andr\u00e4 Rupprechter, told <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/energiewende-als-deutscher-exportschlager-nicht-mit-oesterreich-a-1115985.html\">Der Spiegel</a>. \u201cGermany produces too much cheap energy, which countries like Austria then have to absorb. With the current prices for energy, investing in hydro or wind energy without state support is no longer competitive.\u201d</p> <p>Some analysts argue that while Germany is right to address grid congestion, doing so by artificially slowing down the wind energy boom risks undermining the country\u2019s credibility as a green leader. Since the start of the <em>Energiewende, </em>or energy transformation project, domestic demand for renewable energy has grown by about 3% per annum. Under revised proposals worked out by the government, the sector\u2019s growth is expected slow to about 1%.</p> <p>\u201cA more forward-looking way to meet the current challenge would have been to shut down old power stations, extend the grid faster or invest more in innovative methods to use excess energy to heat homes,\u201d said Arne Jungjohann, the author of Energy Democracy \u2013 Germany\u2019s <em>Energiewende</em> to Renewables.</p> <p>\u201cOn the international stage, Merkel enjoys a reputation as a green pioneer. But on the domestic stage she has been quick to give in to the lobbying of energy-greedy industry\u201d.</p> <p>While the German government admits that transforming its energy infrastructure is a more complex undertaking than originally thought, officials insist that it remains on track to meet ambitious goals, including a 50% share for renewables in gross electricity consumption by 2030.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2016 to correct a reference from gigawatts to gigawatt hours.</p>",

I think that\u2019s changing the way people will vote.\u201d</p> <p>The constituency chalked up a strong remain vote in the EU referendum, and the business classes, professionals and academics who live in the town are broadly liberal. </p> <p>With a display of fervour rarely seen in these quiet Cotswold streets, one of the party\u2019s newest activists, Jake Acock, took what he said was his Green party membership card and ceremoniously tore it up in front of the Green party stall and local TV cameras, before being tackled by disgruntled Greens. </p> <p>The Greens\u2019 candidate, Larry Sanders, has been drawing his fair share of attention too, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/bernie-sanders-larry-sanders-brother-to-fight-david-camerons-old-seat-for-greens\">being the brother of US Democrat Bernie Sanders</a>, though he does admit he had more recognition from locals in Oxford, where he lives, than in the shires. He too is optimistic about cutting into the Conservative lead. \u201cAt the hustings last night was the first time I heard in British politics \u2013 and in Witney too \u2013 the Conservative candidate booed, when he was talking about the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is cutting through.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservatives\u2019 lead looks unassailable: Cameron took home a 25,000 majority in 2015. Change does not come quickly in Witney however, even if some voters have concerns about the direction of the new regime. \u201cWe need to stay stable and keep change to a minimum until Brexit is all sorted out,\u201d said former hotelier Ian Watkins as he passed the Greens\u2019 stand on the high street. \u201cI think May is doing a good job at the moment, I can\u2019t see anyone doing anything any better to be honest.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cPeople felt very comfortable with Cameron, and as someone who is more liberal than Conservative, I couldn\u2019t complain,\u201d said Jackie Moss, who works at a local pre-school. \u201cI will miss him. I think it\u2019s pretty much a cert but I am hoping that the Liberals do better now.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Spindlow, a local painter and decorator, is one of the few to criticise the town\u2019s former MP. \u201cI\u2019m a Farage man,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of toffs round here, I reckon they\u2019ll get in again because of that.\u201d</p> <p>Though even Clegg will admit victory is \u201ca mountain to climb\u201d, a close second, up from fourth in 2015, would help the Lib Dems test their messaging to Tory voters in preparation for seats they might be more able to win, particularly in the south-west, though the polls for the party nationally remain at a stubborn and desultory 8%.</p> <p> \u201cI think a lot of people here, who are traditional mainstream Conservative voters, don\u2019t want a hard Brexit,\u201d Clegg said. \u201cAnd so the byelection does assume a bigger importance: it\u2019s one of the ways in the strange political environment we are in now, that the public can now say that the government is embarking on a direction of travel with which we don\u2019t agree. Coming a good second, given where we were last May, would do that.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Ireland\u2019s finance minister has acknowledged a torrid year for the country\u2019s much-criticised corporate tax regime with a robust defence of Apple\u2019s taxation deals with the Irish state. <br></p> <p>Michael Noonan said while delivering the budget on Tuesday that Ireland\u2019s 12.5% rate for companies \u201cwill not be changed\u201d. His comments will have been welcomed in Ireland\u2019s second city, Cork. It is home to Apple\u2019s main plant in Europe and, in a visit to the city last week, its citizens were equally supportive of the state\u2019s dealings with the tech giant in a relationship that goes back over 40 years. </p> <p>Set on the northern outskirts of Cork, beside the working class housing estate of Holyhill, Apple\u2019s European headquarters is heavily guarded with employees under strict instructions not to talk to any media at its main entrance. However, public backing for the 12.5% rate is not difficult to find outside the Apple site. </p> <p>Tony Fitzgerald, who has lived on the Holyhill estate for 40 years, said that the majority of people in the city look favourably on the hi-tech giant\u2019s presence. Global criticism of Apple grew in August after the European commission ruled that the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">owed Ireland \u20ac13bn (\u00a311.85bn) in back taxes</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdcf5b2b38314304a68dc3a9000e824fb1382e69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdcf5b2b38314304a68dc3a9000e824fb1382e69/0_287_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, said in his budget speech that the country\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate would not change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fitzgerald, a Cork city councillor for Ireland\u2019s main opposition party, Fianna Fail, recently travelled to Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California. He was part of a cross-party delegation from Cork council that attended an international IT conference as the guest of Apple.</p> <p>While there Fitzgerald and other councillors pressed Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, if the company was still committed to Cork four decades after its founder, Steve Jobs, came to open the plant. </p> <p>\u201cTim Cook was adamant about Apple\u2019s ongoing commitment to Cork, which of course was what we wanted to hear. What struck me most about being shown around Apple\u2019s HQ was the amount of people from Cork working there. It demonstrated to me the strong bonds between our city and Apple that have been built over 40 years.\u201d</p> <p>Fitzgerald said there were \u201cmassive spin-off benefits\u201d for Holyhill and neighbouring areas from Apple\u2019s presence.</p> <p>\u201cApple has helped the development of the north side of Cork, including infrastructure. The presence of so many workers has resulted in the building of new road links and even a regular new bus service that runs every 10 minutes. </p> <p>\u201cAs well as funding apprentice and training programmes, the company has put computers into local schools and colleges. </p> <p>\u201cRegardless of what has been said in the European Union and [of] its ruling, the people of this area want Apple to stay here,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Among those who travelled to Apple\u2019s base in the United States was Conor Healy, the head of Cork\u2019s chamber of commerce. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58f028cfca3d19b9aa0a6739dca2f26494242bb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58f028cfca3d19b9aa0a6739dca2f26494242bb2/0_15_2465_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, on a visit to Cork in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, on a visit to Cork in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTim Cook never talked to us once about the EU ruling.

The 12.5% rate is a fiscal policy. No Irish government should change that. </p> <p>\u201cThe Apple workforce will soon be at 6,000 and since 2009 they have invested \u20ac100m in the plant at Holyhill. Their presence, like other multinationals, has created a business ecosystem in Cork that is leading to the creation of more startups in the city. </p> <p>\u201cThe message here in Cork is that no one wants that to change.

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook.

In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU.

First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad.

The middle rung of the ladder has been painted a different colour on the side, so that we can see it when we look at the ladder from the side on. What shape does that middle rung trace out as the ladder falls to the floor?\u201d<br></p> <p>Cotton-Barratt\u2019s answer (yes, <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-10-11-why-do-older-siblings-do-better-iq-tests-their-younger-counterparts-oxford-interview\">sample answers are included</a>) mentions Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem, a hypothesis, some equations, a right-angled triangle and sketching on whiteboards, though not necessarily in that order.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fun question,\u201d says Cotton-Barratt, \u201cbecause the answer is typically the opposite of what they expect because they think about the shape the ladder makes when it falls (which is a series of tangents to a curve centred away from the wall and the floor). A nice extension is what happens when we look at a point 1/3 or 2/3 up the ladder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis question is a great one,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcus-du-sautoy\">Marcus du Sautoy</a>, Simonyi professor for the public understanding of science and professor of mathematics at Oxford. \u201cYou want to see the mathematical mind at work, taking the question and finding what\u2019s essential about the problem and working it into an equation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine to get stuck,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all get stuck. What we want to see is how you respond to a prompt. We are trying to make it a level playing field whatever their background. We are trying to see the way that they think rather than what they know.\u201d</p> <p>Du Sautoy remembers vividly his own interview for a place to study at Wadham College. \u201cI came from a comprehensive, so it was quite nerve-racking coming up to Oxford. I walked into this grand set of rooms and the tutor asked me, \u2018Can you change my light bulb?\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cAll I could think was, is this the beginning of a mathematical joke? \u2018How many mathematicians does it take to change a light bulb?\u2019 But his light bulb had blown and he wanted me to change it.\u201d Du Sautoy, who got the top mark in the entrance exam that year, was duly given a place.</p> <p>The sample questions \u2013 there are just five of them but they are genuine and have been posed by admissions tutors and answered with varying skill by prospective candidates in previous interview rounds \u2013 have been released just days before the 15 October deadline for applications for next year. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/12/oxford-university-admissions-interview-questions-and-answers-revealed\">similar sample releases</a> in previous years.<br></p> <p>Every year approximately 10,000 applicants will be invited for interview in December; 3,500 of them will be offered places in mid-January, then they just have to get the required A-level grades (usually a combination of As and A*s) to secure their place.</p> <p>Oxford is keen to remove some of the fear of the unknown which surrounds the interview, particularly for pupils from state schools that do not routinely send students to Oxford, where candidates are not as well drilled in Oxbridge interview techniques as their peers in the independent sector. Approximately six out of 10 who took up places this year were educated in the state sector.</p> <p> Samina Khan, director of admissions and outreach at Oxford, said: \u201cInterviews will be an entirely new experience for most students and we know many prospective applicants are already worried about being in an unfamiliar place and being questioned by people they have not met \u2013 so to help students to become familiar with the type of questions they might get asked we release these real examples.\u201d</p> <p>One earlier candidate for St Anne\u2019s was former Conservative minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/edwina-currie\">Edwina Currie </a>who remembers being asked \u201cDo you believe in anything absolute,\u201d when she applied to study chemistry in 1964 (she subsequently switched to PPE). \u201cI answered promptly, \u2018No \u2013 except absolute zero, of course\u2019. \u201d </p> <p>Then \u2013 a slightly less challenging question \u2013 she was asked what she had done during half-term. \u201cThe other applicants had gone skiing, or stayed home swotting. My answer, in a Liverpool accent: \u2018I organised a demo ...\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cLiverpool city council was trying to close our grammar school and its venerable boys\u2019 counterpart (Liverpool Institute) and merge them with Paddington Sec Mod to form a comprehensive.

In terms of modern literature, you\u2019d be thinking about Animal Farm, The Grapes of Wrath, Catch-22, The Plot Against America. But it\u2019s no coincidence that viewing the question this way produces a very masculine and largely white list. The more complex answer would recognise that any serious difference between human beings in a society raises broadly political questions. </p> <p><em>Sarah Churchwell, professor of American literature, University of London</em></p> <h2>Medicine: about one in four deaths in the UK is due to some form of cancer, yet in the Philippines the figure is only around one in 10. What factors might underlie this difference?</h2> <p>There are several possible explanations. First, people could be dying of something else before they can get cancer \u2013 getting shot by a death squad, for example. Casual death certification means that causes of death are not reliably recorded and there may also be a cultural reluctance to acknowledge cancer on death certificates. Better genes and better environment could also play a role. In particular more exercise, lower obesity rates, better diet, less alcohol and less smoking all cut cancer risk. And more praying might help too.</p> <p><em>David Spiegelhalter, professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge</em></p> <h2>PPE (and other philosophy courses): what exactly do you think is involved in blaming someone?</h2> <p>When bad things happen, we rush to figure out who is to blame. Blamed people are often punished, which makes blame potentially very consequential for people\u2019s lives. Blaming someone involves answering other questions like \u201cwho made it happen?\u201d and \u201cwho was responsible?\u201d These questions relate to something not usually considered morally relevant: processing of cause and effect. More and more, cognitive scientists have found that mental processes typically considered not morally relevant, such as processing of causation, are skewed by people\u2019s social and moral motivations. </p> <p><em>Laura Niemi, postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychology at Harvard University</em></p> <h2>Maths: imagine a ladder leaning against a vertical wall with its feet on the ground.

If the ladder leans vertically against the wall and starts falling down \u2013 with its feet on the ground in the corner \u2013 then its middle rung will trace a quarter of a circle with the centre in the corner and the radius of half the height. </p> <p>But that would be too easy to ask, so they probably meant to ask what happens as the ladder slides to the floor \u2013 with its feet sliding away from the wall, and its top sliding down on the wall. </p> <p>That is a more intricate question but it has the same answer. To see that, imagine two ladders connected flexibly to share the middle rung, as a big letter X. Then, while one of them will be falling with its feet in the corner, the other will be sliding, and the same quarter-circle will be traced by the middle rung.</p> <p><em>Stanislav Smirnov, maths professor at the University of Geneva, winner of the prestigious Fields medal in 2010</em> </p> <h2>Experimental psychology: a large study appears to show that older siblings consistently score more highly than younger siblings on IQ tests.

Galton thought that the additional resources that parents could expend on their first-born children might\u2019ve given them an intellectual boost. </p> <p>However, recent studies have cast doubt on that. A <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656615000525\">large study</a> of US teenagers from 2015 showed only a tiny birth order effect on IQ.

  "<p>Thousands more flights between the UK and China could operate each year after a deal was struck in London to more than double the permitted number. </p> <p>The government said the move would boost tourism and trade opportunities for the UK, and create vital links for a post-Brexit Britain. </p> <p>Up to 100 passenger flights a week each way will now be allowed, instead of 40, with no limit on cargo flights.

  "<p>This week, Waterkeeper Alliance passed an important milestone. We licensed our 300th Waterkeeper organization. I just came back from a week in Peru, where we have three Waterkeeper organizations fighting dam projects on three of the most important rivers in Latin America. A week before that, I was in the Himalayas and India, where we have seven Waterkeeper organizations protecting the major waterways that supply water to 40% of the planet.</p> <p>The first Waterkeeper organization was founded on the Hudson River in 1966 by a blue collar coalition of commercial and recreational fishermen who mobilized to reclaim the river from its polluters. Many of the people I represent come from families that have been fishing the river continuously since Dutch colonial times. These were people who had little expectation that they\u2019d ever see Yosemite or Yellowstone or the Everglades. They didn\u2019t have the resources to take those kinds of vacations. For them, like for most Americans, the environment was their backyard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies\">The troubling evolution of corporate greenwashing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the things I\u2019ve recognized in my 30 years of doing this work is that wherever you see large scale environmental injury, you\u2019ll also see the subversion of democracy. You\u2019ll see the corruption of public officials, and the capture of the agencies that are supposed to protect Americans from pollution \u2013 they become sock puppets for the industries they\u2019re supposed to regulate.</p> <p>You\u2019ll see the disappearance of transparency in government, the corruption of the press and the diminishment of local control. I\u2019ll give you an example: in the town where I live, Bedford, New York, somebody tried to build a quarry. We passed a zoning law to say, \u201cHey, you can\u2019t do that\u201d because it\u2019s going to diminish everyone else\u2019s property values. So yeah, you\u2019re going to make that one guy rich, but all the rest of us are going to pay for it.</p> <p>That law was upheld by the top appellate court in New York. In Kentucky and West Virginia, where I do a lot of my work, they don\u2019t have those laws. Those laws have been abolished constitutionally so that there is no way for localities to object to mountaintop removal mining, for example. In North Carolina, laws have been abolished that would allow localities to object to factory farms in their backyard. And the agencies in these states are really just mouthpieces for the industries which they\u2019re supposed to regulate.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Rick Dove, a 27-year veteran of the US marine corps [and one of the founding members of the Waterkeeper Alliance], owned a commercial fishing operation on the Neuse River. It was his dream job after he retired from the marines. Two years after he started that business, a billion fish died in the Neuse River with lesions on their bodies, and no one could explain why. Rick traced the pollution to the hog industry, which had happened below anybody\u2019s radar. Why? Because the hog factories were placed in poor communities that had no voice, and no access to public office.</p> <p>A [North Carolina] state senator named Wendell Murphy had looked at what happened to the chicken industry in this country. He\u2019d seen how three men \u2013 Tyson, Pilgrim and Perdue \u2013 had put a million independent chicken farmers out of business and changed the chicken industry from an agricultural one to an industrial one. They would shoehorn up to a million birds into a single facility and keep them in tiny battery cages where they could not turn around, and then dose them with drugs and hormones and manipulate them with light and cause them to literally lay their guts out over a short and miserable life.</p> <p>They made themselves billionaires. And Wendell Murphy said, \u201cI can do that with hogs\u201d. He passed laws that made it almost impossible for anyone to sue anyone who called themselves a hog farmer, even if it had nothing to do with farming. At that time, there were 28,000 independent hog farmers in the state, raising hogs sustainably, providing jobs. He <a href=\"http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/HOG-FARMERS-Ongoing-lawsuit-has-pushed-us-to-bankruptcy-319701941.html\">put every hog farmer in the state out of business</a>, except those who would sign a contract with him. That contract doomed those farmers to involuntary servitude. In 10 years, [the state] went from 28,000 hog farmers to 2,200 factories. And those factories were deliberately put in <a href=\"http://qz.com/433750/the-world-eats-cheap-bacon-at-the-expense-of-north-carolinas-rural-poor/\">areas of the state with minority populations</a> \u2013 blacks, Hispanics \u2013 where people wouldn\u2019t complain.</p> <p>Polluters always choose the soft targets of poverty. Four out of every five toxic waste dumps in this country are in a black neighborhood. The largest toxic waste dump in America is in Emelle, Alabama, where a third of the population is in poverty. The highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America is on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The most contaminated zipcode in California is East LA.</p> <p>Navajo youths have a thousand times the rate of sexual organ cancer as other Americans because the thousands of tons of uranium tailings that have been dumped on their reservation lands. In North Carolina, we now have an air force that flies over the state every day filming these industries because they can\u2019t be photographed from the road. We are not only bringing the hog industry under control, but also one of the worst toxic polluters in the country: coal ash from utilities. There are now 1,400 uncontrolled coal ash pits leeching poisons into local waterways at every coal-burning power plant in the country. And again, the [plants] are almost always located in impoverished neighborhoods.</p> <p>This is one of the corollaries of the idea that the best measure of how democracy functions is how it distributes goods. Every person in the state of North Carolina should be able to go down to the Neuse River and pull in a fish and bring it home to feed it to their family with the security that they\u2019re not poisoning somebody. We have that right: the constitution guarantees it. But those rights have been stolen from us.</p> <p>You\u2019ll hear this a lot from the big polluters, the Koch brothers, from their indentured servants in Washington DC and their toadies on Fox News: \u201cOh we have to choose between economic prosperity on the one hand and environmental protection on the other.\u201d That is a false choice. In 100% of situations, good environmental policy is identical to good economic policy.</p> <p>We should be measuring our economy on how it produces jobs and how it preserves the value of the assets of our community. If, on the other hand, we want to do what the Koch brothers and the big polluters want us to do, which is to treat our country as if it were a business in liquidation, convert our natural resources to cash as quickly as possible, have a few years of pollution-based prosperity ... then we can generate an instantaneous cash flow and the illusion of a prosperous economy and make a few people billionaires by impoverishing the rest of us.</p> <p>But our children are going to pay for our joy ride. And they\u2019re going to pay for it with poor health and huge cleanup costs that are going to amplify and metastasize over time. Environmental injury is deficit spending. It\u2019s a way of loading the costs of our generation\u2019s prosperity onto the backs of our children. One of the things that I\u2019ve done over the past three decades as an environmental advocate is to constantly go around and confront this argument that an investment in our environment is a diminishment of our nation\u2019s wealth. But it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s an investment in infrastructure. It\u2019s the same as investing in telecommunications or road construction. It\u2019s an investment we have to make if we\u2019re going to ensure the economic vitality of future generations.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been asked the question: What\u2019s the most important environmental law that you\u2019d pass? And I\u2019ve always said the same thing: I\u2019d have true free market capitalism.</p> <p>But now, I\u2019d say something different: I would get rid of Citizens United. Because for capitalism to work, you need democracy to work. And right now we don\u2019t have democracy. We have what I would call a corporate kleptocracy, an oligarchy by the corporations and the wealthy. You can\u2019t have a clean environment when you have that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources\">Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fishermen on the Hudson had a business plan that worked. It worked for three and a half centuries. They wanted their children to be able to do the same thing. It didn\u2019t stop working because of a failure of their business model. It stopped working due to a failure of capitalism. A failure of democracy. General Electric had better lobbyists in Albany and they were able to persuade the governor to waive the law that made it illegal for GE to dump their PCBs into the Hudson. And GE dumped their PCBs in and all the fisheries were closed, and men and women were put out of work. It wasn\u2019t their fault the fisheries collapsed \u2013 it was GE\u2019s subversion of democracy.</p> <p>As long as we have Citizens United, the polluters are going to be in charge of our country. And that\u2019s going to happen every time we try and do something good for our children, or something sustainable. Our assets are going to be liquidated and turned into profit by the big shots who own our government.</p> <p>So we need to get right of Citizens United or nothing else works. The reason I believe that true free market capitalism is the best thing for the environment is because a rational marketplace promotes efficiency, which means the elimination of waste. And pollution is waste. In true free market capitalism, you can\u2019t make yourself rich without making your neighbors rich and without enriching your community.</p> <p>What polluters do is make themselves rich by making everyone else poor. They raise standards of living for themselves by lowering quality of life for everyone else. And they do that by escaping the discipline of the free market. You show me a polluter, and I will show you a subsidy. I will show you a fat cat using political clout to escape the discipline of the free market and force the public to pay for his production costs. That\u2019s what all pollution is.</p> <p>At Waterkeeper Alliance, we don\u2019t consider ourselves environmentalists anymore. We think of ourselves as free marketeers. We catch the cheaters and polluters and we say to them: \u201cWe\u2019re going to force you to internalize your costs the same way you internalize your profits.\u201d Because as long as somebody is cheating the free market, none of us get the advantages of the efficiency, the prosperity and the democracy of free market capitalism.</p> <p>What we have to understand as Americans is that there\u2019s a huge difference between free market capitalism, which makes a nation more efficient, more prosperous and more democratic, and the kind of corporate crony capitalism which we\u2019ve now embraced in this country. This is as antithetical to prosperity, democracy and efficiency in America as it is in Nigeria.</p> <p><em>This is an edited transcript of a keynote speech given by </em><em>Robert F Kennedy Jr at the SXSW Eco conference on 10 October 2016, in Austin, Texas.</em></p> <p><em>Robert F Kennedy Jr is president of <a href=\"http://waterkeeper.org/\">Waterkeeper Alliance,</a> a global movement for swimmable, drinkable and fishable water. </em><em>He is also a US radio host, environmental activist and attorney specializing in environmental law.</em></p>",

Planning documents seen by technology site <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2016/amazons-secretive-drive-grocery-store-takes-shape-seattle-neighborhood/\">GeekWire </a>state: \u201cStorage racks insulation plans on main floor for Amazon.\u201d </p> <p>It has been reported that the physical stores will be for the exclusive use of customers signed up to Amazon Fresh food delivery service, which is available for $15 a month on top of Amazon Prime\u2019s $99 annual fee. </p> <p>The company, which has been offering its Fresh service in some densely populated parts of the US since 2007, has been expanding the grocery delivery service rapidly, recently adding new cities across the US. It is now available in Seattle, New York, Washington, Boston, northern New Jersey, Philadelphia, Stamford, Baltimore and large parts of California. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/09/amazon-starts-uk-fresh-food-delivery\">In June it launched outside of the US for the first time, offering grocery delivery to homes in parts of north and east London.</a></p> <p>The British service is offered to Amazon Prime members in 69 postcodes for an additional \u00a36.99 ($8.50) a month. </p> <p>Amazon collected annual sales of $107bn last year, more than double the amount it generated just four years earlier. Its net income totaled $596m.</p>",
  "<p>The larger Sainsbury\u2019s outlets will look increasingly like department stores as they try to fight back against the rise of the discounters with more services and non-food beside the groceries, according to the supermarket chain\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>Unveiling the new Sainsbury\u2019s in south London, its first to feature both a Habitat and an Argos \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/sainsburys-gets-all-clear-to-buy-argos\">bought nearly six weeks ago in the \u00a31.4bn acquisition of Home Retail Group</a> \u2013 Mike Coupe said supermarkets needed to be flexible to compete in a rapidly changing market.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever has has happened in the last five years will be speeded up and happening faster again in the next five years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Coupe said the rise of online shopping and a move towards buying food regularly at small local stores meant big supermarkets had to do more to persuade people to visit. Last month, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/28/sainsburys-sales-fall-further-price-cuts-discounters\">1.1% fall in sales at established stores</a> in the three months to the end of September as it was forced to cut food prices in the latest round of an ongoing industry price war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77f939567f16ee71721f1a2028aea202f46ebc01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77f939567f16ee71721f1a2028aea202f46ebc01/0_46_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to install five Habitat outlets in its stores by Christmas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to install five Habitat outlets in its stores by Christmas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are never going to be John Lewis or go down that road but we have tried to change our look and feel so that we are less like a supermarket and more like a department store,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the new site in Battersea, Sainsbury\u2019s Tu clothing brand has 9,500 sq ft of space set out to look like a high street store, and there is also a sushi counter run by Sushi Gourmet, separate counters for fresh meat, cheese, cakes and pizza, Habitat and Argos concessions and an Explore Learning children\u2019s tuition centre. A Starbucks coffee shop is set to open in the store soon.</p> <p>Coupe said that in a traditional supermarket sales of clothing were driven by price but now Sainsbury\u2019s was able to sell premium products that were stylish and fashionable. It dropped a collection designed by Gok Wan this season but will continue to work with the TV stylist who will pick recommendations from the Tu range, to be highlighted in stores and online. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to install five Habitat outlets in its stores by Christmas, including in St Albans and Solihull. John Rogers, the new boss of Argos, said the group could potentially open tens more outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s stores and was also mulling whether to open new standalone stores.<br></p> <p>Coupe said: \u201cHabitat is extending traditional supermarket prices to places customers wouldn\u2019t expect. You can\u2019t just sell products in isolation, you have to sell them in the right environment.\u201d</p> <p>The Sainsbury\u2019s department store model also includes the installation of Argos outlets, 14 more of which will go into stores by Christmas taking the total to 30. Coupe said he hoped all Sainsbury\u2019s stores would eventually include at least some space for Argos, even if it was just a pick-up point for goods ordered online. The company has even experimented with temporary Argos pop-ups at festivals.</p> <p>But Sainsbury\u2019s has yet to reveal how many Argos outlets it will relocate from the high street to its supermarkets although it has said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/sainsburys-says-600-jobs-could-go-in-home-retail-group-merger\">200 to 300 store jobs are likely to be eliminated through relocations</a>. So far just one store \u2013 in Oldham \u2013 has relocated and Coupe said all Argos staff had transferred. The average length of the lease on an Argos store is just four years, and Rogers said some were much shorter. But he said no firm decision on closure of Argos outlets had yet been taken.</p>",

But he and almost a dozen other industry insiders I speak to agree that the game has changed. As threats \u2013 real and perceived \u2013 grow, celebrities haven\u2019t wised up.

He sends an advance team to hook up with local agents. They sweep the hotel, prepare routes and install their own cameras and motion sensors, wired to an operations room in a neighbouring suite. At least four bodyguards are deployed, including one or two off-duty Paris police officers with arresting power. The principal, as clients are known, carries a panic button at all times and is never allowed to be more than eight seconds from rescue. \u201cWhen you want to rob someone of $10m in jewellery and you realise you\u2019re gonna have to kill a French police officer and two security to get to it, that changes the equation a bit,\u201d Engbrecht says.</p> <p>James Glancy, a former Royal Marine and London-based security consultant, says the heavy who clears a path through a sea of fans should be the \u201ccherry on the cake\u201d of a close-protection detail. Another British close-protection officer, who did not want to be named but is a&#xa0;manager at <a href=\"http://www.closeprotectionworld.com\" title=\"\">Close Protection World</a>, a&#xa0;forum for bodyguards, compares that experience with war (he is a former military police officer). \u201cYou come out of a lift and it\u2019s silent, then \u2013 bang! \u2013 you\u2019re almost blinded by the lights,\u201d he&#xa0;says. \u201cYou have cheering, shouting fans fighting among each other. It\u2019s the same sensory overload, and the adrenaline courses through you.\u201d</p> <p>Glancy\u2019s firm, <a href=\"http://www.another-day.com\" title=\"\">AnotherDay</a>, concentrates on the prevention and planning required to back up the man on the ground. He vets staff and commissions duplicates of valuable objects. He advised one British client to make replicas of a pair of Purdey shotguns. The copies cost about \u00a35,000 \u2013 a fraction of the real guns\u2019 value \u2013 and stand inside a conspicuous cabinet; the antiques are stashed elsewhere. His team trains clients to be convincing while handing over the decoys. \u201cIf an organised crime network really wants to get an individual, they will, but imagine the psychological victory if Kardashian had given these guys a fake ring,\u201d Glancy says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a0d60b682fa149c25c662f40cffa94c997bdc18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0d60b682fa149c25c662f40cffa94c997bdc18/0_41_1987_2484/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pascal Duvier deals with celebrity botherer Vitalii Sediuk\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pascal Duvier and a French security agent deal with celebrity botherer Vitalii Sediuk, who tried to kiss Kim Kardashian in Paris in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Piasecki/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mores of the super-rich are partly to blame for an explosion in the close-protection industry centred on London. A Mayfair car showroom that&#xa0;opened last year sells <a href=\"http://www.ares-performance.com/press/press-releases/ares-opens-the-doors-on-flagship-london-showroom/\" title=\"\">armoured Lamborghinis</a>. Paradoxically, a hulking bodyguard is sometimes deployed as a&#xa0;wealth-signalling accessory. The <a href=\"http://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Security Industry Authority</a>, which regulates the industry for the Home Office, reports that in 2007 there were 2,000 valid close-protection licences in&#xa0;circulation (anyone working as a bodyguard in the UK is legally required to undergo training before applying for one). There are now more than 15,000, each bodyguard charging anything from \u00a3300 a day up into four figures depending on their background (ex-special forces sit at the top of the tree).</p> <p>As Whitfield found with Michael Jackson, the trust required to preserve a life means the role can quickly expand to combine the duties of a confidante, gatekeeper, childminder, PA \u2013 and friend. \u201cWe\u2019ve had clients for whom we\u2019ve had to draw chalk marks on the street at the Cannes festival so they know where to&#xa0;stand,\u201d says Engbrecht. \u201cWe had a billionaire who only communicated by Post-it notes and once informed us there was too much dust under the toaster by writing on a Post-It \u2013 and putting it under the toaster. We had one of the most powerful women in the world, who wasn\u2019t known in America and would come to New York to be treated as a human. We\u2019d walk down Fifth Avenue and I\u2019d be&#xa0;thinking: \u2018You\u2019re worth umpteen billions and God knows how many heads of state you\u2019ve got on your cell&#xa0;phone.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Violence remains rare on the celebrity circuit, although Bolivar says he has had to \u201csuppress life\u201d while protecting a client (he declines to elaborate). Engbrecht says he has displayed his weapon twice, \u201cand it became apparent I was prepared to use&#xa0;it\u201d. Whitfield has never had to take action. \u201cAnyone who would have got close enough to steal anything from Mr&#xa0;Jackson would have broken the barrier and that\u2019s never gonna happen with me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Iain Robertson was a former para who became a bodyguard and road manager for bands including Oasis and Spandau Ballet. In the early 2000s, before he quit for a safer life as a firefighter, he was in a Moscow nightclub after a Marc Almond concert. \u201cHe&#xa0;had a particularly stylish and flamboyant fur coat that night,\u201d Robertson remembers at his one-engine fire station in Gloucestershire. \u201cWe\u2019d been in this club a couple of hours, with the&#xa0;beautiful people of Moscow and shitloads of gangsters, when I was approached by a couple of guys who had been sitting a few tables away.</p> <p>\u201cI introduced myself and they asked if they could buy me a beer. Then one said: \u2018My boss\u2019s wife would really like that coat.\u2019 I said I\u2019d speak to Marc but that I knew he was very attached to it. \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand,\u2019 they said. So I talked to Marc. He didn\u2019t want to give up the coat. \u2018OK, I\u2019ll take care of this,\u2019 I told him. \u2018You need to gather up the band and slip out of here&#xa0;back to the hotel.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Robertson, now 56, says he returned to the table to stall the men. But two of&#xa0;them spotted the band leaving and got up. \u201cI gave the first guy a sort of straight arm to the throat and the second got a sort of knuckle punch into&#xa0;the temple,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew what&#xa0;was going to happen next. I got the living shit kicked out of me, but the&#xa0;band were able to get out. Then the guys who had done the beating picked me up, dusted me down and bought me a beer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2188af83d5779faad46230f4992b24c276e625f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2188af83d5779faad46230f4992b24c276e625f/0_108_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson with his personal security in 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson with his personal security during a visit to Washington in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask Whitfield how he felt after Jackson\u2019s death in the summer of 2009. The bodyguard had stayed in Las Vegas to prepare the security for the world tour that was due to start in London two weeks later. Jackson was in a rented mansion in Los Angeles with his&#xa0;physician, who would later be convicted of involuntary manslaughter for administering the fatal dose of surgical anaesthetic that Jackson demanded for his insomnia. Whitfield had become unfailingly loyal, even forgoing wages while Jackson\u2019s debts multiplied. He remembers carrying in a&#xa0;briefcase two Gone With the Wind Oscars statuettes that Jackson had bought in 1999 for $1.5m. They would be used as currency if the cash ran out.</p> <p>Whitfield had watched lawyers, promoters and family members circle while the tour took shape. \u201cMr Jackson said to me at the beginning: \u2018Bill, watch; now the vultures are going to start to show up.\u2019 And soon I knew exactly what he meant. I witnessed the heartache and stress. He expressed it to me.&#xa0;So when the word came out that Mr Jackson passed away? After what I&#xa0;had witnessed him go through, the first thing that came to my mind was: \u2018Now&#xa0;he\u2019ll rest.\u2019 He didn\u2019t die, he left this place and all of what he was going&#xa0;through.\u201d</p> <p>That loyalty endures and Whitfield dismisses the more lurid claims about Jackson\u2019s private life. He says the man&#xa0;under the mask was \u201cas normal as&#xa0;the rest of us\u201d. In 2014, he wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Remember-Time-protecting-Michael-Jackson/dp/1922247804\" title=\"\">Remembering the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days</a> with Javon Beard, his fellow bodyguard. \u201cMr Jackson became my friend, someone I cared for and loved,\u201d Whitfield says, before putting down the phone and going to school. \u201cWriting the book&#xa0;was a way of continuing my protection of him.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We British are a sorry lot. Our apology-addiction is a point of national pride and one area in which we have always outstripped the rest of the world. According to a recent YouGov poll, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/07/01/oh-sorry-do-british-people-apologise-too-much/\" title=\"\">Brits say sorry up to 50% more than Americans</a>. But for a couple of hours on Sunday night, the contrition tables turned. As the presidential election moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">from debate to debacle</a>, Americans flocked to Twitter to apologise to the world for Donald Trump. A parody Jill Biden account, for example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JillBidenVeep/status/785288664255434752\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSorry, rest of the World. We\u2019re embarrassed too. #debate\u201d, and got 45,000 likes.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long, however, before the UK was apologising back to the US about Nigel Farage. As if Trump hadn\u2019t ruined our Sunday evening enough, you see, the outgoing leader of Ukip decided to continue the damage. Farage appeared in the spin room following the debate to praise Trump\u2019s performance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\" title=\"\">Likening Trump to a silverback gorilla</a>, Farage said: \u201cHe looked like a big gorilla prowling the set. He is that big alpha male \u2013 that\u2019s who he is.\u201d At the end of this soliloquy, a bewildered reporter inquired, <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/please-read-this-incredibly-horny-description-of-donald-1787618973\" title=\"\">\u201cSir, can I just ask: what are you doing here?\u201d</a></p> <p>The short answer to this is: continuing the damage. If Trump is a gorilla, then Farage is, as memorably described by the actor Christoph Waltz, \u201cthe head rat leaving the sinking ship\u201d. Having \u201cliberated\u201d Britain, Farage was quick to remove himself from the actual work of Brexiting. Rather, he headed over to the US to continue inspiring popular revolt alongside Trump. Farage has become something of a rock star to conservative Americans. The rightwing talkshow host Steve Deace called him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/nigel-farage-cpac-american-conservatives\" title=\"\">\u201cprobably the global politician not named Netanyahu most adored by American conservatives\u201d</a>. He makes regular appearances on Fox News. He also seems to have become Trump\u2019s personal fluffer. He was at the debate at Trump\u2019s request and also attended the Republican national convention as well as a Trump rally in Mississippi in August. While many in Trump\u2019s own party have distanced themselves from the increasingly indefensible nominee, Farage is resolutely standing by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/06/nigel-farage-donald-trump-calls-himself-mr-brexit-heres-why-hes-right/\" title=\"\">Donald \u201cJust Call Me Mr Brexit\u201d Trump</a>.</p> <p>Farage\u2019s stateside trumpeting may not seem like much of a big deal, but it is. Farage has an international platform; his animal analogies were written up by a number of American outlets, including Time, CNN, the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek. This reflects back on Britain. It doesn\u2019t just say to America: this is what Nigel Farage thinks. It says, to some degree: this is what the UK thinks. It aligns Brexit Britain with Trump\u2019s values (or dearth thereof). And this gets to the heart of what Farage is really doing in America: claiming Brexit as a victory for his brand of racism and intolerance. Telling the US that Britain feels just like him. Acting as a sort of anti-ambassador.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56z7a\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2792998\"            data-video-name=\"Nigel Farage: 'Donald Trump was like a big silverback gorilla' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb5465e4b05c2f1e953e4a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010Faragesubs.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-donald-trump-big-silverback-gorilla-ukip-video\">Nigel Farage: \u2018Donald Trump was like a big silverback gorilla\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In an August speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/brexit-vote-nigel-farage-making-uk-laughing-stock-abroad-tim-farron\" title=\"\">warned that the UK has become a \u201claughing stock abroad\u201d</a> and identified Farage as one of the \u201cmalevolent forces\u201d tarnishing the country\u2019s image after the EU referendum. Farron told the Guardian that the rest of the world was increasingly associating the UK with figures such as the interim Ukip leader and stressed that we mustn\u2019t allow the likes of Farage, Boris Johnson, David Davis, and Liam Fox to represent Britain. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>No, they don\u2019t. But if we\u2019re not careful then Farage and BoJo are going to become the smug, smirking faces of Britain to the outside world. So how does Britain wrest back control of its international image? What\u2019s needed, I think, is a squad of Brexit-busters. Celebrities who actually represent modern Britain and are tasked with working together to counterbalance malevolent forces such as Farage. A sort of 2016 Captain Planet, tasked with taking political pollution down to zero.</p> <p>First three spots on the squad go to Adele, JK Rowling and Zadie Smith. Obviously. The next goes to Zayn Malik. He may have broken a million hearts with his One Direxit but he is one of the most positive ambassadors of Britishness abroad. Indeed, the poor guy is routinely held up as Modern Muslim British Man Who is Good Role Model by the media. As well as helping to spread the message that not all Muslims are Isis, Malik is telling the world that not all British food is awful. Apparently he\u2019s working as the UK\u2019s unofficial cultural ambassador and helping his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, get \u201csuper into British foods\u201d. The model told ES magazine: <a href=\"http://www.elleuk.com/fashion/news/a31882/gigi-hadid/\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m loving Heinz baked beans in the morning.\u201d</a> If Malik can get Hadid to wax lyrical about baked beans, then anything is possible.</p> <p>James Corden\u2019s recent runaway success in America is another example of overcoming the odds. While most British personalities presenting on American TV have played into the evil Brit trope (think: Gordon Ramsay, Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan), Corden has proved you can be genuinely nice and still get good ratings.</p> <p>The final opening goes to John Oliver. The host of HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight, watched by 4 million Americans, has become a cult figure in the US, where he is far more famous than he is at home. Oliver has turned British sarcasm into something of a superpower; his jokes are helping to change America for the better, something Time magazine termed the <a href=\"http://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/\" title=\"\">\u201cJohn Oliver effect\u201d</a>. His takedown of proposed changes to net neutrality laws, for example, has been credited, in part, with pushing the Federal Communications Commission to vote for regulations against internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d. Who knows, Oliver\u2019s segment on the EU referendum, in which he pleaded with Brits to vote remain, might have had an effect on the British electorate. However, due to British media impartiality rules, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/eu-referendum/britain-television-john-oliver/\" title=\"\">it was never shown there on TV</a>.</p> <p>Which sums up 2016 in the UK: a British politician gushing about gorillas to show his support for a man who says he likes to grope women is just regular news. A British comedian making jokes about the referendum, however, is unsuitable for television. Sorry, rest of the world. We\u2019re embarrassed too.</p>",
  "<p>The former cabinet minister Francis Maude has taken a job advising an international law firm on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, six months after standing down from government. <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/francis-maude\">Lord Maude</a>, who until April was a trade and investment minister, has joined <a href=\"https://www.cov.com/\">Covington and Burling LLP</a> as a senior adviser in its government affairs practice. </p> <p>Law firms and the finance industry have been setting up Brexit units to advise clients on how to understand and shape UK policy and how their commercial interests will be affected by leaving the EU. </p> <p>The appointment coincides with further pressure on the government to clamp down on former ministers who want to take up roles in the private sector that may allow them to exploit their contacts. </p> <p>Maude\u2019s roles in government have made him one of the best connected figures in Whitehall following a 30-year career in parliament as an MP and minister. <br></p> <p>He was the minister for trade and investment under David Cameron from 2015 to 2016. Before that he was minister for the Cabinet Office and paymaster general under the 2010-15 coalition government, which brought him into contact with a succession of permanent secretaries. </p> <p>Covington, which works extensively in Europe, employs more than 120 former government officials, diplomats and regulators. It does not disclose any clients on the UK\u2019s statutory lobbying registers.<br></p> <p>Maude has also has taken up a role as chairman of the advertising agency Cogent Elliott, months after accepting a job on the advisory board at the alternative investment firm Anvest Partners.</p> <p>His roles have been approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) as long as he does not personally lobby ministers or officials for two years after leaving office or draw on privileged information. He is at liberty to advise others on how to do so, however. <br></p> <p>A spokesperson for Covington denied that Maude had taken up a lobbying job. \u201cFrancis Maude is not a lobbyist but a strategic adviser, who will be assisting the firm and its clients as they navigate complexities around Brexit,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Covington is one of a number of firms advising clients on the consequences of the leave vote in June. </p> <p>The lobbying firm <a href=\"http://interelgroup.com/brexit-services/\">Interel</a>, which employs Liam Fox\u2019s former special adviser Oli Waghorn, promises to help clients to \u201cshape the post-Brexit regulatory and business environment\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hanovercomms.com/our-people/directors/charles-lewington/\">Hanover</a>, run by John Major\u2019s former press secretary Charles Lewington, has established a business advisory team to help clients navigate Brexit in order to \u201cprotect your bottom line\u201d.</p> <p>Last month it emerged that the former foreign secretary William Hague had been appointed to the \u201cBrexit client transition unit\u201d at the consultancy Teneo, whose clients include HSBC, Coca-Cola and Nissan. </p> <p>Meanwhile, MPs were warned on Tuesday that the revolving door of ministers and senior civil servants taking senior jobs in the private sector was now so prevalent that the boundary between the regulator and regulated had dissolved.</p> <p>Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, which has campaign on the issue, told the Commons public administration committee that the current system was \u201copen to corruption\u201d and there had been a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d failure to prevent conflict of interests.</p> <p>Alexandra Runswick, director of the campaign group Unlock Democracy said the volume of people moving from senior roles in Whitehall to the private sector had significantly increased.</p> <p>\u201cCalling it a revolving door is almost too gentle a metaphor.

Johnson famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon the the ultra-hawkish Labour MP <strong>John Woodock </strong>urged Johnson to adopt a Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98#block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98\">2.56pm.)</a> As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson\u2019s language was probably a bit more condemnatory than Hammond\u2019s would have been in a debate like this. But if you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May\u2019s views than Johnson\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-the-chilcot-report-is-finally-coming-but-we-already-know-we-havent-learned-the-lessons-of-iraq.html\">(Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is on record as saying foreign policy should \u201cvalue stability, \u201crespect sovereignty\u201d and avoid ideological crusades.)</a> But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead was more Stanley Baldwin.</p> <p>Here are the key points from his speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated for war crimes by the international criminal court</strong>. But he played down prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every hospital in eastern Aleppo is believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been successfully prosecuted decades after their offences.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also expressed some support for <a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20161010084755-l2s3l/\">the French bid to get the ICC to launch an investigation into Syria and Russia,</a> saying he was \u201cpersonally very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the international criminal court\u201d. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, Downing Street sounded a bit less keen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/785863360227250176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris &#39;personally attracted&#39; to pursuing Syria war crimes through ICC.

Johnson said he had \u201cevery sympathy\u201d for what they were proposing and that he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending troops to Syria, he added:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone.

If President Putin\u2019s strategy is to restore the greatness and the glory of Russia, then I believe he risks seeing his ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is happening in Syria.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But he said the \u201cbest hope\u201d was to persuade Russia to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. </strong>Johnson said the UK had urged the EU to adopt a tough line on sanctions against Russia, but he pointedly refused to commit the UK to pushing for tougher sanctions. He also declined to back a call from Labour\u2019s <strong>Toby Perkins</strong> for the international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ... </p> <p>Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine ceasefire. That is the way.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of Syria\u2019s civil war over five years ago.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724/66_0_662_397/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in the Commons.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson in the Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:29:41.200Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcfedce4b01d9dd2c8ff08\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:10:09.982Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia defends its record in Syria</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Russian embassy in London has been using Twitter today to defend its record in Syria.

She is working on the assumption that the country voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true \u2013 a majority of people were against a hard Brexit.</p> <p>There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas hardest of all. Great effort will be expended to protect the financial sector and the City of London, which, while understandable, could lead to trade-offs that will damage other sectors.</p> <p>These issues need to be openly debated and that is why I am asking the prime minister to establish a Brexit committee of the nations and regions, with places for the devolved governments and the elected mayoralties. The aim of that committee should be to seek a fair Brexit that balances the needs of all parts of the country.

Not just to London, but to the whole of the British economy \u2013 hitting jobs and growth. </p> <p>A hard Brexit approach could never be defended as being done in the name of principle or \u2018taking back control\u2019, as the clear motivation would be political expediency in an attempt to turn an extremely complex argument into a simple one. An approach that would not only be deeply irresponsible, but could cause significant economic damage. </p> <p>We need the government to really be on the side of business and the City of London as we go into the Brexit negotiations \u2013 something that seems to be lacking at the moment.</p> <p>So I\u2019ll be working with businesses in the days, weeks and months ahead to put pressure on the government, to make sure London\u2019s voice is heard loud and clear and to make the case for a proper, sensible solution to this complicated challenge.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/785827745054003200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mayor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SadiqKhan\">@SadiqKhan</a> to CBI on Brexit concerns for London &quot;hard Brexit approach cannot be defended- deeply irresponsible&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/eQYbkJegUQ\">pic.twitter.com/eQYbkJegUQ</a></p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/785827745054003200\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fce4f6e4b05d915e423dc0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T13:13:29.396Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>To coincide with today\u2019s Syria debate, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, has said Russia and Syria should face an war crimes investigation at the international criminal court.<strong> Hywel Williams</strong>, Plaid\u2019s leader at Westminster, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The case against Russia and Syria is clear and backed by firm evidence.

Osborne said that he and David Cameron always thought the \u201cbest of the Conservative tradition\u201d combined the interventionist views of people like Heseltine with the economic rationalism of people like Nigel Lawson. Heseltine said that if Osborne was initially opposed to his plans in 2012, that would not surprise him because \u201cthere has been a growing understanding of the potential [of decentralisation]\u201d.

Broadly, the approach I can see them pursuing in energy, regional policy and the like is very similar. </p> <p>It is human nature that new people in new jobs want to do new things. But the key is to look at is what is essentially the agreed strategy adopted by the new team. </p> <p>The agreed strategy that has been adopted by the new team is that we should have an industrial strategy, that certain sectors should receive active government support, that government should be pro-business, that devolution should continue, that the Northern Powerhouse should be supported. </p> <p>I would look behind the blizzard of press releases to the continuity of the policy, and I see a lot of continuity.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said governments in the past had been too slow to build new airports.</strong> Asked if the last government should have acted more quickly to expand Heathrow, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our country has collectively over 60 years dragged its heels on airport expansion.

Laws was a Lib Dem minister in the coalition, and when he was writing the book he had access to Nick Clegg\u2019s private notes. As a result, the book is well-sourced.</p> <p>And the book reveals that Osborne was a) initially sceptical about devolving powers to the region and b) opposed to Heseltine\u2019s No Stone Unturned report.</p> <p>Here is the key extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of October [2012], the Heseltine report was published, urging the government to devolve more economic powers from the centre to the regions. George Osborne didn\u2019t seem very impressed. At a meeting, he described the Heseltine report as a \u2018very personal\u2019 report, and a \u2018bid to steal every department\u2019s capital budget\u2019.</p> <p>David Cameron joked that the whole thing sounded like a \u2018fourth-term priority\u2019. The ever-sharp George Osborne added: \u2018Yes, a fourth-term priority - but for a different government!\u2019</p> <p>The prime minister urged that we should be diplomatic in responding to the Heseltine report as \u2018Michael is a very big beast in the political jungle. Upsetting him over this would be as risky as interrupting a silverback while he\u2019s mating.\u2019 It was an interesting and vivid image.</p> <p>Later in the parliament, George Osborne seemed to become a belated supporter of more localism. For now, he certainly seemed rather sceptical. Even in early 2013, when the chancellor first started to advocate the devolving of money from central government to local areas, one seasoned government adviser told me: \u2018George\u2019s view is that the money will either be wasted by central government or by local government. He thinks the only advantage of devolution is that you can slice 10% off the money as you devolve it, so that the Treasury pays out less.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fcb722e4b088a03a67d5ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T09:56:30.622Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Should you have gone quicker in government on airport expansion?</em></p> <p>Osborne says the country collective has dragged its feet on this.

In the EU, the dispersed nature of power means policies have to trudge wearily between the commission, national capitals and, increasingly, the European and national parliaments before being adopted.</p> <p>Neither is necessarily superior. The eurozone\u2019s inept handling of its sovereign debt crisis was an object lesson in what happens when iterative processes do not match the realities of 21st-century capital markets.

It\u2019s a radical departure of how California has been addressing climate change. In effect, SB 1425 moves the focus from fossil fuels to water.</p> <p>California has long been a leader in addressing global warming. In 2006, California enacted the <a href=\"https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm\">Global Warming Solutions Act </a>(AB 32), which set out to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Since then, the state has implemented a flurry of programs to cut emissions, from subsidizing electric cars and solar panel purchases to mandating tailpipe emission reductions of cars and trucks. In September, the governor expanded the target by signing a bill requiring the state to cut the emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.</p> <p>These programs have been a great success: California is on target to meet its near-term 2020 goal. Reaching the 2030 goal will require new investments and innovation.</p> <p>The new registry for water-related emissions can play a key role in achieving that 2030 target. We haven\u2019t been focusing on water primarily because our efforts have centered on reducing emissions from two of the biggest sources: burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and power vehicles. Then, the ongoing drought that first hit California five years ago put a spotlight on water consumption and its heavy reliance on the state\u2019s electricity generation and distribution system.</p> <p>The drought led to mandatory water use reductions, sparked public anger at heavy water users such as farmers and big businesses and touched off fights over water rights. For example, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-nestle-water-20160319-story.html\">Nestle drew public outcry</a> for continuing to pump and bottle millions of gallons of water.</p> <p>I think many of us understand that driving less can significantly reduce emissions, but is that true for using less water?</p> <p>To investigate this issue, I challenged my research group in the Center for Water-Energy Efficiency at the University of California, Davis, to explore how much electricity is saved through aggressive water conservation measures. The results shocked us.</p> <p>Our analysis showed that the quantity of electricity saved statewide through reducing urban water use by 25% in 2015 was roughly equivalent to all of the electricity saved by all of the energy efficiency programs from the state\u2019s four major investor-owned energy utilities in 2015. The conclusion: energy savings from water conservation are significant.</p> <p>Our research focused on the so-called cold water energy, which is used for pumping, treating, and delivering water and disposing of wastewater. The energy used in consuming water, such as heating it, is commonly referred to as hot water energy.</p> <p>To create effective water conservation programs, we will need good data to measure emission reductions associated with energy savings. SB 1425 will lay the groundwork for establishing a protocol to calculate energy-related emissions and create a registry for documenting and archiving them.</p> <p>Making a strong connection between energy and water savings will also help persuade policy makers to fund more water conservation efforts. This, in turn, will also nudge water utilities to share their data with the voluntary registry. Otherwise, water utilities will either raise water rates to fund those initiatives or absorb the expenses themselves. As a result, they can become reluctant to step up voluntary conservation efforts. To meet the 2015 state mandate to reduce urban water use by 25% over the 2013 levels, for example, water utilities had to pay, on average, $75 for every acre-foot saved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/electricity-storage-underground-quidnet-energy\">A Texas startup's big energy idea: storing electricity underground</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead of crafting new incentive programs, the state can use existing ones to fund water conservation efforts that also lower the state\u2019s energy consumption. One of California\u2019s most important climate change programs is the cap-and-trade system, which generates revenues for the state through the sale of permits that major polluters must buy to cover their emissions. The cap-and-trade program currently funds a variety of emissions-reducing efforts, including rebates for more energy- efficient water heaters. It doesn\u2019t subsidize any type of cold-water conservation, and it should.</p> <p>Just as we are encouraged to diversify our retirement accounts to ensure resiliency and make a profit, we must do the same in our strategies to lower the state\u2019s emissions. Water utilities need to see conservation as an activity that does not threaten their fiscal stability, and we need their help to tackle climate change. In my view, energy utilities need to be even more aggressive investing in energy efficiency through water conservation, and California needs to expand its climate change programs to invest aggressively in both hot and cold water conservation. SB 1425 will help to get this done.</p> <p><em>Frank Loge is the director of the Center for Water-Energy Efficiency and holds the Krone Endowed Professorship in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis.</em></p>",

So far, politicians have done little to tackle the issue. <a href=\"http://epi.org.uk/report/teacherworkload/\">Our analysis</a>, published this week, provides yet further evidence that policymakers must act.</p> <p>Using <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/edu/education-at-a-glance-19991487.htm\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data</a>, we found that full-time teachers in secondary schools in England now work an average of 48.2 hours per week. This is the third highest out of 36 education authorities surveyed. It is also 19% longer than the OECD average. </p> <p>We examined what impact this has on students, and what politicians can do about the problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/burnout-teachers-teaching-extra-work\">To keep burnout at bay, teachers must learn to say no | Kester Brewin</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Long hours, low starting pay<br></strong></h2> <p>England\u2019s secondary school teachers spent an average of just four days on continuing professional development (CPD), including courses, observational visits, seminars and in-service training. This is far lower than the average of approximately 11 days across schools in other OECD countries. Work schedules are a barrier to accessing CPD according to 60% of teachers in England, compared to an average of 49% elsewhere.</p> <p>This has obvious implications for teacher effectiveness. But difficult working conditions also make the job less appealing compared to other professions, especially when relative pay is considered too. England is typical in that teachers are paid less than other workers of similar qualification levels. However, in England the ratio between teachers\u2019 working hours and the average for the whole economy is 17% greater than the average ratio across 13 other, mainly European, countries assessed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only 48% of teachers in England have more than 10 years\u2019\u200bexperience, compared with an OECD average of 64%</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Long hours, low starting pay and limited access to professional development create a risk of teacher burn out, especially in the early stages of careers. Only 48% of teachers in England have more than 10 years\u2019 experience, compared with an average of OECD 64%. According to the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/edu/education-at-a-glance-19991487.htm\">OECD</a>, England has also had one of the fastest reductions in the proportion of teachers aged over 50 in secondary education between 2005 and 2014.</p> <p>Whether or not a teacher can cope with long working hours is therefore likely to have as great an influence on whether they remain a teacher for the duration of their career as their effectiveness in the profession. Combined with extremely low levels of CPD, which might otherwise improve the effectiveness of teachers who need support to improve, this does not suggest a labour market that will help pupils flourish.</p> <p>Does this signal a national problem or, rather, bad practice in certain schools?</p> <p>The figures take a snapshot of the hours worked in a single week and cover, on average, 14 teachers in each school in the study. On this basis, working hours either vary substantially across the year or between individuals much more than they vary between schools. This represents a challenge for any body, for instance Ofsted, that wanted to objectively hold schools to account for working conditions. It also offers little hope that teachers will easily be able to identify schools where they can be assured of lighter work pressures, and may suggest that the approaches of heads of department are at least as important as school-wide policies.</p> <p>Most teachers believe the accountability system plays a role in workload and pressure. However, it appears unlikely that the government\u2019s focus on accountability will wane. Furthermore, teachers in good schools, based on Ofsted inspections outcomes, do not work much longer hours than others, so it does not appear to be the case that the current system creates an environment where the only way to succeed is to have your teachers work longer hours. Internationally, many high performing schools avoid long working hours: full time teachers in Shanghai worked an average of around 40 hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/05/cramped-classes-and-staff-cuts-school-budgets-pushed-to-breaking-point\">Cramped classes and staff cuts: school budgets pushed to breaking point</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What should be done about it?<br></strong></h2> <p>The department for education\u2019s profession-led policy <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/teacher-workload-new-measures-announced\">reviews</a> led to recommendations on planning, marking, and data management. This report highlights that teaching time is indeed not the key driver, both across countries and in comparisons between different teachers in England. So the focuses of the reviews are right and the findings should be heeded by school leaders. The data shows that the time England\u2019s teachers spend planning each hour of lessons is in line with the average across countries. This supports the opinions expressed in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-teachers-workload/reducing-teachers-workload\">Workload Challenge</a> that it is important to use the time more effectively rather than dramatically reduce it.</p> <p>The report does not identify any silver bullets in terms of teacher practice. However, it does show that, for a selected class taught by those surveyed, those teachers who have pupils use ICT for class projects in all or nearly all lessons work 4.6 hours less per week than those who, at most, occasionally adopt this approach. The use of technology to save time is an area that appears ripe for further research and consideration by schools and teachers.</p> <p>Finally, those feeling more prepared for teaching are less likely to find their workload unmanageable. The new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-for-teachers-professional-development\">professional development standards</a> for teachers should therefore be prioritised, promoted and monitored by the department.

The government is \u201cgenuinely trying to set out an agenda about how to close the employment gap,\u201d he adds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/publications/disability-employment-gap/\" title=\"\">Less than half</a> of the 5.5 million working-age people in the UK with work-limiting health conditions or disabilities have jobs. And only 8% of sick and disabled people without a job move into work in any one year. Finding work for 1.2 million of them by 2020 is a \u201cbold\u201d target, Heslop concedes, but the right one. \u201cIt is absolutely imperative that the May government prioritises action to make this a reality and does not lose focus.\u201d</p> <p>Heslop, who lost his sight at 20, due to a degenerative condition, had a 20-year career in the telecoms industry, holding senior roles in North America and the UK, and co-founded <a href=\"http://www.blindinbusiness.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Blind in Business</a>, a charity that helps people who are blind or partially sighted into work. Before joining Leonard Cheshire, led RNIB Solutions, the sight-loss charity\u2019s consultancy service, advising firms on making goods and services more accessible.</p> <p>He says he feels \u201cpassionately\u201d about improving the job prospects of disabled people. Yet he is the only disabled leader of Leonard Cheshire in more than 25 years, and the charity\u2019s management systems don\u2019t accurately measure the number of disabled employees. (A Leonard Cheshire spokesman later tells me it is certainly \u201cnot less than 312\u201d out of more than 7,000 staff and promises that the employment of disabled people will be a \u201ckey\u201d target for Leonard Cheshire). \u201cI believe that our representation of disabled people isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d says Heslop.</p> <p>Its lack of disabled staff, coupled with a failure to involve service users in decision-making and to help them live more independently, has led to run-ins with <a href=\"https://www.kingqueen.org.uk/?s=leonard+cheshire&amp;searchsubmit=\" title=\"\">disability rights activists</a> who accuse the charity of institutionalising disabled people in crumbling mansions.</p> <p>Leonard Cheshire provides a wide range of services, from 107 residential care homes to 24 supported living centres, various day services and employment and skills support across the UK for 7,000 people. So how does Heslop respond to the criticism?</p> <p>\u201cWe need to modernise our organisation in a way and at a speed that takes the people who work for us and the people who use our services with us,\u201d he replies.</p> <p>It has certainly been a turbulent time for the charity. Both the former and acting chief executive left earlier this year, while the new chair, Sally Davis, has only been in post one year. A strategic review of all the charity\u2019s activities, to report in six months\u2019 time, will \u201censure the voice of disabled people is at the heart of all decision-making,\u201d says Heslop. He also wants to \u201crebalance\u201d the charity\u2019s social care activities. \u201cIn the UK we need to increase the proportion of our care services that are delivered through supported living activity, while remaining fully committed to high-quality care for those with the most complex care needs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is looking at the viability of its 20 poorest-performing homes. \u201cIn such a diverse portfolio, you inevitably have to look at the long-term sustainability in terms of our ability to deliver quality of service,\u201d says Heslop. Yet on the issue of home closures, he stresses \u201cno major closure programme is envisaged\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If  the government is doing bad things to the people that we are here to serve, we will be loud and clear about that</p> <footer> <cite>Neil Heslop</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any closures would have to be handled sensitively. The charity was heavily criticised earlier this year by Rochdale council and local health bosses for showing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uncaring-charity-slammed-over-closure-10899106\" title=\"\">uncaring disregard</a>\u201d over the way it closed a local care home with just eight week\u2019s notice.

Chi-chi Nwanoku, double bassist and founder of the Chineke! orchestras, said: \u201cWhen I was growing up there wasn\u2019t really anyone who looked like me doing what I wanted to do \u2013 I was the only person of colour at my grammar school \u2013 so if people put a hand out, I would grab it. Having grown up in an environment where people told me I couldn\u2019t do certain things when I was a girl, I wanted to tell these girls they can.\u201d </p> <p>Listening in, Stevenson nodded in agreement. \u201cBeing an actress for me was no more likely than being an astronaut,\u201d she said. \u201cI think one of the best ways to combat gender bias is to give girls a sense of what is possible through role models \u2013 there are so many more today and girls can see they can be in positions of power and influence.\u201d </p> <p>While most of the mentors agreed progress towards gender equality had been made, others were focused on the battles still being fought. \u201cI come across <a href=\"http://everydaysexism.com/\">everyday sexism</a> every day,\u201d said Morris, who became the first female director of Tate Modern earlier this year. She gave the example of a pair of men blocking her path and calling her \u201cdarling\u201d. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not your darling, I\u2019m the director of the Tate Modern!\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>Speaking of her own appointment, she said she was struck by how many female colleagues had urged her to go for the role \u2013 and how few senior men. \u201cThe response of hundreds of women since I got the job has been of pure pleasure. But it\u2019s not really about me, it\u2019s another box ticked, another summit reached. It would be nice if in a few years\u2019 time, it was just normal.\u201d </p> <p>With 250 world beaters it comes as little surprise that advice is varied, with one mentor overheard offering guidance about how to avoid advances from men in the workplace, as another suggests allowing yourself to be vulnerable and that honesty is key. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9b33e541500014f477caa28a765a4bf5e383b1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9b33e541500014f477caa28a765a4bf5e383b1f/0_296_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doreen Lawrence talks to Sheriah at the speed mentoring event on the London Eye.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doreen Lawrence talks to Sheriah at the speed mentoring event on the London Eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlways aim high \u2013 concentrate on what you are doing, don\u2019t worry about anyone else,\u201d said Lady Lawrence, while Lady Benjamin urged girls to follow the three Cs \u2013 consideration, contentment and confidence. \u201cYou need the courage to stand up and not be afraid to speak out,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been confronted with barriers all my life and I just knock them down. But the most important thing is to smile \u2013 that shows you are a winner.\u201d</p> <p>The girls, in the main, enjoyed it even if one, wandering away from her half-hour session, grumbled: \u201cI thought I was going to get more advice to be honest, she just wanted to know about what I was doing.\u201d </p> <p>But others attested to the power of an influential mentor. Zanika, 14, from Lambeth Academy, fresh from a conversation with Stevenson, looked fired up and ready to go. \u201cShe was like, \u2018You need to work hard, be determined,\u2019\u201d she said. Had it made her think differently about her future? \u201cYeah, I need to focus,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI want to be someone, I want to do this.\u201d </p> <p>With the session over, and girls and mentors back on the banks of the Thames, Tyonna, 14, needed a little help identifying the mentor she had spoken to as Cherie Booth, but seemed happy with the experience. \u201cShe said the sky is your limit, don\u2019t let anything restrict you and stuff like that. It\u2019s made me think I need to be more open-minded, I need to be part of the world. She told me to chase my dreams, and behave.\u201d Is she going to follow that advice? \u201cI\u2019m going to try.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s been a dearth of in-depth writing from the Philippines since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte\" title=\"\">Rodrigo Duterte</a> became president in June. Sure, there\u2019s been news of the foul-mouthed former mayor insulting world leaders, of alliances he intends to forge - or forego - in Asia, and pieces about the rising death toll in the country\u2019s war on drugs.</p> <p>But there was no deep look at the shocking violence that\u2019s unfolding, how it has been incited, and why it is being sanctioned. Then came a quite exceptional piece of reporting from journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-lamb\" title=\"\">Kate Lamb</a>, who often files to the Guardian on events in South-East Asia. It was a piece that delved into the secret squads sanctioned to murder. Disturbing and important, it is brave reporting. You will find it in the deeper-read Review section of the edition this week.</p> <p>Our cover has been given over to equally compelling and important writing from another part of the world where social issues are at the forefront. Latin America correspondent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwatts\" title=\"\">Jonathan Watts</a> travelled through Venezuela to discover how that country is coping with an economic implosion that\u2019s unstitching society. Supermarket shelves sit unstocked, medicines are in short supply and the once-proud bolivar now fails to function as a proper currency (sort of like sterling, but more on that later...). It\u2019s a very good piece indeed.</p> <p>Inside the paper, we report on rebel-held Aleppo\u2019s spiral of despair, the latest debate in the US presidential race, Hurricane Matthew\u2019s impact on Haiti, and the state of the free press in Russia (hint: it\u2019s not great).</p> <p>Our UK coverage takes in the flash crash that stunned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling\" title=\"\">sterling </a>last week, as the pound lost more than 8% of its value in a mere eight minutes, likely because of the government\u2019s tough position on Brexit. From the political side of things, the prime minister, Theresa May, has positioned herself as an agent of change in efforts to give the Conservative party a populist spin. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, consolidated his grip on the party with a reshuffle of his shadow cabinet roles.</p> <p>Our Comment section is rock solid. In Britain\u2019s post-referendum reality, columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\" title=\"\">Jonathan Freedland </a>bemoans the absence of strong political representation for the 48% who voted to remain within the European Union. And rightly so. Opinion-maker Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de looks for the anger over Aleppo, and we consider the impact of US-Russia discord. On a more upbeat note, our writers hail the ratification of the Paris climate accord and laud the awarding of the Nobel prize for peace.</p> <p>There are some wonderful people pieces elsewhere in the paper. We profile an adventurer who is searching doggedly for the truth about flight MH370. On the Discovery pages, we find 97-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/james-lovelock\" title=\"\">James Lovelock</a>, the father of the Gaia hypothesis, on very good form indeed. And endeavouring to offer something for everyone, our Books pages review Bruce Springsteen\u2019s autobiography. Who could resist notes from inside the Boss\u2019s mind?</p> <p>I find myself amazed every week, once the edition is completed, by the depth and range of the Weekly\u2019s coverage.

  "<p>A partnership worth $10m (\u00a38.1m) to increase the uptake and awareness of a vaccine to protect girls from cervical cancer, which has higher death rates in sub-Saharan Africa than any other cancer, was launched on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gavi.org/\">Gavi, the vaccine alliance</a>, announced it is joining forces with the <a href=\"http://www.girleffect.org/\">Girl Effect</a> to increase the demand for the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/hpv/en/\">human papillomavirus</a> (HPV) vaccine in Rwanda, Ethiopia and Malawi.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/oct/11/a-girls-life-how-inequality-starts-before-birth-video-international-day-of-the-girl\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56pbh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793842\"            data-video-name=\"A girl's life: how inequality starts before birth \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fba666e4b05d11acf9ea89\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010GirlsHurdles_KP-29667882_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010GirlsHurdles_KP-29667882.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010GirlsHurdles_KP-29667882_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/oct/11/a-girls-life-how-inequality-starts-before-birth-video-international-day-of-the-girl\">A girl\u2019s life: how inequality starts before birth</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The partnership, launched to mark International Day of the Girl, will challenge the myths and misconceptions about the vaccine. The fact that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact had raised concerns that <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/hpv-vaccination-concerns-about-promiscuity-deemed-unwarranted-1.2864264\">the vaccine would encourage promiscuity</a>.</p> <p>While Gavi will ensure the vaccine is available in each country, the Girl Effect will use its networks to promote the vaccine to girls and their families via social media, radio shows, magazines, drama and mobile apps.</p> <p>The HPV vaccine protects girls against 70% of incidences of cervical cancer, which claims the lives of <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/cervix-new.asp\">an estimated 266,000 women and girls</a> a year, about 85% in poorer countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America have the highest incidences. Left unchallenged, there are fears that by 2035 the number of deaths <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/burden.asp?selection_pop=224900&amp;Text-p=World&amp;selection_cancer=4162&amp;Text-c=Cervix+uteri&amp;pYear=23&amp;type=1&amp;window=1&amp;submit=%C2%A0Execute\">could rise to 416,000</a>, more than 95% of those in developing countries, which would make cervical cancer a bigger killer of women than childbirth.</p> <p>\u201cCervical cancer is a scourge that kills women in the prime of their lives, depriving families of mothers, aunts, grandmothers and wives,\u201d said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi. \u201cThe HPV vaccine is a vital tool in the battle against cervical cancer, especially in countries where lack of access to screening and treatment is a major issue. Our partnership with Girl Effect is an opportunity to bring this vaccine to the attention of girls who are at risk of missing out on its lifesaving impact.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody in sub-Saharan Africa will know people who have died of cervical cancer. They don\u2019t die late in life, but at their peak.\u201d He said diagnosis often comes at the end stage \u201cwhere virtually nothing can be done\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/11/us-united-states-ranks-lower-than-kazakhstan-algeria-gender-equality-international-day-of-the-girl\">US ranks lower than Kazakhstan and Algeria on gender equality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farah Ramzan Golant, CEO of the Girl Effect, said: \u201cIn this unusual partnership with Gavi, we\u2019re pioneering an integrated approach to tackle a complex development issue. Gavi will ensure life-saving vaccines are available, while Girl Effect will use the power of our brands, drawing from popular culture and harnessing new technology, to drive behaviour change at scale, to ensure girls are informed and empowered to actively take up these vaccines.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to create a \u2018new normal\u2019 for girls, where they\u2019re visible and vocal participants in society and actively supported by their communities \u2013 a world where they have the information and inspiration they need to seek out the services they need and deserve.\u201d</p> <p>National rollouts of the HPV vaccine have already been launched in Rwanda, Uganda and Honduras, while immunisation programmes have been set up in other countries, including Kenya. Malawi, one of the target countries in the partnership, has one of the highest mortality rates from cervical cancer in the world. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f97cca85037673265894311e1c34aa1bfd4aad34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f97cca85037673265894311e1c34aa1bfd4aad34/0_0_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurse Helen Angula counsels patients ahead of a cervical cancer screening at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Mbale, eastern Uganda.

In Rwanda, <a href=\"http://www.girleffect.org/what-we-do/ni-nyampinga/\">Ni Nyampinga</a> (which means \u201cbeautiful girl inside and out who makes good decisions\u201d in Kinyarwanda) is an educational platform offering advice on sexual health and showcasing role models for girls. About 500,000 girls have read its magazine or listened to its radio shows. Messages about HPV will feature on the platform.</p> <p>If the partnership proves successful in the three initial countries, Gavi and Girl Effect want to use the lessons learned to promote the vaccine in others.

  "<p>When Raj Khaira\u2019s brother was born, ladoos, a popular celebratory Indian sweet, were sprinkled among the community like confetti. When her sister came along, the extended family cried.</p> <p>Which is why Khaira, now a lawyer, launched the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pinkladoo\">Pink Ladoo project</a> a year ago to mark the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/girl-child\">International Day of the Girl Child</a>. This year she brought it to London and locations in Canada as well.</p> <p>The idea is simple: hand out pink ladoos when a daughter is born as a counterpoint to the golden sweets distributed at the birth of a son.</p> <p>\u201cThe pink ladoo is a symbol of protest against gender bias, one that you can make sense of immediately,\u201d says Khaira. \u201cThe birth announcement is the first tradition to be skewed towards the male child, and the pink ladoos hope to change that.</p> <p>\u201cDiaspora communities tend to hold on to customs stubbornly, and we want them to analyse the gender bias in them. The response to the campaign both offline and on social media has been phenomenal. </p> <p>\u201cMost interestingly, the staff at the hospitals have given us great feedback, saying the disappointment of bearing a daughter is a larger issue than most people realise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55e2c58dbe978844615e492935448683337ccd84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55e2c58dbe978844615e492935448683337ccd84/0_0_3674_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A billboard in New Delhi encouraging the birth of girls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl and a woman walk past a billboard in New Delhi encouraging the birth of girls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raveendran/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The preference for boys in India starts before birth: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/09/india-missing-girls-rising-levels-foeticide\">tens of thousands of girls are thought to be aborted each year</a>, resulting in a wildly distorted gender ratio. India\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/prov_data_products_haryana.html\">most recent census</a> found there were 940 girls born for every 1,000 boys. The skew is worst in Haryana, a rural, northern state bordering Delhi, where just 830 girls are born for every 1,000 boys. <br></p> <p>The gloom surrounding the birth of girls prompted Navi Brar, a 24-year-old nurse from Alberta in Canada, to get involved with Khaira\u2019s campaign. \u201cI always found myself being the one person speaking up to family members for making any parent feel remorse for having a baby girl,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt this campaign allowed me to stand up for gender equality, and reach a bigger audience.\u201d</p> <p>She says such a campaign is more relevant than ever because of the significant strides south Asian women have made, and continue to make \u2013 despite girls in the community still being viewed as less important than their male counterparts. </p> <p>\u201cThis cultural preference for males goes far past birth and continues to follow girls throughout their lifetime. I think this campaign is challenging south Asians, men and women, to stand up and provoke change in the traditional mentality and create a new normal of celebrating both boys and girls.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a375da2aaf5520e3e18ffacc652efdb3c70d4b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a375da2aaf5520e3e18ffacc652efdb3c70d4b6/764_336_1738_1738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pink Ladoo project logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pink Ladoo project runs social media campaigns throughout the year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Pink Ladoo campaign</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project is not a once-a-yearevent. Throughout other months the group runs social media campaigns, sharing stories of inspiring everyday women, posts from families who have celebrated their daughters with pink ladoos, and stories of the slights that mothers of girls have faced. A recent viral social media post told the powerful story of a bride whose mother gave her away at her wedding \u2013 a ritual traditionally reserved for men.</p> <p>The positive response to the post left the bride\u2019s mother, UK-based Jasbir Kaur, feeling vindicated. \u201cI knew it would be a big deal in my community but I never thought something so personal to my family would gain global reach; I was simply fulfilling my duty as a parent,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIn that moment and after, the feeling I had was a sense of achievement.Since I played the dual role of mother and father, I felt it was my absolute right to do this. </p> <p>\u201cThere is still a long way to go in changing people\u2019s mindsets over gender-based roles, but the Pink Ladoo project is a step in the right direction. They are questioning the unfairness, which was not easy for my generation to do.\u201d</p> <p>The best compliment, says Khaira, was when she called a UK sweet shop to ask them to participate and make pink ladoos \u2013 and found that they were already one of their best-selling sweets.</p>",
  "<p>All countries are being urged to consider introducing a sugary drinks tax by the World Health Organisation as an effective way of curbing the soaring obesity rate, especially in children.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s advice comes as more and more countries are considering fiscal measures to dissuade people from buying the large quantities of colas, lemonades and other sugary soft drinks that have been identified as a major cause of the global overweight and obesity crisis. </p> <p>It will strengthen the hand of campaigners in countries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/03/obese-soda-sugar-tax-mexico\">Colombia</a>, where the drinks industry has succeeded in having an anti-sugar broadcast banned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/fiscal-policies-diet-prevention/en/\">A report from the WHO</a> says that a tax of 20% or more results in a drop in sales and consumption of sugary drinks. People consume fewer \u201cfree sugars\u201d such as fructose and glucose, take in fewer calories and reduce their risk of tooth decay. </p> <p>\u201cConsumption of free sugars, including products like sugary drinks, is a major factor in the global increase of people suffering from obesity and diabetes,\u201d said Dr Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO\u2019s department for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. </p> <p>\u201cIf governments tax products like sugary drinks, they can reduce suffering and save lives. They can also cut healthcare costs and increase revenues to invest in health services.\u201d<br></p> <p>The WHO has already published nutritional advice saying nobody actually needs sugar in their diet. Its guidance says we should restrict our intake of free sugars to a maximum of 10% of our energy needs, preferably 5%. The UK government\u2019s scientific advisory committee on nutrition and health echoed that advice, which led to the decision to introduce a sugary drinks tax in the UK, although not until 2018. Other countries, including the Philippines and South Africa, are now looking at introducing similar measures.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s 10% tax on sugary drinks appears to have successfully reduced sales and consumption. The government is being urged by campaigners to double the tax. </p> <p>The WHO says a tax has most impact on the young, those on low incomes and others who consume a lot of sugary drinks and will have the greatest positive effect on the health of those groups.</p> <p>Other fiscal measures that work include subsidising fresh fruit and vegetable prices by 10-30%, it says. Taxing food and other drinks that are high in saturated fats, trans fats, free sugars and salt \u201cappears promising\u201d, it adds, because there is evidence that higher prices reduce consumption.</p> <p>Battle lines are being drawn in Colombia, where a consumer movement is pressing the case for a sugary drinks tax and the industry is fighting back. Sales of sugary drinks have been increasing faster in Colombia, where half the adult population and 17% of children are overweight or obese, than any other Latin American country.</p> <p>Last month, the Asociaci\u00f3n Educar Consumidores \u2013 the consumer organisation which, like its Mexican equivalent, has backing from Bloomberg Philanthropies in the US \u2013 produced an educational video to be broadcast on television, warning that drinking too many sugary drinks can lead to diabetes and other diseases. </p> <p>But after a complaint from Postob\u00f3n, the Colombian beverage giant, the government\u2019s regulatory agency charged with consumer protection banned any showing of the video on TV, saying it was inaccurate and could confuse the public.</p> <p>Senior health experts in the US have joined the fray, supporting a tax in Colombia. Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Walter Willett, of the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and others have written to the Colombian ministry of health about the dangers of sugar consumption and the effectiveness of taxation.</p> <p>Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and now the WHO\u2019s global ambassador for non-communicable diseases, said: \u201cObesity is a major contributor to diabetes, heart disease and other preventable health problems that kill millions of people every year \u2013 and the problem is getting worse, particularly among children and in developing countries. Smart policies can help turn the tides on this deadly epidemic, especially those aimed at reducing consumption of sugary drinks, which are fuelling obesity rates.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of cities and countries \u2013 including Mexico \u2013 are showing that taxes on sugary drinks are effective at driving down consumption. The World Health Organisation report released today can help these effective policies spread to more places around the world, and that will help save many lives.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When asked by Ellen DeGeneres what her spirit animal is, Hillary Clinton had a surprising answer: the elephant. </p> <p>Although the symbol of the GOP, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWAJQEuYbTA\">spoke</a> on the Ellen DeGeneres Show this May with rare passion about the need to protect real elephants from a poaching crisis that has killed at least 110,000 of them over the past decade, pushing the world\u2019s largest land animals \u2013 especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jul/23/forest-elephants-evidence-science-species-ivory-crisis\">forest elephants</a> \u2013 closer to extinction. </p> <p>\u201cI love the way\u2026the matriarch of the family looks for everybody, I just have such a sense of connection to elephants and it just breaks my heart that they are being poached and murdered and babies being left to fend for themselves,\u201d Clinton said on a portion of the show that only aired on Facebook. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s affinity for elephants is not widely known or reported. But during her tenure as Secretary of State in the Obama Administration, she helped bring the issue of global wildlife trafficking out of obscurity. <br></p> <p>\u201cInternational criminal syndicates are orchestrating the slaughter of many of the world\u2019s iconic wildlife species and profiteering by marketing ivory, rhinoceros horn, and other wildlife parts in the U.S., Asia, and Europe,\u201d said Jorge Silva, a spokesperson for the Clinton Campaign. \u201cMany of the criminal syndicates have ties with, and are helping to fund, terrorist groups around the world, and also are engaged in human, drug, and arms trafficking.\u201d <br></p> <p>Experts believe that groups like the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, Al-Shabaab and even ISIS may be in part <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2015/aug/30/case-proven-ivory-trafficking-funds-terrorism\">funded</a> by the illicit sale of ivory and other wildlife parts. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s personal love for elephants springs out of a trip to Tanzania in 1997 as first lady. Her daughter, Chelsea, accompanied her, and since then mother and daughter have shared a passion for pachyderms. During the period, Bill Clinton\u2019s administration opposed any opening of the ivory trade. Despite this, Cites began approving one-off trades in elephant ivory in 1999, 2002 and 2008. Experts have linked the current poaching crisis to the approval of these trades, especially the last one.</p> <p>Clinton has also worked to combat elephant poaching through the family\u2019s foundation. In 2013, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton brought together various conservation groups to partner on a new $80 million programme to fight elephant poaching through the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI).</p> <p>Silva said that if elected president Clinton would amp up the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. </p> <p>\u201c[She will] forge partnerships with the private sector and non-profit community to shut down the U.S. market for illegal wildlife products; deploy U.S. intelligence and enforcement assets to catch and imprison the kingpins that are controlling this multi-billion dollar criminal enterprise; raise the legal penalties for illegal wildlife traffickers; and impose trade sanctions when appropriate on nations that fail to crack down on the illegal killing and marketing of wildlife and wildlife products.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/jul/23/forest-elephants-evidence-science-species-ivory-crisis\">Scientists: we are 'condemning' forest elephants by ignoring evidence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such a global crackdown may be necessary to save the world\u2019s largest land animals from extinction. This year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">the Great Elephant Census </a>\u2013 a thorough, groundbreaking survey across 18 countries \u2013 found that populations of savanna elephants have fallen by 30% in just seven years. The news was even worse than many conservationists feared. But the situation is even more dire for forest elephants. <br></p> <p>Inhabiting the thick jungles of Central and West Africa, forest elephants are more difficult to survey. But last year, scientists estimated that 65% of forest elephant have been slaughtered for their ivory since 2003. A number of recent studies have also argued that forest elephants are indeed a distinct species based on genetic, physical and behavioral differences. </p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to repeated requests for its position on elephant conservation or the global wildlife trade, but its website mentions neither. This is not surprising given the website lists very few positions regarding any environmental issues, including making no mention of climate change \u2013 although Donald Trump has claimed that climate change was a hoax invented by the Chinese. <br></p> <p>In 2012, media leaked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">photos</a> of Donald Trump\u2019s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, taken during a big game hunt safari in Zimbabwe. In one image, Donald Trump Jr. stands next to an elephant he shot to death and holds up its severed tail. Cutting off an elephant\u2019s tail is traditional in some African cultures where the hair is made into a bracelet. </p> <p>A longtime trophy hunter, Donald Trump Jr. has stated that he would be interested in working in the Department of the Interior if his father is elected president. </p> <p>\u201cThe way our society treats animals is a reflection of our humanity,\u201d reads the Clinton campaign website. If elected president, Clinton also promises further action on wildlife and animal rights issues such as combating the overuse of antibiotics in farm animals, eliminating the consumption of horses and toughening regulations on puppy mills. <br></p>",

But Namibia and Sri Lanka stood out for having the lowest percentage reductions since 2000.<br></p> <p>The speed of improvement in eradicating hunger is desperately slow, say the authors. If hunger declines at the same rate as it has since 1992, more than 45 countries will still have \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201calarming\u201d levels in 2030. The 2030 agenda for sustainable development <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/advertisement-features/2015/sep/25/vision-to-end-hunger-captured-among-new-global-goals\">has a goal of zero hunger</a> for all by 2030.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-11T12:34:31/embed.html\" data-alt=\"reduction\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-11T12:34:31/embed.html\">reduction</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe MDG target of halving the percentage of the population experiencing chronic hunger was met by 73 of 129 countries, and the number of the chronically hungry has fallen by 210 million. However, almost 800 million people still do not have enough food to eat to lead healthy and fulfilling lives,\u201d says the report.</p> <p>In terms of the major regions of the developing world, sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia have the highest 2016 GHI scores, at 30.1 and 29.0 respectively.<br></p> <p>Data on the indicators comes from the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the UN\u2019s children\u2019s charity, Unicef, and IFPRI estimates.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost of hunger is measured not only in lost lives but also in unrealised potential for individuals,\u201d say the report\u2019s authors. \u201cIt affects the ability of communities, countries and regions to meet their own social development goals, and it stunts their economic prosperity. How we choose to grow, process, distribute and consume the food we eat will have a profound effect on people, planet, prosperity and peace.\u201d</p> <p>Rose Caldwell, director of Concern Worldwide UK, said: \u201cThe world has made progress in the fight against hunger but it has so far been too slow; we won\u2019t reach the globally agreed target of zero hunger by 2030 if we carry on at the same rate. Hunger continues to waste lives and limit potential \u2013 we need urgent action from the global community to wipe it out for good.\u201d<br></p> <p>Declines in average hunger levels across regions or individual countries do not tell the whole story. Even within regions and countries that have broadly reduced hunger to low levels, lagging areas are leaving millions still hungry, and demonstrate the need to target solutions to communities facing the greatest need. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJhpOYydDPAhXFrxoKHdGvC9sQFggfMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.concern.net%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fmedia%2Fresource%2Fglobal_hunger_index_2015_-_full_report.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqLLPXOjaJn0bmLc_Yu6G6eEEkOg&amp;bvm=bv.135258522,d.d2s&amp;cad=rja\">Haiti, for example, has the fourth highest GHI score at an \u201calarming\u201d 36.9</a>, despite the Latin America region having the lowest regional GHI score in the developing world. Mexico has a low level of overall hunger, but also has areas where child stunting \u2013 an indicator of child undernutrition \u2013 is relatively high.</p> <p>The 2030 agenda set a clear global objective for an end to hunger \u2013 everywhere \u2013 within the next 14 years, said David Nabarro, special adviser to the UN secretary general on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and climate change. \u201cToo many people are hungry today.

  "<h2><strong>What to do about Syria</strong><br></h2> <p>The agony in Syria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/syria-obama-us-president-putin-russia\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a> is more complicated than comments on recent US-Russian negotiations suggest. The Obama government has also had to consider the conflicting interests of Turkey, the Kurds, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and Israel.</p> <p>Turkey, a Nato ally, views the Kurds as a greater threat than the Assad government in Syria. The failed coup in Turkey has only exacerbated President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s crackdown on Kurds in Turkey. The US has agreed with Turkey to give military support to Syrian Kurds as long as they stayed east of the Euphrates.</p> <p>The US is also giving air and ground support to the Iraqi Peshmerga, Iraqi troops and Shia militias, in the buildup to retake Mosul from Sunni Islamic State. At the same time, this presents a threat to the unstable Mosul dam, which, if breached, could kill millions downstream.</p> <p>The successful US nuclear negotiations with Iran have led the US to reluctantly support the Saudi government in its war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Shia Iran is waging a proxy war against a range of Sunni opponents, including Isis and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front), using the Alawite Assad regime and the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah, which Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard have armed.</p> <p>In view of these shifting alliances, it has been prudent of President Obama to consult carefully with his military and diplomatic staff before committing to further Middle East adventures. It is easy to forget that he was elected in 2008 by voters weary of protracted foreign wars.<br><strong>Linda Agerbak</strong><br>Arlington, Massachusetts, US</p> <p>\u2022 Almost every week Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the cold war. Those were the days: one side 100% good, the other 100% bad. Just replace \u201cCommunist\u201d with \u201cRussian\u201d and her columns take me back to the sweet days of youth.</p> <p>Naturally, a black-and-white view of the world requires a short memory. So the fragmentation of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines advanced democracy and was good; the same process in Ukraine is a Russian conspiracy and is bad.</p> <p>Her latest war-horse is Syria \u2013 a tragedy, for which all sides share responsibility. Nougayr\u00e8de\u2019s proposed solution? A \u201ctougher approach to Russia\u2019s intervention\u201d. How? As an example, she quotes approvingly the \u201ctargeted strikes on Serbian forces\u201d that in her opinion helped solve the Yugoslavian crisis. But there are no Russian ground forces in Syria, and if I remember correctly Nato bombed Belgrade as well. So is she saying that the west should bomb Moscow? If only the US president\u2019s \u201creluctance to do more\u201d could be overcome.<br><strong>Giorgio Ranalli</strong><br>Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Please take our toys away </strong><br></h2> <p>George Monbiot is right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/roads-car-use-health-driving\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a> \u2013 the solution to carmageddon is fewer, and electric, cars. But there\u2019s a huge problem here. Electric vehicles will be major indirect polluters and contributors to climate change until the energy they use comes from renewable resources.</p> <p>Most electricity and nearly all hydrogen still come from fossil fuels. A battery-electric vehicle doesn\u2019t avoid the pollution from electricity production \u2013 it is released at the power station rather than on the motorway. Even worse, more battery-electric cars will increase the demand for electricity from a grid that already can\u2019t cope. Likewise, a fuel-cell-electric vehicle running on hydrogen only produces water, but the associated pollution is released at the hydrogen production plant.</p> <p>Solutions that ignore the connected nature of the problem never work. Yes, we must have electric vehicles, but hand-in-hand we must have sustainably produced electricity and hydrogen to power them.<br><strong>Evan Gray</strong><br>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/extinction-let-others-kill-albatross-gorilla-whale-shark-conumerism\" title=\"\">(23 September)</a> has written starkly about to what all the species of the world are heir: the age of the Earth inhabited by humankind. By focusing on contemporary consumerism in which we all are involved to one degree or another, his words remind of how civilisations are dredging everything and everywhere: lands, forests, lakes and rivers, the sky. Even our human species is affected by the degradation of what he calls \u201cuncontrolled consumerism\u201d.</p> <p>With respect to all animals, fishes, birds, plants and the smaller living things of the Earth: so much has sickened. Disappeared. Died. While so many do work on behalf of other species, we humans do not seem to have the nerve for doing what is required to show mercy toward them.</p> <p>We do not grieve enough. Mourn. And as Monbiot suggests, let each of us learn how to better live lightly.<br><strong>Vivian Darroch-Lozowski</strong><br>Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 Gutting a chicken is not enough: people who eat chicken should be prepared to kill it too. Monbiot also forgot to mention bees: some farmers are guilty, even if they don\u2019t kill bees directly; they spray their crops with chemicals that do the job nicely. Don\u2019t our poor bees have enough on their plate, being gobbled up by Asian hornets, without those who manage to get through being exterminated by lethal chemicals? No bees, no pollination. No pollination, no crops.<br><strong>Lea Yauner</strong><br>Pessac, France</p> <p>\u2022 I read both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/21/farewell-to-ice-peter-wadhams-review-climate-change\" title=\"\">Horatio Clare</a>\u2019s review of Peter Wadham\u2019s A Farewell to Ice and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/oceans-heating-big-problem-blue-planet-iucn-report\" title=\"\">Bill McKibben</a>\u2019s opinion on ocean warming (16 September) and both these pieces struck a chord with me.

This is not unusual as many reports emphasise cosy, visible measures (eg wind and solar) but soft-pedal on any thoughts that our consumer excesses should be reined in.</p> <p>Surely we have gone beyond this and we need to give governments a mandate to \u201ctake our toys away\u201d with strong legislation against individual, private transport and cheap air-travel; against excessive trucking, excessive packaging and temperature-controlled retail palaces; and against market structures that encourage indulgent consumption.</p> <p>Only when we have recognised these connections and taken appropriate action do we stand any chance of preventing the coming \u201cmeltdown\u201d.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <h2><strong>The problem with anger</strong><br></h2> <p>Oliver Burkeman\u2019s analysis of anger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/09/anger-does-it-need-managing\" title=\"\">(30&#xa0;September)</a> fails to draw a crucial distinction: the difference between the feeling of anger, or any of our feelings, and the freely chosen expression of the feeling.</p> <p>Feeling, experiencing and accepting our anger is an essential prerequisite to a free decision about what, if anything, to do with it. In the case of genuine self-defence, physical retaliation may be the correct response. A civil, verbal assertion of our disagreement may be a proper response to an abusive attack. Screaming and yelling and retaliation will never be appropriate.</p> <p>If we do not first recognise and accept our feelings, including anger, but sweep them under the carpet, they will inevitably break out in ways that are inappropriate.<br><strong>Greg McCarry</strong><br>Sydney, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Oliver Burkeman\u2019s thought-provoking column on the downside of anger reminded me of a quote by Mark Twain, which I saved as a reminder that \u201cAnger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.\u201d<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Decline of hitchhiking</strong></h2> <p>As someone who hitchhiked through New Zealand in the 60s with a friend, I mourn the decline of hitchhiking as does Anne Perkins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/death-of-hitchhiking-modern-tragedy-frenchman-new-zealand\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a>.

  "<p>Samsung has confirmed that it is permanently stopping production of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after it was involved in dozens of fires and explosions worldwide.</p> <p>In a regulatory filing in South Korea late on Tuesday, the firm said it had made the decision to stop production, for the sake of consumer safety.</p> <p>A day earlier Samsung said it was \u201cadjusting production\u201d, an admission that many saw as the first steps towards killing the phone entirely.</p> <p>It said in a statement: \u201cPutting consumer safety as the top priority, we have reached a final decision to halt production of Galaxy Note 7s.\u201d A spokesperson confirmed that the suspension was \u201cpermanent\u201d.</p> <p>The move comes after the flagship smartphone, which the company hoped would put it give it an advantage over iPhone-maker Apple, was plagued by batteries catching fire and exploding. Attempts to rectify the problem by recalling a replacing faulty batches were undermined when replacement phones also started malfunctioning. </p> <p>Samsung said customers will be able to apply for a full refund or to swap their Note 7s for other Samsung products. It also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/samsung-suspends-sales-galaxy-note-7-phone-warns-turn-it-off\">advised all customers with an original or replacement Galaxy Note 7</a> to \u201cpower down and stop using the device\u201d immediately.</p> <p>In discontinuing the phone, Samsung follows the advice of many analysts who saw it as a lost cause, and who argued that the company\u2019s priority should be protecting the rest of its brand. </p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s once, it could be taken as a mistake. But for Samsung, the same thing happened twice with the same model so there\u2019s going to be a considerable loss of consumer faith,\u201d said Greg Roh at HMC Investment Securities.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason consumers prefer brands like Samsung and Apple is because of product reliability \u2026 so in this case brand damage is inevitable and it will be costly for Samsung to turn that around again,\u201d Roh said.</p> <p>The company will struggle to keep premium customers from switching to other manufacturers such as Google, which released its own Pixel XL phone this month as a direct competitor to the Note 7. Edison Investment Research said: \u201cAs a result of making a complete mess of the Galaxy Note 7 recall, Samsung is more likely to lose a large number of high end users to other Android handsets rather than to Apple.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Windsor, an analyst with Edison, added: \u201cAs long as Samsung carried out the recall smoothly and kept users very happy, the issue would eventually blow over. Unfortunately, this is very far from the case and the fact that Samsung appeared to still be shipping defective devices could trigger a large loss of faith in Samsung products. </p> <p>\u201cIt also ensures that when there are problems with its other products they will be brought into laser focus by the media. The net result is that Galaxy Note 7 owners are now likely to end up with devices from other manufacturers.\u201d</p> <p>The phone initially launched to rave reviews, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review-the-king-of-the-phablets-returns\">critics praising</a> its waterproofing, curved screen, high-quality cameras and fast charging. It appeared to be a success for Samsung, which had deliberately pursued a strategy of rapid innovation <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-18/samsung-crisis-began-in-rush-to-capitalize-on-uninspiring-iphone\">to capitalise</a> on the expected release of the \u201cdull\u201d iPhone 7.</p> <p>But shortly after its release on 19 August, reports began to surface of fully charged Note 7 phones smouldering, catching fire, and even exploding. The company announced that it was <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-18/samsung-crisis-began-in-rush-to-capitalize-on-uninspiring-iphone\">suspending sales</a> of the phone on 2 September, which prevented most devices hitting Europe \u2013 a secondary market for phablet-sized phones after the US and Asia. It also offered a voluntary replacement programme for users with affected Note 7s, which it estimated covered 70% of the phones it had produced. </p> <p>That \u201cvoluntary replacement programme\u201d led to a rap on the knuckles from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/samsung-galaxy-note-7-official-recall-us-watchdog-consumer-reports\">the US consumer watchdog</a> on 9 September, which argued that Samsung should instead have issued an official recall \u2013 which it started a few days later. The company might have hoped this would be the end of the matter, but replacement devices began to exhibit the same problems. </p> <p>On 1 October, Samsung resumed sales of the phone in South Korea and replacements were continuing in the US. Five days later came a report of a replacement Note 7 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/05/replacement-samsung-note-7-smartphone-battery-flight\">starting to smoulder on a US flight</a>. </p> <p>By the time Samsung announced a hiatus to production there were eight reported cases of supposedly safe replacement Note 7s catching fire.</p> <p>According to the Associated Press, South Korea\u2019s safety agency is still investigating why the replacement phones have been exploding, and an official said the replacement phones may have a different defect to the problem with the original Note 7s.</p> <p>Neil Campling, Head of Global TMT Research for Northern Trust Capital Markets, estimated the total financial cost of the affair as potentially higher than $2bn, but added that the reputational damage could be greater still. </p> <p>The affair has not been as damaging for Samsung\u2019s stock price as might have been expected, however. The company\u2019s shares hit a low in mid-September, after news of the recall broke, but proceeded to rally to an all-time high in early October. </p> <p>After confirmation of multiple faulty replacement devices came in over the weekend, however, the stock has dropped almost 10% in the past two days, to 1,554,000 won. The news of halted production came too late to be reflected in Tuesday\u2019s trading in South Korea.<br></p> <p>Karissa Chua, an analyst with Euromonitor International, said: \u201cThis setback will cast doubts on whether Samsung can sustain its stellar results in its mobile business over the next two to three quarters. In terms of financial losses due to the product recall, it will be greater in the US where Samsung is also plagued with potential lawsuits in the US and claims over damage to property and medical bills.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest challenge for Samsung would be to prevent the consumer and investor fallout from worsening,\u201d Chua added. \u201cThe fact that its premium Note 7 smartphone is labelled a safety hazard is damaging to Samsung Corp and its affiliate Samsung SDI\u2019s reputation. It could also have repercussions on consumers\u2019 overall confidence in Samsung smartphones if the company does not take steps to assuage consumers\u2019 concerns over its devices, particularly with the new Note 7 replacements.\u201d</p>",

As a Latin woman in science, I am interested in understanding the how these issues operate, how they manifest themselves on women of colour, and what the particular issues are in relation to palaeontology, my field of research. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/oct/11/promoting-equality-in-science-what-works-and-what-doesnt\">Promoting equality in science: what works, and what doesn't?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I consider myself lucky to have never faced \u201cserious\u201d gender-related issues, as all my male advisors/mentors/hosts have been amazingly supportive, and never made me feel less (or more) because I am a (Latin) woman. On the contrary, they constantly empowered me and provided me with the tools to build confidence to overcome other minor gender-related issues I have encountered during my career. </p> <p>These minor issues have been a handful of isolated cases of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining\">mansplaining</a> and sexist/racist attitudes from some colleagues. I admit that I find it hard to assess whether these cases have reflected their position on women\u2019s roles, or if they are trying to be funny. As a Colombian, I have learned to live with the common <a href=\"http://colombiareports.com/colombia-the-drug-consumer/\">uninformed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/23/colombia-farc-killed-mothers-justice\">insensitive</a> jokes about cocaine and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nickbrownxo/stereotypes-of-colombia-in-netflix-narcos-b29f7cbb48d3#.clms9vtx5\">Pablo Escobar</a>. I have developed a sort of flexible and understanding attitude towards sexist/racist comments, along the lines of: \u201cwow, that comment kind of hurts, but I know he is a good guy and didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way\u201d. However, I wonder to what extent such comments and attitudes are part of a bigger problem, in which case they shouldn\u2019t be ignored. </p> <p>In my search for a better understanding on how women\u2019s issues operate in my field, I found two explanations for the leaky pipeline, both rooted in complex biological and societal issues. One is that, in general, publication rates are <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534712002753\">lower</a> in women than men. Since number of publication is a metric for employment, this results in a systematic bias against women, because such a metric is not equitable. The second explanation I found is based on <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360\">experimental </a>evidence, and shows a 2:1<a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/women-preferred-21-over-men-stem-faculty-positions\">preference</a> in favour of women for tenure track positions, and that women\u2019s underrepresentation is actually a result of fewer women applying for jobs.</p> <p>In terms of the situation for women of colour, I found that <a href=\"http://www.uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/01/double-jeopardy-report.pdf\">gender bias</a> acts differently depending on a woman\u2019s race. For <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/the-5-biases-pushing-women-out-of-stem\">example</a>, black women are more likely to deal with the constant requirement to prove themselves capable, Asian women have to deal with the stereotype of being the smartest one in the lab, and Latin women are more at risk of being seen as angry when expressing themselves in the workplace. This problem is reflected in the representation of women of colour in science: <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-sciences#footnote11_j1n3mnw\">only 3% of professorships in the US are given to women of colour</a>. Indeed, being a minority within a minority adds another layer of complexity to the gender-bias problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488b768ad577dc045a4694c671e4cc32e18e03f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488b768ad577dc045a4694c671e4cc32e18e03f6/0_0_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Catalina Pimiento collecting fossil shark teeth in the field.

First, I searched for the top 10 most cited papers in palaeontology journals to assess what percentage were led by women; I looked for reports on women\u2019s representation in professional conferences; finally, I asked all the palaeo-women I know to tell me the biggest gender-related problem they have faced as palaeontologists.</p> <p>Here is what I found.</p> <h2>Papers </h2> <p>Only 10% of the most cited papers in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/most-cited\">Paleobiology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/most-cited\">Journal of Paleontology</a>, <a href=\"http://www.palass.org/publications/palaeontology-journal\">Paleontology</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/palaeogeography-palaeoclimatology-palaeoecology\">Paleo3</a>, were lead by a woman. No women led any of the 10 most cited papers in the <a href=\"http://vertpaleo.org/publications/journal-of-vertebrate-paleontology.aspx\">Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</a>.</p> <h2>Conferences </h2> <p>Reports show that female representation in paleontological associations are <a href=\"http://vertpaleo.org/Society-News/Blog/Old-Bones-SVP-s-Blog/March-2016/Historic-Conference-Quite-Possibly-the-First-All-W.aspx\">close to 50%</a> in terms of students members. However, professional memberships are disproportionally <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/02/13/need-more-paleontological-women/\">low</a> relative to those of men (leaky pipeline in action). With regards to <a href=\"http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/24/11/pdf/i1052-5173-24-11-44.pdf\">meeting</a> participation, even though the number of abstracts with female authors has increased in the last 40 years, women are still underrepresented (more \u201ccold hard numbers\u201d can be found on blog <a href=\"http://thebeardedladyproject.com/about/the-cold-hard-numbers/\">The Bearded Lady Project</a>).</p> <h2>Testimonies </h2> <p>Around 20 palaeo-women (ranging from undergrads to senior professors, from different parts of the world including the US, Europe, Latin America and Africa) responded to my survey with their personal experiences. According to their responses (a diverse selection is presented at the end of this article), it seems like women in palaeontology are often assumed incompetent until proven otherwise. I realise, however, this is an issue not exclusively associated with being a palaeontologist. </p> <p>Fieldwork-related problems were commonly mentioned and range from attempts to police outfits (although this happens in labs/offices as well), to being ignored (or, as <a href=\"https://muellerlaboratory.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/sara-varela/\">one</a> of my friends puts it: having the super-power of being invisible) or patronised by their coworkers. Even when fieldwork-related issues are not exclusively linked to palaeo, the term <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Issues-Palaeobiology-Global-Interviews-Essays/dp/3905923173\">palaeontology</a> is often associated with macho behaviour related to fossil collecting. This perceived need for machismo of course clashes with the <a href=\"http://thebeardedladyproject.com/trailers/\">wrong-headed</a> perception of feminine identities being weaker and not well-suited to the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/526\">harsh conditions</a> associated with fieldwork. </p> <p>As gender bias against women in palaeontology could also occur to a member of any other minority, I asked (admittedly, only a few) male palaeontologists who are members of a minority, whether or not they have ever felt any kind of bias against them. Based on the responses of five Hispanic and three gay palaeontologists, it seems like they don\u2019t feel any particular bias, and if they do, that typically occurs only at the beginning of their careers. However, gay palaeontologists mentioned they feel they need to be particularly careful when doing fieldwork in the remote sites of certain countries (e.g. Latin America or the Middle East). Further, a transgender palaeontologist commented on the restrictions relating to health care provision when looking for jobs. Since mobility is expected in academia, this imposes a major problem for transgender scientists in all disciplines.</p> <p>The reason we should care about the situation of women and minorities in palaeontology is not simply because of social justice.

However, the fact is that even though evidence suggests that women are preferred for academic jobs, women are still underrepresented, endure pressure over our appearances and face a battle to have our ideas recognised and be credited to us, not to mention experiencing constant mansplaining.

I always felt bad about it, and I knew that it was because he never thought my work was worth it. When my PhD research got published, he claimed I had scooped him. I think that instead, his sexist approach to meetings attendance proved to him inefficient.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>When I competed for an open postdoc position, a very good friend and colleague who also applied and did not get it, sourly told me that I only got offered the position because I am female. I got very frustrated at the remark, because I know, that by all the common benchmarks, (publications, citation, grants) I am a much better candidate than him.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>While doing my PhD, advisers and collaborators used the following phrases: \u201cyou can share the computer that is in the corridor\u201d; \u201cyou might become a good secretary\u201d; \u201cwhy don\u2019t you accept the technician position? It fits you!\u201d; \u201cbetter you don\u2019t try there, it is a good journal, you know?\u201d; \u201cI am sure that you did not realise it, but the idea you just said is great!\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>On my first time doing fieldwork, I was told to pack light, so I did: one sweatshirt, only the boots I was wearing, and no extras. The temperature went down dramatically in 12 hours and I had to borrow a sweatshirt from each of the three men there (who all had plenty of clothes) to not freeze. We had to wade a river, and I had to do it barefoot and slashed my foot. I had to wear my boots on the way back through and then had to borrow an extra pair of shoes from one of the guys. I learned that I was the only one who was told to pack light, and none of the students had ever been in the field, so it wasn\u2019t because I was a newbie, it was clearly because there\u2019s a female stereotype of overpacking.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>A student [who] worked for me was told that she dressed \u2018like a librarian rather than a scientist\u2019 because she would frequently wear dresses and heels. She was told (often by other women) that she should dress more seriously if she wants to be taken seriously.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I couldn\u2019t count how many times I have made a point in a group discussion that seems to fall flat initially but when repeated later by a male colleague, magically becomes worthy of serious consideration.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>On the first day at a SVP meeting, as I was entering, a man stopped and asked what the convention was for. I told him and he shook his head. He told me that I was the only black person that he had seen attending the convention that didn\u2019t work there. I am used to being the only black woman in the room, but it has never been pointed out before. I was very aware of it for the rest of the conference. I felt proud to be breaking that wall.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>When I apply for jobs I have to seriously consider how friendly the state and city are given the current political climate. Most places in the US explicitly don\u2019t cover transgender related health care, and even if we pay out of pocket most doctors do not know our needs. I\u2019ve not applied to jobs I wanted because they\u2019re in states without health care and they\u2019re in an area where I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable living.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I was asking a senior colleague with a permanent research position advertised at his institution what kind of person they were looking to hire (I was thinking along the lines of areas of research emphasis - e.g. taxonomic group, geological time period, types of research questions addressed etc.) only to be told that they were looking to hire a man because women couldn\u2019t handle fieldwork.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I happened to be two months pregnant during a field season and no colleague was aware of my condition. The fieldwork was successful but upon my return, I developed some medical complications that got me admitted [to hospital]. I got well and life was back to normal again. But after my boss learnt what happened, he always asks whether there [is] anybody pregnant before we depart for a field trip, and even asked me whether he should seek permission from my husband.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>While working on palaeontological mitigation, three different workers asked me out, and while they were all respectful I started to hear scary stories from other female colleagues, so I became more guarded. Even so, one somehow found my phone number and started calling me in the middle of the night and showing up at talks I gave with gifts. One even tried to kiss me when I showed him a fossil I\u2019d found. Because of this, my behaviour changed to the point where I didn\u2019t talk to people, didn\u2019t wear makeup, and stayed in worn, baggy clothes. I remember even considering wearing a fake wedding ring.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In a developing country, the main challenge I had while pursuing a graduate training and carrier in palaeontology was the lack of successful female role models in my country, who were born and raised in a similar cultural and educational background \u2026 simply, someone who I can easily relate to and look up to.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>The main body of this blog benefited from conversations with many palaeontologists, especially <a href=\"http://www.pim.uzh.ch/institut/mitarbeitende/index.php?show=34\">Marcelo S\u00e1nchez</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uwyo.edu/geolgeophys/faculty/ellen-currano.html\">Ellen Currano</a>, <a href=\"http://paleobiology.si.edu/staff/individuals/behrensmeyer.html\">Kay Behrensmeyer,</a> <a href=\"http://www.pim.uzh.ch/institut/mitarbeitende/index.php?show=996\">Kristof Veitschegger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaleoLagus\">April Carr</a>, although it should be noted that none of the testimonies above should be attributed to them.<br></li> </ul>",

Dance is the ultimate art of subtle non-verbal communication. And the non-verbal counts for more than we tend to allow. Professional dancers know this. Learn how to do exactly the right gesture in the perfect way at the right moment, and your message is subliminally strengthened.

Not as a politician locked in an argument, but as a partner unsure whether to wince or cheer.</p> <p>It helps Labour too, by giving the audience a glimpse of the party doing something other than fighting itself. But that help probably benefits most the wing of the party associated with Balls and Cooper. When Labour\u2019s public face these days is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell , Balls\u2019s Strictly run is a weekly reminder that Labour used to look very different.</p> <p>Usually New Labour jogs itself back into the memory with an intervention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-says-his-return-to-british-politics-is-an-open-question\">Tony Blair</a>, whose associations are \u2013 shall we say \u2013 not entirely positive in the public mind. But there is nothing contentious about the resurfacing of Ed Balls. He\u2019s a reminder that, in its heyday, New Labour was very good at presenting its leading figures as normal people, in touch with popular culture and the national mood. Indeed, the fact that Balls is still on the show \u2013 despite regularly scoring the lowest marks from the judges \u2013 is a weekly reminder of New Labour\u2019s greatest selling point: its uncanny knack of winning votes.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lyndseywinship\">Lyndsey Winship</a>: He is the Brexit of the Strictly world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26ed64c5febe0fb7d349227a15094dfd67a372a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26ed64c5febe0fb7d349227a15094dfd67a372a/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Lyndsey Winship\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dance is a powerful art form.

He went all out on a Mask-themed samba routine this week, green facepaint and banana-hued suit only adding to the rather camp and slightly terrifying effect.

Despite what the unfathomable success of Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage might suggest, I still don\u2019t think we want cartoon characters for leaders. But you could argue the voting public seems to be warming to people who remind them of their own imperfect selves.</p> <p>And there is something strangely compelling about watching Balls dance. This is not someone who has given up the fight. He really goes for it, with maximum gusto. And for all the graceless execution, he\u2019s mostly on top of the steps.

When Barack Obama came out for gay marriage in 2012 the first question on cable television was not \u201cWhat will this mean for gay people?\u201d but \u201cWhat will this mean for Obama\u2019s re-election prospects?\u201d</p> <p>This new, twice-weekly series marks my sixth presidential election as a journalist and, as someone who prefers the road to the couch and ordinary people to TV pundits, I\u2019ve always found it tough to cover the process in a way that both satisfies the reader\u2019s need for a steer on the big picture and my desire to try to shift the framing of our coverage away from the horse race. Readers of course want to know who is likely to be the next president, and what headline issues they should look out for but I\u2019m also interested in what the whole thing can tell us about how American society is evolving \u2013 particularly in an election as extraordinary as this, where a character as bizarre as Donald Trump and another as experienced as Hillary Clinton are candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa1ac6732555681a6745c0560aee4e4cab184868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1ac6732555681a6745c0560aee4e4cab184868/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge is reporting for a month from Muncie, Indiana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Younge is reporting for a month from Muncie, Indiana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/02/uselections2004.usa4\">I drove from John Kerry\u2019s hometown</a> in Boston to George W Bush\u2019s former hometown in Midland, Texas, stopping in swing states along the way. I can\u2019t vouch for what it was like to read, but I found it enthralling to write. I found myself at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/23/uselections2004.gayrights\">a drag show</a> in a small town in Missouri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/09/uselections2004.usa\">breaking bread with Christian fundamentalists</a> who\u2019d lost their son in Iraq in Pennsylvania, and watching the presidential debates with students in Iowa.</p> <p>In 2008 I went to Roanoke, Virginia \u2013 a swing town in a swing state with a sizeable enough African American population that I could gauge the excitement around the potential election of America\u2019s first black president. It was only by sticking around that I discovered that the town had a thriving arts scene that was politically engaged, or that the local courts set aside one whole day a week to deal with people with healthcare debts.</p> <p>This time I\u2019m going to Muncie, Indiana. Ahead of the election, I\u2019ll be publishing articles twice a week \u2013 on Tuesdays and Thursdays \u2013 about what I discover here, who I\u2019ve met, before writing an extended report after the vote. I chose Muncie, population 70,000, as my destination for two reasons. First of all it sits in Delaware County, <a href=\"http://www.delawarecountyelectionday.com/\">which voted for</a> both Donald Trump (53%) and Bernie Sanders (56%). In an election year when Americans appear to be enamored with neither of the nominees \u2013 Clinton has <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">a net favourability rating</a> of -11 while <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">Trump\u2019s is -20</a> \u2013 I\u2019m hoping that this trip will give some insight into what Americans appear to find alienating about their political establishment. I also want to ask: what is peculiarly American about this moment? How many similarities are there between here and Brexit Britain, or a France where the Front National is a serious contender for the presidency?</p> <p>Indiana is a reliable Republican state \u2013 though Obama did win it in 2008 \u2013 but Delaware is a swing county. Both <a href=\"http://dcelectionday.com/20082General/Html/DelawareElecSumm.htm\">Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2000&amp;fips=18035&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">George W Bush</a> won it twice. Once <a href=\"http://dcelectionday.com/20122General/Html/DelawareElecSumm.htm\">narrowly</a> and once with <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/statesub.php?year=2004&amp;fips=18035&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">double figures</a>. But I\u2019m also heading to Muncie because it has an iconic place in American social science as the subject of major sociological case study in the 1920s called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aRFcRFNUNQ\">Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/video/2016/oct/11/view-from-middletown-us-election-2016-presidential-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57xny\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2796357\"            data-video-name=\"The view from Middletown: get involved in this US election project \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fcbd19e4b0eaaafbc951fa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/11/161010GaryYoungeMuncieSUBTITLED_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/video/2016/oct/11/view-from-middletown-us-election-2016-presidential-election-video\">The view from Middletown: get involved in this US election project</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The authors, Helen Merrell Lynd and Robert Staughton Lynd, who were married, were seeking a fairly typical American town in which to conduct extensive field research. They described Muncie, which they only ever referred to as Middletown, as \u201ca community as small as thirty-odd thousand ... [in which] the field staff was enabled to concentrate on cultural change ... the interplay of a relatively constant ... American stock and its changing environment.\u201d Having first visited during a period of relative prosperity in the 1920s, they returned a decade later to write Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts during the Depression.</p> <p>I want to hear from people who live in Muncie or nearby in Indiana: we intend that this project should be guided by readers. Let me know if there are issues you think I am missing or questions I\u2019m not asking. Do you know smart people I should talk to? Put us in touch.</p> <p>The question of political alienation and political parties losing their grip on their bases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jan/06/dont-let-trump-fool-you-rightwing-populism-is-the-new-normal-video\">is not, however, unique to America</a>. Look across Europe and you will see that there is nothing uniquely American about the rise of Donald Trump. In Britain we\u2019ve seen the grassroots of the major parties rebel against their own leaderships with the double election of the leftwing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and the Conservative revolt over Brexit. So while I\u2019m staying in Muncie I hope readers from across America and elsewhere let me know if they are seeing similar themes emerge and if so how they are manifesting themselves. Every country has a Middletown \u2013 and most of them are hurting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"726521c763e8b2350c5b94c244e4df8ccf7efb8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726521c763e8b2350c5b94c244e4df8ccf7efb8f/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House in the downtown are of Muncie, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houses in the downtown are of Muncie, Indiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have been to Muncie before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/11/september11.usa3\">13 years ago</a>, to write about the second anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Back then, the political mood was tender with the political polarisation prompted by the Iraq war in particular and the Bush presidency in general. \u201cThe day when you would go out of your way to make a political statement are gone,\u201d Joseph Losco, chairman of the town\u2019s Ball State University political science department, told me at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gone for ever but it\u2019s gone for now.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call Muncie typical \u2013 what place truly is? \u2013 but it certainly showcased America as a complex place. True, the sign for the local mosque was destroyed and one local preacher held a memorial service in which he refused to share the pulpit with Muslims, Jews or any other religion. But following the mosque incident a local Muslim man held a barbecue and 200 neighbours showed up; an alternative interfaith service attracted twice the number of participants as the Christian-only one.</p> <p>So I\u2019m back in Middletown in the hope that I will once again find that level of complexity and nuance in this volatile moment. I want to visit the food banks, gun ranges, churches and gay bars to talk to its teachers, preachers, cops and kids. To find out not just how people will vote but what they are thinking, and not just who will win but what, if anything, might change. <br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 12 October 2016.

It delivered a point that Australia would have taken at half-time and one that Japan set out to achieve before kick-off. </p> <p>Japan were excellent in the first half, Australia poor. The Socceroos never got to grips with Japan\u2019s concession of territory and the Blue Samurai perhaps deserved to be more than a goal up after the break. Goalscorer Haraguchi then turned from hero to villain, conceding a needless penalty early in the second half to restore Australia\u2019s belief and shift the momentum. Thereafter, both sides probed but the clearest opportunities fell Japan\u2019s way, though Ryan only had one decent save to make. </p> <p>Much will be made of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s selections, in particular starting with two central strikers and a diamond midfield. The resulting lack of pace and width hurt Australia\u2019s chances. The Socceroos looked much more balanced and threatening after Robbie Kruse appeared. </p> <p>Brad Smith stood out all night, marauding down the left hand side and offering the best of the home side\u2019s attacking thrust.</p> <p>Unbeaten after four matches, and still to face whipping boys Thailand, this remains a strong start to the final World Cup qualifying phase for Australia. Tonight pitted them against a credentialed opponent that came with a defensive agenda and showed Australia a massive amount of respect. Russia 2018 is still very much on the agenda. </p> <p>Thanks for joining me, it\u2019s been a hoot, as always.

The Asian Confederation has been whittled to 12 teams split evenly into two groups with Australia topping Pool B with seven points from their opening three matches. It\u2019s been a strong opening to this leg of the campaign by Ange Postecoglou and his crew, with a routine home victory over Iraq followed by a hard-earned away win in the UAE and a draw last Thursday in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The top four teams in the group (Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Japan) are separated by only one point, with Iraq and Thailand cast adrift and pointless. With only two automatic qualifiers and a third-place playoff on offer, every match carries plenty of meaning over the coming months.</p> <p>On paper at least Japan represent the toughest opposition to the Socceroos in the group, but their form so far has been patchy. They suffered a surprise defeat to the UAE in their opening group game and required a 96th minute winner to down Iraq a few nights ago. Coach Vahid Halilhodzic is under immense scrutiny and another disappointing performance tonight could spell the end of his tenure in charge of the Blue Samurai. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s rivalry with Japan has been one of the highlights of the move into the AFC. The Tim Cahill inspired 2006 World Cup comeback remains the highlight, but whenever these countries meet there\u2019s a sense continental supremacy is at stake. This is especially so at present with the Socceroos the reigning Asian Cup champions but without a win over Japan since 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"554ddf2143e59151f23c017345212a7584882e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/554ddf2143e59151f23c017345212a7584882e79/0_419_1961_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Tim Cahill repeat his heroics of Kaiserslautern 2006 when Australia host Japan in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"534\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Tim Cahill repeat his heroics of Kaiserslautern 2006 when Australia host Japan in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fc7251e4b0eaaafbc950e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T05:34:13.512Z\">6.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jonathan will be here shortly to guide you through proceedings at Etihad, where Australia face their traditional Asian rivals hoping to consolidate top spot in Group B.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/08/socceroos-big-atmosphere-world-cup-clash-japan\">Socceroos keen for massive crowd in key Japan World Cup clash</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T05:36:21.359Z\">at 6.36am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The UK has fallen out of the top 10 of a respected international league table of countries\u2019 energy sectors for the first time.</p> <p>The World Energy Council blamed the government\u2019s lack of clarity and myriad changes which it said have left the country facing a potential gap in energy supply.</p> <p>The UK has previously been one of the top performers in the council\u2019s \u201cTrillema Index\u201d, which has ranked countries on energy security, costs and decarbonisation efforts for the last six years.</p> <p>But the Brexit vote, cuts to renewable energy subsidies and planned changes on foreign ownership have created investment uncertainty and significant challenges for the UK, according to <a href=\"https://www.worldenergy.org/publications/2016/2016-energy-trilemma-index-benchmarking-the-sustainability-of-national-energy-systems/\">the latest edition of the index for the London-headquartered agency</a>, whose members include energy companies across the world. </p> <p>The UK was also added to a watchlist of countries where negative changes are expected imminently, alongside the US, Germany and Japan. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland took the top three positive slots in the ranking, with the UK now 11th.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/hinkley-point-ministers-sign-go-ahead-for-nuclear-power-plant\">the recent decision to go ahead with new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset</a>, the UK had a \u201cdistinct lack of policy direction\u201d, the council\u2019s chief said.</p> <p>\u201cChallenges in terms of improving affordability, and delivering security of supply as North Sea assets deplete, coupled with the rundown of worn-out legacy infrastructure, including coal-fired generation, has left the UK with a potential energy gap,\u201d said Joan MacNaughton, executive chair of the council. \u201cRenewables are increasing as a percentage of the UK energy mix but their output is not yet at a level where energy security can be guaranteed.\u201d</p> <p>She added that ministers had not helped by making \u201cmyriad different changes\u201d since 2013. It was not clear if Theresa May\u2019s new government would back the \u201cdash for gas\u201d approach pushed by the former chancellor George Osborne under the last administration, said MacNaughton, adding that no alternative to gas had been made clear either. Gas has come to supply around half of the UK\u2019s electricity generation this year, up from around a third in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/04/solar-outstrips-coal-in-past-six-months-of-uk-electricity-generation\">as several major coal plants shut</a>.</p> <p>The result of the EU referendum vote in July has also cast a cloud over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/energy-policy-shift-climate-change-amber-rudd-backburner\">government\u2019s pledge last year to phase out coal power by 2025</a>, as leaving the single market as part of a hard Brexit \u201ccould significantly increase the cost of its energy imports\u201d. Imports via interconnectors to the continent accounted for <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/energy-industry/electricity-generation.html\">around 6% of the UK\u2019s electricity supply last year</a>.</p> <p>Planned changes to rules on foreign ownership of energy infrastructure, announced during May\u2019s review of Hinkley Point C contract, added to the investment uncertainty, the report said.</p> <p>The council also highlighted government cuts to onshore wind and solar subsidies since it took power, which <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/556329/Solar_photovoltaics_deployment_August_2016.xlsx\">Office for National Statistics figures showed last week</a> had led solar power installations to crash. The changes could hinder investments in those sectors, the council said.</p> <p>The longer term future of support for low-carbon energy was unclear too, said MacNaughton. \u201cThe market knows some of what to expect until 2020 but after this point there are no answers to how the country will finance the low-carbon transition.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Colin Brown, director of engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: \u201cThis report confirms that the UK government\u2019s lack of clear energy policy is threatening the country\u2019s future energy security.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe recent approval of the Hinkley Point C nuclear, while promising, is only part of the solution to the UK securing its low carbon energy requirements for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Former Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, tweeted that the report showed the UK was a case study in \u201chow not to run an energy policy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/natalieben/status/785806174683697152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How not to run an energy policy - the UK&#39;s a case study <a href=\"https://t.co/lyIow9k2Q6\">https://t.co/lyIow9k2Q6</a></p>&mdash; Natalie Bennett (@natalieben) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natalieben/status/785806174683697152\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A spokesman for the government said: \u201cKeeping the lights on is non-negotiable and an absolute priority. We do not leave this up to chance, and the measures we have put in place through the capacity market, mean that homes and businesses will continue to have the supplies they need as we build an energy infrastructure fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is a global leader in attracting investment and we are already seeing the fruits from this in our energy infrastructure with more offshore wind, solar energy and nuclear capacity being developed across the country. We will continue to work with industry and other key stakeholders to ensure that our future energy supplies remain clean, secure and affordable.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-neville-rolfes-speech-to-the-bloomberg-new-energy-finance-summit\">a speech on Monday</a>, the energy minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, said that new nuclear would have a key role to play for the UK in ensuring security of supply, affordability and decarbonising the sector.</p> <p>\u201cWhat might this look like in practice [meeting those criteria]? Where better to start than with Hinkley and nuclear new-build. Britain has a 60-year history as a global leader in nuclear power. Yet after the completion of the last new nuclear plant, Sizewell B in 1995, which I remember seeing while it was under construction, the nuclear industry was regrettably left to atrophy,\u201d she told a summit in London.</p> <p>Offshore windfarms could also play a role if the industry drives down costs, and the safe extraction of shale gas could help on affordability and supply, she said. </p>",

Unlike, say, the goings-on at a hotel run by a furious man who loathes the public, or the japes that ensue when a group of freakish priests are banished to a lonely island, this isn\u2019t a premise teeming with side-splitting potential. Fleabag took the genre\u2019s tropes \u2013 the half-hour format, the eccentric characters, the silliness and the boundary-pushing humour \u2013 and used them to make serious subjects accessible and engaging.

Most of the time, they won\u2019t have you doubled up with laughter. By unshackling themselves from the promise of gag after gag, they are free to be as interesting and progressive as they like. Amazon\u2019s Transparent is primarily concerned with being a groundbreaking, nuanced and naturalistic exploration of one family\u2019s relationships with gender, sexuality and Judaism; that didn\u2019t stop it being nominated in eight comedy categories at this year\u2019s Emmys. How did we get to the point where comedy could get away with ditching its most essential quality?</p> <p>The seeds of the unfunny comedy trend \u2013 dubbed, in the US, the sadcom \u2013 can probably be traced back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/01/favourite-tv-show-the-office-ricky-gervais-david-brent\">the original Office</a>\u2019s 2003 Christmas specials. But the phenomenon really gained traction in 2010, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/24/louie-box-set-review-louis-ck\">FX began airing Louis CK\u2019s autobiographical comedy Louie</a>, a show that channelled the realism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seinfeld\">Seinfeld</a> but left out the synthetic sitcom set-up \u2013 and most of the jokes. While an early review complained that \u201claughs come only intermittently\u201d, it soon became clear the show was more interested in ruthlessly sifting through the comedian\u2019s psyche in a series of scenarios both nightmarish and real. That this unfunniness was deliberate seemed clear from CK\u2019s reputation as one of the most hilarious stand-ups on the circuit; sitcom, it seemed, could be a home for something more sombre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f627fd87af65cede773ad75b4a566f2b4e116fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f627fd87af65cede773ad75b4a566f2b4e116fb/0_140_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aziz Ansari and Noel Wells in Master Of None.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aziz Ansari and Noel Wells in Master Of None.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KC Bailey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Louie was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/20/girls-season-five-premiere-best-lena-dunham\">followed in 2012 by Girls</a>: notable for drawing its occasional laughs from uncomfortable topics such as mental health and objectification. Importantly, it demonstrated that comedy\u2019s inbuilt irreverence meant it could discuss identity politics \u2013 one of the most important ideas of the decade \u2013 without preaching. Shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/26/transparent-review-the-best-thing-on-tv-at-the-moment\">Transparent</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/06/aziz-ansari-master-of-none-netflix\">Aziz Ansari\u2019s Master Of None</a>, which dealt with racial stereotyping and the lived experience of immigrants and their children, followed suit.</p> <p>Combine this with the Netflixication of TV \u2013 which favours shows with a strong narrative arc and scope for emotional investment \u2013 and society has created the perfect environment for this new strain of comedy. New Netflix series Easy, Tig Notaro\u2019s One Mississippi and Donald Glover\u2019s forthcoming Atlanta \u2013 which meditates on the US police system as well as the nature of fame \u2013 add to a trend that is only gathering steam.</p> <p>Many of these shows are the semi-autobiographical vehicles of US standup comedians, indicating how the status of comic has become elevated: they are now more akin to metaphysical gurus than clowns. That\u2019s partly because humour has a very high value in modern culture: not only is the news increasingly consumed through a prism of humour \u2013 thanks in part to social media and memes \u2013 but we live in an age of complicated theoretical ideas, such as gender, sexuality and latent institutional racism and sexism, and we need comedy to make them easily digestible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c61da4daf45f1b1d6fe5998aa5042453ecfebfc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c61da4daf45f1b1d6fe5998aa5042453ecfebfc6/0_55_2832_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Chancellor and Olivia Colman in Flowers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Chancellor and Olivia Colman in Flowers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/25/flowers-olivia-colman-julian-baratt\">Flowers: Olivia Colman and Julian Barratt come together to fall apart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important to note that unfunny comedy is not the same as comedy-drama \u2013 an often schmaltzy and generally regressive genre that sprinkles laughs on top of a dramatic conceit. The difference can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/25/flowers-olivia-colman-julian-baratt\">summed up best in Channel 4\u2019s Flowers</a>, a comedy about a severely depressed patriarch and his family\u2019s deep-seated unhappiness. By commandeering the irreverence and dark absurdity of sitcoms like Nighty Night and The League Of Gentlemen, Flowers was able to generate humour from its subject \u2013 mental health \u2013 rather than diffusing the tension with trite jokes about something incidental. Fusing laughter and pain felt healing rather than controversial, and a real step forward for television as a medium.</p> <p>Ultimately, these shows are so absorbing because life really is an unfunny comedy. Like the siblings from Transparent cackling at the fallout from their father\u2019s gender transition, traumatic events usually generate the best laugh-out-loud moments. This life-long dance between comedy and tragedy is summed up perfectly by that final scene of Fleabag, which ends with the protagonist\u2019s companion, played by Hugh Dennis, cracking a pre-discussed joke. Still tear-stained, Fleabag can\u2019t help but burst out laughing. \u201cTold you it was funny,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>Atlanta is on Fox in November</em></p>",
  "<p>One of the most brilliant and unexpected treats of recent years was Konami\u2019s PT, a \u201cplayable teaser\u201d for an unreleased and possibly cancelled reboot of the horror series Silent Hill. Directed by the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/18/can-metal-gear-survive-without-hideo-kojima-konami\">Hideo Kojima</a>, alongside the film maker Guillermo del Toro, PT is notable not just for moving a third-person series into a first-person perspective, but also for offering an ingenious solution to a problem that faces every high-end developer of video games. As game assets become even more expensive and time-consuming to produce, how do you squeeze the most out of them?</p> <p>PT\u2019s solution was a small but detailed house interior which plays out repeatedly, a snack-sized Groundhog Day. The player wakes afresh in the same room, explores the house and, depending on their actions, small details change. If you experiment enough, mysteries are solved and new secrets are uncovered. As an experience it has issues, primarily that it\u2019s too obtuse, but as a proof-of-concept, PT is exceptional, even if Konami\u2019s may never follow it up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXVx2bPgBp8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HXVx2bPgBp8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Konami\u2019s PT \u2018playable teaser\u2019</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Video game history loves a coincidence, and so we come to the new Resident Evil. Resi and Silent Hill share very little in terms of tone or structure, but as both are third-person survival horror games made by Japanese studios, they have been viewed as competitors since the days of the original Playstation. Announced this summer and due for release in January 2017, Resi 7 is a dramatic reinvention for Capcom\u2019s biggest-selling series of all time that \u2013 though having been in development for many years before PT saw release \u2013 it is toying with very similar concepts.</p> <p>Subtitled \u201cBeginning Hour\u201d, Resident Evil 7\u2019s Playstation-only playable teaser stars a spooky house, a switch to a first-person perspective and a total absence of combat. It was recently Resident Evil\u2019s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and such a drastic reinvention was sorely-needed \u2013 these two decades saw dozens of individual Resi titles, but almost all were based on just two templates: the original game and 2004\u2019s Resident Evil 4 (itself a reinvention). That repetition \u2013 and the need to ensure mainstream success in an era of rapidly escalating budgets \u2013 led to an identity crisis, as \u201csurvival horror\u201d inexorably gravitated towards \u201caction horror\u201d and then just \u201caction with a few blobby monsters\u201d. </p> <p>In that context, Resident Evil 7 is one hell of a bet. Not only does it rip the series free from the defining third-person perspective, but it also doubles-down with VR implementation. Such a radical shift is accompanied by, in the teaser at least, a new focus on scares over combat, and the creation of a claustrophobic, shifting environment. What remains of Resident Evil is simple: the house.</p> <p>Because, in the very first game, the star character was not one of those panicking STARS operatives \u2013 it was the Arklay Mansion, a byzantine architectural masterpiece designed for re-use: players would criss-cross the layout several times during the game, unlocking and discovering new rooms and nightmares. This design solved a technical problem at a time when 3D environments were relatively new (polygonal structures are computational expensive), but the parallel to Resident Evil 7\u2019s environment is spookily close.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a182fb004b37420114a31bfb2f9307bc4390fbf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a182fb004b37420114a31bfb2f9307bc4390fbf4/121_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The environment in Resident Evil 7 is unsettlingly naturalistic.

This could be a real house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teaser\u2019s dilapidated house is cramped, but packed. It\u2019s designed like a house, for a start, with a believable layout and dimensions. The wall and furniture textures are beautifully detailed, with the kind of worn leather chairs you can imagine feeling raggedy on your fingertips. Minor objects such as photographs withstand and repay examination.</p> <p>This grounded setting establishes a new tone for Resident Evil, which has always had as much schlock as shock. It has an effect that resonates, powerfully, through how this game works. You still move like a video game character, and understand you\u2019re in a video game horror house, but in the moment-to-moment experience this character feels convincingly flesh-and-blood. One of the strangest things was noticing that, when hiding, I was holding my breath.</p> <p>This would be promising enough, but Beginning Hour has even more unusual elements. What makes this house special is that, as you explore, creepy things start happening \u2013 and when you play again, it\u2019s not quite the same. In a first-floor room there are three mannequins. While checking a corner I heard a shuffle, turned around \u2013 and there was a fourth, at the top of the stairs I\u2019d just walked up. Subsequently I\u2019ve been to the same room, done the same things, and nothing\u2019s happened. On those same stairs, I saw the apparition of a girl for a split-second before she vanished. Never again.</p> <p>The short playtime (it should really be called \u201cBeginning 20 minutes\u201d) combines very well with tricks like this, in not only encouraging but rewarding multiple playthroughs \u2013 the potential of seeing something new maintains the atmosphere\u2019s tension. Even when you become familiar with the interior, and some of the more frequent scares, the tiniest event can set you on edge.</p> <p>The biggest part of this is the spectacularly creepy audio design, with its disturbing creaks and shuffles. Was that someone upstairs, or just an old timber settling? You\u2019re in an empty room, and something rustles in a corner that, now you look, is empty. The squeaks of old pipework lengthen into moans. Are those footsteps fading away?</p> <p>The puzzles are simple \u2013 a fuse box is missing a fuse, a mechanism needs power, a door is locked \u2013 but as with the original game, the point is more to make the player take journeys around the interior. Here we come to a unique characteristic of Beginning Hour, because there\u2019s never been a demo quite like this. For all it says about Resident Evil 7, there\u2019s a strange relationship with what\u2019s to come \u2013 Beginning Hour is not part of the main game, but a self-contained taster.</p> <p>This in itself is not unheard-of, but since release Capcom has been changing Beginning Hour with updates \u2013 adding items and allowing players to access new parts of the house. This is not only in-keeping with the shifting experience of Beginning Hour, but taps into that obsessive element of large fanbases to create an on-running mystery leading up to the full game\u2019s release. As marketing it\u2019s a stroke of design-led genius: Beginning Hour works both as a (free!) standalone miniature for any player, and by parcelling out its mysteries to build and maintain interest among more dedicated players.</p> <p>It also means, in this age of pre-release over-exposure, Resident Evil 7 is still something of an unknown quantity. We know the specifics of some nastier incidents, thanks to a spoiler-tastic age rating \u2013 don\u2019t look it up if you\u2019re interested in the game. We know there will be a combat system, and enemies to fight \u2013 though clearly the days of Resi 4 crowd control are long-gone. We know, thanks to the \u201clantern\u201d demo of in-game content, the hints of being hunted in Beginning Hour will become virtual reality. And this last point, along with the whole horror and scares thing, has a predictable effect.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8daUsjQj2ko\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8daUsjQj2ko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>VR may be an obviously appropriate fit for horror, but that doesn\u2019t mean people will necessarily like it. There\u2019s a level of abstraction in \u201ctraditional\u201d horror video games that allows a mass audience to enjoy feeling threatened in a very obviously virtual world. Resident Evil 7 won\u2019t be the first or last VR horror game, and VR-ready consumers will likely make up a small part of its audience, but this is a big leap in the dark.<br></p> <p>Beginning Hour is full of promise, but answers none of these questions. It offers tempting glimpses, too, of an even more radical approach than expected \u2013 using the great big brand behind it to deliver a new horror experience, one where the moment-to-moment experience is prized above deadening requirements such as campaign length. Midway through Beginning Hour the protagonist changes. We watch a videotape and inhabit the cameraman filming it, as a small TV crew reccy the house you\u2019re in for a low-budget horror series. Everything\u2019s fine and dandy until, unseen, the producer goes missing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf2c128d3a22d8c49fcf9b8235e54a9c809620fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2c128d3a22d8c49fcf9b8235e54a9c809620fa/72_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first-person perspective puts players right inside the horror, changing the feel of the experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first-person perspective puts players right inside the horror, changing the feel of the experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1989 film Sweet Home, a documentary crew visit an old mansion \u2013 and find a paranormal terror rooted in domestic tragedy. Capcom\u2019s Tokuro Fujiwara directed a video game adaptation on the NES so good, an historical classic, that the original Resident Evil is widely-acknowledged as a 3D adaptation of his design (Chris and Jill\u2019s \u201cspecial items\u201d of a lighter and lock pick are the most obvious tribute). How you crisscross the map, the puzzle design, the way characters can die if you make the wrong decisions \u2013 all of this became Resident Evil. Sweet Home is no zombie horror, though \u2013 it\u2019s a supernatural tale of human tragedy. </p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/v8m2YJaidbc\">\u201cMeet the Baker family\u201d</a> ran Capcom\u2019s press line last month while premiering a new trailer \u2013 though you\u2019ll have met Pa Baker when he knocks you out in either one of Beginning Hours\u2019 endings. Many game series remain in a state of perpetual adolescence, convinced that their audience is doing the same \u2013 and if not, the next generation\u2019s coming along. When you look at Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, there\u2019s a sense of a studio maybe \u2013 maybe \u2013 ageing a little with its audience. Understanding there are more horrible things that can happen to characters than just being killed by a bio-weapon.</p> <p>Perhaps the most tantalising possibility is that Resident Evil 7 augurs a future for video gaming\u2019s blockbuster franchises where horror is not simply a synonym for violence. At the very least, we may get less gore and more brains. At most it\u2019ll feel like home, Sweet Home. </p>",

  "<p>The frequency of floods of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of New York City in 2012, is rising so sharply that they could become relatively normal, with a raft of new research laying bare the enormous upheavals already under way in the US due to climate change.</p> <p>These findings and two other fresh pieces of research have highlighted how the US is already in the grip of significant environmental changes driven by warming temperatures, albeit in different ways to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/climate-change-hurricane-matthew-sea-level-rise\">processes that are fueling hurricanes</a>.</p> <p>An analysis of past storms and models of future events as the planet warms has shown that Sandy-like floods have become three times more common in the New York area since 1800.

It is a habit formed by oil, which warps price perceptions like a pyschotropic drug.</p> <p>Historically, abundant supplies have made Venezuelans regard cheap petrol as a birthright, so for political reasons \u2013 and despite hyperinflation, collapsing government revenues, global markets and climate change \u2013 the current price for a litre of high-grade gasoline is just 6 bolivars (less than a penny or a cent) \u2013 more than 100 times cheaper than the same volume of mineral water. This meant the fuel bill for the entire 1,400km journey was less than a pound or dollar.<br></p> <p>When Hugo Ch\u00e1vez came to power in 1999, he took this way of thinking a step further and used petrol dollars to subsidise essential products such as rice, sugar, toilet paper, sanitary towels and medicine.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38fc336680ebb09322a27fe7bf7f64ceacf3f105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38fc336680ebb09322a27fe7bf7f64ceacf3f105/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 100 bolivar note is the highest denomination.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 100 bolivar note is the highest denomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was an altruistic, populist move that allowed the poor to finally share in the nation\u2019s oil wealth.

Even in the midst of crisis, the government still hands out free or massively discounted homes, cars, DVD players and microwave ovens.<br></p> <p>Driving through the Gran Sabana region to its gateway San Isidro, also known as Kilometro 88, taxi driver Jos\u00e9 Lopez is conflicted about the consequences.

But even this loyal Chavista says people are now suffering. \u201cThings turned bad towards the end of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s time, and it\u2019s much worse now under Maduro,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>El Tigre \u2013 fertile fields lie empty</h2> <p>Further north, the road crosses the Orinoco river into the state of Anzo\u00e1tegui, which is home to many of Venezuela\u2019s biggest oil refineries and aluminium plants. Almost all have been run down. Output at the PDVSA state oil company has fallen by 450,000 barrels a day from its 2014 level of 2.7m barrels. Given that each barrel is also worth less than half its value two years ago, this has created an enormous hole in the state\u2019s finances.</p> <p>Compared to agriculture, however, that is a relatively small decline. On the roadside are miles and miles of empty, fertile land, and relatively few crops. With prices of many vegetables kept low, there is little incentive for farmers. Between 2012 and 2015, domestic grain production fell by 80%, meat by 40% and vegetables by 18%, according to private sector analysts.

  "<p>When turkey farmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/26/bernard-matthews-obituary\" title=\"\">Bernard Matthews died in 2010</a>, the company bearing his name was in a bad way. The avian flu of 2007 led to a cull of turkeys and undermined confidence in the business. Despite the best efforts of advertisers, turkey meat had failed to displace the popularity of chicken and pork. In 2013 the Matthews family secured \u00a325m in investment from private equity firm Rutland Partners, and gave up control of Bernard Matthews Limited. The new controllers hoped to revive the business; but that is not how it turned out and they were soon <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11610426/Bernard-Matthews-in-fresh-search-for-funds-as-turnaround-battle-rages-on.html\" title=\"\">looking for buyers</a>.</p> <p>In July this year the company\u2019s German subsidiary was sold for \u00a311.9m, but its fortunes continued to decline and accountancy firm Deloitte was hired as an adviser. The course of action chosen by the directors \u2013 a \u201cpre-pack\u201d administration \u2013 is controversial because of the secrecy involved, and because buyers can cherry-pick assets while dumping liabilities. Today I delivered <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2015/pre-pack-bernard-matthews-briefing-16-17/\" title=\"\">my report on this arrangement </a>to the work and pensions committee.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once again, pensioners find themselves at the back of the queue when things go wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In September Deloitte was appointed administrator, and on the same day the assets of the business \u2013 which included farms, land and buildings \u2013 were sold for \u00a387.5m to two property companies in the Boparan Private Office, a private investment vehicle. This was good news for employees as most of the 2,000 jobs were saved, at least for the time being, and for secured creditors Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services, who are set to be paid \u00a346.6m. Rutland has already received \u00a334m. But the big losers here, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sir-philip-green-i-am-working-every-day-on-the-bhs-pension-crisis\" title=\"\">as at BHS</a>, are the pensioners and the unsecured creditors.</p> <p>The Bernard Matthews pension scheme had a deficit of \u00a317.5m, rising to \u00a320m, but is unlikely to receive anything. Unsecured creditors, who between them are owed \u00a339m (including more than \u00a31m owed to HMRC), will be lucky to receive 1p in the pound, which is likely to have a devastating effect on the local economy in Norfolk and Suffolk.</p> <p>Deloitte has charged a fee of \u00a3790,000 and its advisers have run up another \u00a3668,000. Meanwhile, pension scheme members and trustees can do little to challenge this outcome. Administrators generally do not owe a \u201cduty of care\u201d to all parties.</p> <p>The poor state of UK regulation is captured by a letter from the pensions regulator to the work and pension committee last month. The letter notes that there is no compulsion to inform the regulator when such a deal is made. The Bernard Matthews pension scheme may eventually be rescued by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), but employees may not be entitled to 100% of their accrued pensions. We are still waiting to learn how much of BHS\u2019s \u00a3700m pension scheme liability is to be absorbed by the PPF.</p> <p>So once again, pensioners find themselves at the back of the queue when things go wrong, as shareholders\u2019 interests are prioritised over theirs. Despite reporting pension scheme deficits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/01/uk-defined-benefit-pension-fund-deficit-grows-100bn-one-month-pwc\" title=\"\">nearly \u00a3710bn</a>, companies do not prioritise deficit reduction. <a href=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/news/ftse-100-companies-pension-deficits-paid-out-%C2%A348-billion-dividends\" title=\"\">One recent study </a>notes that over the past two years, FTSE100 companies paid at least \u00a348bn in annual dividends while leaving \u00a352bn in pension scheme deficits. Another study noted that FTSE100 directors paid \u00a313.3bn to reduce their pension scheme deficits, compared with \u00a371.8bn in payments to shareholders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/bernard-matthews-pension-pot-to-receive-just-1p-in-the-pound\">Bernard Matthews pension pot to receive just 1p in the pound</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The following steps would help stamp out such practices. All large companies \u2013 say with more than 500 employees \u2013 should have significant employee representation on their boards. These representatives could be expected to stand up for the rights of employees. Second, no company should be able to pay dividends without a plan to reduce pension scheme deficit. Third, for companies in administration or liquidation, the pension scheme should be a priority creditor. Fourth, the regulator\u2019s permission should be needed before any sale can go ahead.</p> <p>The dumping of pension liabilities is a public matter. Sales and agreements like this one, affecting thousands of lives, should not remain confidential. This is not to say that openness is a panacea. The problems of corporate governance and capitalism more widely are deep-rooted. But some new rules and a greater degree of transparency could help prevent companies from playing fast and loose with pension liabilities.</p>",

She claims that Appelbaum touched her without her consent when she stayed at his apartment in 2014. She spent two years, she <a href=\"https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net/\">says</a>, alternating between trying to inhibit her rage and trying to convince herself that she hadn\u2019t been hurt. But in 2016, she began to seek out other victims, and when Appelbaum found out he confronted her in an online chat. Lovecruft says she felt he was trying to ruin her life for standing up to him: \u201cAttempting to blackmail me into silence whilst I was defending others is really not a good look for an \u2018anarchist\u2019 \u2018free-speech advocate\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Alison Macrina, another Tor volunteer and founder of the anti-surveillance <a href=\"https://libraryfreedomproject.org/\">Library Freedom Project</a>, tried to confront Appelbaum about her own experience. At his apartment in January 2016, she says that he repeatedly pressured her to take a bath with him and eventually pulled her into the tub in a kind of \u201cnonconsensual washing\u201d. More than a month passed until Macrina was able to talk to a friend about what had happened. When she met Appelbaum again in Berlin he insisted that he was the real victim because other people were making \u201cfalse claims\u201d about him. \u201cHe put on such a show on this little bench we were sitting on. It wasn\u2019t that cold but he ostensibly shivered, asking repeatedly why I didn\u2019t want to come over for tea.\u201d Hoping for an apology was futile, she realised. \u201cIt was all about him trying to get me into his thrall with stylizing himself as the victim,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tor has changed from being run by cypherpunks to American professional activists who care more about securing funding</p> <footer> <cite>Tor volunteer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet some female <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dhammicmarxist/on-my-experiences-with-jacob-appelbaum-361a11b847f5#.7hr3c3l8l\">friends</a>, former partners and colleagues, including WikiLeaks editor and journalist Sarah Harrison and human rights lawyer Renata Avila, stood up for Appelbaum, publishing a <a href=\"https://ourresponse.org/\">site in support of him</a> and claiming he had been the subject of \u201cegregious character assassination\u201d. One woman claimed that an inaccurate version of her story had been included on the site of anonymous allegations without her knowledge. German newspaper <a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-08/jacob-appelbaum-rape-sexual-abuse-allegations\">Die Zeit claimed</a> to have discovered inconsistencies in the most serious allegations made against Appelbaum, and the Guardian also found some conflicting accounts in at least three of the allegations of sexual assault. </p> <p>Appelbaum himself <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1soorlp\">denies all the accusations</a> of sexual misconduct, saying the claims are \u201centirely false\u201d and part of a \u201ccalculated and targeted attack\u201d. He has not said publicly why he might be targeted, or why he is the subject of what what his German lawyer describes as \u201ca hate campaign\u201d. \u201cTypically, people who come forward with these kinds of allegations are said to be doing it for money or fame,\u201d says Anne Roth, psychologist at Berlin\u2019s Lara Rape Crisis and Counselling Center. \u201cIn fact they gain nothing but negative attention.\u201d</p> <p>Roth says Berlin\u2019s close-knit cyberactivist community is likely to be no different to any other dysfunctional organisation or business that fails to properly address allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Sexual violence, she explains, is about the exertion of power, whether the power is defined by official rank or by social status, and in both cases it is <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">difficult for the victims to speak up</a>. \u201cThat relies on the goodwill of the aggressor, so without a formal allegation, victims often prefer to remain silent.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">The Tor Project</a> began in the mid-1990s at the <a href=\"http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/chacs/dingledine-tor-second-generation-onion-router\">US navy research lab</a>, which was exploring ways to protect military communications online. Short for \u201cThe Onion Router\u201d, which describes the layers of anonymity it is able to pile on top of a user\u2019s online activity, Tor was spun out into a non-profit company in 2006 led by<a href=\"http://www.freehaven.net/~arma/cv.html\"> Roger Dingledine</a>,<a href=\"http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/\"> Nick Mathewson</a> and <a href=\"http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearchViewPDF.aspx\">six others</a> from its base in Massachusetts. By 2014 it had <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2014-TorProject-combined-Form990_PC_Audit_Results.pdf\">annual revenue of $2.5m</a>. Appelbaum began as a volunteer and joined the staff in 2008. </p> <p>Dingledine and Appelbaum began to work closely together, with Appelbaum encouraged to speak as Tor\u2019s public evangelist \u2013 marking the beginning of Appelbaum\u2019s ascendency into an influential figure in the tech community. He was one of only a handful of activists with the confidence and technical knowledge to publicly challenge the US government\u2019s pervasive surveillance regime. In August 2013, he even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8lRCqYI6U\">accepted a Whistleblower Award</a> on behalf of Edward Snowden. \u201cHe asked me to speak about individuals and about the hope for change,\u201d Appelbaum, according to <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/snowden-did-it-for-all-of-us/a-17057251\">Deutsche Welle</a>. \u201cHe said everyone had the strength to stand up against corruption, war crimes and lies \u2013 every day and at any time.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"116e4127aaa512a71563000e5c162554cc520ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/116e4127aaa512a71563000e5c162554cc520ed1/0_245_3875_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Appelbaum at the Chaos Computer Club, a European hacker gathering, during a video conference with Julian Assange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Appelbaum at the Chaos Computer Club, a European hacker gathering, during a video conference with Julian Assange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Allegations against Appelbaum were first brought before the Tor board in March 2015, when a female employee <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/sources-tor-project-board-knew-about-allegations-against-jac?utm_term=.pcByo997r#.wq1DAoo0L\">approached her bosses</a> with concerns about sexual misconduct and bullying. Tor suspended her and Appelbaum for 10 days but, sources say, the employee was unable to present any evidence to support the claim. The employee then left the company.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/shari-steele-legacy-digital-rights\">Shari Steele</a> came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/11/shari-steele-tor-encryption-online-anonymity-censorship\">on board as Tor\u2019s executive director</a> in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/announcing-shari-steele-our-new-executive-director\">December 2015</a>, one of her priorities was to deal with the allegations, Dingledine wrote in an<a href=\"https://cryptome.org/2016/06/dingledine-appelbaum-16-0602.pdf\"> internal email</a>. Steele, a trained lawyer, had worked at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) since 1992 and has a reputation for being fair and effective \u2013 if a little prone to impatience and threats when under pressure, according to former colleagues. \u201cShari\u2019s original plan was to develop a process that we could use for these situations: we\u2019d put the new process in place, ask everyone to start fresh, and then follow the process moving forward. In the meantime, we have been sending concerned people to her, so she can keep track of the big picture,\u201d Dingledine told Tor\u2019s inner circle just after the allegations were published on jacobappelbaum.net. \u201cUnfortunately, events have overtaken us.\u201d </p> <p>In February 2016, Lovecruft sent an encrypted email to Tor executives detailing more allegations of sexual abuse and harassment she had gathered from multiple victims. Tor is said to have consequently banned Appelbaum from its developer meeting at the Internet Freedom Festival in Valencia. Appelbaum claims that Steele asked him to resign on 25 <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blogs/ssteele\">May</a>, and later sent him \u201c<a href=\"https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf\">separation agreement</a>\u201d which would remove any liability from Tor. Appelbaum didn\u2019t sign. He says that he had also agreed to undertake anti-harassment training, but left Tor before that could happen. </p> <p>Tor <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project\">announced</a> his departure on 2 June and began an internal investigation. When it concluded on 27 July, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/statement-0\">Steele</a> thanked those who had come forward to report Appelbaum\u2019s behaviour. \u201cMany people inside and outside the Tor Project have reported incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, bullied and frightened by Jacob, and several experienced unwanted sexually aggressive behavior from him \u2026 I am grateful you spoke up, and I acknowledge and appreciate your courage.\u201d</p> <p>The claims against Appelbaum, as well as Tor\u2019s treatment both of him and of the alleged victims, have thrown Tor and its network of staff and dedicated volunteers into chaos. Tor has been accused of mishandling the investigation and of failing to give information about their process, and of failing to protect and support victims as well as some who say they have been unfairly implicated as accomplices of Appelbaum. Tor, a small organisation with a laser focus on internet anonymity and privacy, seems overwhelmed by the intensity of the infighting and lacking the skills to handle the severity of the accusations among its staff and volunteers. </p> <p>Appelbaum told the Guardian that Tor did not speak to him to ask his version of events during its internal investigation, while Tor claims he declined to be interviewed over the encrypted channels its investigator proposed. Another witness to the rape allegation also <a href=\"https://yawnbox.com/static/The-Tor-Project-has-lied-to-its-community.html\">claims</a> not to have been interviewed by Tor. Some of Appelbaum\u2019s <a href=\"https://shiromarieke.github.io/tor\">supporters</a> feel he was not treated fairly by the organisation, and have <a href=\"https://www.oneeyedman.net/?p=2589\">called for a boycott</a> or <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19690\">stopped</a> working with the organisation. \u201cTor has changed from being an organization run by cypherpunks to being run by American professional activists, who care more about securing funding and their job security than the cause,\u201d says one longstanding community member. \u201cPeople are afraid to speak up in case they are ousted like the people interviewed in the investigation,\u201d says another insider. \u201cWe have very little information from Tor\u2019s leadership about the investigation and the nature of the allegations. Rather ironic for an organization promoting free speech.\u201d</p> <p>Long-term community member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/01/wikileaks-john-gilmore-guardian-internet\">John Gilmore</a>, who also co-founded EFF, claimed on an internal mailing list that Appelbaum had been put through \u201ctrial-by-rumour\u201d. \u201cThe numerous victims that this process creates are not helped at all; the innocent along with the allegedly guilty are savaged and rejected without ever getting a chance to defend themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db23da7f09a7d3e63b8cd8cb8841eb1e948c7b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db23da7f09a7d3e63b8cd8cb8841eb1e948c7b46/0_133_3712_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Appelbaum at a Berlin demonstration in support of press freedom in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Appelbaum at a Berlin demonstration in support of press freedom in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Britta Pedersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In July 2016, shortly before the internal investigation concluded, Dingledine and the six other members of Tor\u2019s board of directors <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-elects-new-board%C2%A0-directors\">all stepped down</a>. They did not acknowledge the Appelbaum controversy, saying only that Tor deserved \u201cthe best possible leadership\u201d. \u201cIt is time that we pass the baton of board oversight as the Tor Project moves into its second decade of operations,\u201d Tor wrote on its blog. </p> <p>In a statement released to the Guardian, Tor said that the investigation had been handled \u201cthoroughly and professionally\u201d. \u201cThe board\u2019s resignation was part of a larger effort on their part to bring more professional leadership to the organization. This included hiring Shari Steele to the executive director role and bringing on a board with more nonprofit oversight experience.\u201d</p> <p>When the employee came forward with concerns in March 2015, Tor conducted an internal investigation and took action, it says, yet there were no formal procedures in place to deal with allegations of sexual harassment among staff or volunteers. Tor has since introduced an anti-harassment policy, a conflicts of interest policy, procedures for submitting complaints and an internal complaint review process.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many saw the way he treated me and did nothing about it ... so it took me years before I realized how abusive he was</p> <footer> <cite>Leigh Honeywell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tor defended its handling of the second investigation in 2016. \u201cTor handled the investigation carefully and ethically. We posted information about what we were doing on our blog, and we have supported and protected victims throughout this process.\u201d</p> <p>Many in the tech community have distanced themselves from Appelbaum. Even the San Francisco hackers\u2019 workspace he co-founded has <a href=\"http://blog.noisebridge.net/post/145728465358/noisebridge-statement-on-jacob-appelbaum\">blocked him online and from its building</a> after implementing a new harassment policy. \u201cEverybody knew that Jake used sexually charged language to upset people in work meetings,\u201d says one former co-worker. \u201cThere were many rumors, but Jake was allowed to win every argument and Tor was letting him get away with every little whim.\u201d</p> <p>Appelbaum says that he has stopped drinking and begun therapy. \u201cI have obviously seriously hurt people\u2019s feelings unintentionally and I deeply regret this,\u201d he said. He hopes to focus on his doctoral work on cryptography in the Netherlands, claiming he can\u2019t return to America because he could be investigated over <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/20/wikileaks-jacob-appelbaum-google-investigation/\">his work with WikiLeaks</a> and Der Spiegel about <a href=\"http://www.cicero.de/berliner-republik/jacob-appelbaum-der-hacker-der-merkels-handy-ueberwachung-aufdeckte/57465\">classified US surveillance</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime member of the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity. These are ideals that I will continue to uphold, despite the vicious campaign that is currently being waged against me,\u201d Appelbaum <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1soorlp\">said</a>.

Horgan\u2019s dialogue, complete with staccato swears and well-measured vulgarity, has more than survived the journey across the Atlantic. She hasn\u2019t had to adjust her tone; crucial when someone writing for British TV tries to take their essence to the US. It always gets diluted somehow, but, apart from the odd \u201casshole\u201d, that\u2019s not the case here.</p> <p>As a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/cynthia-nixon-sex-and-the-city\">Sex And The City</a> fan, the combination of that HBO sting and Parker\u2019s name in the credits gets my fingers tingling. Way to make your high-profile US debut, casting an actor who carries with her (that was an unintentional pun) the huge weight of audience expectation, when her last TV character was Carrie Bradshaw and most potential viewers are in a state of strung-out anticipointment, waiting to see what she can do to top it.</p> <p>Horgan\u2019s exploration of marital disharmony, that sometimes casual cruelty sprung from a mid-life panic, sees Parker step into a more mature role. Or at least that\u2019s how it seems in the beginning. Frances is intelligent, a caring mum and sympathetic friend, who dreams of opening a gallery and who also finds time to maintain her appearance. She wants the world to like her. In turn, Robert is a pass-agg jobsworth with a burgeoning resentment for the world around him. If this marriage is going down the crapper, we know whose fault it is. Doesn\u2019t he realise what a tremendous woman he\u2019s married to?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIGYQi6p8f4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oIGYQi6p8f4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But it\u2019s not long before Frances\u2019s imperfections surface. Beneath those autumnal separates and cashmere wrist-warmers beats the heart of a selfish prick. Like all of Horgan\u2019s antiheroes, Frances is out for number one. She\u2019s having an affair with an academic played by Jemaine Clement. She full-stops most conversations with Robert by way of a turned back. He changes the locks, she emasculates him during therapy. Peck, peck, peck.</p> <p>Parker\u2019s character is encapsulated the first time we see her inspecting her neck flesh in the bathroom mirror while Robert huffs in the doorway, complaining he\u2019s had to defecate in a tin. If I\u2019m making him sound like a doofus, he\u2019s not. Just as the cracks appear in Frances, the softer side of Robert is revealed in the neatly structured first episode. You\u2019ll change teams five times before the credits roll.</p> <p>\u201cI want a divorce,\u201d says Frances in the fallout from a 50th birthday party the two attend. As a viewer, it puts you in a novel position because you\u2019ll want a divorce, too \u2013 theirs.

The definition of marriage would change: The definition of marriage in s5 of the Marriage Act would be changed to replace \u201ca man and a woman\u201d with \u201ctwo people\u201d.</p> <p>2. The conditions for a valid marriage would stay the same: It will continue to be the case that a marriage would be void if, for example, the parties are in a \u2018prohibited relationship\u2019, consent was not real, or one or both parties are not of marriageable age.</p> <p>3. Foreign same-sex marriages would be recognised in Australia: All valid marriage solemnised under the law of a foreign country, including same-sex marriages, would be recognised in Australia if they are consistent with Australian law. A foreign marriage would not be valid in Australia if the marriage would be unlawful in Australia, for example, if the parties are siblings, in a parent-child relationship, or are polygamous.</p> <p>4. Existing protections for ministers of religion would be retained and strengthened: ministers of religion would be able to refuse to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man and a woman, if that refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the minister\u2019s religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of the religion, or if (irrespective of the teachings of his or her church) the minister has a conscientious objection to same-sex marriage.</p> <p>5. Marriage celebrants (including those who are not ministers of religion) would be able to refuse to marry a same-sex couple: In addition to the existing law whereby marriage celebrants are under no obligation to solemnise marriage, the Marriage Act would be amended to allow marriage celebrants who are not ministers of religion to refuse, on the basis of conscientious or religious beliefs, to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man or a woman. Religious bodies and religious organisations would also be able to refuse to provide facilities, goods or services for the purpose of solemnisation of a same-sex marriage, or for purposes reasonably incidental thereto, if the refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents to that religion.<br></p> <p>In the event that the parliament passes the plebiscite bill, the government proposes the establishment of a joint select committee to review and report on the exposure draft. The composition of the committee would be as agreed by the government, the opposition, and crossbench parties.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T22:26:18.723Z\">at 11.26pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fc0992e4b0a043a4c24335\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T21:36:54.900Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stephanieando/status/785592427570606081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nats MP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/broad4mallee\">@broad4mallee</a> indicates he&#39;ll withdraw support for government if there is a vote on same-sex marriage without plebiscite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\">#auspol</a></p>&mdash; Stephanie Anderson (@stephanieando) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephanieando/status/785592427570606081\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I am not sure whether National MP <strong>Andrew Broad</strong> means total withdrawal of support or just on this issue.

The political weather is cool with a lot of bluster this morning but let\u2019s separate out what is real and what is rhetoric.</p> <p>The concrete points:</p> <ol> <li>The <strong>attorney general, George Brandis,</strong> has released draft amendments to the Marriage Act that would go to parliament if the plebiscite passes.</li> <li>Under the amendments, the definition of marriage would be changed to replace \u201ca man and a woman\u201d with \u201ctwo people\u201d. Protections would be offered for religious organisations and celebrants involved in the marriage ceremony but not small businesses.</li> <li>Labor will meet this morning to decide their final position on the plebiscite bill that needs to pass for the plebiscite to be conducted. </li> </ol> <p>Apart from those points, these are the political points:</p> <ol> <li>Conservatives are unhappy that the amendments do not go far enough because small businesses are not offered protection on the grounds of freedom of speech \u2013 the so-called wedding cake clause.</li> <li>The LGBTI community say the amendments do not go far enough to force religious organisations to comply with the law. </li> <li>LGBTI community representatives are pushing the Labor party to oppose the plebiscite due to the fear of hate speech and the argument that no other human rights issues need to go to a plebiscite.</li> <li><strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong> said this morning that Brandis released the draft marriage amendments at 11pm last night and expected Labor to decide overnight.</li> <li>Plibersek also said \u201cmeh\u201d to the changes, given the draft bill still doesn\u2019t answer the mental health concerns of a divisive debate, nor the $200m cost of the plebiscite.</li> <li>Brandis said while Labor may complain, in his meeting with his shadow minister <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong> and <strong>Terri Butler</strong>, Labor refused nine times to suggest what changes they would like to the plebiscite bill. They are not serious, says Brandis.</li> </ol> <p>He argued on Sky that the amendments set out the general rules of the act \u2013 the rest is up to the courts. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People will always be able to dream up borderline cases, I mean that is what courts are for to interpret acts of parliament. All we can do in acts of parliament is to explain a general rule. And the general rule we have created is an absolute exemption for ministers of religion. An absolute exemption on conscientious grounds for civil celebrants and an absolute exemption for churches and religious bodies in relation to the provision of facilities or the sale of goods or services reasonably incidental to a same-sex marriage ceremony.</p> </blockquote> <p>OK there is a whole lot more in Brandis\u2019s remarks, which I will bring you in the minute.

  "<p>The England coach, Eddie Jones, went to four rugby matches over the weekend but it was the game he did not attend that will be talked about for years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/south-africa-new-zealand-rugby-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">New Zealand\u2019s one-sided 57-15 romp over South Africa</a> in Durban was no routine victory. Let\u2019s just say Jones chose an interesting time to suggest there is limited value in seeking to emulate the All Blacks.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that really annoys me in rugby at the moment is that everyone tries to copy New Zealand. Why?\u201d asked Jones in an interview with the Sunday Times. He went on to talk about England \u201crebranding\u201d the way the game is played between now and 2019. Everyone knows what he is driving at \u2013 to beat New Zealand at their own game is presently impossible \u2013 but it would be churlish to suggest the All Blacks have nothing to teach their pursuers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/south-africa-new-zealand-rugby-championship-match-report\">New Zealand claim largest victory over South Africa in nine-try blitz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not so much the record-breaking <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfcrGIqMZCA\" title=\"\">nine-try margin of defeat</a> for the Springboks on home soil, as significant as that is in the historical context of the sport. What really resonated was the way the All Blacks pulled away after the interval, winning the second half by an astounding 45-6. The speed and awareness of Beauden Barrett, the fly-paper hands of Israel Dagg, the precision of Ben Smith, the staggering all-court games of Brodie Retallick and Dane Coles, the potential of Liam Squire and Ardie Savea: the Springboks were not so much overpowered as sliced and diced by something far beyond their imaginations.</p> <p>When the former All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick told Sky Sports viewers New Zealand had \u201ctaken rugby to a new level\u201d and called them \u201cprobably the best All Blacks side I\u2019ve seen in terms of their preparation and skillsets\u201d he was merely stating the obvious.</p> <p>Another Bledisloe Cup victory over Australia on Saturday week, their 18th win in a row, would set a record for consecutive Test wins among tier one nations, a distinction which will be furiously drawn in Lithuania whose national side also went unbeaten for 18 games between 2006-10. With all due respect to the boys from Vilnius, the two squads have nothing else in common.</p> <p>It is increasingly a stretch to imagine New Zealand\u2019s sequence being broken this autumn by Ireland \u2013 who have two shots at them in Chicago and Dublin \u2013 Italy or France, leaving the British &amp; Irish Lions potentially facing hosts unbeaten in a Test match on home soil since 2009.</p> <p>Common sense would suggest there is at least a thimble of wisdom these free-wheeling, modern-thinking All Blacks can offer the rest of the world. At the very least the increased tempo they add to their game in the second half is an example to all, as is their hunger to strike just before and after the interval and from restarts. No side hit harder on the counterattack, none handle better flat to the gainline, none have forwards and backs who appear so absurdly interchangeable. The try scored by TJ Perenara after a quite brilliant flat pass across the defence to a full-tilt Kieran Read followed by a one-handed catch by Dagg and another one-handed offload from Coles was merely the latest eye-popping example. Dan who? Richie who?</p> <p>Attempting to copy that kind of thing from a standing start is akin to buying a couple of tins of emulsion and expecting to paint like Michelangelo. That is essentially what Jones was getting at: he sees no point in England pretending to be something they are not. He may have derived rather more enjoyment from the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/saracens-wasps-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Saracens shut down Wasps\u2019</a> much-vaunted attacking game at the weekend; there is still no rugby team who can do much with a bristling opposition in their nostrils, intent on stopping any hint of creativity at source.</p> <p>Hence Jones\u2019s preference for big, bustling back-row forwards, tactically shrewd half-backs, physicality and attitude across the field. He says he will not turn his attention fully to England\u2019s attack until next year, once the \u201ctraditional pillars\u201d of set piece and defence are firmly in place.</p> <p>Rebranding the way the game is played? His England team will not be taught to run until they can walk, which is a slightly sobering assessment of the second-ranked team in the world. New Zealand, in contrast, are now showing their class with Usain Bolt consistency.</p> <p>As with Bolt, it is hard to think of anyone else in their respective sports who has shone brighter or made the rest of the world look so mediocre.</p> <h2>MIND THE GAP</h2> <p>There is any amount of hot air emanating from rugby boardrooms in both hemispheres as the global game struggles to reach any semblance of accord on crucial issues such as Test schedules, revenue-sharing and qualification periods. The prize for the most thoughtless use of words so far goes to the Australian Rugby Union\u2019s Bill Pulver, who \u2013 surprise, surprise - is against increasing the three-year eligibility period for overseas-born players but sees possible value in allowing those capped at tier one level being allowed to represent tier two nations at the end of their careers. \u201cI do wonder whether [there is] some flexibility, particularly with some of the Pacific Islands players who, after a career overseas, are returning and may have completed their use-by dates in some of those countries.\u201d Their \u201cuse-by dates\u201d? Those who have long suspected Pacific Islands players are seen as pieces of meat by wealthier clubs and unions now have the condescending proof.</p> <h2>AND ANOTHER THING...</h2> <p>English rugby has lost one of its most evocative former internationals with the death of Dickie Jeeps at the age of 84. The British &amp; Irish Lions, England and Northampton scrum-half was made of resilient stuff and, with 13 Lions caps earned on three tours, ranks among the finest No9s to pull on the red rose. His half-back partnership with the great Cliff Morgan in 1955 was famously effective and, after his playing days, he served as the president of the Rugby Football Union. Given the abbreviated length of modern tours he is likely to remain the most-capped Lions back and most-capped Englishman in Lions history.</p>",
  "<p>Paprika Gifts is an independent retail store based in the Wiltshire market town of Chippenham. Located in the Borough Parade shopping centre just off the high street, it rubs shoulders with some well-known retail brands \u2013 Waitrose, Argos, The Body Shop, WHSmith and Boots to name a few. For owner Anne Anderson, who has a second smaller store on Chelsea Road in nearby Bath, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity.<br></p> <p>While all these chains are classed as competitors they also bring footfall, but she doesn\u2019t know how much because the data is not released by the centre management. Anderson understands that the names bring in the shoppers but she also sees the \u201chundreds of boxes\u201d delivered to Waitrose as part of the John Lewis click and collect online scheme.</p> <p>\u201cThere is competition everywhere. All the major stores bring out Christmas gift ranges,\u201d Anderson says, adding that it is her and her staff\u2019s intuition for products and local knowledge of customers that enables the business to succeed. There is no data, no analytics, just good old-fashioned smelling what\u2019s selling, as Lord Sugar would put it.</p> <h2>Utilising big data </h2> <p>In contrast, the large retailers are increasingly driven by big data \u2013 information harvested from a mix of product sales receipts, online browsing records, loyalty cards, open data, location-based data and, of course, social media data. This data is helping to drive decision making \u2013 where to locate a new store, which products to stock, how to market to different age groups and so on.</p> <p>\u201cThe more we know about our customers \u2013 the way they shop and when, their preferred methods of communication, their buying patterns and habits \u2013 the more that allows us to tailor our client proposition,\u201d Andrew Ware, chief financial offer at Keyhaven Capital, said in an Economist Intelligence Unit <a href=\"http://www.wipro.com/documents/the-big-data-revolution-in-retail.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> by consultancy firm Wipro.</p> <p>The study is revealing: 54% of retailers said big data had brought gains in multichannel sales, and 62% said they would make further investments in big data analytics in the next two years. Of course it makes sense if you are a retailer and can afford it or even find the required skills in the market. Retail data analysts are in demand and can command salaries from \u00a330-75k and above, according to James Milligan, director of Hays Digital Technology.</p> <p>So what does this get you? The <a href=\"http://johnlewis.scene7.com/is/content/JohnLewis/jl_retail_report_2015_151015pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Lewis retail report</a>, a detailed analysis of customer habits, best-selling products and fashion trends is a good example of what customer data can do for a retailer with all the right data tools in place. So are smaller independents missing out? Can they get access to data or is the accepted pattern an ever-widening gulf between large chains and independents?</p> <p>Emile Naus, partner and technical director at supply chain and operations specialist LCP Consulting, says there are advantages to big data but equally pitfalls. Data, he says, is a starting point and needs meaning to enable decision making.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last few years large retailers have invested heavily in big data with varied results,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a risk of over reliance. Retailers can get boring. Local retailers have an advantage in that they have to be more creative. They should play to their strengths.\u201d</p> <h2>Tapping into local knowledge </h2> <p>Naus adds that if smaller independent retailers get the data bit right, they could in fact put themselves in a strong position by combining it with their local knowledge. Clare Bailey, retail expert and chair of The Retail Conference, agrees.</p> <p>\u201cLarge retailers are at risk of losing the local detail through data aggregation,\u201d says Bailey, adding that small independents \u201cdon\u2019t need big data they just need data\u201d. Combine this data with local expertise and you have a tasty recipe for success, well at least the potential for an advantage over the bigger retailers.</p> <p>\u201cAt the top end of the independent market, those that are doing really well are investing in EPOS systems, for example, that provide data and reporting,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cMost of the independents, though, are just getting by so they need to embrace technology.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey is right, of course. It\u2019s something Anderson at Paprika Gifts is well aware of as she embarks on a major website upgrade and digital marketing and data strategy. But Anderson is typical, not just of independent retailers but small business owners when she says finding time is the biggest challenge.</p> <p>It\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t escaped the attention of software providers. While IBM and SAP have already released \u201clite\u201d versions of data software for small retailers, specialist startups such as Statement Retail are gaining traction. </p> <h2>Investing time and money innovating</h2> <p>\u201cI think data analysis is a big challenge for small retailers,\u201d says Dan Conboy, managing director at digital retail firm Statement Retail. \u201cThis is partly because many smaller independents don\u2019t have any EPOS solutions in place and have often not embraced the multichannel world where consumers like to browse before they visit a store. We often find that smaller independents say they haven\u2019t innovated in this way because they perceive it to be complex, expensive or they don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p> <p>Statement Retail, adds Conboy, aims to change this. It has partnered with Shopify, a global e-commerce platform, opening up the possibility for data analytics, regardless of size of business. </p> <p>\u201cThis can transform a small retail business because they can easily see what is and isn\u2019t selling, thereby having the knowledge to improve both their sales and cash flow,\u201d adds Conboy. \u201cIn today\u2019s volatile and fast-paced retail landscape, having this level of intelligence can be critical to the business success for an independent retailer.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly the future is a challenging one for any retailer. <a href=\"http://blog.localdatacompany.com/infographic-in-the-balance-h1-2016-retail-and-leisure-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">Figures</a> from retail data firm the Local Data Company recently revealed that shop closures are currently outstripping shop openings and as a result, high-street vacancy rates are up for the first time since 2012. </p> <p>The figures suggest Brexit is having an impact but as we head towards the Christmas shopping period, may be this will change, at least for the short term.

TfL just works. I was in London in August, and for about \u00a37 I went everywhere, on the buses and on the underground.</p> <p>This compared to a recent day-trip from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight: \u00a310 for an adult ticket on its privately run and operated Southern Vectis buses on the Isle of Wight. You can save \u00a346 if you buy a weekly ticket for \u00a324 \u2013 but we were only there for the day. There was no other option but the bus.</p> <p>A bus is not luxury transport. They\u2019re used by millions of people every day \u2013 to get to work, school, the shops. For those, like me, with serious health concerns, some days walking is simply not an option, so buses are the only way I can make it the two and a half miles into town.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My council tax is paying for the transport service while my fare is lining the pockets of shareholders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Portsmouth, that means FirstGroup buses. Which means \u00a34.20 of the weekly budget needs to be spent on a one-day travel ticket (I could get a return for about \u00a33.50, but if I\u2019m spending the money I make it worthwhile and try to do everything in one day.) My daughter\u2019s weekly pass to get to school (a little over two miles each way) is \u00a315.</p> <p>The buses generally run on time, but of course sometimes they don\u2019t. Some routes have had me standing in the rain for 45 minutes because a bus simply never showed up. Other services run every two hours. I\u2019ll get on the bus, shivering and cold, and I\u2019ll be surrounded by concessionary pass-holders \u2013 who don\u2019t complain about the buses as they don\u2019t have to pay for them. The other day I counted 30 passengers as they got on the bus. Only three paid, and one of those had a weekly pass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a722eca69c855cfed9b0d8c8041127908569cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a722eca69c855cfed9b0d8c8041127908569cf/0_408_7218_4331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bus travelling through a winter landscape\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Some routes have had me standing in the rain for 45 minutes because a bus simply never showed up.

Twice. The city council pays a subsidy to the bus company to cover the routes and the bus pass scheme. So my council tax is paying for the transport service while my fare is lining the pockets of shareholders.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s not just the trains we should nationalise. Maybe the buses need to be run by local government, not profit-hungry companies. The current pricing seems almost random. It costs \u00a38 on a Stagecoach bus to go from Portsmouth to Brighton, getting on and off as I please; it costs \u00a36 on First just to travel around Hampshire. It\u2019s \u00a310 for a day ticket on the Isle of Wight; yet Southampton, a much larger city than Portsmouth, only costs \u00a33.20.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/03/bus-services-bill-lords-local-authority-transport-devolution\">The bus bill could rob communities of high quality, affordable bus travel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is nonsensical, unaffordable, and not good value for money. They\u2019re no longer the transport of choice for the working-class commuter. In fact, a train ticket from my nearest station into the city centre is cheaper than the bus fare. If trains are cheaper than buses, you know there\u2019s a problem. The rest of the country can only dream of the service Londoners get for their cash.</p> <p>We\u2019re asked to cut back on car use, told to prevent pollution. The car is seen as bad for the environment, and yet buses are so expensive it\u2019s cheaper to maintain a car. And that doesn\u2019t make sense on any level.</p> <p>So, take back the trains, take back the buses, make them not-for-profit, as TfL has managed to do, and give customers a break. There is a better way to do things, and we need only look at our capital to see what needs to be done.</p>",
  "<p>Entrepreneurs need little convincing that technology is important, rapidly evolving, and likely to have a profound impact on their businesses.

Prof Michael Feindt, a former Cern scientist and now chief scientific officer at predictive applications company Blue Yonder, says machines can learn from past experience better than humans can and are very effective at making unbiased predictions. Feindt says this is a powerful tool in highly competitive, low margin markets such as retail. But machine learning takes time and requires a lot of data. \u201cThe most important piece of advice I would give to small businesses is to keep all business-related data \u2013 don\u2019t throw anything away,\u201d says Feindt. \u201cData is valuable.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Augmented reality (AR)</strong></h2> <p>Augmented reality and its better known cousin virtual reality (VR) are coming to the fore and revenues from these industries are forecast to <a href=\"http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/01/augmentedvirtual-reality-revenue-forecast-revised-to-hit-120-billion-by-2020/#.V_prk48o-Ul\" rel=\"nofollow\">reach $120bn by 2020</a>. But PwC innovation consultant Jeremy Dalton, says there are clear differences \u2013 VR is an \u201cimmersive experience\u201d whereas AR provides the ability to place a virtual image into a real environment. A car engine manufacturer, for example, would be able to create a holographic image of a proposed design. \u201cYou\u2019d be able to walk around it, look closely at all the different parts and understand the idea before it has been created,\u201d Dalton says. \u201cThis has huge implications for businesses involved in manufacturing, architectural design and prototyping.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Blockchain</strong></h2> <p>Blockchain is best known as the ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. But entrepreneurs have spotted there are many uses of blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) and <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/state-of-blockchain-q1-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">investment is pouring in</a>. Prof Andrei Kirilenko of Imperial College Business School says DLT has the potential to disrupt countless industries and is the \u201cnext big thing\u201d for financial services. \u201cBlockchain, or DLT, is a bunch of computer code that literally anyone with a computer or a smartphone can use to create, exchange and record value,\u201d says Kirilenko. \u201cA very useful side effect of this technology is a complete, immutable and, at the same time, freely observable record of transactions.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/aug/02/blockchain-businesses-embark-on-world-changing-projects\">Blockchain businesses embark on world-changing projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because the blockchain is effectively unhackable, it can work as a highly trusted source of information. This enables users to validate themselves and others, speeding up transactions and trade. \u201cFrom an economist\u2019s perspective, lots of value can be unlocked through this technology by allowing individuals to supply or demand valuable resources without permission from the governments or financial institutions,\u201d Kirilenko adds.</p> <h2><strong>Drones</strong></h2> <p>Dr Kevin Curran, senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, says the rapid advancement of drone technology, combined with a desire to reduce fuel costs, means drones will become commonplace over the next five years \u2013 PwC estimates the market will be <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-09/world-drone-market-seen-nearing-127-billion-in-2020-pwc-says\" rel=\"nofollow\">worth $127bn by 2020</a>. Curran predicts supermarket deliveries, aerial photography, advertising at public events and security/surveillance will all make use of drones soon. But he warns businesses to take note of concerns regarding safety, privacy and of Civil Aviation Authority regulations. \u201cDrones have rapidly developed in a short space of time,\u201d says Curran. \u201cIn the future, we could well see businesses look to the skies.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong></h2> <p>Researchers at Gartner estimate there will be <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3165317\" rel=\"nofollow\">6.4bn \u201cthings\u201d connected to the internet by the end of 2016</a>. Heidi O\u2019Leary, principal consultant at Market Gravity, says she expects to see big growth in \u201csmart home\u201d technology such as smart thermostats, connecting lights and security systems, as well as wearables such as smart watches, fitness and payment devices. O\u2019Leary says many of these products are in their infancy, but expects \u201csubstantial scale over the next five years\u201d, although she says there are still big challenges in convincing consumers there is value in these items. \u201cMost industries are still working out how to create customer value from IoT, and therein lies the opportunity for small businesses and startups,\u201d she says. \u201cEntrepreneurs can act quicker and don\u2019t have to adapt big legacy systems and data architectures to the world of connected devices.

Graham Mackrell, managing director of Harmonic Drive UK, which has created parts for Nasa missions to Mars, says collaborative robots (cobots), which can \u201cmimic and learn\u201d tasks from humans, are set to revolutionise workplaces. There are many applications, he adds, from material handling and automotive manufacturing to dispensing in pharmaceutical and food processing that cobots could help with. \u201cA human worker can stand next to a robot, hold its hand and guide it through a delicate task. This movement is perfectly recorded in real-time and the software can begin to automatically programme the necessary commands, allowing the robot to repeat this task again and again,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>Virtual reality (VR)</strong></h2> <p> Dr Wendy Powell, lecturer in VR at the University of Portsmouth, says the affordability of VR now makes it within reach of even the smallest of businesses. \u201cIt offers a huge range of opportunities for business, from product visualisation to virtual tours, training employees in safety-critical processes, even improving health and wellbeing of staff and customers,\u201d she says. \u201cLarger businesses have been using VR for quite a long time for product design and visualisation, as well as simulation and training. The difference now is that cost is no longer a barrier. Even the smallest business could consider investing in some 3D product marketing, such as a 360-degree video virtual tour.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>3D printing</strong></h2> <p>Prof Hari Mann of Ashridge Executive Education predicts the 3D printing market will revolutionise manufacturing as a whole, enabling the creation of affordable, bespoke products produced locally.

  "<p>In the mid-2000s, the Stung Meanchey landfill in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, had the dubious distinction of being one of the world\u2019s most famous rubbish dumps. It was, in the words of one resident, \u201chell on earth\u201d.</p> <p>Night and day, thousands of waste pickers \u2013 people who gather, sort, reuse and sell the materials others throw away \u2013 toiled on the 100-acre mound of festering rubbish. Families fashioned homes from rubbish, on top of rubbish. They ate rubbish, fought over it \u2013 and even died over it.</p> <p>Children grew up there. Now in his early 30s, Suon Vy was 10 years old when he first saw someone fatally injured. He was helping his parents rummage on the precarious heap when a dump truck careened into a neighbour from a nearby village. The man\u2019s leg was sliced off. \u201cThe older people took him to hospital but finally he died,\u201d says Suon. \u201cI saw many other accidents happen.\u201d</p> <p>There were numerous other hazards. Putrid smoke seeped from the pile and residents had to step over broken glass and medical waste \u2013 one woman even said she stumbled on aborted foetuses among the rubbish. Researchers who studied the dump found dangerous levels of cancer-causing dioxins in the soil and heavy metals in the metabolisms of children working there. People reported the afflictions common to dump life worldwide: diarrhoea, headaches, chest and stomach pain, typhoid and irritation of the skin, nose and eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/50dumps-zip/giv-1406eKsQrpDnnHLR/\" data-alt=\"World's biggest rubbish dumps\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/50dumps-zip/giv-1406eKsQrpDnnHLR/\">World's biggest rubbish dumps</a> </figure>  <p>Ry Mom, an elderly woman with thick black hair, and whose eye has turned red, put it like this: \u201cWe lived in hell because we had no choice.\u201d</p> <p>Around the world, millions of people make a living by waste picking. Some work on the city streets, pushing their carts along the pavement, often at night when there are fewer cars on the roads. Others are drawn to open dumps, where there is an abundant, concentrated supply of sellable material.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe first thing that drives people to work with waste, wherever it is, is destitution \u2013 it\u2019s poverty,\u201d explains Sonia Dias, a leading Brazilian waste expert. Another is bad governance. \u201cIf there are open dumps in a city, it is because the municipality has a lot of issues, including its ability to manage solid waste,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>In October, city leaders and development experts from around the world will convene in Quito, Ecuador, for <a href=\"https://habitat3.org/\">Habitat III</a>, a UN conference held every 20 years.

In Manila, the gritty capital of the Philippines, the notorious Smokey Mountain rubbish dump became a magnet for poor families after an NGO established a school there, according to author Andy Mulligan.</p> <p>He wrote his novel Trash based on his experiences there. \u201cThe slum around the dumpsite started to grow as the news spread: \u2018move to Tondo \u2013 there\u2019s free food and even a school\u2019,\u201d he wrote in an email.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0da9e8ac665f241b588661be6b02000cab4d0a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0da9e8ac665f241b588661be6b02000cab4d0a8/0_119_1983_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children scavenge through rubbish in the notorious Smokey Mountain dump in Manila.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children scavenge through rubbish in the notorious Smokey Mountain dump in Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Nito/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI often say that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s humane to have people working in an open dump,\u201d says Dias. \u201cIt\u2019s a violation of human rights. But, at the same time, you also have to consider that people have to earn a livelihood. You cannot adapt without providing some source of income for people.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1990s, Dias was working with local government in Belo Horizonte, her home city. Back then, about 72% of the country\u2019s municipalities tipped their waste into open dumps \u2013 defined as places where rubbish is simply left to rot \u2013 as opposed to sanitary landfills, which are planned and by definition cannot house waste pickers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My fear is that charity closes down intelligent thinking about injustice</p> <footer> <cite>Andy Mulligan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By 2010, the percentage of municipalities tipping waste into open dumps had fallen to 50% following a mandatory closure order. For some of the waste pickers and recycling collectors, suddenly deprived of their sole source of income, life became harder. The government offered some compensation, but it was hardly a match for their jobs on the dump. Some migrated to smaller, less lucrative \u201cmini-dumps\u201d while others worked on the streets. The same year, the government passed a law ordering cities and private businesses to work with the recycling cooperatives.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s recycling collectors, known as <em>catadores</em>, have a long history of organising. There are more than 1,500 cooperatives spread across the country, together forming a national movement with powerful political force. In S\u00e3o Paolo alone, catadores pick up an estimated 90% of recyclable material.</p> <p>It started, in part, with work done by the Catholic church in the 1980s and 90s. \u201cUsually cooperatives in Brazil \u2013 the initial ones, not now \u2013 were formed by the social work that NGOs from the Catholic church did with informal recyclers,\u201d explains Dias. By 2001, the national movement was formed. As well as lobbying and securing contracts, the cooperatives attempted to help shed the stigma that surrounds their work, staging PR campaigns. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0374cac49296865e9c910415383919bbfe077b15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0374cac49296865e9c910415383919bbfe077b15/0_275_4852_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catadores dig through waste at the Jardim Gramacho landfill in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 before it was permanently closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catadores dig through waste at the Jardim Gramacho landfill in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 before it was permanently closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catadores were charged with the clean-up after this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio. \u201cWaste pickers here, they carried the Olympic torch,\u201d says Dias. \u201cThis gives you an idea of how their profile is changing.

The cooperative she belonged to is family-run and recently they sided with an ex-partner who abuses her, she said. Forced to leave the cooperative, she now works independently on the street, bringing the recyclables to her home and sorting them there. She squats in a shared house with no electricity and no running water. </p> <p>While the cooperative movement in Brazil has not completely spared waste pickers the hardship endured by their peers around the world, getting organised has granted the catadores a measure of something people in their line of work are often denied: dignity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2014/oct/06/world-biggest-most-dangerous-dump-sites-interactive\">The world's biggest and most dangerous dump sites \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Movements similar to Brazil\u2019s have worked \u2013 to an extent \u2013 in other vastly different cultural contexts.

Starmer, touted as a future Labour leader, said his first priority would be to push for more parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has to be democratic grip of the process.

In the home, this could mean allowing the temperature of a freezer to increase by 0.5C to cut demand or turning up a water heater at 1am to utilise spare renewable energy. </p> <p>In the commercial sector, where the technology will be first rolled out, it could mean water company pumps are used at specific times or an office air-conditioning system is adjusted.</p> <p>The development is part of a wholesale change taking place in the energy industry, in which large, centralised fossil-fuel power stations are being replaced by decentralised renewable energy and smart grids. The government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-power-a-national-infrastructure-commission-report\">National Infrastructure Commission</a> (NIC), the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/national-grid-sees-major-boost-for-solar-electric-vehicles-and-batteries\">National Grid</a> and industry group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/28/top-lobbying-group-green-energy-u-turn\">Energy UK</a> have all said an energy \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/national-grid-sees-major-boost-for-solar-electric-vehicles-and-batteries\">revolution</a>\u201d is taking place, delivering a low-carbon system that is more secure, cheaper and faster to build. </p> <p>The NIC recently estimated that UK consumers could <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/505218/IC_Energy_Report_web.pdf\">save \u00a38bn a year by 2030 by adopting smart power technology</a>, while also helping the nation meet its climate change targets.

There are other ways of managing electricity, one of which is carrying knowledge from the telecommunications and software engineering side into the energy sector.\u201d</p> <p>Marc Borrett, RT\u2019s CEO said: \u201cWhat is better? Building a Hinkley, which if it goes down you have lost 7% of the national electricity generation, or building up capacity from many hundreds of thousands of smaller devices around the UK? It needs quite a cultural shift: smaller is better, distributed is better.\u201d</p> <p>Cordi O\u2019Hara, at National Grid, said: \u201cWe are keen to support innovative products like this one that can bring a real benefit for customers. It represents another step forward in the development of the smart grid technologies that are going to play an increasingly important role in the energy systems of the future.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for big six energy company SSE, which was also involved in the trial, said: \u201cInnovation milestones, such as this, will help keep the lights on and offer significant cost savings.\u201d </p> <p>Electricity wires have previously been used to transmit information within homes and local networks, such as rows of street lights, by sending very high frequency data alongside the standard 50Hz signal. But sending messages across the country means going through sub-station transformers, which contain an air gap that cannot pass on the high-frequency data. Instead, using technology developed by former Nokia engineers in Finland, the RT system inserts the data as small changes in the 50Hz signal itself, which does jump the air gap.</p> <p>When electricity demand needs to be ramped up or down, the system broadcasts a message through the grid which is received by the connected appliances. One advantage of the system over the internet and mobile phone networks is that the grid already reaches all electrical devices, even those in remote locations. </p> <p>To test the new technology, RT set up a handful of electrical devices - truck-sized resistors - across the UK to generate the messages and then installed 20 listening receivers in other places, connected only via the National Grid. When the messages were sent out, they were successfully received.</p> <p>RT already runs an <a href=\"https://www.tradenergy.com/\">internet-based demand management system</a>. It expects to have its first commercial customers for the grid-based system within 18 months. </p> <p>Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said: \u201cThis is a really important next step technologically.\u201d </p> <p>She said it would allow customers to choose which appliances are used to manage demand. \u201cThis implies that more people would be content to join [such] programmes \u2013 a very good thing.\u201d But she said government policy had to keep up with the energy revolution by providing a transparent way to pay consumers for the service they provide.</p>",

It was jet black with white underparts, and I could just make out the white tufts on its ears, which confirm it was a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mammal.org.uk/sites/default/files/factsheets/water_shrew_complete.pdf\">water shrew</a><strong tabindex=\"-1\">, </strong><em tabindex=\"-1\">Neomys fodiens</em>.

Water shrews tend to be nocturnal, and are seen most often at dawn, in or by the water. Their velvet-black, waterproof coats protect them and take on a silvery sheen of air bubbles when they dive to hunt for freshwater crustaceans, fly larvae, small fish and frogs.</p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>The transition to a low carbon economy is already happening \u2026 in the Australian Capital Territory, where the local Labor government has legislated for a 100% renewable energy target by the year 2020. </p> <p>But this major achievement is at risk on Saturday when residents of Canberra go to the polls for territory elections. </p> <p>Renewable energy is <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/tv-advertising-campaign-launched-to-preserve-acts-environmental-record-20151216-gloy4u.html\">incredibly popular</a> in Canberra. Eight in 10 Canberrans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/31/most-voters-support-transition-to-100-renewable-energy-says-australia-institute\">support the 100% renewable energy target</a>, and the city has one of the highest domestic installation bases (per capita) of rooftop solar. The reverse auctions that the ACT Labor-Green government used to achieve this target have helped create more than 510 jobs in the renewable energy sector (that\u2019s in the ACT alone \u2013 more have been created in other states where the wind farms are located), most of which are high-tech, high wage, and high skilled. That represents a 400% growth of renewable jobs in just five years, which is six times faster than any other state or territory in Australia.</p> <p>With such high levels of popularity, it is remarkable that the conservative opposition party, the Liberals, has for years opposed expansion of renewable energy. </p> <p>In 2014 the Canberra Liberals complained about the \u201cugly impact\u201d of the renewable energy target. In 2015, they called the target \u201cunfair\u201d. In April this year, they said the 100% target was \u201ctoo much, too fast\u201d. </p> <p>Renewable energy targets have been put back on the political agenda following the blackout in South Australia. Federal Liberal and National party politicians hit the airwaves without waiting for power to be restored to blame renewable energy for the blackout. </p> <p>Climate deniers, fossil fuel lobbyists and conservative politicians have spent the past fortnight tub-thumping for the end of state-based renewable energy targets and a halt to the expansion of new renewable energy construction. </p> <p>We\u2019ve already seen the impact of this kind of scare campaign. </p> <p>The anti-renewable energy policies of the Abbott government, and then the Turnbull government, put investment in renewables at risk over the past few years. By fuelling doubt about the renewable energy target, even threatening to repeal it, large-scale renewable\u2019s investors were scared off. </p> <p>This is important because the renewable energy industry is a big employer with the potential to be even bigger.</p> <p>The solar industry already employs more people than coal-fired generation across the country. In 2014 the solar industry employed more than 13,000 people and even with the uncertainty and watering down of the renewable energy target this is likely to have grown. By comparison, according to the 2011 census 8,000 people worked in fossil fuel electricity generation. Sadly, fossil fuel companies around Australia are betraying the workers who have kept old coal-fired power stations running for decades, with several stations abruptly shut down and the workers abandoned. This underscores the importance of governments committed to a just transition that respects working people and their communities.</p> <p>Across the world the trend is clear. For the last six years in a row renewables outpaced fossil fuels in net investment and capacity additions. New large-scale renewable installations totalled US$286bn in 2016.</p> <p>When the Abbott government announced in 2014 that it wanted to scrap the renewable energy target, no new wind farms were constructed for 16 months because of the policy uncertainty. </p> <p>It was the ACT\u2019s renewable energy target that <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/canberra-leads-the-country-on-clean-energy-20160510-goqll9.html\">ended this drought</a> and <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/acts-renewable-energy-target-broke-investment-drought-report-finds-20161007-grx46r.html\">helped save renewable investment in Australia</a>.</p> <p>With the federal Coalition government again demonising renewables, the states and territories, including the ACT, have stepped in with local targets. </p> <p>It was a bizarre spectacle and deeply damaging to his credibility for the prime minister to use a natural disaster to mount a political attack against state-based renewable energy targets. It was even more unseemly that both the prime minister and the energy minister were politicising the natural disaster while it was still happening. </p> <p>With no evidence, Turnbull and his conservative cheer squad linked the successful South Australian uptake of renewable energy and the blackout. He also took a direct swipe at the Queensland and Victorian renewable energy targets.</p> <p>This is a very different Malcolm Turnbull than the one that said in 2009 that \u201cI will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.\u201d Since taking the prime ministership in 2015 he has adopted almost every policy position of his predecessor Tony Abbott. </p> <p>After spending the past decade condemning, opposing and voting against the ACT\u2019s renewable energy target, the Canberra Liberals have had a, literally, unbelievable conversion. </p> <p>Facing an election where their only major election promise is to rip up contracts to build a solar-powered tram, the Canberra Liberals claim they now support, after years of opposing, renewables. Not once in the past several years has any elected ACT Liberal opposed their federal colleagues extreme position on renewables, or publicly support action on climate change.</p> <p>It is important to remember that in 2013 the Abbott Liberals supported the renewable energy target. Before the election, they stated they would make no change to the policy. Things turned out very different post-election.</p> <p>Renewable energy targets are a very effective way to increase the uptake of renewable energy but they require a government that is committed to achieving them. Without that commitment it is too easy for a government \u2013 which after Saturday\u2019s ACT election could be run by a party that spent a decade opposed to renewables \u2013 to backslide. The uncertainty that would be created for the renewables sector in Canberra, if the Liberals were elected, would be deeply damaging.</p> <p>The ACT renewable energy target requires a government with a genuine commitment to tackling climate change. It needs a government that has a vision for a clean energy city. It needs a government that understands important, but complicated, policy looks like reverse auctions. And it needs a government with ministers who genuinely want to see us transition to a cleaner, low carbon economy and city. </p> <p>The future security of 510 renewable energy jobs in Canberra rest on the outcome of the election this Saturday.</p>",

But by the end of the 1980s that number had fallen to perhaps 200 thanks to a lethal cocktail of dam-building, over-fishing, pollution and boat traffic. By the turn of the century just 13 remained, according to one survey. <br></p> <p>In his book about the baiji\u2019s plight, <a href=\"http://www.edgeofexistence.org/edgeblog/?p=782\">Witness to Extinction</a>, biologist Samuel Turvey described how thousands of years of human activity had decimated the Yangtze basin, a bio-diverse area once regarded as the Amazon of the East. As well as the baiji, the ecosystem was once home to two species of rhinoceros, elephants, gibbons and giant pandas. All have now disappeared. </p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/china-great-famine-book-tombstone\">Great Famine</a> of the late 1950s, when tens of millions of Chinese people starved to death as a result of Mao Zedong\u2019s rule, \u201cthe goddess of the Yangtze became lunch\u201d, Turvey wrote. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt was the dolphins or it was our children,\u201d one Yangtze fisherman is quoted as telling a Hong Kong journalist. \u201cWhich would you choose?\u201d</p> <p>More recently, shipping and catastrophic levels of industrial pollution have taken their toll. China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, this week reported that <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-10/10/c_135743494.htm\">more than 400,000 \u201cchemical enterprises\u201d</a> were operating on the Yangtze\u2019s middle and lower reaches \u2013 around half the country\u2019s total. <br></p> <p>Song said he hoped his team\u2019s unconfirmed baiji sighting would prompt renewed efforts to save the species. He vowed to launch another expedition along the Yangtze early next year. \u201cI want society to realise that the baiji is not extinct,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>However, Turvey, a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who took part in the unsuccessful 2006 search mission, said he was skeptical about the supposed sighting. </p> <p>\u201cExtreme claims for the possible survival of probably extinct species require robust proof, and while I would deeply love there to be strong evidence that the baiji is not extinct, this isn\u2019t it,\u201d the conservation biologist said in an email. </p> <p>\u201cEcologically, the question is: if this is a baiji, where has the species been hiding for the past decade?\u201d Turvey added, pointing out that a previous sighting, in August 2007, had turned out to be a finless porpoise. </p> <p>Turvey said that rather than chasing \u201cthe ghosts of baiji\u201d he believed the world should instead focus on the plight of the Yangtze finless porpoise which was now critically endangered.</p> <p>\u201cThis animal needs urgent media interest and conservation attention in order to combat its total population collapse, while there is still time to do something about it.\u201d<br></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Christy Yao.</em><br></p>"
