  "<p>As someone who has spent much of my career engaged in energy market issues, it has been faintly amusing to read the media and political commentary that has swarmed over South Australia\u2019s blackout and whether or not it was the wind farms that caused it. </p> <p>Normally such serious matters of power system engineering where people\u2019s lives are potentially at risk are left to, well, the power system engineers. </p> <p>That\u2019s what happened in Western Australia when it experienced <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/big-w-a-blackout-cant-be-blamed-on-renewables-doesnt-make-headlines-75160\" rel=\"nofollow\">a blackout</a> on 22 September when 130,000 customers lost power due to a fault with a gas power station. And on 1 October when 24,000 West Australians lost power, the headlines were <a href=\"http://www.skynews.com.au/news/national/wa/2016/10/01/storm-causes-widespread-blackout-in-wa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">storm causes widespread blackout in WA</a>. No one seemed to treat these blackouts as sinister or surprising, and on both occasions, neither the national media nor federal politicians took much notice.</p> <p>But in the case of South Australia, which had just copped an extraordinary once-in-fifty-years storm, no one seemed much interested in waiting for the verdict of power system engineers. And in spite of the stream of photos and videos flooding the internet showing the strewn wreckage of crumpled power lines, as well as swarms of lightning strikes, the media, many senior politicians, and plenty of Twitter-qualified energy experts became electricity system sleuths. They weren\u2019t fooled by such false clues. They asked why the whole system went down and not just one part? Surely this was wind power\u2019s indelible fingerprint at the crime scene.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/the-lights-go-out-in-sa-and-turnbull-flicks-the-switch-to-peak-stupid\">The lights go out in SA and Turnbull flicks the switch to peak stupid | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.aemo.com.au/Media-Centre/-/media/BE174B1732CB4B3ABB74BD507664B270.ashx\" rel=\"nofollow\">report released this week</a> by the Australian Energy Market Operator on events leading to the blackout has only served to reinforce their suspicions that it was caused by the inherent failings of wind power, not an extraordinary storm.</p> <p>They seized upon a subsection of an AEMO press release which stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>Generation initially rode through the faults, but at 16:18hrs, following multiple faults in a short period, 315 MW of wind generation disconnected, affecting the region north of Adelaide. The uncontrolled reduction in generation increased the flow on the main Victorian interconnector [Heywood] to make up the deficit and resulted in the interconnector overloading.</p> </blockquote> <p>So there you go wind farms are bad, fossil fuels are good. </p> <p>But these amateur power system sleuths didn\u2019t seem too interested in asking why these wind farms had disconnected and whether this might be symptomatic of the effect of a very severe storm on any form of power supply. </p> <p>If you read the AEMO report closely, it reveals that the power system north of Adelaide was subject to a barrage of lightning strikes. This led to what AEMO calls in its report a \u201csingle phase to ground fault\u201d. Weather reports indicate that in the few hours surrounding the period of the blackout, the state was subject to over 100,000 lighting strikes. A number of these hit the transmission lines north of Adelaide nearby to a cluster of wind farms. These transmission lines also used to transport power from the now closed Port August coal power stations. Over a few seconds, these lightning strikes took out three of the four major lines. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/energy-storage-how-an-abandoned-goldmine-will-be-converted-into-a-world-first\">Energy storage: how an abandoned goldmine will be converted into a world first</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lightning strikes on power lines flow through to the power stations connected to them. As you can imagine this is dangerous for the power station. Power stations can be designed to ride through a few lighting strikes, but it\u2019s quite probable these wind farms suffered multiple strikes. At such point they would have disconnected to avoid damage. Fossil fuel power stations also don\u2019t cope too well with lightning strikes. In fact one of the fossil fuel power stations AEMO relied upon to restart the power system after the blackout wasn\u2019t operational and this was also likely to be due to lightning damage.</p> <p>What makes this wind farm witch-hunt so farcical is that a similar event involved the Northern coal power station. The closure of this coal power plant has been held up by critics of renewable energy as heralding great threats to SA\u2019s power supplies and a reason to halt further expansion of renewable energy nationally.</p> <p>On 14 March 2005 <em> </em>the 275kV transmission backbone of Northern \u2013 the same as the one that was hit last week \u2013 suffered the same single phase to ground fault, in that case due to dirty insulators. This led to the sudden loss of all Northern\u2019s power. This then induced imports from the interconnector with Victoria to surge to levels just like they did in the recent black out. This caused the interconnector to trip off to avoid damage and so large parts of the state lost power. </p> <p>A major power blackout causes considerable damage and inconvenience to the community and can threaten lives. We should rightly ask whether we might be able to make changes to the system at an affordable cost that could prevent such an event occurring again. Additionally we should consider how we maintain high levels of reliability while incorporating non-polluting power sources reliant on the weather. But can we please leave this to the experts?</p>",
  "<p>Archaeologists have discovered evidence of what they believe is the earliest known journey in British history: a 250-mile trip from York to Wiltshire made 7,000 years ago by a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer and his dog.</p> <p>Scientific investigation of a dog\u2019s tooth found at a site one mile from Stonehenge has thrown up a number of exciting discoveries, said archaeologist David Jacques, who leads the team digging at an <a href=\"http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/research/hri/blickmead\">encampment site called Blick Mead</a>.</p> <p>For one thing, it shows that Mesolithic man was using a domesticated dog, probably for hunting. But more fascinating is that the animal originally came from an area that is now the Vale of York, suggesting the pair made a long, gruelling journey.</p> <p>Jacques said the findings showed the dog and people with it came to what is now Wiltshire. This is the earliest evidence of a journey that has been unearthed in Britain.</p> <p>The clinching evidence was found by researchers at Durham University, who carried out an isotope analysis of the tooth enamel, which showed the dog drank water that came from the Vale of York area. They also speculate that the dog would have been roughly the same size, shape and colour of an alsatian, albeit more wolf-like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"471240500a6b9279a8c0095b0afe4547a7f0d1df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/471240500a6b9279a8c0095b0afe4547a7f0d1df/0_104_1378_827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Jacques in Blick Mead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Jacques in Blick Mead.

Jacques and his team believe people were coming to the spot over a near 4,000-year period, from 7900BC to 4000BC. </p> <p>\u201cIt is an amazing sequence,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is nothing like it in Europe and now we\u2019ve got this evidence from the dog you start to piece it together. You can see that this place seems to have special to not just local people, it seems to have been drawing in people from long distances away and the sort of distances you would not expect for mobile hunter-gatherers.\u201d</p> <p>Jacques has led <a href=\"http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/research/hri/blickmead\">University of Buckingham digs at Blick Mead</a> for nearly a decade, believing the area is key to the beginnings of people living in Britain because evidence of occupancy covers such a long period of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c0217e286c5fe324bc78d69857dee3c5db3013e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c0217e286c5fe324bc78d69857dee3c5db3013e/177_0_4265_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lorry drives near Stonehenge in Wiltshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archaeologists have criticised plans to construct a 1.8-mile tunnel past Stonehenge in Wiltshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other discoveries include evidence of Mesolithic people feasting on huge oxen, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/20/shifting-sands-time\">aurochs</a>, salmon, trout, hazelnuts and even frog\u2019s legs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/15/wiltshire-dig-frogs-legs-eaten-british-before-french\">about eight millennia before they became a French staple</a>.</p> <p>Jacques believes Blick Mead is crucial to our understanding of the stone circle at Stonehenge, erected in the late Neolithic period, at about 2500BC</p> <p>\u201cDiscoveries like this give us a completely new understanding of the establishment of the ritual landscape and make Stonehenge even more special than we thought we knew it was,\u201d said Jacques.</p> <p>It raises the question of why people would travel such long distances to get to the site. \u201cIt makes us wonder if this place is a hub point, a really important place for the spread of ideas, new technologies and probably genes,\u201d said Jacques.</p> <p>\u201cYou have small dispersed populations of people in Britain and people are probably getting it together and families are coming out of that. In a sense it is probably quite a multicultural environment.\u201d</p> <p>The Blick Mead site is close to the busy A303 and only 100 metres from the site of a proposed 1.8-mile tunnel, which would remove the road from the Stonehenge site.</p> <p>Jacques is firmly against a tunnel, fearing it could alter the water table and make it impossible to continue digging at Blick Mead. \u201cIt would be devastating if the tunnel obliterated our chance of piecing together the jigsaw to explain why Stonehenge was built,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e62731dc1c7dc2c1888c0f0666d87a1549aae466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62731dc1c7dc2c1888c0f0666d87a1549aae466/0_0_2035_3053/667.jpg\" alt=\"Examination of a trench in Blick Mead has led to the discovery of a charred toad\u2019s leg, bones of trout or salmon as well as the remains of cooked aurochs.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Examination of a trench in Blick Mead has led to the discovery of a charred toad\u2019s leg, bones of trout or salmon as well as the remains of cooked aurochs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Buckingham/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stonehenge-landscape/features/tunnel-will-remove-a303-from-stonehenge-landscape\">The tunnel is supported by the National Trust</a> and Historic England, which believe the road is a blight.</p> <p>Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, said the discoveries were rewriting the history books of Mesolithic Britain. \u201cBlick Mead is without doubt one of the greatest national discoveries ever made in the Stonehenge landscape. </p> <p>\u201cAs we edge towards a road improvement plan that could see a disastrous, ineffective tunnel, I desperately hope Historic England and the National Trust recognise what a key site this is and ensure it is protected and preserved so that we can carry on unlocking the history of Stonehenge.\u201d</p> <p>Historic England said any tunnel was likely to be well away from the Blick Mead site. </p> <p>Phil McMahon, inspector of ancient monuments for Historic England in the south west said<strong>:</strong> \u201cThere\u2019s no scheme available yet to understand the exact impacts of any road improvement proposal.</p> <p>\u201cBut from our work on possible tunnel locations advising Department for Transport and Highways England over the past two and a half years, we understand that any tunnel scheme is likely to be well away from the Blick Mead site.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One evening, about 10 years ago, I turned down the volume on my compact disc player and used the phone attached to a wall to call my girlfriend. Later, she got a taxi back to our home and we watched a movie hired from the local video store.

On the other hand \u2013 to pick just one economic indicator \u2013 almost <a href=\"http://www.ceda.com.au/2015/06/16/five-million-Aussie-jobs-gone-in-10-to-15-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">40%</a> of Australian jobs have a likelihood of disappearing in the next 10 to 15 years because of the tech revolution.</p> <p>The future of work will be made up of jobs that don\u2019t yet exist within industries and using technologies that are new, in planetary conditions that no human being has ever experienced. Given that there is no status quo option, we need a fundamental debate over the shape and purpose of the new economy. How do we achieve a new economy squarely in the service of society, not only geared towards ecological limits, but also oriented to fairness and justice? </p> <p>First, we need a language that evokes a different set of values and priorities to the status quo. Last year when the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/launch-of-the-national-innovation-and-science-agenda1\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> the people of Australia as \u201cassets\u201d and \u201chuman capital\u201d, he gave expression to a whole value system that sees us foremost as economic units and everything we do and experience in life as ripe for commodification. When the terms of debate are limited to the language and concepts of bankers and management consultants, there can be no broader vision and no recourse to deeper values. </p> <p>Second, we must understand that policy follows power. In contested areas of public life, it is the ideas with the greatest political force behind them that will triumph. In national policy debates, the <a href=\"https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/opinion/topic/2016/07/02/how-business-lobbyists-trump-your-vote/14673816003445\" rel=\"nofollow\">power of vested interests</a> \u2013 fossil fuel miners, big banks and the like \u2013 can be overcome only through organised people. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accordingly, ensuring that the rules of the new economy are defined for the common good is above all a challenge of political cooperation. Anyone who wants a fairer and more sustainable Australia needs to reach out to others to seek common cause in a collaborative vision. A sufficiently powerful coalition will require alliances across classes, engaging progressive movements, existing social institutions and socially embedded business. </p> <p>Third, we must remind ourselves who is in charge here. It is essential that changes in technology are the subject of democratic debate and control. Tech shapes our practical access to rights and freedoms and shapes our human subjectivity in all kinds of ways. </p> <p>Yet from augmented reality to artificial intelligence, technological change is too often regarded, fatalistically, as inevitable or even as outside of politics altogether. And we seem curiously untroubled by the monumental concentration of power in global tech corporations. We need to think about tech more actively and more critically, grasping the enormous potential for good, while guarding against the potential for tyranny.</p> <p>The fourth industrial revolution contains enormous emancipative power \u2013 if we can get the politics sorted out. The future is still open. It is up to the power of organised people to ensure that the new economy serves the greater good, not just narrow vested interests. </p> <p>Primacy has to go to the urgent just transition to a low carbon economy because everything else depends on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>If we want to see a new Australian economy built on fairness, kindness, justice and sustainability then we must use the language and assemble the alliances necessary to provide the political momentum for our vision to be both imagined and realised. <em> </em></p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s core supporters may back his views on curbing immigration \u2013 but they disagree with him over global trade and US involvement in Nato, an opinion poll has found.</p> <p>Trump has made opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal between the US and Asia a central theme of his populist campaign, but more of his base favour it (49%) than oppose it (46%), according to the <a href=\"https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/america-age-uncertainty?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ccs-report\">2016 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey</a>.</p> <p>In another surprising finding, despite Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/07/03/484574128/sanders-centers-platform-fight-on-trans-pacific-trade-deal\">vocal criticism of the TPP</a> during the Democratic primary, some 56% of his supporters back the agreement, as do 74% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>The annual survey suggests a gap between the views of those who shout loudest during the presidential election and the more nuanced positions of many Democratic and Republican voters on the ground, most of whom want America to remain engaged with the world.</p> <p>As expected, immigration does seem to be a vote winner for Trump, who has been accused of inciting hatred and violence. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video\">Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigrants</a> and refugees has most clearly struck a chord with his base,\u201d notes the report, published on Thursday. \u201cOn each and every question concerning immigration, Trump\u2019s core supporters are the least favorable.\u201d</p> <p>An overwhelming majority of core Trump supporters (80%) agree that immigration is a critical threat to the US \u2013 almost double the percentage among the general public (43%). Six in 10 Trump supporters believe that undocumented immigrants in the US should be forced to leave their jobs, and the country. And nine in 10 Trump supporters support \u201cexpanding the 700 miles of border wall and fencing with Mexico\u201d. The public overall is divided on expanding the wall, and 58% support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>On other issues, however, Trump\u2019s regular battle cries appear to have less resonance. Although the Republican candidate said in July that \u201cNato is obsolete\u201d and complained that \u201cmany member countries [are] not paying their fair share\u201d, 51% of his followers want to keep the US commitment to the military alliance as it is now and 9% actually want to increase it. Just 13% favour withdrawal from Nato.<br></p> <p>While Trump has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy</a> and said US allies must pay for the cost of being defended, his backers are equally or more likely than other Americans to support long-term US military bases in Australia, Germany, Japan and South Korea.</p> <p>Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/public-opinion-and-americas-next-global-priorities\">told an audience at the Wilson Center thinktank</a> in Washington on Thursday: \u201cThe numbers are quite surprising. Even among core Trump supporters, 60% think that the United States should either maintain or increase its commitment to Nato. It\u2019s 75% for Americans overall. That\u2019s a remarkable number.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gratifying to see that in this, and in fact in so many other aspects of the poll, you find an American public that remains dedicated to the kind of open, engaged foreign policy and global engagement that we in many ways have taken for granted for a very long time and has been the basis until very recently of a bipartisan political consensus in this country.\u201d</p> <p>A decade ago more Republicans than Democrats said globalisation had been good for the US, but now 74% of Democrats view globalisation in a positive light compared with 59% of Republicans. Daalder added: \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strong number. You wouldn\u2019t know that if you talked to any congressman or senator from the Democratic party. Maybe one or two dinosaurs are still there but there are not many of them.\u201d</p> <p>The findings suggest that politicians are not always in touch with the public mood, Kori Schake, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said during the same panel discussion: \u201cOne of the things that I found most interesting in the numbers is that 56% of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters support the TPP. A vast majority of Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters support it and you would never know that from listening to the campaign rhetoric.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\">Clinton has joined Sanders and Trump </a>in opposing the TPP in what some see as an expedient move, although Schake speculated that, if elected, she might find a way to modify it while keeping it essentially intact.</p> <p>The survey was conducted from 10 to 27 June among a representative national sample of 2,061 adults. The label of \u201ccore Trump supporter\u201d was based on respondents\u2019 answer to a presidential preference question.</p> <p>The report concludes: \u201cThe changing demographic makeup of America will likely transform the political dynamics, given that younger and non-white Americans are more supportive of globalization, immigration and increasing ties to the world. But in the near term, the attitudes and opinions that brought Trump to the fore of American politics will remain \u2013 and could very well strengthen.\u201d</p>",

So we have a choice \u2013 retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.\u201d </p> <p>In an election year characterised by a wave of anti-trade sentiment from Trump and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders, Obama contends that globalisation has been by far a net positive for the American economy.</p> <p>\u201cLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade,\u201d Obama contends. \u201cWhile some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Clinton has joined Trump and Sanders in speaking out against the TPP, although some analysts suspect that, should she win the presidency, she will seek to repackage the deal in a manner that allows her to approve it. Obama pledges to keep pushing for Congress to pass the TPP because, he says, it will level the playing field for workers and businesses.</p> <p>In an obvious swipe at Trump, Obama writes of the current air of discontent: \u201cThe anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798</a>, the Know-Nothings of the mid-1800s, the anti-Asian sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again.\u201d</p> <p>But he acknowledges that some of the unrest is rooted in \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality resulting in slower income growth for low- and middle-income families. The financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/2016-economy-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-reagan\">Back to the future: economy becomes battle between Reagan and Bill Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton is attempting a broad church election campaign that embraces some ideas from Sanders, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn\">a self-proclaimed socialist</a>, but also has the centrist Obama as a leading surrogate. During an electrifying primary campaign, Sanders argued for the breakup of the Wall Street banks. But the president urges against quick fix solutions. </p> <p>\u201cFurther progress requires recognising that America\u2019s economy is an enormously complicated mechanism,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract \u2013 breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports \u2013 the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people.\u201d</p> <p>Obama does, however, devote a section of the essay to widening inequality \u2013 a key theme of Sanders and Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eugene-robinson-elizabeth-warren-makes-the-case-on-income-inequality/2014/10/20/ba54c68e-588a-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2_story.html?utm_term=.36595d694337\">senator Elizabeth Warren</a> \u2013 and its negative economic and moral consequences. In 1979, he says, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all after-tax income; by 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We don\u2019t begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, we\u2019ve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better.\u201d</p> <p>He cites technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage as factors in growing inequality. \u201cBut I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels \u2013 at church, at their children\u2019s schools, in civic organisations.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why CEOs took home about 20 to 30 times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why today\u2019s CEO is now paid over 250 times more.\u201d</p> <p>He urges the next occupant of the White House: \u201cIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition.\u201d</p> <p>He also calls for increasing the federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children and limiting tax breaks for high-income households.</p> <p>Obama further notes that in 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the workforce. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of prime-age women were out of the workforce. Today, it is 26%.</p> <p>\u201cInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among non-college-educated Americans \u2013 the group where labour-force participation has fallen most precipitously.\u201d</p> <p>Obama proposes increasing access to community colleges and providing wage insurance to those workers who cannot find a job that pays as well as their previous one. He says paid leave and guaranteed sick leave would also encourage flexibility that could lead to more people working. </p> <p>Championing the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2008 financial crisis from turning into a great depression, Obama says a foundation was laid for a better future. He suggests that the US should prepare for negative shocks to the economy before they occur and not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,\u201d he writes. </p>",

But he said growth should not be based on low-paid, low-skilled, migrant labour. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last few years is an economy that is growing, but GDP per capita has hardly grown at all. We need to see our economic expansion coming from an improvement in productivity, not simply from bringing ever larger numbers of low skilled people into the economy.\u201d</p> <p>In his charm offensive with Wall Street firms he is thought to have taken a constructive approach to concerns about how access to the EU might be maintained in the run-up to Brexit.

Gjurovski always ignored him.</p> <p>\u201cOne day, when I drive past, I want to look around and say to my grandchildren, \u2018this place is still going.

In love with the job and with the people.\u201d</p> <p>Zarogiannis and Gjurovski are not outliers. According to a survey by the Australian Catholic University, workers in Victoria\u2019s automotive industry averaged 50 years of age and 19 years with the same company. Were it not for the shutdown, they would stay with Ford until retirement. Of the 67% who said they intended to keep working, survey author Dr Tom Barnes said, about half said they wanted to keep working in the same field.</p> <p>That field is rapidly clearing. When Zarogiannis retired in 2008, Mitsubishi had just ceased production at its South Australian plant. Since then General Motors/Holden and Toyota have announced they would follow Ford in moving production offshore. Both will have closed their Australian factories by the end of 2017.</p> <p>Of the 409 people surveyed, Barnes said, 87% had not yet tried to find a new job even though 49% expected to be made redundant.</p> <p>\u201cSome of them have been to some extent institutionalised, and some of them will struggle with a working environment that is different to that,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A similar study by Flinders University of Mitsubishi workers 18 months after the closure of its Adelaide factory found high levels of job instability, with 38% having been through two or more jobs in the previous year.</p> <p>Workers from Ford are expected to fare better. They will leave with an average payout of $150,000, equivalent to two year\u2019s pay, and be connected to a job placement company that in 2014 had a 100% success rate in placing people made forcibly redundant from the company. They have been offered literacy and numeracy classes, been bussed to job fairs, and been connected to training opportunities in the industry of their choice.</p> <p>More than half of those made redundant have taken some form of training, a Ford spokeswoman said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people, they are never going to find a secure job like Ford</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Zarogianni</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have seen good and bad examples of [car companies managing redundancies], and this is the best,\u201d Dave Smith, the national secretary of the AMWU\u2019s vehicle division, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey will come out job-ready.\u201d</p> <p>There is still work in manufacturing near Broadmeadows, particularly in local caravan-building businesses, but the hourly rate is two-thirds the $30 to $33 paid at Ford.

  "<p>This year, green chemistry celebrates its 25th birthday.

Join The Guardian for this one-day event</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As green chemistry prepares to enter its next quarter century, we asked some pioneers in the field to tell us about some of its most important advancements. Here\u2019s what they told us.</p> <h2>Petroleum made in a lab?</h2> <p><em>Martin Mulvihill, co-founder and former director of the <a href=\"http://live-bcgc.pantheon.berkeley.edu/\">Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry</a> and co-founder of Safer Made, a venture capital fund that invests in the latest green chemistry technologies.</em></p> <p>\u201cOne of the most influential trends has been the move to bio-based feedstocks for chemistry. Historically, chemistry has relied on petroleum based products, which means that we have to extract petroleum from the ground, transport it and process it. As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fracking\">recent problems with fracking show</a>, that\u2019s expensive and environmentally damaging.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done with these products, they don\u2019t biodegrade; instead, they pile up in landfills and in the ocean. It\u2019s interesting that people think that our leftover plastic and other products are just going to disappear: fossils fuels are the remains of organic matter that have managed to stay around for millions of years. What makes us think that [plastics] are going to go away just because we\u2019re done with them?</p> <p>\u201cScientists have begun using microorganisms to biosynthesize materials, which means that, rather than using chemicals that come from oil, we\u2019re growing our chemicals in the lab. In the future, it\u2019s entirely possible that the basic building blocks of our chemistry will come from biomass, including food and crop waste. In other words, this biotechnology revolution will help us use our waste to make new materials.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of the most exciting new areas of chemistry, and it provides us with an opportunity to design safer and more sustainable chemicals. Companies like Amyris, BioAmber and Elevance are already commercializing this process, and the next generation of chemists are already beginning to reach for biosynthesized materials, rather than petroleum based ones. It\u2019s a vast change, and it\u2019s transforming the way we develop and manufacture products.\u201d</p> <h2>A BPA-free future</h2> <p><em>David Levine is the co-founder and CEO of the <a href=\"http://asbcouncil.org/\">American Sustainable Business Council</a>, a coalition of business organizations dedicated to building a more sustainable, less toxic economy.</em></p> <p>\u201cThe biggest advancement in green chemistry has been a shift in consciousness and practice. The public has become aware of the need for and value of green chemistry and companies have become aware of the economic opportunities that it offers \u2013 as well as the danger of not taking advantage of them, which the<a href=\"http://asbcouncil.org/sites/default/files/asbcsaferchemicalsreportpresred.pdf\"> 2015 report by the American Sustainable Business Council, GC3 and Trucost</a> demonstrate.</p> <p>\u201cNalgene\u2019s bottle recall in 2008 is a perfect example. The presence of BPA in plastic bottles became a major media story and captured the public\u2019s interest. The public demanded action on numerous products, from baby bottles to the water bottles that college students were toting around. Within a year, many companies were changing their production to cut BPA out of their products. And those that didn\u2019t watched their reputations \u2013 and their market share \u2013 evaporate.</p> <p>\u201cToday, you walk into every store and see \u2018BPA free\u2019 products on the shelves. There are new plants, new advertising, new products. Consumers are demanding products without hazardous chemicals, companies are realizing that they can be responsible, innovate and improve their profits, and regulators and legislators are realizing that they can provide more comprehensive regulations. Green chemistry is providing an opportunity for a stronger economy and a healthier society.\u201d</p> <h2>Breathing new life into greenhouse gases</h2> <p><em>Libby Bernick is senior vice president, North America for <a href=\"http://www.trucost.com/\">Trucost</a>, a research firm that measures the way that companies use natural resources.</em></p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest advancements in green chemistry is the growth in manufacturers that are starting to use pollution as a raw material for making their products.</p> <p>\u201cThis is incredibly significant: according to the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2016/press-releases/\">World Economic Forum</a>, the biggest risk currently facing our society is its failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change. We\u2019re continuing to produce greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, which are leading to further climate change that will, in turn, have massive financial implications for the economy. </p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s another approach that we can take. Instead of looking at methane and carbon dioxide as an inevitable byproduct of manufacturing, companies like <a href=\"http://www.novomer.com/\">Novomer</a> and <a href=\"http://newlight.com/\">Newlight</a> are seeing it as an opportunity. They\u2019re using it to make new products: Newlight makes a price-competitive plastic, and Novomer makes chemicals that can be used to produce anything from diapers to paints. In so doing, both companies are creating new markets and new economic opportunities.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/02/antibacterial-soaps-banned-us-fda\">Antibacterial soaps banned in US amid claims they do 'more harm than good'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Letting nature do the heavy lifting</h2> <p><em>Larry Weiss is the chief medical officer at <a href=\"http://aobiome.com/\">AOBiome</a>, which develops bacteria-based hygiene products. He also founded <a href=\"http://www.cleanwelltoday.com/\">CleanWell</a>, which uses botanical chemicals in its disinfectants.</em></p> <p>\u201cThe biggest advancement in green chemistry has been a shift in our relationship to chemicals. Rather than figuring out which chemical to use, we\u2019re figuring out how to use fewer chemicals \u2013 or none at all.</p> <p>\u201cThe recent ban on triclosan, an antibacterial chemical, is a perfect example. <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/media/2013/131122\">Since the 1970s</a>, the FDA has been questioning triclosan\u2019s use in consumer products, but real change didn\u2019t start until 2010, when the Natural Resources Defense Council sued the FDA [and forced] them to issue a final rule. That year, <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/media/2010/100408\">the FDA stated</a> that triclosan was no better than soap and water at preventing infections, and that it may even contribute to antibiotic resistance.</p> <p>\u201cSince then, awareness has grown. And now, after years of litigation, the FDA has ruled that, within a year, no company can market antibacterial soap that contains triclosan, tricarbon and several other chemicals. We have decided to stop using a chemical that was marketed as a value-add, but which actually had negative effects.</p> <p>\u201cOur entire economic architecture is designed to create needs and then fill them. But what if we designed products with positive long term effects? What if our chemistry was focused on making health a primary design parameter, so that our products slowly made us healthier over time? That\u2019s the challenge \u2013 and the greatest advance \u2013 of green chemistry. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re slowly becoming aware that, rather than experiencing better living through chemistry, we might have better living with less chemistry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Irish authorities have conducted a series of raids on fishing vessels in ports around the country as part of an investigation into the use of undocumented migrant workers.</p> <p>The Irish police, the Gardai, declined to comment on the operation, saying it was not yet complete. But it is understood from local sources that officers from its immigration unit, together with the Irish navy, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners targeted trawlers in Castletownbere, in County Cork, and Howth in Dublin on Wednesday. They moved on to other key fishing ports on Thursday.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the operation was undertaken as part of the Santa Marta project \u2013 the initiative led by the pope to tackle human trafficking and modern-day slavery. The project has made the exploitation of migrants in the global fishing sector one of its priorities. Local media reported that the raid teams were focusing on the routes used by Asian and African migrant fishermen to enter Ireland. </p> <p> An <a href=\"http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/publications/2015/TaskForceReport141215.pdf\">emergency taskforce</a> was set up by the Irish government last year to tackle the illegal employment of Asian and African migrants in its fleet. The government said in February it would issue up to 500 specially created work permits for fishermen from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) after allegations that they were being exploited as cheap labour.</p> <p>Senior figures in the industry had predicted that at least 1,000 work permits would be needed to ensure the protection of all non-EEA fishermen working in the Irish fleet. Only some 160 permits had been applied for by the scheme\u2019s deadline.</p> <p>Sources said the operation this week was also aimed at checking whether the permit scheme was working. The fishermen\u2019s union, the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF), welcomed the police checks, saying its own port visits in recent months suggested some boat owners were still using undocumented labour and refusing to apply for permits for their workers.</p> <p>The permit scheme requires owners to register, provide a solicitor-backed contract to workers, and pay the legal minimum wage. ITF\u2019s Ireland coordinator, Ken Fleming, said strong enforcement action was needed \u201cto end the widespread abuse of vulnerable fishers by unscrupulous employers\u201d.</p> <p>Several Filipino workers have used the scheme to regularise their position after years of working in the state illegally. They told us how happy they were to be properly documented and free to visit their families back home and return to work.</p> <p>However, migrant support groups expressed concern that the raids were focused on immigration breaches rather than labour exploitation. The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland said it has been contacted by several fishermen who had been put on notice to report to immigration authorities following the raids. \u201cNo one asked them about their employment conditions or checked for human trafficking. They are targeting those we most need to help rather than unscrupulous owners,\u201d said Gr\u00e1inne O\u2019Toole, an MRCI coordinator. </p>",
  "<p>So much for the idea that easyJet could improve its profits every year. Those investors who enjoyed the shares\u2019 splendid run from 300p in 2011 to \u00a318 in 2015 have discovered that volatility has not been abolished in the airline game. EasyJet says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/easyjet-set-for-annual-profit-fall-year-extraordinary-events\">its profits will fall 28%</a> in the financial year that closed last month. Its shares have almost halved in value in 12 months and now stand at 933p, down 7% on Thursday.</p> <p>The vote for Brexit is merely the lesser of two upsets. A weak sterling has been unhelpful to the tune of \u00a390m for a company that flies over so much eurozone airspace and pays so many landing charges in euros. The greater impact has come from disruption, strikes by air-traffic controllers and the effects of terrorist attacks in Nice, Paris and Brussels.</p> <p>Revenue per seat is running at 8% below last year, sending a strong signal that, behind a year of \u201cextraordinary events\u201d, there is a European short-haul market that simply has too much capacity. Cheap oil has encouraged too much expansion. Don\u2019t worry, the chief executive, Dame Carolyn McCall, says soothingly, \u201cthe current environment is tough for all airlines, but history shows that at times like this the strongest airlines become stronger\u201d.</p> <p>Ultimately, she\u2019s right. EasyJet still expects to make pre-tax profits of about \u00a3490m in the year. That is a commanding position from which to sit back and wait for weak airlines to shrink, go bust or seek shelter. The trouble is, the wait can be long in an industry where optimism is ingrained. Air Berlin is slashing capacity after being thrown a lifeline by Lufthansa but easyJet (and Ryanair for that matter) would prefer to see more radicalism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, easyJet itself has been adding capacity \u2013 6% last year, 8% this year. A cheerful interpretation says the new routes will intensify rivals\u2019 pain and bring long-term reward. Alternatively, easyJet has stepped up expansion at the wrong moment.</p> <p>A comfort for shareholders is a chunky dividend set at 50% of post-tax earnings, giving a yield of 5.7% at the reduced share price. But prospects for earnings themselves are the real worry. One tough year could be viewed as exceptional, but the City is expecting at least three before the clouds clear. That is how life used to run for airlines, and probably does still.</p> <h2>Tough tactics backfire for HarbourVest\u2019s bid for SVG Capital</h2> <p>It ought to be hard to lose a \u00a31bn takeover bid when you start with 51% support and are offering hard cash. Yet HarbourVest, the Boston outfit stalking the quoted private equity fund SVG Capital, looks to be heading for defeat.</p> <p>At the eleventh hour, SVG has produced a more convincing white knight than it had managed to previously. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> plus a Canadian pension fund \u2013 two credible outfits \u2013 have put an offer on the table worth about 680p a share, versus HarbourVest\u2019s 650p.</p> <p>Conceivably, SVG shareholders could still prefer the lower offer because it is more certain and the cash would arrive sooner. But that\u2019s not the way to bet. Two big institutions, Aviva Investors and Legal &amp; General Investment Management, have withdrawn their support for HarbourVest\u2019s proposal and SVG\u2019s share price, at 667p, says the Goldman consortium will win.</p> <p>The difference between the two offers works out at about \u00a335m \u2013 almost nothing in the context of \u00a31bn contest \u2013 but HarbourVest cannot match Goldman\u2019s price because it declared its bid \u201cfinal\u201d on day one. Aggression appears to have backfired. For the sake of a cherry on top of the cake, HarbourVest will probably lose. Well played, SVG chair Lynn Fordham, for scratching out a few extra quid for her shareholders, but HarbourVest\u2019s tactics were baffling.</p> <h2>Andrew Tyrie: board record-keepers must do better</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1aa4d7b6f60f2e2fdac858d265420b813950ea9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aa4d7b6f60f2e2fdac858d265420b813950ea9d/553_0_1863_2329/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Tyrie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poor minuting of board meetings means lessons may not be learned when businesses fail, says Andrew Tyrie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Lean/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fastidious Andrew Tyrie strikes again.

He is also right to do so.<br></p> <p>Tyrie\u2019s complaint is that the minutes of the failed Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS were next to useless for investigators conducting postmortems. If the non-executive directors were doing their job of challenging management and assessing risks, it was impossible to tell from written records. Disagreements weren\u2019t routinely recorded, so the minutes could not serve as a \u201cblack box\u201d to help prevent future mistakes. Sort it out, Tyrie told the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (Icsa) last year.</p> <p>The body has failed to do so, says Tyrie now. Its response is \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d because it clings to the idea that directors must actively demand that their dissent be noted, he suggests. That, as Tyrie implies, seems unhelpful and defensive.</p> <p>Simon Osborne, who might have expected a quiet life as chief executive of Icsa, is the man in the firing line. \u201cI would be very grateful if Icsa could take another look,\u201d writes Tryie, terribly politely. Translation: do so before I summon the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England.</p>",
  "<p>A Texas man will attempt to become the first person to swim across the Pacific Ocean next year, after almost five years of setbacks.<br></p> <p>Benoit Lecomte, 49, revealed his intentions at the University of Texas at Austin on Thursday. He says he will set off from Tokyo in April 2017 and \u2013 conditions and sharks willing \u2013 arrive in San Francisco five to six months later. He hopes the swim will raise awareness of environmental issues.</p> <p>It is the third time in under five years that Lecomte has announced he plans to swim the Pacific. He was originally due to begin the quest in May 2013. After that attempt was foiled, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/25/swim-across-pacific-ocean-texas-architect-benoit-lecomte-environment-pollution\">he announced</a> that he would begin the swim in December 2015. This time he is confident his attempt will go ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThe main issue has always been the boat,\u201d Lecomte said. He has pursued two different boating options in the past four years. He abandoned plans to use one vessel after the captain had a heart attack. Another boat, called Stella, was deemed unsuitable when it turned out the boat was a unique build, with no blueprints available should anything go wrong at sea.</p> <p>This time will be different, Lecomte said. He has purchased a boat, the Discoverer, that has been previously used in the Global Challenge, a round-the-world-yacht race. He is confident in its seaworthiness.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have any issues with the owner and the skipper is in our team,\u201d Lecomte said. \u201cIt\u2019s a boat has been used to being in offshore situations, it has been proven and it has a steel hull so it is very strong.\u201d</p> <p>Lecomte is originally from France but has been based in Austin for more than 20 years. In 1998 he became the first person to swim the Atlantic Ocean, completing the 3,700-mile swim in 73 days. This latest challenge dwarfs even that feat, however \u2013 Lecomte will need to swim 5,500 miles to make it to San Francisco.</p> <p>He will swim for an average of eight hours a day, resting and eating on the Discoverer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"469d63305c50d2d2e25deff61d9765149295ce53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/469d63305c50d2d2e25deff61d9765149295ce53/0_46_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benoit Lecomte swimming\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lecomte was followed by a shark for five days during his swim across the Atlantic in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: thelongestswim.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The swim will take Lecomte through the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2013 a vast area of floating waste that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/04/great-pacific-garbage-patch-ocean-plastic-trash\">scientists believe</a> spans 1,351,000 sq miles. Lecomte said he was inspired to swim the Pacific after noticing changes in the ocean.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing open-water swims for a very long time and I have seen the changes in the ocean, the environment,\u201d Lecomte said. \u201cMore plastic, less fish, and every time I swim with my kids I always think about what type of world I am going to leave behind.</p> <p>\u201cIt became very clear to me that the only way to go forward was to use my passion to get attention on an issue that affects all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Lecomte will be accompanied by an eight-person crew which will use scientific equipment \u2013 provided by Nasa and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, among other organisations \u2013 to gather samples during the crossing. They will hand over their findings to a team of oceanographers on their return.</p> <p>When Lecomte swam the Atlantic he was followed by a shark for five days. He said he hopes to see sharks during his Pacific swim \u201cbecause if we don\u2019t see them, it will say a lot about their state\u201d.<br></p> <p>His team will use an electromagnetic field to prevent sharks from eating him. Sharks use special receptors, located on their head and snout, to sense the electrical fields of objects in the water. Creating an electro-magnetic field can disrupt those receptors and harmlessly deter the shark from attacking. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sharkbanz.com/technology/\">Sharkbanz</a>, a manufacturer of magnetic shark-repellant bracelets, likened the shark\u2019s experience to \u201ca person suddenly shining a very bright light in your eyes in a dark room\u201d.</p> <p>Away from marine life, Lecomte said the most difficult part of the swim will be dealing with the isolation of swimming alone for eight hours every day.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge is to keep your mind sane and to be focused. It\u2019s mind over matter,\u201d he said. Lecomte has been training on land to be able to \u201cdisassociate\u201d his mind from his body.</p> <p>\u201cBefore going in the morning I know exactly what I am going to do with my mind, hour by hour. I\u2019ll be making my own movies, creating my own buildings, and reliving moments I lived in the past and engaging all my senses so I can remember what I was doing very precisely. </p> <p>\u201cRemembering how the smell was, how the wind was, the sun on my skin, to be very detailed about all those elements.

  "<p>Journalism has always had an ambivalent relationship with respectability. The noblest ambition of the press is to hold power to account on behalf of the powerless, which means behaving in a way that sustains the trust of a wide audience while sometimes upsetting those in authority. If newspapers never caused controversy they would not be doing their job properly. If they are deemed to be routinely scurrilous their authority is&#xa0;diminished.</p> <p>Sometimes pursuit of the truth will lead journalists to deploy subterfuge. When breaching walls of official secrecy, for example, the greater good might even be served by breaking the law. But the decision to embark on that path is, or should be, felt as an acute ethical dilemma requiring examination of conscience and the highest standard of public interest.</p> <p>That test was not met by Mazher Mahmood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/fake-sheikh-mazher-mahmood-tulisa-contostavlos-trial\" title=\"\">convicted on Wednesday</a> of perverting the course of justice in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/02/tulisa-contostavlos-fake-sheikh-simon-hattenstone\" title=\"\">trial of Tulisa Contostavlos</a> \u2013 a pop star inveigled into offering to broker a drug deal by the Sun on Sunday\u2019s star investigative reporter. Mahmood and his driver, Alan Smith, were found to have conspired in the revision of a police statement, excising information that might have helped Ms Contostavlos\u2019s defence. (The case against her collapsed.) This is the opposite of pursuing the truth, the antithesis of decent journalism. Inevitably, questions are being raised about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/new-corp-20-lawsuits-fake-sheikh-conviction\" title=\"\">other convictions</a> secured on the basis of Mahmood\u2019s evidence and cavalier methodology. The case also invites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/met-police-accused-of-ignoring-warnings-on-fake-sheikh\" title=\"\">scrutiny of police</a> who appear to have sought prosecutions based on a standard of investigative rigour below that which they would expect of fellow officers. The glamour attached to a trial with a celebrity defendant appears to have trumped prosecutorial diligence.</p> <p>Mahmood built his career as the \u201cFake Sheikh\u201d of Sunday tabloid stings in the grey area between that which is in the public interest and that which interests the public. That distinction is not often interrogated enough in newsrooms when handling a \u201cgood\u201d story, which might be a commercial judgment before it is an ethical one. In that sense, the techniques involved are a secondary to the purpose of the investigation. The Independent Press Standards Organisation makes it clear in the <a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/\" title=\"\">editors\u2019 code of practice</a> that misrepresentation, subterfuge and clandestine recording \u2013 Mahmood\u2019s modus operandi \u2013 are to be shunned whenever alternative means of procuring information are possible, and permissible only in the public interest.</p> <p>There are times when corruption has been uncovered that could only have been exposed by a reporter pretending to be something else. The stung party there needs little sympathy. But there is another genre of investigation that involves the reporter using a financial inducement and alcohol to pester targets into doing something sensational when there is no reason to believe they would have broken the law without provocation \u2013 a kind of aggravated entrapment. That appears to have been the scenario in the Contostavlos case and some others. In that way, Mahmood proved only that people are not perfect and can be manipulated into making bad decisions. This is not news.</p> <p>Perhaps the saddest aspect of this is the squandering of resources and goodwill. Proper investigative journalism is a painstaking, costly and sometimes risky business that fulfils an important function in the relationship between a democracy and its media. There is no shortage of places where Mahmood\u2019s capabilities might have been deployed to expose real wrongdoing. Closed circles of the rich and powerful sometimes need to be penetrated by devious methods to uncover abuse. But the unwritten permission to do that is itself a source of power that is corroded when abused.</p> <p>No media organisation can afford to be pious or complacent about its status as a gatekeeper of public standards. Mistrust of journalism has spread in tandem with declining faith in politics. The \u201cmainstream media\u201d is often now cast as an institutional cog in an elitist machine, regardless of journalism\u2019s self-image as a check on the establishment. And while changes in technology, the way news is consumed and public attitudes make for an ever more challenging commercial environment, the underlying ethics of the trade are remarkably constant. The line between what is justifiable in the public interest and what is not rarely moves, but the penalty for crossing that line is getting higher.</p>",
  "<p>The world\u2019s first agreement to curb aviation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution has been struck by 191 nations in a landmark United Nations accord, although environmental groups have warned the deal doesn\u2019t go far enough.<br></p> <p> A meeting of 2,000 delegates at the <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx\">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO), a UN agency, in Montreal has settled upon a global emissions-reduction scheme that will apply to passenger and cargo flights that generate more than 10,000 tonnes of annual greenhouse gases. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Meetings/a39/Pages/default.aspx\"> The deal</a>, aimed at reducing the growing climate impact of plane travel, follows years of disagreement between nations on how to slow emissions from the sector. Instead of facing a cap or charge on emissions, airlines will be involved in an offsetting scheme whereby forest areas and carbon-reducing activities will be funded, costing about 2% of the industry\u2019s annual revenues. Global aviation emissions in 2020 will be used as a benchmark, with around 80% of emissions above 2020 levels offset until 2035. </p> <p>The new system will be voluntary until 2027, but dozens of countries, including the world\u2019s two largest emitters, the US and China, have promised to join at its outset in 2020. Campaigners hope that this will spike ambition to make aviation carbon neutral.</p> <p>Olumuyiwa Bernard Aliu, president of ICAO, said the accord is a \u201cbold decision and an historic moment\u201d. But green groups have complained that the deal will do little to reduce aviation emissions, which account for 1.3% of the global greenhouse gas total today. This share is expected to leap to a quarter of all emissions by 2050 as more and more people opt to take flights. Currently, 10 million people a day are shuttled around the world on planes.</p> <p>Bill Hemmings, aviation director of green group Transport &amp; Environment, said: \u201cAirline claims that flying will now be green are a myth. Taking a plane is the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won\u2019t reduce demand for jet fuel one drop. Instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in other industries.\u201d</p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/eu-gives-green-light-to-activate-paris-climate-deal\">Paris climate agreement</a>, which set an aspirational target of a 1.5C limit on the global temperature rise compared with pre-industrial times, is mentioned in the agreement\u2019s preamble but was removed from its body, infuriating some environmentalists.</p> <p>However, the deal does include review periods every three years and it rules out \u201cdouble counting\u201d of offsets to ensure that forest protection efforts elsewhere aren\u2019t used to negate aircraft emissions.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag really,\u201d said Brad Schallert, deputy director of international climate cooperation at WWF. </p> <p> \u201cThere\u2019s a strong signal in there that you have got to have good carbon credits, not bogus ones. The lack of the Paris text puts more pressure on countries to step up and deliver. As an approach for the long run this won\u2019t work, but luckily we have the review periods.\u201d</p> <p> Violeta Bulc, European commissioner for transport, said: \u201cThis unprecedented agreement opens a new chapter in international aviation, where sustainability finally becomes part of the way we fly. We have now set a process in motion, which will not be reversed. And yet, it is not \u2018mission accomplished\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> Emission reduction pledges made by nations in Paris last year will not, by themselves, meet the deal\u2019s stated goal of avoiding a 1.5C or even 2C limit in temperature rise. </p> <p>The shortfall means the world is on <a href=\"https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/scoreboard/\">track for warming of 3C or 4C</a>, which will cause a cascade of problems including extreme weather events, deadly heatwaves, coastal inundation by the rising seas and extinction of many of the world\u2019s animal species.</p>",

  "<p>Just in time for Halloween and after a notably devastating year for race relations in the US, the first trailer for Jordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut Get Out has hit, causing an understandable stir. Given Peele\u2019s Emmy-winning Comedy Central show Key &amp; Peele, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that his first film as director would involve racial commentary (one of his most famous skits revolves around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztRSm_SJP58\">fear a black man has walking through a white neighborhood</a>), but what\u2019s interesting is that he would insert this within the horror genre. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/bad-omens-blair-witch-omen-ring-carrie-trouble-with-horror-franchise-revival\">Bad omens: Blair Witch and the trouble with the horror franchise revival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plot focuses on Chris (Sicario\u2019s Daniel Kaluuya), a black man planning to meet the parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams, known for her role as Marnie in Girls) for the first time. But from the outset, something seems off. An uncomfortable encounter with a local cop puts them \u2013 and us \u2013 on edge and once they arrive at the family home and get settled, Chris becomes aware of increasingly strange, and potentially murderous, behavior. A major element of this relates to racial difference as Chris must navigate an almost entirely white space (apart from the \u201chelp\u201d), relying on a lifetime\u2019s worth of practice dealing with micro-aggressions and discrimination. It\u2019s a thrilling conceit and one hopes that Get Out might signal a trend of culturally relevant horror films from film-makers of color.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRfnevzM9kQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sRfnevzM9kQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The horror genre has various subdivisions, most of which tend to be more populated than the sparse category of scary films that directly address race and the anxiety around this social construct of skin color. \u201cIt is one of the very, very few horror movies that does jump off of racial fears,\u201d Peele said of Get Out in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.playboy.com/articles/jordan-peele-horror-get-out\">Playboy interview</a> from 2014. \u201cThat to me is a world that hasn\u2019t been explored. Specifically, the fears of being a black man today. The fears of being any person who feels like they\u2019re a stranger in any environment that is foreign to them. It deals with a protagonist that I don\u2019t see in horror movies.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fair statement, but it won\u2019t be the first time that racial fears have been encoded within the genre. In George A Romero\u2019s seminal Night of the Living Dead in 1968, the African American lead Ben, played by Duane Jones, and his grim fate (40-year-old spoiler: he gets killed at the end after a posse mistakes him for a zombie) eerily coincided with the assassination of Martin Luther King. It was a landmark film even for having a black lead, but its bleak climax made a depressing statement on American sociopolitical progress. There are moments throughout the film that imply hostility towards Ben\u2019s race and his power but issues surrounding his racial identity aren\u2019t overtly explored. </p> <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/24/creed-boxing-film-stars-black-hero-michael-b-jordan-rocky-spinoff\">Creed: why do so few boxing films have black heroes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the key dynamics in Get Out is the interracial relationship between the two leads and appears to be a catalyst for the nefarious doings later in the story. \u201cDo they know I\u2019m black?\u201d is a line Chris delivers with concern and also dread, imagining the possible scenarios he\u2019ll encounter upon meeting Rose\u2019s parents. His self-awareness of how his race might present a challenge suggests an honesty and subjective insight we\u2019re not often shown within the genre. This is something we didn\u2019t quite get in 1992\u2019s Candyman.</p> <p>That story goes back to the 1890s when Daniel Robatille, a black, wealthy socialite is commissioned to paint a portrait of a white landowner\u2019s daughter. But when the two fall in love and their relationship is discovered by her father and his peers, Daniel is lynched and his tortured soul is doomed to wreak havoc on anyone saying the name Candyman five times in a mirror. The film delivers a powerful commentary of the brutal manifestation of racism and its lingering effect on a community, but it focuses its sympathetic eye on a contemporary white female protagonist, played by Virginia Madsen. Her personal and professional turning points became focal and the film leaves little to no room for investigating the horrors of racism from the point of view of the black characters. Candyman is not the center, she is.</p> <p>The shift in focus shown in the trailer for Get Out and the exploration of racial identity suggests that the horror genre might finally be ready to push a new boundary. There\u2019s so much to unpack in the 150-second preview, giving us a mere glimpse of themes we\u2019re not used to seeing in horror. The timing of the film also mirrors Romero\u2019s efforts in the 60s to reflect America\u2019s struggle with race, a nation still plagued by ongoing, institutional injustice. While Get Out will act as entertainment predominantly (it\u2019s from Blumhouse, the production company behind Insidious and The Purge), with daily reports of black men killed for the color of their skin, it\u2019s also a vital reminder that racism remains a more terrifying force than any supernatural boogeyman.</p> <p></p>",

It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u2019s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, Hammond\u2019s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. </p> <p>The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion. Whilst a timetable for Brexit makes Hammond\u2019s job easier in some respects, it remains to be seen if Wall Street can be convinced by him.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f622a9e4b08ebe3d5575f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T10:13:10.110Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has dropped by 0.25% today but is still</strong><strong> clinging onto the $1.27 level.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s above yesterday\u2019s 31-year low, despite worries about a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s broadside at ultra-low interest rates appears to be propping up sterling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7878aa5699b1420b7d3e6c1e666fb0e4f21a1f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7878aa5699b1420b7d3e6c1e666fb0e4f21a1f1a/0_0_1423_688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the US dollar since 1980\" width=\"1000\" height=\"483\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the US dollar since 1980</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f61c32e4b08ebe3d5575d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:42:33.526Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Greece, the unemployment rate has dropped to a four-year low, but remains far too high.</strong></p> <p>The Greek jobless rate dipped to 23.2% in July from 23.4% in June \u2013 the lowest since March 2012, but more than double the eurozone average after years of austerity.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:44:23.952Z\">at 10.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f617a0e4b08ebe3d5575c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:25:45.289Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"adbcef58e86fa463f577fc5a72112399f55a89e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbcef58e86fa463f577fc5a72112399f55a89e7/0_0_5034_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The skyline of Canary Wharf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The pound continues to bob around the $1.273 mark, as traders wait for news of Philip Hammond\u2019s meetings in New York.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s about half a cent above the 31-year low struck on Wednesday.</p> <p>Angela Merkel\u2019s comments about freedom of movement being intrinsic to the EU haven\u2019t eased concerns about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019.</p> <p>And Theresa May\u2019s attacks on the wealthy \u2018global elite\u2019 have also left City investors feeling vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Chris Turner</strong>, the head of currency strategy at <strong>ING</strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>May has pushed her party way across the centre ground \u2013 taking issue with self-serving individuals and businesses and appealing to the non-metropolitan voter.</p> <p>That does not bode well for financial services in Brexit discussions.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<em>Thanks to Reuters for the quote</em>)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:43:49.804Z\">at 10.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f61062e4b08ebe3d55759c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T08:59:52.279Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Merkel: Brexit negotiations won't be easy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash from Berlin: the German chancellor Angela Merkel is telling industry leaders that Brexit is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the EU.</strong></p> <p>Merkel also says negotiations won\u2019t be easy and will determine what access each side has to the other\u2019s market.

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.omfif.org/analysis/commentary/2016/october/on-the-road-to-a-sterling-crisis/\">More here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:49:48.678Z\">at 10.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f60476e4b08ebe3d55755f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T08:00:51.273Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (<em>and what it is giving up</em>):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/status/783933535459676160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lost in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> options?

  "<p>A gigantic overhaul of the world\u2019s buildings, public transport and energy infrastructure costing trillions of dollars is required if dangerous climate change is to be avoided, according to a major new report.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/2016/\">study by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate</a>, which is co-chaired by prominent climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, found that the world is expected to invest about $90tn in infrastructure over the next 15 years, requiring an \u201curgent\u201d shift to ensure that this money is spent on low-carbon, energy-efficient projects. Such smart investment over the next two or three years could help ameliorate the climate crisis, but \u201cthe window for making the right choices is narrow and closing fast\u201d. </p> <p>The report states that more than 60% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases are associated with ageing power plants, roads, buildings, sanitation and other structures. Around 1,500 coal plants are estimated to already be in construction worldwide, which would send the world spiraling towards disastrous environmental changes. Carbon-heavy infrastructure \u201cliterally kills people by causing deadly respiratory illnesses, exacerbating road accidents and spreading unclean drinking water, among other hazards\u201d, the report reads.</p> <p>\u201cIt also puts pressure on land and natural resources, creating unsustainable burdens for future generations such as unproductive soils and runaway climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Stern said the next few years will be \u201ccritical\u201d to the future of sustainable development and the battle to ensure civilization isn\u2019t ravaged by heatwaves, extreme weather, sea level rise and other risks.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot continue with business as usual, which will lock in high-carbon infrastructure and create further congestion and pollution while choking off development opportunities, particularly for poor people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can and should invest in and build cities where we can move and breathe and be productive, while protecting the natural world that underpins our livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p>The financial system will need to be adjusted to make this change, the report finds. Subsidies to fossil fuels, currently totaling about $550bn a year, will need to be eliminated; better planning of projects will be required; and tools such as green bonds and green investment banking will need to be deployed.</p> <p>While it will cost slightly more to make infrastructure more sustainable, the upfront costs can be fully offset by efficiency gains and fuel savings. There are also health and societal benefits \u2013 greener energy infrastructure will reduce air pollution and provide greater access to energy to people in developing countries not connected to coal-fired power grids.</p> <p>Decisions made now in cities, which will house two-thirds of the global population by 2050, will influence the climate experienced later this century. To avoid gobbling up to a third of the remaining \u201ccarbon budget\u201d that remains before the world is pushed beyond a 2C (3.6F) temperature rise compared with pre-industrial times, cities need to properly plan for integrated public transport and energy-efficient buildings.</p> <p>The call comes after nations ratified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate accord</a>, which will come into force next month. Far steeper emissions cuts than countries have pledged so far will be required if the agreement\u2019s principal target \u2013 avoiding 2C of warming \u2013 is to be met.</p> <p>\u201cInvesting in sustainable infrastructure is essential to solve all the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d said Felipe Calder\u00f3n, former president of Mexico and chair of the Global Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s key to reigniting global growth. It\u2019s key to reducing poverty. And it\u2019s key to meeting the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris deal includes a promise to provide funding for nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/15/marshall-islands-climate-change-springdale-arkansas\">such as low-lying islands, most vulnerable to climate change</a>. But many major economies have been slow to ramp up spending on their own mitigation and adaptation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/report-combat-vs-climate/\">new report</a> by the thinktank Institute for Policy Studies found the US spends 28 times more on its military than it does on climate change. It estimates that the Obama administration has requested only $21bn for 2017 to transition to clean energy, compared with the $55bn required. These figures are estimates because the federal government stopped outlining its climate change budget in 2013.</p> <p>The Obama administration has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/21/presidential-memorandum-climate-change-and-national-security\">made climate change a key consideration in its military endeavors</a> but is also planning to spend $1tn to modernize its nuclear arsenal and a further $1.4tn on building F-35 fighter jets, according to the report. </p> <p>\u201cThough China has overtaken the US as the biggest producer of greenhouse gases, it is currently achieving a better balance between military and climate security spending,\u201d said Miriam Pemberton, lead author of the report.</p>",
  "<p>This past August <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/\">marked</a> 16 straight months of record-breaking high temperatures globally. The planet is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/global-temperature-climate-change-highest-115000-years\">hotter right now</a> than it has been in 115,000 years. Nasa makes very easy-to-understand videos that show the decrease in the polar ice caps in the Arctic Circle, which is warming <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2893850/nasa-releases-video-of-melting-polar-ice-caps/\">twice as fast</a> as the rest of the world. More than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/climate-change-poll-pew.html?_r=0\">90%</a> of the world\u2019s climate scientists say that the planet is warming and human activity is the cause. </p> <p>Amazingly, lots of people still don\u2019t believe them. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-more-republicans-now-believe-in-climate-change/\">Less than half</a> of all Republicans polled this year by Yale and George Mason universities think that the climate is changing at all.</p> <p>What is going with on with these people? Kirsti Jylha, a psychology professor at Sweden\u2019s Upsala University, recently <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161004103313.htm\">published</a> a thesis in the scientific journal Personality and Individual Differences that sketches a profile of a standard climate change denier. Jylha\u2019s studies found that climate change denial correlates strongly with conservative political orientation, authoritarian attitudes and support for the status quo. </p> <p>Deniers tend to exhibit a low capacity for empathy and a high aptitude for dominance. They\u2019re predisposed to closed-mindedness and seeing the world in a hierarchical structure, and they avoid experiencing negative emotions. Perhaps not surprisingly, they are usually male.</p> <p>Since climate change denial hampers efforts towards the collective worldwide action scientists believe will be required to ward off the most catastrophic results of global warming, Jylha hopes that her work can lead to new routes of communication and cooperation.</p> <p>\u201cThe arguments used in the climate debate often revolve around giving up conveniences in life to help the environment or the poor or weak,\u201d Jylha told Science Daily. \u201cBut that is maybe not a convincing argument to someone who sees the world from a hierarchical viewpoint. It would perhaps be better to talk in other terms and describe how everyone will benefit from the measures instead of being affected by the consequences and that the measures don\u2019t have to be a threat to the current societal structure.\u201d</p> <p>In other words: how can we more effectively talk stubborn, closed-minded jerks into helping to solve (and/or, at the very least, stop worsening) the world\u2019s most dangerous problem? Following Jylha\u2019s lead, I\u2019ve come up with a few conversation starters, to use in the appropriate situations, custom-designed to ease the climate denier in your neighborhood into taking measures that might just do our imperilled planet some good. </p> <p>You notice the guy \u2013 pot-bellied, bad hair, fake tan, tiny fingers, we\u2019ll call him \u201cDonald\u201d \u2013 pulling his SUV out of his driveway to head into work. Try this: <em>hey Donald</em>, you mouth, indicating he should roll down his driver\u2019s side window. </p> <p>When he does, you go on. \u201cHave you ever considered car pooling? If you were to give a couple of your colleagues a ride to work in this huge car of yours, you could dominate conversation for the whole hourlong drive<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>A week later, casually mention that you\u2019re thinking about buying a Prius. Suggest he consider getting one himself. \u201cA nice small car like that would make your tiny fingers look comparatively bigger on the steering wheel.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon, when you see him out riding his lawnmower in the yard of his McMansion, ask about the dividing line between his property and that of his other neighbor, Mike. \u201cYou should plant some trees all along the fence,\u201d you might tell him. \u201cI suppose Mike might get his knickers all up in a bunch, if you were to do it, say, without consulting him first. But it <em>is </em>your property, and the law says that you can do whatever you want with it.\u201d</p> <p>Come summertime, ask him whether his wife and kids leave the air conditioning blasting all day. \u201cWho pays the bills in the family, Donald? Who gets to decide when the air conditioner goes on and off?\u201d</p> <p>Once football seasons starts, and he starts inviting friends over to watch football games in his \u201cman cave\u201d, appeal to his well-established competitive streak. \u201cWho can drink the most beer?\u201d you can ask. \u201cLet\u2019s make pyramids out of our empty cans! And make sure to keep them carefully separated from the non-recyclable garbage when it\u2019s time to clean up. So we can have an accurate count and see who\u2019s the best.\u201d</p> <p>After the beer drinking and can stacking, and counting and drunken, bare-chested push-ups in the middle of the cul-de-sac or whatever, Donald\u2019s liable to be dizzy and disoriented. Now\u2019s the time to get him to sign the petition in support of the wind farm being proposed in the fields next to the highway. Tell him that the mills are big giant \u201cprotection fans\u201d, designed to blow newcomers away from your town. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like a great big wall.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The leaders of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/worldbank\">World Bank </a>have launched a strong defence of open markets and free trade, as concern grows that the Brexit vote and calls for protectionism in the US presidential election represent a backlash against globalisation.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said international trade had been a force for good in the past few decades but that without a more equal division of the benefits of growth there was a risk of barriers going back up.</p> <p>As part of a concerted push back against protectionism, the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said China had lifted 700 million people out of poverty as a result of trade and opening its economy to competition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/britain-fastest-growing-g7-economy-imf-international-monetary-fund-brexit-vote\">Britain will be fastest growing G7 economy this year, says IMF</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kim said the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, the US presidential race and looming elections in Europe were adding to uncertainty. \u201cThese are all risks. Uncertainty is normally very bad for most developing countries.\u201d</p> <p>Outlining her global policy agenda, Lagarde said: \u201cPolicymakers should act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation \u2013 which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades \u2013 are shared more broadly.</p> <p>\u201cA retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde said governments should press ahead with attempts to secure multilateral trade deals, despite the difficulties involved, while providing help for workers adversely affected by globalisation and technological change.</p> <p>She refused to comment on the American election, but made clear her opposition to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump\u2019s</a> demand that protectionism should be used to repatriate jobs to the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe rhetoric against trade would do harm to the economy. I call it economic malpractice,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The IMF believes the political shifts that have led to huge support for Trump and the shock Brexit vote are the biggest current threat to a fragile global economy.</p> <p>Lagarde welcomed the UK\u2019s better-than-expected performance since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Ahead of the EU referendum, she said the outcome would either be \u201cpretty bad or very, very bad\u201d, but speaking in Washington on Thursday she said the IMF had envisaged both mild and adverse scenarios.</p> <p>\u201cI am encouraged that, because of good policies and the cooperation of central banks, it is currently the mild scenario and not the adverse scenario.\u201d</p> <p>She has welcomed the government\u2019s announcement that negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will begin by March next year, but said this week\u2019s sharp fall in the pound was the result of uncertainty about what Brexit would mean for the financial services sector and for trade.</p> <p>Following Theresa May\u2019s attack on ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing, Lagarde said: \u201cWe currently observe that monetary policy has been under a lot of pressure to act. It has been the first port of call. It has acted in many countries in isolation, which is not helpful.</p> <p>\u201cAll policies \u2013 monetary, fiscal and structural \u2013 have to come together. It can\u2019t just be left to central banks. They have used unconventional policies to explore unchartered territories with benefits so far. But it can\u2019t just be monetary policy.\u201d</p> <p>Kim said heightened political uncertainty coincided with the highest number of poor countries in recession since the global slump of 2009.</p> <p>He said growth in sub-Saharan Africa was expected to be 1.6% this year and 2.9% in 2017, insufficient to keep up with population growth of 3% a year. \u201cIf growth can\u2019t keep up with population growth it is essentially negative growth\u201d, he said.</p>",
  "<p>Today the United Nations security council has confirmed the former Portuguese prime minister and occasionally outspoken former head of the UN High Commission for Refugees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/antonio-guterres-next-un-secretary-general\">Ant\u00f3nio Guterres</a>, as the next UN secretary general \u2013 a choice that is likely to reaffirmed by the UN general assembly shortly. Guterres\u2019 elevation follows what has for the United Nations been the most transparent process of nomination and public debate to date, even if recent weeks have been bedevilled by acrimonious briefing and plotting.</p> <p>This new UN-style glasnost has the advantage of lending Guterres added authority as he prepares to step into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bankimoon\">Ban Ki-moon</a>\u2019s shoes in December. And despite stealing an early march on most of his opponents in a series of straw polls, the emergence of Guterres still comes as something of a surprise. This was supposed to be eastern Europe\u2019s turn; there had been a strong push to have a woman as UN secretary general for the first time; and the ever present threat of a veto from a permanent member might have meant that the strongest candidates would be blocked.</p> <p>The optics and choreography of the blessing conferred on Guterres by this month\u2019s president of the security council, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin, flanked by fellow members, including US ambassador Samantha Power, sends a powerful message. Given that he wasn\u2019t its preferred candidate, Russia might have been expected to veto Guterres. But faced with the withdrawal of Bulgaria\u2019s support for its and Russia\u2019s favoured candidate, the head of Unesco, Irina Bokova, Churkin knew that the game was up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"63a951d0a7510b3906ac6c72ffcc966dc2ffbde4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63a951d0a7510b3906ac6c72ffcc966dc2ffbde4/0_198_2888_1733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wartorn Aleppo: \u2018As the world\u2019s secular pope, Guterres inherits the charnel house that is Syria.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wartorn Aleppo: \u2018As the world\u2019s secular pope, Guterres inherits the charnel house that is Syria.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Russians were said to be furious that, under EU pressure, Bulgaria had instead tried to opt for the EU finance commissioner, another Bulgarian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/bulgaria-withdraws-support-un-secretary-general-candidate-irina-bokova\">Kristalina Georgieva</a>, despite being unable to do so under the rules. But today no one can accuse Russia of saying \u201cnyet\u201d to the most popular candidate for the job, and many now expect that both Russia and China will demand their fair share of senior appointments. Indeed there is already speculation that Bokova will become deputy secretary general. Without giving any special favours, Guterres will need clear ideas about personnel. He will need to improve the efficiency of the organisation while drawing strongly on the ethos and experience of a loyal staff who are able and willing to properly communicate and champion the achievements of the United Nations.</p> <p>As the world\u2019s secular pope, Guterres inherits the charnel house that is Syria. It will fall to him to take the lead where the security council has so demonstrably failed. He has won plaudits for speaking out strongly in the past over a wave of migration from a wartorn Middle East that is now larger than that which took place at the end of the second world war. He will need to put Syria at the top of his list of priorities.</p> <p>This may call for a more muscular, hands-on approach. The UN needs to be right, left and centre of the intense shuttle diplomacy that should have the very best diplomats involved at the highest levels in the capital of every country involved. Building on the happy collusion between the United States and Russia over his selection, Guterres will know that a thawing in relations between these two powers offers the best hope for an eventual peace in Syria, tackling Isis and a series of broader issues \u2013 from encouraging nuclear non proliferation to calming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/north-korea-warns-of-uncontrollable-tension-amid-criticism-of-missile-tests\">tensions on the Korean peninsula</a> \u2013 as well as the prospects for wider peace in the Middle East.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">Sustainable development goals: changing the world in 17 steps \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His predecessor, Ban, has made tackling climate change and the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">sustainable development goals</a> very much his signature tune. A good deal of the groundwork has been done but, as the world continues to warm, much of the heavy lifting remains.</p> <p>Ban often used to say that when he assumed office 10 years ago the biggest conflict in his in-tray was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/darfur\">Darfur</a>, Sudan. But in the period since, wars have intensified and become more protracted. Women and children, hospitals and aid convoys have become targets with an apparent impunity for those carrying out the heinous deeds.</p> <p>The new secretary general will hopefully use his good offices to encourage the security council to give up its power of veto when war crimes are being committed, as they are today in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/aleppo-syria-war-humanitarian-crisis-un\">Aleppo</a> and in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen\">Yemen</a>. The UN must be able to act decisively and with properly supported peacekeeping operations.</p> <p>The new secretary general will of course be the very model of courtesy and good manners with whomever is elected the next president of the United States, the country that hosts the organisation\u2019s imposing headquarters.

I had, that very morning, explained that I thought that the party was in crisis, with irreparable rifts, financial challenges, the loss of the figurehead, in the departure of Nigel Farage, and an existential crisis in determining its raison d\u2019etre after the Brexit vote. There were, I determined, far too many obstacles for Ukip to traverse.</p> <p>However, watching James on stage, I did start to think: can she do it? She spoke passionately and eloquently, capturing real emotion at Ukip\u2019s national conference.</p> <p>So perhaps it is sad to see that just 18 days later the spark of hope for Ukip\u2019s future has already been extinguished. Why, when a party has essentially just seen the greatest victory in its history \u2013 what will go down as one of the biggest political decisions of this century \u2013 is it now in utter turmoil?</p> <p>Just as this piece was due to be published Steven Woolfe was rushed to hospital having been punched by an MEP colleague. I\u2019m extremely thankful that Steven is OK \u2013 he\u2019s a good man and a talented politician. People lose their tempers in all walks of life, and over myriad issues.</p> <p>When passions run high, people can behave in uncharacteristic and appalling ways, but this situation is indicative of how desperate the situation inside Ukip now seems to be, and of how frayed tempers are.</p> <p>The problem for Ukip is not only one of simple political disagreement. Most people in politics are vehemently adherent to a worldview: it\u2019s why they got into politics in the first place. Each believes their approach will garner the best result. That is not to condone physical violence or verbal abuse, but it is a job in which disagreement is fundamental.</p> <p>The problem in Ukip is that many ordinary men and women gave up careers and normal lives to pursue their shared cause of leaving the EU. Now that the referendum has been delivered \u2013 and won \u2013 not only are there bitter divisions over what the party should do next, a lot of those involved will ultimately lose their jobs once the UK does withdraw and the MEPs give up their seats. The stakes are very high indeed.</p> <p>There are many aspects to this, but the final conclusion is that the party needs to pull together around a brand new purpose if it has a shot at surviving.</p> <p>Ukip <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/ukip-circus-clowns-diane-james-arron-banks\" title=\"\">has many ideological splits and factions</a>, all gathered around conflicting schools of thought.

Suffering from an onslaught of attacks from mainstream media and political opponents trying to grapple with the sudden growth spurt of the party, the comparatively small team that made up its central operation huddled together and defended hard while going on the assault for the sacred referendum. The mood in the office was optimistic, familial.</p> <p>Then came the battle for seats in Westminster. Nigel Farage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/ukip-insider-raheem-kassam-we-had-to-lock-hq-doors-because-some-people-were-too-embarrassing-to-be-seen\" title=\"\">took on new advisers</a> and determined strategy from his bunker in Thanet while the party\u2019s national press office and elected caucus felt completely cut off. It was as though two entirely separate campaigns were running in parallel.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work. Ukip failed to garner the seats it had expected to gain. Accusations of failure flew between the two camps. Acrid frustrations played out in public. Now the party\u2019s potential major resourcing, parliamentary short money, lay in the hands of its only elected MP.</p> <p>Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless had defected, with the former particularly believing Ukip had to head in a different direction and essentially rebrand to deliver Brexit success. Stymying the dogmatic rhetoric that characterised the party was regarded as key to neutralising the negativity of the leave campaign.</p> <p>Meanwhile down in Thanet, Farage and his advisers had a contrasting approach. With a slightly more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\" title=\"\">alt-right</a> flavour, and no doubt with their own calculated reasons to do so, a very different type of messaging and relationship with the media was being pursued.</p> <p>Soon enough, the two separate camps, entirely cut off from each other, started generating friction. A culture of leaking, rumour-mongering, briefing and counter-briefing and barbed comments, both inside the party and in the media, emerged, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and vitriol. Hyperbole about plots and coups dominated exchanges at the water cooler. The damp had set in. This fundamental conflict of ideas was paralleled by the two separate campaigns for leave, a distracting and confusing sideshow for many Brexiteers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/ukip-work-done-party-conference-should-disband\">Ukip\u2019s work is done \u2013 the party should respect its victory and disband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With such a toxic environment created, and with the central tenet of the organisation ripped out after 23 June, it\u2019s not hard to see how so many different people, with so many different approaches and agendas, are now contributing to the fractured and often bitter environment. Heated discussions are being had in vacuums as to how to redefine the party and its central purpose, each coterie mistrustful of the other.</p> <p>The atmosphere permeates every stratum of Ukip\u2019s sprawl, from the cloak-and-dagger leader debate, the split between Westminster and the outgoing leader, the NEC and the Welsh Assembly, down to key donors. Not a single Ukip enclave is spared bitter divisions, each blighted by mistrust and conflicting ideas of what the party should be.</p> <p>With the central uniting factor, the heart of the party, now ripped out, Ukip paradoxically has to rely on Brexit failing in order to maintain relevance. Its greatest risk now is that in trying to save itself, it actually has to feed off the idea that Brexit won\u2019t be delivered, potentially hampering the progress of the very cause it was founded to deliver. The party\u2019s other emblematic campaigns, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">reintroduction of selective education</a>, are also being championed by Theresa May. Without a shared dream, the factions feel all the more disparate.</p> <p>The simple fact is, Diane James must have realised this, as many others are doing, with each passing day. The anti-venom among the membership would surely be a return of their spiritual leader, but Farage seems reluctant to step back into the fray fully, knowing exactly what awaits, and finding life outside Ukip even more enriching and profitable. But even if he were to stride to the rescue, it would only open up sores among party officials previously isolated from his clique.</p> <p>It\u2019s probable that Ukip has done its job. It fought hard to make EU membership a headline topic and then doggedly pursued its completion. Even its charismatic leader has called it a day.</p> <p>Perhaps like Diane James, it\u2019s time Ukip realised it was time to hang up its boots. After all, it has just won an exhausting \u2013 but deeply satisfying \u2013 fight of its life.</p>",
  "<p>Scottish ministers have banned the use of a technique to extract methane by burning underground coal beds, after expert advice said it posed too many risks to the climate and environment.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish environment minister, said he was asking ministers in London to revoke six licences to find test sites for the technique, known as underground coal gasification (UGC), in central and south-west Scotland.</p> <p>He said <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/10/2704\">an expert report from Prof Campbell Gemmell</a>, former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, had found it was unproven, under-regulated and too risky to be approved.</p> <p>Wheelhouse said the infant industry had a history of pollution accidents and \u201closs of containment issues\u201d at test sites in other countries, but added that the ban could be lifted if it proved safe in future. </p> <p>To the delight of environment campaigners, Wheelhouse said: \u201cIt is the Scottish government\u2019s view that UGC poses numerous and serious environmental risks and, on that basis, the Scottish government cannot support this technology. Accordingly, UCG will have no place in Scotland\u2019s energy mix at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Environmentalists believe the Scottish ban will add pressure on UK ministers to ban or postpone possible UCG projects in England, despite giving the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">go-ahead on Thursday to the UK\u2019s biggest fracking site yet, on the Fylde in Lancashire</a>.</p> <p>Scottish ministers are still wrestling with their policy on fracking, repeatedly delaying a final decision in the face of strong industry pressure to support it after divisions emerged within the cabinet over its potential value to Scotland\u2019s ailing economy and energy industries.</p> <p>Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/28/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking-for-shale-gas\">has had a moratorium on commercial fracking and coalbed methane drilling since January 2015</a>, and Wheelhouse said on Thursday he would publish a set of scientific papers on fracking and open up a public consultation later this autumn. </p> <p>Scotland had been at the forefront of attempts in the UK by several energy companies and some academics to develop UCG because of its extensive network of rich coal seams under land and the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh and Solway Firth north of Carlisle.</p> <p>The technique involves chemically igniting coal seams, under controlled conditions, and then capturing the released methane-rich gases at ground level before processing the gases. Those could feed chemicals plants and power stations, they said, adding to the UK\u2019s domestic energy mix. </p> <p>Developers promised that excess carbon dioxide would be buried offshore in carbon capture and storage sites; some claimed the technology promised a bonanza for the unconventional gas industry, with sites eventually being exploited far offshore in the Atlantic or in the North Sea. The European commission has invested tens of millions of euros in UCG research projects.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Unlike fracking, UGC technology is still untested, very costly and years away from approval by UK regulators, making the Scottish government\u2019s decision to ban it relatively easy. One of the two developers, Five Quarter, recently went into receivership.</p> <p>There are no carbon capture and storage sites yet in operation in the UK, and no evidence that carbon capture would be cost effective, undermining the business case for UGC. </p> <p>Environmental campaigners were jubilant following Wheelhouse\u2019s announcement. Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoES) pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/18/queensland-bans-underground-coal-gasification-over-environmental-risk\">a case in Queensland, Australia</a>, where developers of one test site, Linc Energy, are now being prosecuted after contamination and leaks into the environment.</p> <p>Mary Church, head of campaigns with FoES, said: \u201cThis is a victory for people power. Setting coal seams alight under two of our major firths was always a reckless idea. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe history of UCG is littered with contamination incidents, ground subsidence and industrial accidents.

  "<p>First we realised the Earth isn\u2019t the only planet in the solar system. Then we learned that everything doesn\u2019t revolve around it. Then we discovered that we are nothing but apes, collections of selfish genes. And now we have been dealt the final blow: we humans can\u2019t even pride ourselves on the richness and variety of our communication. It turns out that, of all things, fish have regional accents not unlike our own.</p> <p>That\u2019s right \u2013 fish. Welcome to the world of genuine cod science.</p> <p>Research revealed on Wednesday by scientists at the University of Exeter shows that European and American cod differ in the intensity of the males\u2019 sexual noises \u2013 the \u201cgrumps\u201d and \u201cthumps\u201d made with their swim bladders. (You can hear the different dialects yourself on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/cod-may-have-regional-accents-scientists-say\" title=\"\">the Guardian news story</a>.)</p> <p>American cod seem a bit pushy and in-your-face compared with their European counterparts, whose grunts sound a little more aloof. But that\u2019s just my personal view. Everyone should be free to make their own choices about which fish noises might woo them.</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t really find this surprising. If humans have dialects, to say nothing of birds and whales and monkeys and amphibians, why not fish? We share the same ancestors in those 400m-year-old ancient seas, after all. Cod were probably grunting away long before our Palaeolithic forebears.</p> <p>But there is a hidden side to this story. Rather than being just another look-at-what-else-animals-can-do sensation, this cod dialect business is a story of threat. It is a warning of how fish might be affected by human activity.</p> <p>Like dolphins and whales, cod are threatened by more than classic conservation challenges such as overfishing, ocean acidification or pollution: their very sex lives may be endangered by the noises we make. Their ability to communicate is menaced by guns that fire fusillades at the sea floor to detect undersea oil reserves, or undersea construction operations that explode great piles in the sea floor. It is threatened by drilling and busy shipping lanes. This is a realm where the sounds of humankind travel with an efficiency unmatched on land.</p> <p>And, year on year, decade by decade, we are getting noisier. In some parts of the world there has been <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060818173400.htm?trendmd-shared=0\" title=\"\">a tenfold increase in ocean noise since the 1960s</a>, and no one fully understands the impact this might have on sea creatures, particularly cetaceans, whose songs transmit long-distance notes that hint at species, location, social status and, of course, sexual readiness. For creatures like these, we are the neighbours from hell.</p> <p>So this research into cod grunts is nowhere near as trivial as some reports make it sound. We are threatening their survival with the God-awful clattering and banging that we are creating under the surface. Completely unintentionally we are drowning out their sex lives. We are cock-blocking nature.</p> <p>What will happen next? Perhaps cod will evolve in this noisy undersea world.Perhaps, like <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/121201_grasshoppers\" title=\"\">grasshoppers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1852758/\" title=\"\">birds</a> that live near busy roads, they will change pitch to make themselves heard over the din. Yet there\u2019s also the possibility that they won\u2019t. Perhaps there\u2019s only so much a swim bladder can do.

It\u2019s a&#xa0;48-minute long hip-hop-influenced performance poem about the alienated lives of the residents of one south London street, set to a variety of post-dubstep bass music. It opens with an invocation of Mother Earth and ends with a plea for humanity to, as Primal Scream once had it, come together&#xa0;as one. In between, it variously takes aim at capitalism, gentrification, celebrity culture, political corruption and global warming (\u201cthe water is rising, the elephants and polar bears are dying\u201d). There is a joke about David Cameron having it off with a pig\u2019s head. It\u2019s somehow redolent of the kind of well-meaning event you see&#xa0;advertised at a local arts centre and make a mental note to avoid at all costs \u2013 partly because it seems so painfully earnest, and partly because at least half&#xa0;the audience seems likely to consist of recalcitrant 14-year-olds dragged there by an English teacher who insists pupils call him by his first name and says things like \u201cSiegfried Sassoon was&#xa0;the Lil\u2019 Wayne of his day\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a reason Kate Tempest has become the first poet to make authentic headway in the world of pop since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cooper-clarke\" title=\"\">John Cooper Clarke</a> and Linton Kwesi Johnson the best part of 40 years ago; to cross the boundary from performances at the Edinburgh Fringe and, indeed, local arts centres to making albums that are eagerly awaited by people who don\u2019t normally take much notice of performance poetry. There are plenty of talented people doing their thing at poetry slam events up and down the country, but only Tempest has been gifted an hour of prime-time terrestrial TV on which to launch Let Them Eat Chaos.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aRxIWgFLpA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-aRxIWgFLpA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Performed live as part of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/02/bbc2-poetry-night-kate-tempest\" title=\"\">BBC2 poetry night</a>, and broadcast immediately after a programme in which Rick Stein talked about cuddly old John Betjeman and a variety of writers waxed whimsical about a train journey from Euston to Glasgow to a light orchestral backing, Let Them Eat Chaos understandably felt like a bomb going off in a chintzy tea shop. But even stripped of that context, it still sounds remarkably potent. You could argue that it offers a&#xa0;pretty well-thumbed checklist of liberal woes, but as Tempest\u2019s voice gradually rises in anger over the clanking rhythm track midway through Europe Is Lost, it\u2019s hard not to get carried along with it. That\u2019s partly because, however unsurprising her targets, her writing is often brilliantly acute, not least on the solipsism of latterday pop culture: \u201cSaccharine ballads and selfies and selfies and selfies and here\u2019s me outside the palace of me.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the rant that consumes the second half of Europe Is Lost is presented as the confused worries of a&#xa0;knackered professional carer, back home after a double shift \u2013 one of seven characters the poem depicts. They\u2019re uniformly well drawn and believable, from a girl holding an internal dialogue with a murdered friend (\u201cWhat\u2019s it like where you\u2019ve gone?

Whoops feels not unlike one of Mike Skinner\u2019s tales of dancefloor excess recast for a more troubled era, with its protagonist\u2019s intemperance fuelled by something dark in his past, and driven by the fact that he\u2019s still stuck living with his parents: he might be making the wrong choices, but even if he were making the right ones, the property market means he\u2019d still be there. Elsewhere, the pen portraits are powered by an eye for detail \u2013 Blu-Tack stains \u201cgrease the walls\u201d of a flat about to be vacated; an apparently reformed hedonist recalls scrounging drugs from friends with \u201cpuppy-dog eyes for the acid on their fingertips\u201d \u2013 and by the fact that Tempest knows when to leave the listener hanging: the dead friend may&#xa0;or may not be the father of the protagonist\u2019s son; the hedonist may have reformed, but it isn\u2019t entirely clear where that has left her life.</p> <p>The words and their delivery are obviously the point of Let Them Eat Chaos, but they aren\u2019t the only thing that makes it compelling. From the slowly pulsating electronic currents of Breaks to Perfect Coffee\u2019s early Chicago house chug, the music is uniformly great. It\u2019s never so showy that it distracts from Tempest\u2019s voice \u2013 it&#xa0;doesn\u2019t really do choruses \u2013 but equally, it\u2019s never mere background music. It adds to the impressive sense&#xa0;of assurance that oozes off the&#xa0;album. In terms of visibility, Kate Tempest is&#xa0;currently way ahead of her performance-poet peers. Out on her own, she sounds like a woman who knows exactly what she\u2019s doing.</p>",

How could they not? The play, set in 1964, has a cast of six black actors \u2013 portraying Cassius Clay (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\">Muhammad Ali</a> was then known), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/21/malcolm-x-assassination-records-nypd-investigation\">Malcolm X</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\">Sam Cooke</a>, the American football player (and soon to be actor) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9HtSeVrn7s\">Jim Brown</a>, and two Nation of Islam security men.</p> <p>As he walked into the room, one of the actors asked: \u201cHave you heard about what happened in Tulsa?\u201d There was a searching in his voice.

My process revolves around the exploration and articulation of everything the world throws at us and delving into our own deep emotional hinterland; the two then collide through the text of the play. This process does not allow for the exclusion of seismic events that personally touch each individual in the room.<br></p> <p>I asked the actors if we could do something radical that day. We removed 90% of the furniture from the set and, rather than work scene by scene as we had planned to, I suggested we run the play non-stop from beginning to end. No discussion, no preparation, just take to the air and see where we land. This would be almost a week earlier than we had planned, but the actors all agreed to just hit it.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a clear psychological explanation for my reaction. Avoidance is a tool I use successfully each time I\u2019m about to start writing a new narrative. (Never is my house cleaner, or my garden in better shape.) But this was neither an act of avoidance nor of channelling rage or pain into the work. It was an attempt to not allow the bandwidth of my company be decreased by acts of terror that have the potential to traumatise beyond their geographic location.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dffd955e25770cbf95aa976bd1852a14d8327531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dffd955e25770cbf95aa976bd1852a14d8327531/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Kwame Kwei-Armah, right, in rehearsal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Something radical \u2026 director Kwame Kwei-Armah, right, in rehearsal with cast member Arinz\u00e9 Kene (playing Sam Cooke).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had witnessed this trauma in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/02/kwame-kwei-armah-center-stage\">my adopted city of Baltimore</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquittal of George Zimmerman</a> for the murder of Trayvon Martin. I saw in the eyes of black mothers and fathers alike, an almost existential angst as they tried to realign this new reality, against age-old strategies they had used to protect their children, their boys, from the ravages of extreme racism. I remember arriving at my theatre the next morning and seeing that pain in the eyes of some of my African American staff members. All of us were asking ourselves: how can I, how can art, help at this moment? We decided to commission eight local artists to write and perform whatever they wanted to on the subject, so long as they looked the trauma in question right in the eye. They performed these pieces on the streets, in community centres, in the homes of those most touched by the events and then led a post-show discussion around the issues. We were less interested in discussing police brutality, far more interested in discussing new tools for a new age. Our theory being that trauma binds you to the present and the past.

It was impossible to avoid the parallels of then and now. The play is set in 1964, during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/01/civil-rights-america-1960s-activists-voting-rights-vietnam\">first civil rights era</a>. Each of the characters had lived through the kind of systemic inequalities that make or break you. Far from being broken, these men had soared! They were truly celebrated individuals. So celebrated that, in segregated Miami, Sam Cooke (albeit under cover) was allowed to stay at a whites-only hotel on the night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/23/muhammad-ali-sonny-liston\">Clay beat Sonny Liston</a> to become the heavyweight champion of the world. However, at the heart of our play, these men are in Malcolm X\u2019s segregated hotel room, negotiating how to serve. How to contribute. How to not be set apart from the community but help to elevate it. </p> <p>My cast of actors began to think of the modern black artists, entertainers and sportspeople and the questions they must be asking themselves amid what many are calling a second civil rights era. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/01/beyonce-lemonade-visual-album-review-woman-scorned\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade</a>.

All of these acts of defiance and service rush to the surface. And although I applaud these acts from my soul, I find myself dissatisfied.</p> <p>Dissatisfied because the thing I find most fascinating about the icons in the play is not their acts of defiance but that they were intellectually on the cutting edge of new thoughts and ideas. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/nov/20/popandrock.urban1\">Sam Cooke</a> was way ahead of nearly every artist in owning his own record label and the publishing rights to his songs.

I felt good about this. I felt we had found a way to speak to the young people who will come and see One Night in Miami. A way to not let them ignore the realities of today but not be bound in the agonies of them. <br></p> <p>Then I opened my newsfeed and I saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/25/charlotte-mecklenburg-police-release-footage-of-keith-scott-shooting-video\">video of Keith Scott being shot</a> in Charlotte.

  "<p>Depending on your outlook, the fourth title in this muscle-bound sci-fi series could easily look like an anachronism. It\u2019s a single-path third-person cover-shooter that pays no heed to modern demands for open worlds, and belongs to a franchise that has looked somewhat jaded over the last few iterations. But Microsoft has cannily brought in a new developer, the Coalition, and it has administered a much-needed injection of fresh ideas, without compromising the core appeal.</p> <p>After a brief nostalgic prologue, Gears of War 4 takes place 25 years after the Locust were (apparently) finally defeated in Gears 3. The planet Sera has changed massively in that quarter-century; the COG have become the baddies, exercising fascistic control over the populace with the help of a robotic army known as DBs, even though the authoritarian female first minister (remind you of anyone?), Jinn, begins by paying lip-service to Marcus Fenix at a commemorative rally. You play as James \u201cJD\u201d Fenix, son of Marcus, who has gone Awol from the COG and hooked up with a bunch of \u201coutsiders\u201d living off-grid in a country village. Along with sidekick Del and Kait, the franchise\u2019s first properly central female character, JD embarks on a raid of a COG establishment with the aim of stealing a Fabricator \u2013 essentially a 3D printer with knobs on, which can make weapons and fortifications.</p> <p>The merry band \u2013 moving through a world which, at last, hasn\u2019t been entirely constructed using a colour palette of black, brown and grey \u2013 take on wave after wave of robots, using disappointingly weedy new weapons. But a change-up soon occurs: after returning to the outsider village and fending off a major COG assault (which seamlessly introduces the changes the Coalition has made to Gears of War\u2019s legendary horde mode), a new enemy, which JD and company dub the Swarm, appears, kidnapping Kait\u2019s mother, village headwoman, Reyna, and the rest of the village\u2019s inhabitants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a03cf74084af5c41b437d3aecfcc41fdcd28493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a03cf74084af5c41b437d3aecfcc41fdcd28493/410_0_4666_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gears hero Marcus Fenix bonds with his son JD in the only way he knows how: over a massive machine gun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gears hero Marcus Fenix bonds with his son JD in the only way he knows how: over a massive machine gun</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So JD and his cohorts embark on another world-saving quest \u2013 and the first stop involves approaching the now-grizzled (but still gung-ho) Marcus Fenix who, rather unexpectedly, has opted for bucolic retirement in a country pile. Luckily, Marcus has his old COG gear, so at last you can reacquaint yourself with the trusty assault-rifle-cum-chainsaw Lancer and the Gnasher shotgun.</p> <p>In the quest to find Reyna and discover the truth about the Swarm, Sera\u2019s harsh climate occasionally intervenes: \u2018windflares\u2019 often strike, pairing beyond-hurricane-force winds with deadly localised lightning. In those sequences, impressive physics let you take out swathes of enemies by bringing the environment into play, and often add a puzzle-solving element. The Coalition has also thrown in some on-rails sequences, which are less successful, though: they simply feel too on-rails.</p> <p>There are, of course, boss battles, and the various forms of the Swarm force you to take a more tactical approach than in the past \u2013 although you still have to fill them full of unfeasible quantities of lead, albeit in a much less indiscriminate manner. So-called Juvies, for example, are quick and elusive but unarmed, so they will melee you if you stay behind cover while, entertainingly, Snatchers will swallow you up if you let them get too close, rendering you helpless until a team-mate shoots you out of their stomachs (you can play the campaign cooperatively, although the AI, controlling bot-based team-mates, is pretty good). Overall, the single-player campaign offers a much more varied, flowing experience than previous Gears of War games. It isn\u2019t the longest, though: those in a hurry could finish it in about nine hours.</p> <p>The game\u2019s real meat, however, lies online, with two major pillars in the form of versus multiplay and Horde 3.0 (the name reflecting the Coalition\u2019s desire to register that the much-loved survival mode has been extensively revamped). In versus, Gears of War\u2019s existing multiplayer modes make welcome returns, so you can plunge into warzone (team deathmatch with a single life per short-but-sweet round), team deathmatch (in which each team has an allocated number of lives), king of the hill and guardian. Plus there is the intriguing dodgeball, in which every time you kill an enemy, you allow a dead team-mate, consigned to a queue, to respawn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"537ff28604209094f70a85772fe93ef6fa752865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537ff28604209094f70a85772fe93ef6fa752865/78_0_1874_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new Horde Mode adds an array of features to the co-op multiplayer favourite\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new horde mode adds an array of features to the co-op multiplayer favourite</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another new mode, arms race, is likely to inspire either fanatical devotion or total indifference, as it forces you to cycle through all the game\u2019s weapons: every three kills, your team will swap to a new model. It\u2019s a great idea (one that we have seen variations on in the Call of Duty series, among others), but it also means you have to use the new DB weapons, which are vastly inferior to the original COG ones. Escalation, meanwhile is a new mode which has e-sports firmly on its agenda: it involves teams capturing three areas and ramps up respawn times at the end of each round.</p> <p>Social playlists allow you to jump into the multiplayer and sample various game types at a time, with the ability to vote for the next map and mode. There\u2019s an XP system which extends across both Versus and Horde 3.0, which is good, and a Gears Pack system which provides cards that bring some pretty appealing cosmetic enhancements for use in versus, along with bounties (which are specific challenges), and some really useful perks and buffs that can be applied in horde mode. We played the multiplayer side of the game extensively pre-launch, and things progressed pretty smoothly \u2013 matching problems won\u2019t arise as the game can strip in bots where needed \u2013 although we did experience one catastrophic crash at the end of a round. </p> <p>Gears of War 4 will kick off with 10 maps (all of which are impeccable) and more will be provided for free via DLC. Frame-rate issues and lag, mercifully, were completely absent. But you can never tell whether Microsoft\u2019s server network will be able to take the strain when everyone jumps online. If you\u2019re nervous, watch and wait before purchasing.</p> <p>Horde 3.0 chiefly benefits from the new mechanic provided by fabricators, which let you build things like electrified fences, automatic turrets and various levels of decoys. You can move your fabricator crate to whatever strategic place you feel you can best defend from the waves of incoming enemies, and the whole exercise adds a welcome new level of strategy to proceedings. But there is a caveat: Horde 3.0 also introduces classes, and you have to be very careful which you choose, as your class determines your load-out. You can, of course, pick up weapons from dead enemies, but pick the wrong class and you\u2019ll be forced to use the weedy DB weaponry, which is annoying. And the game doesn\u2019t offer anything like as much explanation of that as it should.</p> <p>Overall, Gears of War 4 may adhere to a seemingly old-fashioned template but, in practice, it feels anything but archaic. Its single-player campaign is much more varied and engaging than those of its predecessors and the online mode is exhilarating, catering for all shades of gamers, from the less adept to those with pro-gamer aspirations. The horde thoroughly deserves its 3.0 designation upgrade and as a whole, the fourth iteration gives the Gears of War template the rejuvenating shot in the arm it sorely needed. </p> <p><strong>The Coalition/Microsoft; Xbox One/PC; \u00a350; Pegi rating: 18</strong></p>",

Nothing is clear except that it is all going to be a lot trickier to disengage from the EU than some foolish people said \u2013 and still say despite mounting evidence to the contrary.</p> <p>So my starting point is one of humility as I learn stuff I didn\u2019t known before. It\u2019s safe to say that some things will be better outside the EU, others worse, some sectors and individuals will thrive, others languish. The consequences of Britain\u2019s leap in the dark \u2013 37% of the total electorate voted Brexit by a very slender margin \u2013 are still largely unknown for all 28 members states. Only charlatans and romantics pretend otherwise.</p> <p>I like to quote one of Fleet St\u2019s most celebrated columnists at this point. In an article published by the Telegraph on May 12 2013 he wisely wrote:<strong><em> <br></em></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate and we would have to recognize that most of our problems are not caused by Brussels, but by chronic British short termism, inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and underinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Did Boris Johnson believe what he wrote then? It\u2019s never easy to tell when the man \u201cmost trusted\u201d by Brexit voters opens his mouth. But he was right. Whatever you regard as Britain\u2019s big mistakes in recent decades \u2013 poor bank regulation, Iraq, privatization, PFI, the failure to build new runways or HS2 \u2013 have been our own mistakes. Europe has mostly been the scapegoat.</p> <p>That is my chief fear for the future. However much \u201csovereignty\u201d ( let alone cash) we get back from Brussels in reality, however successful and sophisticated a deal we negotiate with generous-spirited EU leaders and new trading partners, it is all going to take a lot of time and effort. The City\u2019s insurance, for which the single market never worked well, will adapt and survive. Banks, UK tourism and farming may flourish while those Japanese car makers desert Sunderland for somewhere cheaper inside the Eurozone. Or they may not.<br></p> <p>But the process is bound to disappoint many people, Brexit voters as well as Remainers, because Brexit was oversold as a panacea. With no EU whipping boy to blame for things which were actually our own fault \u2013 eh, Boris !! \u2013 the search will start for new scapegoats ( some of them very old ones too). Populist politicians and cynical newspapers will encourage it to mask the failure of their predictions. Some people claim to detect such stirrings in this week\u2019s Tory conference speeches.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s premature and hope they\u2019re wrong. I also hope the Brexit optimists are triumphantly vindicated in their vision of a prosperous new Britain.

Since Brexit I have noticed an uptick in sales to the United States, but I have noticed a distinct decline in sales to Europe, though they do still take place. The effect of Brexit on Europe\u2019s perception of Britain as a country is very negative - and the announcements from the Tory party conference will only reinforce the impression that Britain is not opening up for business. In fact, the very reverse: closing down for business and pursuing policies of discrimination against foreigners, especially from Europe. </p> <p>The level of discrimination against immigrants from Europe is most definitely alienating what should be Britain\u2019s closest friends. As someone with a slight foreign accent I no longer feel entirely safe in this country. A hard Brexit would be a disaster for me - as many books go abroad and the customs paperwork would add a considerable workload as well as extra costs in the case of more valuable books. There literally is not a single advantage to be derived from Brexit except for the lower pound, which could have been lowered by other means which would have done far less damage to Britain\u2019s economy and society.

At the moment we have free movement of goods throughout the EU, all I have to do in my own business is put an address on a shipment and off it goes. It\u2019s just not possible for whatever is put in its place to improve on that.</p> <p>A \u2018trade deal\u2019 usually involves reduced tariffs which is a dis-improvement on no tariffs at all. This would bring back customs paperwork and all the associated admin, whereas currently we have none at all. There is no upside, only a downside.</p> <p>As for non-EU trade, there is nothing about Brexit that makes its prospects better, and Brexiteers rhetoric that which suggests EU trade being at the expense of relationships elsewhere is false. There never has been anything about EU membership that\u2019s constrained trade elsewhere.</p> <p>Brexit does not make my company\u2019s or any company\u2019s business any more inherently attractive to clients in the USA, Australia, Japan etc. Its a basic matter of having something to sell that they are interested in buying and if a transaction makes economic sense.</p> <p>Up to now selling to the UK was the same thing as selling to the EU where the UK could be a distribution point for the entire single market, that\u2019s no longer possible after Brexit as it would involve a second set of customs hurdles if single market membership is not sustained.</p> <p>Relocating my business elsewhere in the EU is something that I could do, in my case to Ireland. I don\u2019t particularly want to uproot after 30 years here but it may well be necessary in the event of a hard Brexit. At the moment like so many other businesses, I\u2019m waiting to see, all that there\u2019s been is a vote but nothing on what Brexit actually means. The appointment of Theresa May did reassure that there would be sane heads making the decisions, but Tory party conference only suggests hubris on the part of Brexiteers, and no facing up to the huge difficulties it all involves.

There is nothing going to shift us from that path,\u201d she said, gathered among fellow campaigners at the proposed fracking site.</p> <p>Wearing a black tabard with the words \u201cNo fracking democracy\u201d, Kate Styles, 55, dished out homemade lemon drizzle cake and chocolate brownies she had baked to calm her nerves on Wednesday night. \u201cExtreme times, extreme baking,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A lifelong Tory voter who had never previously taken up a placard, Styles has been radicalised by the government\u2019s pro-fracking policy. \u201cI never thought as a middle-aged woman I\u2019d be fighting the government on anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could offer me diamonds and pearls \u2013 I\u2019ll never vote Tory again.\u201d</p> <p>Another of the self-declared \u201cfrack-fighting nanas\u201d, Julia Stribling, 67, said she was seething at Theresa May\u2019s government. The fracking operation would make the everyday task of crossing the road a \u201cdeathtrap\u201d due to the convoys of heavy goods vehicles passing by her static home 300 yards from the drill site, she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad day for me. I\u2019m a pensioner. I never thought I\u2019d be protesting,\u201d she said as passing cars honked their horns. \u201cThis has riled me up so much because they\u2019re just not listening to people.

There remains underlying tension in the rural villages between Preston and Blackpool. Some are angry at the farmers who have allowed the energy firm to drill on their land. Others, like Claire Stephenson, 37, even removed their children from a school a mile from the Preston New Road fracking site over concerns about its potential impact on their health.</p> <p>\u201cThe children were banned from talking about fracking in school so we removed them,\u201d Stephenson said, her seven-year-old daughter Eveline clutching at her leg. \u201cWe\u2019re a rural farming community, we rely on farms and tourism. We rely on democracy, which has been shattered. It\u2019s just a big shock. We\u2019re devastated.\u201d</p> <p>Stephenson and the other campaigners believe they have strong grounds for a judicial review of Javid\u2019s decision. Rothery, who was part of a group that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/24/anti-fracking-activist-refuses-to-pay-legal-bill-cuadrilla\">occupied a field earmarked for shale gas exploration</a> in 2014, added: \u201cAt what point do you stand aside and say: \u2018You know what, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m sure I trust you\u2019? Because if my regulators and my government aren\u2019t looking after my kids then that\u2019s just down to us then, isn\u2019t it? And that\u2019s a ridiculous state of affairs in a democracy.\u201d</p> <p>In Roseacare, Jackie and Jim Sylvester, who live less than 300 metres away from the proposed fracking site, were furious that ministers in London could overrule a decision made locally.</p> <p>\u201cDemocracy is dead as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d said Jackie, a parish councillor who has lived in the area with her husband for 47 years. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone against the will of the people. I think the people of England don\u2019t realise that once this starts it\u2019s not going to stop and there\u2019s going to be hundreds of drills.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Warner, who runs a local action group against the Roseacre fracking from her kitchen table, described the process as a \u201cChinese show trial\u201d and an affront to local democracy.</p> <p>Warner, her husband, Barry, and other local campaigners raised \u00a3100,000 in donations to fight Cuadrilla\u2019s application throughout the two-and-a-half-year process. They were staggered and felt cheated when they received notice of Javid\u2019s decision by email shortly before 10am on Thursday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b921b63865af3192c66a80df56ab10bb65b6d74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b921b63865af3192c66a80df56ab10bb65b6d74/0_106_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth and Barry Warner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth and Barry Warner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Halliday/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just intolerable for the communities that are affected. It is absolute torture. At the heart of it is the expectation that people will buckle because of the strain. It will inflict further anxiety on people who have been through it by two and a half years,\u201d Elizabeth Warner said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like reaching the end of a football match and extra time and a penalty shootout then inventing something else like let\u2019s run round the pitch for 10 laps and the last man home, your team loses. It\u2019s a truly shocking outcome.\u201d</p> <p>As texts and emails pinged around Warner\u2019s anti-fracking nerve centre in her pristine kitchen, her husband, Barry, said Theresa May\u2019s government had ridden roughshod over the objections of 15,000 local residents.</p> <p>\u201cTheresa May just yesterday was talking about fairness,\u201d he said. \u201cShe says that one day and the very next day her secretary of state bends the meaning of the word.

We\u2019re not nimbys, we\u2019re not scaremongerers. We\u2019ve done our research. As far as I\u2019m concerned, fracking is a very bad thing and it clearly is not in line with the government\u2019s commitment on climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Several Roseacre residents said Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking application, first lodged two years ago, had split the once tight-knit rural community. The farmers allowing Cuadrilla to drill for shale gas on their land have been shunned by the majority of locals, who fear it will damage their health, the environment and the area\u2019s reputation as a rural retreat from the bright lights and excess of Blackpool 20 minutes away.</p> <p>Clutching a mug of tea as her grandchildren ran round her back garden, Speak said she had initially been open to the idea of fracking. She turned against it, she said, after researching its potentially harmful effect on the environment. <br></p> <p>She said Thursday\u2019s decision had made her consider quitting her posts as a borough and parish councillor, which she has held for 17 years and 23 years respectively.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like walking away from it all because you feel what is the point? What is the point? They should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d she said. <br></p>",
  "<p>Some years ago I joined a delegation of Labour MPs to the European parliament. A member of the EU commission gave us some of his valuable time. \u201cThe British people are just going to have to learn to put up with freedom of movement,\u201d he said as he sat down.</p> <p>Everyone around me agreed. I remember thinking that the British people didn\u2019t have to put up with anything, not their politicians and certainly not their bureaucrats. But I said nothing. As a recently elected MP I did not have the confidence to interrupt the consensus. And besides, like all my colleagues, I supported freedom of movement.</p> <p>That consensus is now breaking down. Earlier in the summer I wrote about the fears of many Jeremy Corbyn supporters that without him Labour would race not simply to the right but to a fusion of Blairite managerialism and Farage populism.</p> <p>I thought those fears unjustified, a Corbynista version of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\" title=\"\">Project Fear</a>. But some are now arguing that, like Brexit, Project Fear is becoming Project Fact as Labour MPs argue for the party to walk away from freedom of movement and the home secretary proposes lists of \u201cforeign\u201d employees.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only in the UK. Across Europe the rise of the right has made comrades question the appetite for freedom of movement. While the tone and actual proposals differ, the message is often similar. The white working class has been ignored for too long. We need to check our privilege and check out of Europe.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know that much about privilege. I grew up like the white working class, with one obvious difference: I wasn\u2019t white. I\u2019m certainly in a position of immense privilege now, and that gives me a voice when it comes to my values, but it did not help form them. The white working class helped form my values.</p> <p>On North Kenton council estate, where I grew up, racism was a daily occurrence that marked me for life. But I also benefited from a huge amount of support from working-class friends, families and teachers. I learned abiding and entrenched views on fairness, the value of labour and the importance of solidarity. The values that caused Abraham Lincoln to thank \u201cthe working men of Manchester\u201d for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/feb/04/lincoln-oscars-manchester-cotton-abraham\" title=\"\">solidarity against slavery</a>. The values that formed both the co-operative movement and the fair trade movement.</p> <p>When I was selected as candidate for Newcastle Central I said there was no doorstep in the city where I would not go. If someone was voting BNP or Ukip, I would listen and find out why. I learned that we have a huge job to do to regain the trust of many who have been betrayed by rising inequality, reduced demand for traditional skills and increased competition for certain types of work. There is real and justified anger at that betrayal.</p> <p>I can see that such anger might incline some comrades towards if not a flirtation with xenophobia then at least a wary two-step (\u201cLook, we\u2019re not touching, just moving to the mood music\u201d). They hope in so doing to shore up Labour\u2019s position as the party that speaks for the working class, the same reasoning that led the party to abstain on the second reading of the welfare bill last year. This latest dance is likely to be just as successful, but the impact on our reputation would be even worse.</p> <p>There are certainly arguments to be had about freedom of movement of people versus freedom of movement of exploitation and welfare. And there is much to be said for knowing what happens at our borders, and who comes in to the country and who is leaving it.</p> <p>But these arguments must be made from a position of strong support for free movement of people, the jobs it brings through access to the European market and the value those people add to our economy and our society. Without the free movement of people, the free movement of goods and capital isolates and dehumanises us, free trade without free people both commoditises our experience and makes us less resilient to global forces of change.</p> <p>This is toxic territory. It does not lend itself to \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2013 particularly by those who have little familiarity with the working class they claim to represent. For too many, the working-class experience is an essay in anthropology, not a reality to be reflected \u2013 far less challenged or questioned.</p> <p>And even if we could triangulate it to try to win more votes, we should not. Labour party members have for the second time overwhelmingly demonstrated they want authenticity. On this subject the Tories can authentically outplay us every time, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">this week has shown</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately no matter how many soundbites we drop, Labour is not going to be believed as the party that is tough on immigration. We can be believed as the party that is tough on the negative consequences of migration. But if we let our values dance to the tune of xenophobia, we will not be believed on anything.</p>",

Shops remained open in much of the east, and neighbourhoods functioned as they always had, vendors touting wares amid motorbike fumes and cars inching through bustling streets criss-crossed with electricity wires. </p> <p>As war set in, people moved out. Aleppo slowly crumbled over the next two years. A once-symmetrical skyline became increasingly jagged. Rubble stood where the al-Shifa hospital used to be.

  "<p>It\u2019s one of the first things we do in the morning and one of the last we do at night. Yet brushing our teeth sees billions of plastic toothbrushes bound for the world\u2019s rubbish dumps and oceans every year. </p> <p>As important as good oral health is, must it be a source of pollution? Two decades ago, that question set Massachusetts-based Eric Hudson on a quest to produce the world\u2019s first recyclable plastic toothbrush. </p> <h2><strong>Recyclable handles</strong> </h2> <p>After months consulting dentists, scientists and engineers, the <a href=\"https://www.preserveproducts.com/shop/bath/oral-care\" rel=\"nofollow\">Preserve toothbrush</a> was born. The award-winning design has a handle made from recycled plastic \u2013 from discarded toothbrushes and yoghurt pots \u2013 and bristles manufactured from new nylon. <br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of big brands say that they don\u2019t see the \u2018purchase intent\u2019 among customers for recyclable toothbrushes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for us, that\u2019s not the point: the point is to lighten the footprint of the product from the start.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3018f6d5443db5f7460f9848b30824fb0d3a1b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3018f6d5443db5f7460f9848b30824fb0d3a1b5/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"preserve toothbrusg\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Preserve toothbrush.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preserve</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Preserve says it\u2019s now the top-selling US toothbrush in the country\u2019s $85.5bn (\u00a367bn) natural grocery market. The company\u2019s arched brushes can be found on the shelves of Walmart, Trader Joe\u2019s and a host of other mainstream retailers. Already operating in 18 global markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/b-corps-markets-corporate-law\">B Corp-certified</a> Preserve is currently looking to expand in Europe. <br></p> <p>Marking out the product is Preserve\u2019s commitment to so-called closed-loop manufacturing. The company currently operates a nationwide recycling campaign called <a href=\"https://www.preserveproducts.com/recycle/programs/gimme-5-program-171\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gimme 5</a>, which sees around 400 recycling bins placed in retail stores around the US. Consumers can use the bins (mostly located in Whole Foods stores) to return any polypropylene plastics, which are then recycled to make the toothbrush handle. </p> <p>Since 2008, the initiative has saved more than 500,000kg of plastic from going to landfill. To cover its collection costs, Preserve has a sponsorship deal with baby-food manufacturer Plum Organics and Danone-owned yoghurt brand Stonyfield Farm.</p> <p>\u201cToothbrushes get completely lost in the recycling process ... often they\u2019re destined [for] waste-to-energy or shipped overseas, so the Gimme 5 programme definitely has a lighter impact on the earth,\u201d says Hudson. </p> <p>He admits that finding a fully sustainable material for the brush\u2019s bristles is a struggle. Ideally, the company would like to find a biodegradable option \u2013 a quest that remains \u201cstill in the research lab\u201d. It currently uses virgin nylon, which is the \u201cbristle of choice\u201d among dental professionals but is not recycled.</p> <h2><strong>Bamboo brushes</strong></h2> <p>Another option for green-minded consumers is biodegradable toothbrushes. Instead of having to go to the trouble of recycling your brush when you\u2019re done with it (which only 10-20% of those who buy the Preserve Toothbrush actually do), you can just throw it on the compost heap.</p> <p>The overwhelming biodegradable material-of-choice is bamboo, given its natural tensile strength and its ability to grow fast. An early entrant into the market is the <a href=\"http://environmentaltoothbrush.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Environmental Toothbrush</a>, which retails at \u00a32.85 in the UK. Invented by a suburban dentist in Brisbane, Australia, it boasts a heat-treated carbonised surface that gives it a smooth finish \u2013 as well as stopping it going manky on the edge of your bathroom sink. </p> <p>You\u2019re unlikely to stumble on the Environmental Toothbrush or otherbiodegradable brushes (such as <a href=\"http://savesomegreen.co.uk/product/bamboo-toothbrush-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Save Some Green</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brushwithbamboo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brush with Bamboo</a>) on the high-street. Consumers have to either go hunting in specialist health stores or surf eco-ecommerce sites such as <a href=\"http://www.soapnuts.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Living Naturally</a> or <a href=\"http://www.boobalou.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boobalou</a>. </p> <p>A rare exception is the <a href=\"http://www.humblebrush.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humble Brush</a>, which UK supermarket Waitrose started selling at the beginning of the year. In addition to its environmental credentials (the handle is made from FSC-certified bamboo), the product\u2019s Swedish manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.humblesmile.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pledges to donate</a> a free brush or the cost-equivalent in oral care for children living in vulnerable countries. </p> <p>\u201cThe production of plastic toothbrushes produces toxins and leaves a carbon footprint. But more importantly, they never biodegrade,\u201d says Noel Abdayem, a qualified dentist and founder of Humble Brush. </p> <h2><strong>Bio-brushes </strong></h2> <p>For those who aren\u2019t sold on the idea of plastic in any form (Humble Brush uses nylon-6 bristles), the current market options are even more restricted. James Cowles, managing director at the eco-product manufacturer Save Some Green, believes the future could lie with compostable plant-based plastics.</p> <p>\u201cDemand is getting to the stage where [a bioplastic solution] is going to have to happen. Look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2016/aug/24/ban-on-microbeads-tiny-objects-massive-problem-environment-cosmetics\">ban on microbeads</a> and the amount of plastics going into the ocean. It\u2019s not good for the fish, and it\u2019s not good for us,\u201d Cowles says.<br></p> <p>One option for now is to go old-school and revert to the pre-nylon days of toothbrushes with bristles made from pig hair. Germany-based <a href=\"https://www.lifewithoutplastic.com/store/set-of-10-plastic-free-wooden-toothbrushes-for-adults.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Life without Plastic</a> offers just such a product. Its handle, which is made from sustainably-harvested beech wood, should further satisfy (non-vegan) eco-consumers. <br><br>Rachelle Strauss, founder of <a href=\"http://www.zerowasteweek.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Waste Week</a>, says a shift to fully recyclable or biodegradable materials by Oral B, Colgate-Palmolive, Crest and the sector\u2019s other big brands is long overdue. As an immediate step, her advice is to go for a recyclable plastic brush with a comprehensive take-back scheme.</p> <p>\u201cThose already committed to buying green show a preference for biodegradable options,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I wonder if the average consumer is really ready to use a bamboo toothbrush.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Life expectancy has increased by 10 years across the globe in the past 35 years, thanks in part to efforts to treat infectious diseases such as Aids and malaria, but diet, obesity and drug use are now major causes of death and disability while too many women still die in childbirth, data reveals.</p> <p>The Global Burden of Disease study, which regularly reviews the causes of illness, disability and death in every country in the world, shows health is improving but not to the same extent or in the same ways in every country. And as people live longer, they are suffering from more ill health and disability in their old age.</p> <p>\u201cDevelopment drives, but does not determine health,\u201d said Dr Christopher Murray, director of the Institute. \u201cWe see countries that have improved far faster than can be explained by income, education or fertility. And we also continue to see countries \u2013 including the United States \u2013 that are far less healthy than they should be given their resources.\u201d</p> <p>Life expectancy from 1980 to 2015 has risen globally by more than a decade to 69 years in men and 74.8 years in women. The cause of 70% of deaths is non-infectious diseases that often have lifestyle origins, such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, but also include dementia. HIV/Aids, which was a major killer, accounted for 1.2 million deaths in 2015, which is a reduction of a third from 2005.</p> <p>People are spending more years with chronic illness and disability, caused by drug use \u2013 particularly of opioids and cocaine \u2013 loss of sight and hearing and osteoarthritis, according to <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/gbd\">the series of papers published by the Lancet medical journal.</a></p> <p>Low back and neck pain, sight and hearing loss, depression and anaemia caused by a lack of iron were the main reasons why people were living in poor health. Huge numbers of people suffer for more than three months from cavities in their teeth \u2013 2.3 billion \u2013 while 1.5 billion suffer long-term from tension-style headaches. There have been drops in the numbers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cervical cancer and ischemic heart disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/05/human-lifespan-has-hit-its-natural-limit-research-suggests\">Human lifespan has hit its natural limit, research suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>High blood pressure, smoking, high blood sugar, high body mass index, and childhood undernutrition were the leading risk factors for premature death and ill health in 2015. <br></p> <p>Environmental factors undermine people\u2019s health worldwide. Obesity caused by bad diets \u2013 those high in salt and low in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts, seeds and seafoods \u2013 drug use and pollutants such as diesel exhaust and benzene encountered in people\u2019s working lives as well as ozone pollution, have an impact on diabetes, heart disease and cancers, says the study coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p> <p>Progress has been made in reducing the threat to health from smoking, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution, although they remain major causes of poor health. Exposure to smoking fell by over a quarter worldwide, but it is still ranked among the top five risks associated with health loss in 140 countries, claiming 289,000 more lives in 2015 (total deaths: 6.4 million) than 2005, and is the leading risk factor for poor health in the UK and the US. </p> <p>Investment in the Millennium Development Goals brought down the numbers of childhood and maternal deaths, and yet in 2015 more than 275,000 women died in pregnancy or childbirth in 2015, mostly from preventable causes. In 24 countries, deaths have actually risen. Many, such as Afghanistan and Palestine, have been affected by conflict, but some are high-income countries such as the US, Greece and Luxembourg. In the poorest countries, with most of the deaths in childbirth, women most often die from haemorrhage, but in rich countries they die from complications, such as heart problems which may be obesity-related.</p> <p> Prof John Newton of Public Health England, who is involved in the study as chair of the European Burden of Disease Network, said: \u201cThe global picture is similar to that in England \u2013 people are living longer, but spending more time living with illness and disability. While we\u2019ve made great strides to reduce deaths and illness from infections like HIV, malaria and measles, it\u2019s the chronic, non-communicable conditions like diabetes, drug use disorders and hearing and sight loss that create the bigger burden of illness. The treatment and resource implications for health systems are huge.</p> <p>\u201cThis presents a great opportunity for prevention both in England and worldwide. Consequences of a poor diet now account for 10% of all ill-health worldwide and levels of alcohol consumption and air pollution have hardly changed. We can tackle all of this and more through committed individual, national and global action.\u201d</p>",

But the relief of seeing a pair of headlights peek through the tunnel, or the sensation of the hot air of a passing train, are so mundane they can often go uncelebrated save for a fleeting moment. </p> <p>Poetry like Meitner\u2019s can give us a space to sing the praises and frustrations of the cities we live in. But can it actually help us make those cities better? Can poetry be a way to experience and understand our environment more richly?</p> <p>Many people\u2019s first formal interaction with poetry \u2013 beyond nursery rhymes, at least \u2013 tends to be centred on the Romantic-era poets such as Blake, Keats, Wordsworth or Shelley. This particular tradition <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-romantics\">is known for</a> being rooted in a celebration of the beauty of the natural world, typified in classics such as Keats\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/106/255.html\">Ode to Autumn</a><em> </em>(\u201cWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day / And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue\u201d), and Shelley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45134\">Ode to the West Wind</a><em>:</em> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams<br>The blue Mediterranean, where he lay<br>Lull\u2019d by the coil of his crystalline streams\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that over time, poetry has been less associated with train tracks, smog, and bridges and more with brooks, brambles, and fields. </p> <p>However, east London-based poet Tom Chivers, whose work focuses heavily on the urban experience and who has made a series of poetic audio walks down London\u2019s lost rivers, says that emphasis is misplaced. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is this energy and aggression and speed in a city that lends itself to poetry</p> <footer> <cite>Tom Chivers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe city resists nostalgic forms of poetry that have been handed down to us in various traditions,\u201d Chivers says. \u201cThere is this energy and aggression and speed in a city that lends itself to poetry.

At the Southbank Centre\u2019s Poetry Library, which houses the most comprehensive collection of poetry in the UK, Ellams tells me that \u201cpoems are 3D portraits of the world using as few words as possible\u201d. A shortcut to creating that portrait, he says, is by focusing on the senses.</p> <p>This shift in focus from the cerebral to the physical feels particularly apt in the urban setting, where we are bombarded with all manner of sensory assaults \u2013 from unsavoury fumes to dewy morning light and the smell of croissants. Taken as a whole, this can be overwhelming; but embraced intentionally, with a kind of poetic mindfulness, these common threads of the urban experience can take on a whole new meaning. </p> <p>One urban poetic tradition that revels in that act of noticing is that of the <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/10/17/in-praise-of-the-flaneur/\">fl\u00e2neur, or the 19th-century wanderer</a>, personified by the French poet Charles Baudelaire, who once wistfully wrote: \u201cThe form of a city changes faster, alas, than the human heart.\u201d In her book about the subversive tradition of female fl\u00e2neurs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/flaneuse-women-walk-city-paris-new-york-tokyo-venice-london-review-lauren-elkin\">Flaneuse</a>, Lauren Elkin writes of the way Virginia Woolf practiced this art in her Bloomsbury neighbourhood:</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The form of a city changes faster, alas, than the human heart</p> <footer> <cite>Charles Baudelaire</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWoolf reminds us that there is something physically absorbing that keys us into the throb of the city, transformed by the quality of the light, of the air, of the road \u2026 The city, [Woolf] wrote in her diary in 1928, was forever \u2018attract[ing], stimulat[ing]\u2019 her, giving her \u2018a play and a story and a poem\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd13b5815ffa06482c3c4044fc47af72a0fdbae5/0_148_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eminem rap battle 8 mile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hip-hop lyrics are a distinct kind of urban poetry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ellams echoes this sentiment. \u201cSo much of the urban experience is going somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cMeandering is not celebrated.\u201d By slowing down, we notice the kinds of poetic details that can help us transcend the normal thrum of daily life. </p> <p>The 18th-century poet Alexander Pope was a practitioner of a slightly more provocative kind of urban poetry \u2013 he gained notoriety for his habit of cussing and satirising his adversaries in verse. In his four-part poem The Dunciad, Pope publicly lampoons his literary and political rivals and name-drops the \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.be/books?id=bksDnJqR9PgC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=pope+grub+street+race&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XIfqaXOPDp&amp;sig=KrkuRwbnxTOrN4byBF5SbXQB71Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3tOyIvMHPAhUGcRQKHZO8BxkQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pope%20grub%20street%20race&amp;f=fal\">Grub Street race</a>\u201d \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Grub-Street\">bohemian neighbourhood</a> that is now Milton Street near the Barbican in London, where poets and <a href=\"http://www.robertfulford.com/2003-08-19-hacks.html\">hacks</a> used to compete in public readings for literary prestige. </p> <p>Live poetry readings in cities went on to become a key element of the legend of the Beat generation, particularly a <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n17/jeremy-harding/at-the-centre-pompidou\">famous reading in 1955 at the Six Gallery in San Francisco</a>, where Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure and Gary Snyder (among others) came to the attention of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/lawrence-ferlinghetti\">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>, whose offer to publish Ginsberg\u2019s Howl kicked off their fame.

Hip-hop lyrics are a distinctly urban kind of poetry that has exploded in the past 30 years, rising mainly from the experience of black Americans in cities but increasingly to be found in metropolises worldwide. Though the line between rap and poetry depends heavily on who you ask (linguist, literary critic, poet), and Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s declaration that TS Elliot <a href=\"http://gawker.com/an-old-white-man-invented-rap-claims-an-old-white-man-1601184355\">invented rap</a> is even more tin-eared than his music, it is not hard to see the same contemplative urban spirit in Eminem\u2019s film 8 Mile as in some of the best classic urban poetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/22/female-rappers-mexico-city-violence-against-women\">Female rappers take a stand in Mexico's capital of violence against women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another successful project similarly proves that urban poetry needn\u2019t be intimidating or elitist, but simply accessible: <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/culture-and-heritage/poems-on-the-underground\">Poems on the Underground</a>, a public art project funded by the Arts Council and now celebrating its 30th year, has seen 600 poems grace the inside carriages of the Tube and been emulated from New York to Shanghai. \u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to have created a public art project that is so widely liked,\u201d says Judith Chernaik, co-creator and curator. </p> <p>\u201cThe tradition of poetry appearing in parks, in buildings \u2013 this has gone on a long time. There was nothing original about [our project] except that it was on the Tube,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, in such a commercialised world, I think there\u2019s a kind of implicit pleasure in the poems just being there, not doing anything to you, and not forcing you to do anything. People can read it or not. Nobody is shouting. It isn\u2019t a competition \u2013 just an offering.\u201d</p> <p>In a modern world where hyper-connectivity often results in disconnection from our immediate surroundings, creating the space to explore poetry can make us more reflective and engaged citizens. With poetry, the city becomes a place where we meander, both physically and mentally \u2013 or as Chernaik puts it, \u201cbe lifted up to another world, even when we\u2019re underground\u201d.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

  "<p>One of the first things that comes to mind, sitting across from Indi Cowie, who\u2019s dressed in her familiar colorful soccer attire, is how mature and focused she is. Then again, maybe it\u2019s not such a surprise, considering all she\u2019s accomplished in the world of soccer freestyling \u2013 and all by the age of 22.</p> <p>Cowie\u2019s impressive resum\u00e9 has seen her travel and perform across the world, and her talents have given her the opportunity to meet and connect with the biggest names in sport. She\u2019s done half-time shows at Old Trafford in front of 76,000 people, and she took part<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-fLIIzgUGA\"> Mia Hamm\u2019s Celebrity Soccer Challenge</a> with Kobe Bryant and Pep Guardiola.</p> <p>Four years ago, as part of the video game campaign for EA Sports\u2019 Fifa Street, Lionel Messi personally named her global freestyle champion, and in the same year she filmed her very own Champions League/PlayStation commercial \u2013 as well as achieving a Guinness world record by<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/46459130\"> juggling 102 times</a> with her heel. </p> <p>But Cowie says nothing topped meeting Ellen DeGeneres. \u201cShe was so down-to-earth and super nice,\u201d says Cowie. \u201cShe was just so sweet. It was one of the best moments of my life.\u201d</p> <p>As arguably the world\u2019s foremost female soccer freestyler, Cowie has made a habit of proving people wrong \u2013 especially men.</p> <p>Growing up, she played with the boys\u2019 teams, in spite of all the negative comments. \u201cI would hear things like: \u2018You can\u2019t play in a guy\u2019s team, you\u2019re a girl, you can\u2019t keep up with the speed of the play,\u2019\u201d remembers Cowie. \u201cAnd I would say to myself: \u2018Well, I have to play now, I have to show them that I can do it.\u2019 That would always be my motivation.\u201d</p> <p>Like the times she\u2019d read comments on freestyle forums where male bloggers would say a female freestyler could never do a \u201cthree revolution\u201d \u2013 where the foot does three full rotations around the ball while the ball is still in the air.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmCiX9xYlN8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HmCiX9xYlN8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cFor years, the guys would say that a girl\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t be able to do it because their hips were too wide or their legs were too slow, so I trained and trained and trained.\u201d The hard work paid off: last year Cowie<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmCiX9xYlN8\"> became the first ever female freestyler to land the trick.</a> \u201cWe just have to keep pushing ourselves, no matter what. Even after all of this we\u2019re still looked down upon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about Indi is that she is unbelievably determined,\u201d says her childhood friend Charlotte DeFazio. De Fazio, a writer and editor who lives in Manhattan, has known Cowie since they were toddlers, and believes her friend\u2019s drive and work ethic has always been there, but the fact that she is a woman in a male-dominated sport gives her a bigger purpose to pursue success.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a drive for her, as it is for many of us in our own industries, and I just think that\u2019s so inspiring and incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Indi Armstrong Cowie was born in Boca Raton, Florida to Scottish parents. Her grandfather, Dick, had a short professional career with St Mirren, but Cowie says the football gene skipped a generation. \u201cMy dad likes to say soccer was in his blood, but it didn\u2019t flow to his feet.\u201d After 10 months in Florida, the Cowies relocated to North Carolina and as soon as she could crawl, Cowie was attached to a soccer ball. She took the usual journey of being coached by her dad and playing for academy and travel teams \u2013 but the place where she found her calling was freestyle.</p> <p>\u201cI think I was 10 or 11, and I always enjoyed juggling, but then it got to a point where I just kept going and see how many I could do.\u201d She did 2,000. After some research on the different skills and tricks that could be achieved, the 11-year-old Indi discovered freestyling.</p> <p>During a family trip to Scotland, Cowie begged her parents, Logan and Judith, to go to Leeds and see John Farnworth, one of the most respected names in football freestyling.</p> <p>\u201cAfter seeing him, I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when it became more than just a hobby.\u201d</p> <p>She was also working on her career as a professional soccer player. When she was 14, the family moved back to Glasgow for a semester during her sophomore year, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/magazine/mag-27Soccer-t.html?_r=1\">she was accepted</a> to play for Celtic\u2019s women\u2019s academy. After graduating from high school a semester early, Cowie went to the University of North Carolina \u2013 she\u2019s still there as an art major \u2013 to play for their women\u2019s NCAA team, one of the most renowned squads in the country.</p> <p>Sadly, during a preseason match, Cowie damaged her knee. There was no contact, and no collision, but the knee popped, and she knew something was wrong. Cowie suffered damage to her medial and anterior cruciate ligament, and it was enough to scar her chances of making it as a professional player. \u201cBefore that injury I thought I could do both \u2013 freestyle and pros,\u201d she says. \u201cIn college, I would get up at 4am and do freestyle and then go to practice. So I was hoping to balance both.\u201d</p> <p>She had to make a decision. Doctors said she had a 40% chance of re-injuring her knee if she played again. So she chose freestyle. Her rehab period was tough, and she worried about her future.</p> <p>\u201cIt was harder to recover mentally than it was physically,\u201d she says. \u201cI went from playing and freestyling every single minute of the day to doing nothing, and just to have that taken away it was really hard to just figure out who I was without a soccer ball.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from her freestyling skills, Cowie, who is now sponsored by Nike, has an eye for entrepreneurship. Her digital presence, from Facebook to her YouTube channel to her Instagram page, plays a vital role in her work.</p> <p>\u201cSocial media can be a great tool, but there are also some negative aspects that can come with it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I realize I have a following and I have an influence on people, especially with young kids, so I think hard about what I post and how I post it \u2013 focusing on things that can be inspiring and uplifting.\u201d</p> <p>Cowie also posts about her everyday life, like the time she went to the Adele concert, or when she met Michelle Obama and Jessica Alba at FNV (Fruit n\u2019 Veggies), an organization set up to promote healthy living. She has almost 800,000 fans on Facebook.<br></p> <p>As we begin to wrap up our conversation, I get to witness just how good Cowie is.</p> <p>I foolishly<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BK0qf9MgM-H/?taken-by=luismechegaray\"> agree to a freestyle battle</a> \u2013 despite the embarrassment that\u2019s sure to come my way. We start things easy. I show her my repertoire: my usual one revolution, Ronaldinho\u2019s ball-balancing-on-the-head trick, my lifting it up with the use of only the knee. She seems impressed, and even cheers me on. </p> <p>But then, it\u2019s showtime.<br></p> <p>Let me assure you: to be so close to a freestyler when they show you their arsenal of trickery is an unbelievable experience. When Cowie performs, you can\u2019t help but smile. Freestylers, like dancers, create poetry by expressing themselves through motion and in this scenario the ball is Cowie\u2019s partner. No matter where she places it \u2013 by her head, on the sole of her foot, her forehead \u2013 you begin to realize that you\u2019re watching an artist at work. In this case, Indi Cowie is Misty Copeland with a soccer ball.<br></p>",
  "<p>Spot the difference. Fracking, which is climate-polluting and unproven in the UK, gets \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/13/shale-gas-fracking-cameron-all-out\">all-out</a>\u201d government backing, with ministers steamrolling over local opposition. Onshore windfarms, proven to be low-cost and low-carbon, get undermined by the government, with <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn04370.pdf\">local opposition given power to block applications</a>.</p> <p>The decision by the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">overturn Lancashire council\u2019s rejection of Cuadrilla\u2019s plan</a> to drill four fracking wells in the county is, therefore, nothing short of hypocrisy. </p> <p>It is a vital win for the nascent UK shale gas industry. But these are merely the opening skirmishes. To really know if fracking can provide significant gas for the UK, hundreds - if not thousands - of wells need to be drilled. Given the hand-to-hand combat that accompanies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">even single wells</a> at the moment, the frackers still have an uphill struggle.</p> <p>But the government has their back. It has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/06/fracking-local-people-payments-theresa-may\">cash handouts to local people</a> in fracking areas: compensation or bribes, depending on your point of view. Yet why are the same incentives not offered for windfarms? A key underlying reason for opposition to turbines is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled\">feeling of invasion of a community</a> which derives no benefit from the development.</p> <p>Ministers cannot say they did not know. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-attitudes-tracking-survey-wave-17\">government\u2019s own public opinion poll</a> shows nearly eight in 10 people agree that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located. The poll also shows 81% in support of renewables, with 4% against. Contrast that with fracking: 19% in favour and 31% against, with the rest undecided.</p> <p>So why does the government persist? The heady fracking fumes drifting across the Atlantic from the US, where shale oil and gas have transformed the energy market, are intoxicating. Ministers initially argued that fracking in the UK would cut energy bills, only to discover than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/uk-advertising-watchdog-admits-it-was-wrong-to-ban-greenpeace-fracking-advert?CMP=share_btn_tw\">no one else agreed with them</a>. </p> <p>The US is huge, relatively sparsely populated and loosely regulated: a fracker\u2019s dream.

  "<p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> is among the day\u2019s leading fallers on worries about the outlook for both its clothing and food businesses.</p> <p>Its shares are down more than 4% to 323.5p as analysts at Numis reduced their recommendation from hold to reduce with a 295p price target.</p> <p>In a hefty note on the retail sector Numis said there had been a bounceback from the immediate weakness post-Brexit vote, with consumer confidence recovering and trading - apart from weather related problems - holding up. But 2017 could be a little more difficult, the broker said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, 2017 is set to be a challenging, but not disastrous, year for the General Retailers. We expect the early effects of Brexit to weigh on employment growth, and drive some inflationary pressure on household costs, such that we expect retail sales growth of flat to +1%.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Marks in particular, Numis said the company\u2019s new strategy on pricing looked the right move but the jury was out on whether it would succeed: It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recognising after five years of negative like for likes that M&amp;S had \u2018clearly got its price dynamic wrong\u2019, new chief executive Steve Rowe announced a series of strategic volte-faces, including double-digit price reductions on 30% of the range, a shift back to \u2018good\u2019 product, reduced seasonal phases, and a de-emphasis of the sub-brands.

With like for likes having tipped marginally into negative territory in the first quarter, and while we see no imminent threat, we do see any weakness in the Food division as a meaningful downside risk.</p> <p>Given the warm August and September, M&amp;S\u2019 current trading will undoubtedly have been weak. As a result, we expect first half pretax profit to be in the region of \u00a3215m, which would suggest, even with a marked improvement in second half like for likes, full year pretax profit closer to \u00a3575m, if not worse. Versus current consensus of \u00a3590m, this suggests yet more downgrades to come.</p> <p>By our calculation, M&amp;S is now achieving a return on cash invested of just 5% and consensus expectations do not suggest any meaningful growth profile. Moreover, we are expecting downgrades in the coming weeks. And yet, on 11.2 times, it trades at a 10% premium to Next (10.2 times) on 2017 PE. </p> </blockquote>",

Output per hour in manufacturing rose by 2.2% on the previous quarter and was 1% higher than a year earlier.<br></p> <p>John Philpott, the director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said news of an increase in overall productivity growth was encouraging, but warned that the process of leaving the EU fuelled uncertainty about the UK\u2019s ability to climb the international productivity rankings.</p> <p>\u201cWhile likely curbs on unskilled migration may aid productivity by removing the drip feed of cheap EU labour to less efficient businesses, productivity could suffer if anti-migrant sentiment prevents the UK from attracting talent,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cFar more important, however, will be the impact of Brexit on business investment, which is almost certain to be adversely affected by short-run uncertainty, with longer run recovery critically dependent on the precise Brexit settlement the UK eventually reaches with the EU. Either way, there is little to suggest that the UK economy will any time soon begin to reverse its post-recession slide down the international productivity league table.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Brinkley of human resources trade group CIPD echoed this warning and said the onus was on Hammond to find ways to keep productivity growing.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>With the long-term challenges posed by Brexit and wider adverse global trends, it is imperative that we do not let this recovery slip away,\u201d he said. \u201cSecuring a sustained recovery can only come from increased investment in people and new technologies. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">forthcoming autumn statement</a> needs to show how the government intends to support future productivity growth through investment in infrastructure, skills, and the science base.\u201d</p> <p>Others have urged the chancellor not to focus solely on high-value sectors, but look at productivity in the parts of the economy that employ low-paid workers. </p> <p>By broadening the industrial strategy to include low-paying sectors, the government could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-urged-to-downgrade-autumn-statement\">make greater economic gains</a>, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said, and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of working poverty. </p> <p>The charity published an analysis this week showing that almost 1 million workers are trapped in working poverty in the retail, residential care, and hotels and catering sectors, in which productivity lags behind the economy as a whole. </p>",

But May insisted she would still seek \u201cto give British companies the maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market\u201d.</p> <p>The report\u2019s stark warnings are likely to redouble demands from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">keeping single market membership</a> should be the UK\u2019s main priority after the June referendum\u2019s narrow vote to leave. </p> <p>The FAI\u2019s study for Holyrood\u2019s Europe committee forecasts that even in a best-case scenario, where the UK adopts Norwegian-style membership of the single market but remains outside the EU, the Scottish economy would lose up to \u00a35bn in value over 10 years.</p> <p>The institute, part of the University of Strathclyde, said its modelling suggested that up to 30,000 people in Scotland could lose their jobs while wages for those still in work would fall by about 3-4% or \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200 a year. </p> <p>Professor Graeme Roy, the thinktank\u2019s director, said its forecasts suggested the UK\u2019s economy would be even harder hit by Brexit because a far higher volume of its exports went into the EU, suggesting higher job losses and deeper cuts to GDP. </p> <p>Scotland\u2019s economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/scottish-economy-grows-far-more-slowly-than-uk-as-a-whole\">was weaker and more sluggish </a>than the UK\u2019s as a whole before the referendum, with public spending running a substantial \u00a315bn annual deficit, increasing its vulnerability. </p> <p>As Scotland\u2019s largest market remains the rest of the UK, with EU trade worth \u00a311.5bn versus \u00a348.5bn from the rest of the UK, a recession south of the border would add to the pressure on Scottish businesses. And unlike the 2008 banking crash, this impact would be long-term.</p> <p>Roy added that there were complex forces at play. Some industries with greater reliance on EU trade, such as transport and services, would be hit hardest. Under a hard Brexit scenario, 25,000 jobs would be lost from wholesale and retail, transport and warehousing sectors alone. Ministers could now start looking at strategies for supporting the most vulnerable sectors.</p> <p>But others with a wider global market may not be so hard hit. The Scotch whisky industry, which generates up to \u00a35bn a year in exports but supports relatively few jobs, could benefit from a lower pound and see sales grow in non-EU markets. </p> <p>Joan McAlpine MSP, the convener of the culture, tourism, Europe and external relations committee which commissioned the report, said it\u201cpaints a grim picture\u201d.If the UK government leads us into a hard Brexit the evidence presented in this report indicates that there could be disastrous consequences for jobs, exports and production,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour\u2019s economy spokeswoman, said: \u201cThis report shows the cost of the Tories\u2019 reckless Brexit gamble and how vital it is that Scotland, and indeed the whole UK, retains access to the single market. When Theresa May hinted at a hard Brexit earlier this week, sterling crashed to a 31-year low. Even the most blinkered of Brexiteers cannot ignore the huge risk this poses to our economy.\u201d</p> <p>A UK government spokeswoman said May and David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, had already made clear they were seeking a bespoke deal with the EU, to get the best outcome possible. \u201cAs the report itself recognises, we have not begun negotiating our exit from the EU, so it seems very premature to draw conclusions from some highly speculative models,\u201d she said. </p>",

You work when you\u2019re ill because if you take a day off you don\u2019t earn money. I think everyone can relate to this. If we could have at least a few paid holidays or sick days, it would make our lives a lot easier and less stressful.\u201d</p> <p>Tomaszewska set up her business two years after leaving university, and while she loves her freedom, she suggests that many who choose self-employment do so because they had no other choice. \u201cNowadays even if you are a graduate it\u2019s difficult to find a full-time position in your field.\u201d</p> <p>Darren Fell, the CEO and founder of Crunch, a cloud accountancy firm in Brighton, hopes the review will bring greater understanding about the needs of the self-employed. He describes how he struggled to get a mortgage. \u201cIt took me nearly a year to navigate the process, despite running a successful business. When I founded Crunch seven years ago, I reinvested the money made from the sale of my previous business, Pure 360. Crunch was scaling rapidly every day, as we took on more clients and team members. Yet as the major stakeholder of a business in its startup phase, I was deemed too risky and nobody was prepared to lend to me.\u201d</p> <p>While many self-employed people believe the government could do more to support them, it also has to tread a fine line. The self-employed are not always in favour of greater government regulations, indeed business lobbies spend significant time campaigning against \u201cred tape\u201d.

Although he is arguably a rare case, he argues that any entrepreneur without a long trading history is disadvantaged. \u201cObtaining finance remains out of the question for many budding entrepreneurs. Younger entrepreneurs will not have a credit history or any assets which makes it practically impossible to secure funding from banks and loan agencies.

Lawrie Jones, managing director of marketing company 42group, said: \u201cwe have been affected by our inability to enforce debt management on clients who haven\u2019t paid us.

Jones\u2019 42group has worked regularly for government agencies, but says winning the work is time consuming. \u201cIt\u2019s often interesting and challenging work, but they make it very hard for small businesses to break through - either as a result of stringent contract conditions, lengthy forms or long payment schedules.\u201d</p> <p>While the idea of running a company has gained in popularity, in other quarters business has been getting a bad name.

By demanding a high rental fee, probably, but if the friendly international calendar changes after 2019 so that neither hemisphere has to embark on an end-of-season tour, the end of August into September could become the window for what are now the autumn and summer series, blending the two into one.</p> <p>The All Blacks may play England at Twickenham on consecutive weekends, or Wales in Cardiff or France in Paris, away in the first and at home in the second, banking far more than they would for a match at Eden Park.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone will look at opportunities available to them and I am sure they want to see how successful Saturday is,\u201d said Steve Phillips, the Welsh Rugby Union\u2019s finance director as he reflected on Saturday evening\u2019s match at Twickenham. \u201cWe would consider a request to play a Rugby Championship match at the Principality Stadium whilst being careful about cannibalising our own market by competing against it.</p> <p>\u201cWe spoke many years ago about the possibility of Bath and one of our regions playing back-to-back European Cup matches at the ground. It was an interesting idea, and while Bath are playing Leicester at Twickenham next April, we are closer. There are politics involved, of course, and the talks about the global calendar are continuing. They will play out to a conclusion and while we would not look at anything if we thought it would work against our interests, you do not want to see Australia and South Africa going the way of France. The world game needs all the leading nations to be competitive and add to the mystery.\u201d</p> <p>Borders are expanding. The Premiership ventured into the United States last season when London Irish played Saracens in New Jersey, a venture that will be repeated if, with the Exiles in the Championship, another club can be persuaded to give up a home fixture; Newcastle seem to be the most likely. The Top 14 played its final this year at the Camp Nou in Barcelona while Saracens, after trying to arrange a European Cup match in Cape Town, entertained Racing M\u00e9tro in Brussels four years ago.</p> <p>Players have moved from the south to the north in ever growing numbers in the professional era, following the money just as their countries now are. Oregan Hoskins, the former president of SA Rugby, said last month that he believed South Africa should leave Sanzar, and therefore Super Rugby and the Rugby Championship, and link up with the European unions, taking advantage of the same time zone.</p> <p>\u201cWe need people to sit around the table and ask where we stop the haemorrhaging; do we continue with Sanzar?\u201d said Hoskins. \u201cWe need to join the northern hemisphere and we should call convention involving the stakeholders in our game, the people who put in a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>Hoskins had advocated moving to Europe before, when he had an official role. Having resigned from SA Rugby before his time as president was up, he is now speaking as an individual against a backdrop in the country of falling gates, fewer television viewers and the loss of sponsors. Television revenue has increased, but not by enough to stem mounting losses.</p> <p>The figures may mean that South Africa heed Hoskins\u2019s advice and act out of self-interest rather than solidarity. The Six Nations would be less demanding to win with New Zealand not part of it, but if Hoskins had floated his idea a generation ago, when the south was the powerhouse of the game on the field and in the bank, he would have been laughed at.</p> <p>Not now, which is why Argentina and Australia, two countries not in Europe\u2019s time zone \u2013 although the evening kick-off at Twickenham will mean an afternoon slot for television viewers supporting the \u2018home side\u2019 \u2013 are in London this week, on the money trail.</p> <p><em>This is an extract taken from the Guardian\u2019s weekly rugby union email, The Breakdown.

  "<p>One of the constant refrains from veteran - especially retired - journalists over the last 20 years or so is that investigative journalism is dead. It is, of course, rubbish.</p> <p>In different ways, every mainstream newspaper runs investigations of some kind, as do the major news broadcasters. Although months may pass without one, they still turn up and usually make waves.</p> <p>It is true that cash-strapped newspapers have studied their editorial budgets more closely and there has been greater pressure on reporting teams to produce results more quickly. </p> <p>Rarely do reporters have the luxury of spending months on an investigatuion, although the Daily Telegraph did just that, saying it spent 10 months on its recent agenda-setting FA tales.</p> <p>Investigative journalism, off the news diary, separate from the daily round of events, free from PR persuasion, remains among our trade\u2019s greatest reasons for existence.</p> <p>Sadly, one of its very best exponents, Nick Davies, has retired from the fray. At his farewell party last Friday at the Frontline Club, he blushed at the praise heaped upon him by the former Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger.</p> <p>But Nick has inspired many people along the way, as has another retired Guardian reporter, David Leigh, who now spends time passing on his knowledge to students at City University. <br></p> <p>They know that one of the great benefits of the digital revolution has been the springing up of online outlets that have given a new fillip to their craft.</p> <p>These so-called \u201cnew kids on the block\u201d include the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), which operates from quarters at City University and has received a grant from Google to promote local reporting. Think also of BuzzFeed and Vice.</p> <p>Then there are the NGOs and global charities that have created investigative journalism units. Greenpeace, for example, has recently hired a team of reporters to dig deeper into stories about climate change and the environment.</p> <p>Global Witness has increased its already significant investigative capacity. In 2014, it revealed - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/15/surge-deaths-environmental-activists-global-witness-report\">courtesy of the Guardian</a>, incidentally - a surge in the killing of activists protecting land rights and the environment. </p> <p>And global collaboration has changed the face of investigative journalism in recent years, as the Wikileaks and Ed Snowden revelations showed. Similarly, the Panama Papers exposure was carried out by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a network of <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/journalists\">more than 190 investigative journalists based in more than 65 countries</a>.<br></p> <p>If you want to know more about the health of investigative journalism, and also the problems and pressures it faces, then you might try to find a way of attending a Frontline Club event next Thursday (13 October), \u201c<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/new-kids-on-the-block-in-investigative-journalism-tickets-27701880069\">New kids on the block in investigative journalism</a>\u201d. </p> <p>Among the speakers will be David Leigh; the BIJ\u2019s managing editor Rachel Oldroyd; BuzzFeed\u2019s news investigations correspondent Jane Bradley; and Maeve McClenaghan, a freelance journalist who is also Greenpeace\u2019s senior investigative reporter.

  "<p>The arrival of the immense <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hurricane-matthew-leaves-haiti-facing-humanitarian-crisis-un\" title=\"\">Hurricane Matthew</a> on Haitian land early on Tuesday morning has plunged the Caribbean\u2019s oldest nation into another period of despairing uncertainty. Haiti is ill-prepared to deal with what Matthew brings \u2013 category 4 force winds and a 190-mile outer band of powerful rains pounding the towns and villages along the southwestern coastline and extending all the way to the Dominican Republic. Haiti\u2019s soil already holds the lives of far too many of its children taken by extreme natural disasters.</p> <p>Matthew comes at an especially tense moment for Haiti. This Sunday, Haitians were meant to go to the polls to choose from 27 candidates to cast their vote for the new president of the republic. However, in the wake of Matthew the election has been postponed indefinitely. The poll was to have been a restart of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/haiti-elections-2015-voters-face-long-wait\" title=\"\">controversial first round</a> held in October 2015 that cost millions, only to dissolve in fraudulent results and widespread national protests. This time around, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/13/rotten-system-blamed-haiti-election-stalemate\" title=\"\">campaign had been prolonged</a> by repeated delays and clashes between the electoral council and the candidates.</p> <p>Politics and natural disasters have a way of converging to disturb the state of things in Haiti. In most recent memory the devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/16/the-haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-then-and-now\" title=\"\">2010 earthquake</a> that struck the capital Port-au-Prince and its environs led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, bringing unimaginable trauma. A global outpouring of support drew sympathy and attention but few lasting resources. It also came in an election year. The elections were held at a time when the country, and the world, were still coming to terms with the earthquake. The cost was significant. International assistance addressed short-term needs while repeating the same approaches that had made the scale of the disaster so expansive. In 2004, seven months after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/08/guardiananalysispage\" title=\"\">ousting of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/sep/22/naturaldisasters.climatechange\" title=\"\">Tropical Storm Jeanne</a> deposited 13 inches of water in Haiti and claimed more than 3,000 lives. And as far back as the 19th century, a massive earthquake in the north of Haiti in May 1842 preceded an uprising against president Jean-Pierre Boyer less than a year later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d31e6b799e049eed1dfdf98831a1699c3a305159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31e6b799e049eed1dfdf98831a1699c3a305159/0_152_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The presidency of Michel Martelly was dogged with claims of corruption and state abuse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The presidency of Michel Martelly was dogged with claims of corruption and state abuse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rarely has a disaster occurred in such close proximity to a scheduled major political event as it has this week. Whenever the poll eventually takes place, the stakes will be high. The several political quagmires that followed the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/haiti-leaders-move-to-install-provisional-government\" title=\"\">president Michel Martelly</a> (2011-2016) have further undermined Haitian politics, with claims of corruption and state abuse. The forthcoming elections are expected to, at the very least, demonstrate a willingness to improve. Yet popular distrust of local and international powers is great.</p> <p>Most upsetting are the effects of these conditions on Haitians. Programmes intended to expand the economy in areas such as tourism have brought little benefit for Haiti\u2019s more than 10 million people. Instead, Haitian emigration has increased tremendously and to new locations in Central and South America as thousands of the country\u2019s citizens find fewer reasons to endure the economic hardships and political instability. Any improvement hinges on a restoration of the political process through the election of a new president. It is also clear that other countries, particularly the United States, are expected to play a role in whatever direction Haiti takes. Last month, at an address to the United Nations, interim president Jocelerme Privert called for more support from the international community to restore stability after the elections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hurricane-matthew-leaves-haiti-facing-humanitarian-crisis-un\">Hurricane Matthew: UN says 350,000 Haitians in need of assistance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of that was before Tuesday morning. Now Hurricane Matthew brings a new challenge for Haiti\u2019s leaders and the international community that has vowed to help the proud nation. The efficacy of the infrastructure repairs put in place since 2010 will be tested. Concerns that Haiti\u2019s fragile democracy must not be knocked off course have to be weighed against the human tragedy that will result from ineffective action.</p> <p>If Haiti\u2019s contending politicians must do anything now, it is to insist that the lessons of the past six years, which saw a deadly cholera outbreak added to the impact of the quake, are heeded. For a vulnerable country that has suffered greatly from weaker tropical systems, the effects of Hurricane Matthew could be catastrophic. The Haitian state and the international community have a duty to provide an effective emergency response. But so do members of Haiti\u2019s civil society and its large diaspora. It was these groups that made some of the strongest interventions after the earthquake. Haiti\u2019s neighbours, including spared Jamaica, also have a role to play once the full impact of the hurricane is known.</p> <p>Outside forces have much to atone for. In many ways it is the failures of international support since 2010 that have had greater consequences for Haiti than its longstanding political failures. There is now a desperate need for a new type of engagement with Haiti. After Matthew, Haiti simply cannot endure any more broken promises.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 October 2016 to reflect the fact that the elections had been postponed indefinitely</p>",
  "<p>Atlantic City may be forced by New Jersey into an unprecedented state takeover of its water as the result of a bailout, something experts have warned has worrying echoes of the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and could result in price hikes.</p> <p>The near-bankruptcy of the financially ailing resort town was caused in part by the failures of casinos such as those previously owned by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-atlantic-city-casinos-taj-mahal-plaza-bankruptcy\">Trump and Atlantic City: the lessons behind the demise of his casino empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Casino closures over the past five years opened a cavern in Atlantic City\u2019s budget, as <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/08/atlantic-citys-watchdogs\">property values plummeted and tax revenues plunged</a>. However, Governor Chris Christie \u2013 now also chair of Trump\u2019s White House transition team \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/03/christie_i_wont_let_atlantic_city_file_for_bankrup.html\">refused earlier this year to allow Atlantic City to formally go bankrupt</a> to shed or restructure debt. </p> <p>Instead, a harsh $73m bailout loan was signed by the city and state, which required Atlantic City to dissolve its independent water utility and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3123636-JG-atlantic-city-loan-agreement.html#document/p9/a320691\">hold the infrastructure as collateral for the bailout loan</a>. Christie, a water privatization proponent, has said he would \u201csell\u201d the city\u2019s assets if Atlantic City failed to meet its loan obligations, a promise that could result in a private company owning or leasing the city\u2019s infrastructure.</p> <p>Separately, the Guardian can reveal that while two of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos were under his control, the mogul failed to pay more than $146,000 in water bills between 2012 and 2014 until March this year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual for the state to step in on a municipality\u2019s finances at all,\u201d said Daniel J Van Abs, a Rutgers University professor and expert in water policy. \u201cThe sort of deal that was established for Atlantic City is even more unusual, if you will. The notion that they should be required to privatize their utility \u2013 I have not seen the state take that action previously.\u201d<br></p> <p>Advocates of public water were blunt about the loan\u2019s terms.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s undemocratic and un-American,\u201d said Mary Grant, a water privatization expert at Food &amp; Water Watch, an advocacy group that monitors corporate water takeover attempts.</p> <p>\u201cThe relationship to Flint is very compelling,\u201d Grant said. \u201cAn emergency manager came in and made decisions about the water system against the wishes of the local elected officials, and that resulted in the Flint water crisis, because they put money before health and human lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f00364334ef2d2e6039106d5c652ef1853cb262b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f00364334ef2d2e6039106d5c652ef1853cb262b/0_93_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian waves at a local walking the boardwalk as he passes the huge shuttered Revel casino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian waves at a local walking the boardwalk as he passes the huge shuttered Revel casino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael S Williamson/The Washington Post</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Customers of private water companies routinely <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2016/02/16/new-rate-survey-500-us-water-systems-finds-private-water-providers-charge-58\">pay more for water</a>, and under privatization the people of Atlantic City would lose democratic control of their water and rates, as the people of Flint did when an emergency manager made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/16/flints-water-crisis-what-went-wrong\">broad changes to the city\u2019s source water</a> in 2014 that resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/24/flint-children-water-crisis-lack-of-data-lead\">widespread lead contamination</a>. </p> <p>A change in source water is unlikely in Atlantic City, but residents would have little say in rates or improvements. Currently, a local board supervises Atlantic City\u2019s water utility. If a private company took over, only the state\u2019s public utility board, which has limited power, could intercede to mitigate hefty rate hikes.</p> <p>In September, Atlantic City violated a key term of New Jersey\u2019s $73m loan by failing to dissolve its municipal utility authority, and this month it sailed past the most recent state-imposed deadlines. New Jersey\u2019s division of community affairs, which administers the loan, refused to comment.</p> <p>While it remains unclear when and if the state might enforce the terms of the loan agreement, a <a href=\"http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/02/05/with-stroke-of-pen-christie-makes-it-easy-sell-off-water-wastewater-facilities/\">2014 law signed by Christie</a> assured an easy transfer of Atlantic City\u2019s water into private hands, and the governor has made his intentions clear. </p> <p>\u201cI want it secured by every asset they have, so that if they don\u2019t pay it, I get to take the assets, sell them and pay you [the taxpayer] back,\u201d Christie said at a public appearance in August, according to the <a href=\"http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/atlantic-city-begins-dissolving-water-utility-for-million-loan/article_9bdfa650-55fa-11e6-8c6f-ab79300c9957.html\">Press of Atlantic City</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey sent [the loan agreement] back all marked up, \u2018We want to change this, we want to change this,\u2019\u201d he said of Atlantic City lawmakers. \u201cExcuse me? You\u2019re asking for $74m to stay alive, you should just say, \u2018Where do I sign? Thank you, sir.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few years, Christie has laid the groundwork for the lease or sale of New Jersey water utilities. The <a href=\"http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/02/05/with-stroke-of-pen-christie-makes-it-easy-sell-off-water-wastewater-facilities/\">2014 Water Infrastructure Protection Act</a> eliminated the requirement for a <a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/dep/wipa/general.html\">public referendum</a> when water infrastructure is sold or leased to a private company in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/dep/wipa/general.html\">emergent conditions</a>\u201d. The law also eliminated the public utility board\u2019s review of rate hikes from water system purchases, an expert at the rate counsel of New Jersey said.</p> <p>In other words, if Atlantic City\u2019s water supply is purchased for $100m, a price <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/01/30/464961028/new-jersey-steps-in-to-turn-around-atlantic-city-s-luck\">repeatedly cited in public debate</a>, corporate buyers could lawfully pass on that cost to ratepayers in increased water rates \u2013 not just in Atlantic City, but anywhere across the state that the corporation owns water.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill suggests that costs get automatically passed to ratepayers,\u201d said Stefanie Brand, the director of the rate counsel of New Jersey, about the Water Infrastructure Protection Act, which passed into law. Though she said her organization would fight such an increase, she admitted it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether the rate counsel could triumph. </p> <p>At least two of the largest private water companies in America have lobbied heavily in New Jersey: Suez North America, a French multinational corporation, and American Water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5ca7de1fc127e64282a00a20777bb55dbfb00f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5ca7de1fc127e64282a00a20777bb55dbfb00f/0_308_4946_2974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Christie has laid the groundwork for the lease or sale of New Jersey water utilities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Christie has laid the groundwork for the lease or sale of New Jersey water utilities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Evans/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New Jersey American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, spent $708,750 from 2011 to 2015 lobbying New Jersey lawmakers on \u201cutility business issues\u201d, according to state lobbying disclosures.

  "<p>Climate scientists have 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming over the past six decades. Their best estimate attributes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/27/global-warming-ipcc-report-humans\">100% of global warming since 1950 to human activities</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming\">90 to 100% of climate scientists and their research agree on this</a>. Human-caused global warming is as settled as science gets.</p> <p>Yet most Americans don\u2019t realize it. Moreover, the more conservative a person\u2019s ideology, the less likely they are to accept this scientific reality or to trust the scientific experts.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/\">a new Pew Research Center poll</a>, just 48% of Americans realize that the Earth is warming mostly due to human activity. Highlighting a vast partisan reality gap, 79% of liberal Democrats and just 15% of conservative Republicans answer the question correctly.</p> <h2><strong>Science knowledge matters for Democrats, but not Republicans</strong></h2> <p>Among social scientists, there\u2019s an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/04/scientists-are-figuring-out-the-keys-to-convincing-people-about-global-warming\">debate about whether facts can change peoples\u2019 minds</a> on scientific issues that have become politically polarized, like climate change. There\u2019s some evidence that when conservatives have more scientific knowledge, it just gives them more tools to use in rejecting the scientific information that conflicts with their ideological beliefs.</p> <p>Pew asked a variety of general science questions to test the correlation between scientific knowledge and acceptance of human-caused global warming. Overall, Democrats and Republicans got the same average score on these scientific questions, although liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans scored better than moderates in both parties. When it came to understanding that humans are causing global warming, Pew found that scientific knowledge makes a huge difference among Democrats, and no difference among Republicans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1c583b69dae16c8dd056b318715c72255be2003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1c583b69dae16c8dd056b318715c72255be2003/0_0_420_460/420.jpg\" alt=\"Acceptance of human-caused global warming broken down by political affiliation and general science knowledge.\" width=\"420\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Acceptance of human-caused global warming broken down by political affiliation and general science knowledge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Pew Research Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, previous research has shown that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/aug/07/facts-can-convince-some-conservatives-about-global-warming\">conservatives with climate-specific knowledge are more likely to accept climate realities</a>. </p> <p>For Democrats, ideology isn\u2019t a factor because the main solutions to the problem (<em>e.g.</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jun/25/climate-change-carbon-emissions-president-obama-epa\">regulations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">pollution taxes</a>) don\u2019t conflict with their ideological beliefs. Thus scientific knowledge determines whether they understand that humans are causing global warming. For three-quarters of American conservatives, their ideology prevents them from accepting that reality, regardless of their scientific literacy.</p> <h2><strong>Republicans distrust climate science experts</strong></h2> <p>The expert consensus on human-caused global warming poses a conundrum for conservatives. People usually defer to the experts, in particular on complex issues like climate science. How can they square an ideological opposition to climate change solutions with the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/meta;jsessionid=4998AD2337003A365518190110EBAAAE.c6.iopscience.cld.iop.org\">97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming</a>? The Pew survey suggests that conservatives accomplish this by denying the expert consensus, and by distrusting the experts.</p> <p>The poll asked whether respondents thought that \u201calmost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change.\u201d Only 27% of Americans were aware of this fact, including just 55% of liberal democrats, 29% of moderate Democrats, and 15% of Republicans. <br></p> <p>When asked if climate scientists can be trusted to give full and accurate information on the causes of climate change, only 39% of Americans answered yes, including 70% of liberal Democrats and 15% of conservative Republicans. More than half of conservative Republicans also said that climate scientists\u2019 research findings are influenced by the desire to advance their careers and their political leanings.</p> <p>In short, when experts tell you something you don\u2019t want to believe, reject their conclusions by accusing them of bias, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/qa-brian-cox-brings-graphs-malcolm-roberts\">as we saw conservative Australian senator Malcolm Roberts do recently on Q &amp; A</a>:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVB-rpC2x3w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qVB-rpC2x3w?start=423&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=423\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Prof Brian Cox and Australian Senator Malcolm Roberts talk climate on Q &amp; A.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Conservative media and politicians created an echo chamber of denial</strong></h2> <p>Research has shown that American conservative media outlets like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/06/conservative-media-bias-is-inflating-american-climate-denial-and-polarization\">the Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/08/global-warming-denial-fox-news\">Fox News</a> are terribly inaccurate and biased in their climate change reporting. In fact, a study in 2013 found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/08/global-warming-denial-fox-news\">conservative media consumption decreases viewer trust in</a> scientists and belief that global warming is happening. The Pew survey results further reinforce that finding.</p> <p>Moreover, a study published last year found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that rejects the need to tackle climate change</a>. This is likely due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/14/trump-and-the-republican-party-are-doing-big-oils-bidding\">the party\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel industry campaign donations</a>.</p> <p>Humans are causing global warming. Scientific experts agree about this. Smoking causes lung cancer. Gravity is real. Humans landed on the moon. These are all statements that reflect the reality we all live in whether we\u2019re politically liberal or conservative. Political ideology should not determine whether we accept these realities.</p> <p>And yet in America, on climate change, it does. The Republican Party has created an echo chamber in which their media and political leaders live by the phrase jokingly uttered by Mythbuster Adam Savage:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8qcccZy03s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W8qcccZy03s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Republican voters take their cues from party leaders and often get their information from conservative media outlets. On climate change, those leaders and media sources reject reality and substitute their own denial and misinformation, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jul/12/us-senators-detail-a-climate-science-web-of-denial-but-the-impacts-go-well-beyond-their-borders\">it benefits them</a>. Their voters become misinformed as a result, and thus don\u2019t demand change from party leaders. Everybody outside the denial echo chamber is puzzled by it, and since it\u2019s impervious to external facts, few know how to break through.</p> <h2><strong>Piercing the echo chamber</strong></h2> <p>Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe has been trying to make a difference by identifying commonalities with many conservatives, like her evangelical faith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/climatetruth/status/783098690353369088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Loved Dr. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KHayhoe\">@KHayhoe</a>&#39;s message that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatechange?src=hash\">#climatechange</a> doesn&#39;t have to divide us \u2013 we can unite around shared values to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ActOnClimate?src=hash\">#ActOnClimate</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SXSL?src=hash\">#SXSL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/K2crDte8Si\">pic.twitter.com/K2crDte8Si</a></p>&mdash; ClimateTruth (@climatetruth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/climatetruth/status/783098690353369088\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There are glimmers of hope in the Pew survey. For example, there\u2019s bipartisan support for wind and solar energy, with 83% and 89% of Americans in favor, respectively. As Hayhoe noted in <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/obama-hayhoe-dicaprio.html\">her climate event with President Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio this week</a>, Texas produces the most wind power of any state, generating 10% of its electricity from wind. Because they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/03/doe-charts-show-why-climate-doom-and-gloom-isnt-needed\">becoming increasingly cheap and popular</a>, clean technologies are giving us a shot at preventing the worst consequences of climate change. </p> <p>Much like climate change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/28/can-the-republican-party-solve-its-science-denial-problem\">science denial poses a long-term threat to the Republican Party</a>. And similar to alcoholism, denying the problem doesn\u2019t make it go away; if you don\u2019t accept the problem and take steps to deal with it, reality will eventually come crashing in with disastrous consequences. <a href=\"http://www.carbontax.org/conservatives/\"><br></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.carbontax.org/conservatives/\">There are conservative thought leaders who realize this</a> and are in a battle with the science-denying wing over the future of the Republican Party.

No chance | Keith Kahn-Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among other findings, Chakrabarti correctly identified \u201cZio\u201d as a term of racist antisemitic abuse. Yet the word that the insult is derived from \u2013 Zionism, a belief in the right of the Jewish people to self-determination \u2013 is an ideology that has enjoyed a long and proud history of support from the British labour movement.</p> <p>The year before the battle of Cable Street, the future Labour prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/04/citizen-clem-biography-of-attlee-john-bew-exemplary\" title=\"\">Clement Attlee</a> noted that Labour party conferences would \u201cnever falter\u201d in their \u201cactive and sympathetic co-operation\u201d with the Zionists. According to Attlee, Nazism and fascism demanded that this support was \u201call the more necessary\u201d.</p> <p>In the same year, the future president of the World Trade Union Conference, George Isaacs, called upon the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc\" title=\"\">Trades Union Congress</a> to extend its blessing and help to the Jewish people in building, \u201ca new Jerusalem in Palestine\u201d.</p> <p>The labour movement saw in Zionism the manifestation of its own ideals, as persecuted and downtrodden Jews fought for their equality among the nations. In so doing, they were struggling against history and prejudice, and liberating themselves while building a progressive and egalitarian society. Yet despite this support for Zionism and staunch opposition to anti-Jewish racism, parts of the left have never been wholly immune to the disease of antisemitism.</p> <p>The 19th-century utopian socialist Charles Fourier regarded Jews as \u201cparasites, merchants, usurers\u201d. His fellow French socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon wrote: \u201cThe Jew is the enemy of humankind. They must be sent back to Asia or be exterminated.\u201d Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin described the Jews as \u201ccomprising a single exploiting sect, a kind of blood-sucking people.\u201d Even Karl Marx \u2013 his parents being baptised Jews \u2013 equated the Jewish spirit with \u201chuckstering\u201d. For many, it is very comfortable to view antisemitism as belonging solely the domain of the far right, yet reality shows otherwise.</p> <p>Today, leftwing antisemitism often conceals itself behind the mask of anti-Zionism, whereby the existence of the Jewish state is rejected, regardless of its borders. Within such a paradigm, Israel is the Jew among the nations, the epicentre of evil, and the ultimate global pariah. In this perverse view, it is the Jewish state \u2013 rather than the Jewish people \u2013 poisoning wells, spreading disease and craving the blood of gentile children.</p> <p>Even some on the left who would not use such language themselves, still march in solidarity with those who do. Hamas in its charter shamelessly blames Zionists for \u201cthe French Revolution, the Communist revolution [and both] world wars\u201d, and calls for the murder of Jews everywhere, fuelling an indiscriminate campaign of violence against innocent Israeli civilians. Meanwhile, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, claims that it is better for all the Jews to \u201cgather [in Israel ] from all parts of the world\u201d so that they do not have to be chased down, for \u201cthe final and decisive battle\u201d.</p> <p>Disappointingly, the response in some parts of the labour movement is not to say, \u201cThese are the antisemites we oppose\u201d, as their heroes did in 1936, but rather \u201cThese are our comrades, with whom we stand in solidarity!\u201d And so the bellowing cries, \u201cWe are all Hezbollah now,\u201d or \u201cFrom the river to the sea Palestine will be free\u201d \u2013 a barely concealed call for genocide \u2013 echo menacingly through London.</p> <p>Cable Street teaches us that the labour movement must completely unshackle itself from the prejudices expressed by Proudhon and Bakunin. It is one thing to savour the memory of marching down Cable Street against the British Union of Fascists 80 years ago.

Years working a day job at an ad agency have also helped turn him into music\u2019s most entertaining self-promoter. Consider this arsenal of attention-grabbing pranks. After his gurning University Challenge contestant namesake Oscar Powell went viral, he cut up clips into a music video; on Valentine\u2019s Day he <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/feed-item.aspx?id=91955\">created a website</a> where you could email the message \u201cYou said it would be alright, but it\u2019s not\u201d to a former lover. </p> <p>For one track, Insomniac, he sampled the Nirvana producer Steve Albini but when Albini approved the sample and complained \u201cI detest club culture as deeply as I detest anything on earth\u201d, <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/18882-powell-vs-steve-albini\">Powell printed their email correspondence on a giant billboard</a>. Another billboard featured his own email address, to which hundreds of people sent messages. Journalists are handed a sheet of faux-diva guidance notes on how to interview him, like: \u201cPretend, for everyone\u2019s sake, that you\u2019re into sharks.\u201d Taken from his debut album Sport, his new video Jonny features fans filming themselves smashing watermelons.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bYsnJfRcdA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8bYsnJfRcdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In person, Powell could easily be a bad boy in a teen TV serial: tall, athletic and handsome, with a slightly lazy eye that makes him appear punchdrunk. For him, these japes aren\u2019t just knowing marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m Johnny Knoxville,\u201d he says, arranged at 45 degrees on a sofa in XL\u2019s offices. \u201cI do these things because I think they\u2019re interesting. I don\u2019t like Facebook, I don\u2019t like Twitter. I stuck my email address on a billboard instead, and I had a thousand real conversations. One girl even told me she had cancer. This is actual social contact. It became an interesting study: what if I actually invite people to troll? And there were none.\u201d</p> <p>During his former boardroom years, Powell found \u201cthe frustrating thing about working in advertising is that ultimately you don\u2019t give a fuck, you just want to get paid\u201d. Music, by contrast, is an almost dangerously all-consuming passion. \u201cYou want to say so much but the process of getting it out is so hard and painstaking,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople ask me: \u2018Why are you always beating yourself up, why do you make yourself so angry, why are you always worried?\u2019 I put so much pressure on myself. I hate the process of making music, it terrifies me. It\u2019s like taking a really difficult shit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a719d653a53285c2c2f019137f2e533bfcd59f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a719d653a53285c2c2f019137f2e533bfcd59f9/572_174_4968_2981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Even so, Powell describes his debut album as being defined by its \u201cenergy and playfulness\u201d, all desiccated post-punk drums, fizzy synths and blurts of people shouting. His music has a groove, but never lets you settle into it. This jarring quality comes, he says, partly from growing up going to drum\u2019n\u2019bass raves in London in the late 90s. \u201cFriends were leaning in from the side with a bottle of champagne, smoking spliffs, rewinding records... you\u2019d clang mixes and no-one gave a shit. I loved that rough and ready spirit.\u201d Deadpan vocals prang into motorik rhythms, cheap electronic squelches and looped guitar solos, all in the space of a single track. \u201cThere are still some moments of tension and release, though, where you\u2019re like: \u2018Finally Powell, stop trying to bite my brain,\u2019\u201d he says of his restless music. \u201cI like going from groove to chaos and back, that conflict.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/26/djs-touring-mental-health-drugs-sleeplessness-isolation\">Drugs, sleeplessness, isolation: the downside of being a dance musician</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s a DJ too, piling up Belgian new beat and bits of Skype conversations into headspinning sets.

To him, this lack of boundaries is a positive. \u201cHouse in Chicago, jungle in London, things that exist around geographies \u2013 it\u2019s harder for them to occur now because of the fragmented way people consume stuff,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut as an artist that\u2019s more exciting; you\u2019re not relying on other people to create something that has an identity.\u201d</p> <p>Powell may be a salesman at heart \u2013 at one point he uses the phrase \u201cmultifaceted media landscape\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s come up with a one-of-a-kind product.

  "<p>News that Facebook had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/23/facebook-video-viewing-times-ad-agencies-metric\">erroneously reporting one of its measures of video watch-time</a> has sparked a series of ad industry debates around trust, accountability and ultimately \u2018viewability\u2019. While these are important discussions to be having as digital marketing matures, now is also a key time to more widely consider what we mean by a video view and how that needs to increasingly influence our creative direction.</p> <p>Over the last couple of years Facebook\u2019s newsfeed has grown from hosting almost no native video to being increasingly dominated by the format, attracting billions of ad dollars in the process. Whilst the revealed measurement error didn\u2019t affect any of the metrics by which Facebook video advertising was bought or sold, the over estimation of watch times may have accidentally helped cover up their platform\u2019s potential Achilles heel.</p> <p>They\u2019ve won great plaudits for their ability to get video content in front of phenomenally large audiences but it\u2019s never really been a secret that many of those people are watching just a few seconds of what\u2019s shown to them, and often don\u2019t have the sound on as they do so. Facebook themselves provide support and advice on how to best adapt creative for this environment but it is striking that much of the video going out on the platform isn\u2019t optimised - making sure your key takeaway comes before the \u2018skip\u2019 button appears is a key starting point - and as such is in itself arguably a waste of media budgets.</p> <p>Many marketers have been having great success with simple animations or \u2018cinemagraphs\u2019 on Facebook which only need to grab your attention for a few short seconds, and similarly others have found out that traditional TV adverts can be hugely ineffective if promoted there without suitable adaptions. If people only watch the first two seconds of your ad with no sound is there anything there they can take away? If your product reveal is tucked away at the very end, are 99% of your audience missing out on the punchline?</p> <p>YouTube in contrast offers a <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/products/youtube-trueview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">TrueView</a> advertising format whereby consumers have to watch at least five seconds of an ad and advertisers don\u2019t pay a penny until they\u2019ve watched at least 30 seconds. Clearly the latter approach forces longer watch times, which are in principle a useful metric to understand how much attention you\u2019re really getting. If you\u2019re left wondering why anyone would choose Facebook\u2019s product at all, the answer is of course that it\u2019s a lot cheaper to drive one of their shorter \u2018views\u2019 and that when you show impressions to enough people a few of them do end up watching the whole thing along the way. Research finds that partial or skipped views have a surprisingly large impact on consumers (see the image below) and thus certainly shouldn\u2019t be completely discounted either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"872051382ee96bc7f00549851015f24d56dad167\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872051382ee96bc7f00549851015f24d56dad167/0_0_750_300/500.jpg\" alt=\"From Facebook research - Making an Impact: Measuring the Value of Facebook Video\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2015/04/02/measuring-facebook-video/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research </a>\u2018Making an Impact: Measuring the Value of Facebook Video\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The right approach to video measurement will always depend on specific business objectives \u2013 for instance do you need lots of people to hear a little from your brand, or would you rather fewer people really engage and understand a message? Whilst a shift to video may make digital advertising seem simpler, there remain many nuances in definition. </p> <p>Any attempt at reporting video \u2018views\u2019 which casually throws together Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as if their metrics are comparable is a flawed approach, and some level of calibration is essential. And this is before you even begin to have a measure which brings parity with TV advertising, or countless other platforms. This is why forward-thinking media agencies are focusing such resources on tools which can help them truly unpack impact across different platforms.</p> <p>There is also a need for all involved to draw a creative line in the sand, and to simply refuse running video assets which have not had the (often simple) tweaks made to suit these environments. Just as the early TV ads were radio ads with an image, the early online video ads have been repurposed TV ads, but as such they are missing much of the effectiveness opportunity. </p> <p>Surprisingly there may be easier wins in adapting and animating print or outdoor advertising, itself inherently designed for quick and instant communication, than trying to squeeze 30 or 60 second videos down into a newsfeed friendly format. There are even services now which can let marketers make these adaptations, and rapidly test out different iterations, for fairly nominal costs.</p> <p>It must have seemed an obvious decision in Facebook HQ to follow the advertising dollars and go all in on online video, but it may yet be a strategy that comes back to haunt them. As a platform capable of getting a message in front of billions of real people, wherever they are, in a visually engaging way and with efficient and controlled media options they are hard to beat. When you enter into the world of video, it\u2019s a more complicated fight and it really does come down to what you\u2019re willing to count as a view. This measurement discrepancy has certainly put their particular definition in the spotlight.</p> <p>Marketers shouldn\u2019t forget the static (or near static) brand building opportunities which first made Facebook a great platform- even as they struggle to get their heads around its role in their video mix. And while there\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s more video than ever before playing in your various newsfeeds, the right creative approach to such a fast moving environment has to be different to what you\u2019d show an audience sat back and waiting in a cinema.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cBrought to you by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>In 1747 the French doctor and philosopher Julien Offray de La Mettrie suggested we might, using sign language, teach great apes to speak. He justified this proposal by stating that from \u201canimals to man there is no abrupt transition \u2026 What was man before he invented words and learnt languages? An animal of a particular species.\u201d In his fine book, the Dutch-American primatologist Frans de Waal pursues this line of thinking, not so much to see if apes can use language (they can, although only at a very low level), but to show that there is no clear behavioural division between ourselves and other animals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/do-you-care-about-animals-then-you-really-shouldnt-eat-octopus\">Do you care about animals? Then you really shouldn't eat octopus | Elle Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virtually every characteristic that has been claimed to be uniquely human has eventually turned out to have some kind of a precursor in a close relative. As De Waal explains in a series of engaging accounts, language, self-recognition, tool making, empathy, co-operative behaviour, mental time-travel, culture and many other traits and abilities have turned out not to be exclusively human. This is hardly surprising, given that we evolved from an ape ancestor not so long ago: we share behaviour with our relatives, just as we share anatomy.</p> <p>De Waal is not interested in showing what animals cannot do, but rather what they can do, and clarifying why. He has made a video, as part of <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_do_animals_have_morals?language=en\">a TED talk</a>, in which a pair of capuchin monkeys in adjoining cages each offer a human a token in return for a piece of fruit. One monkey gets a much-desired grape in return for their \u201cwork\u201d; the other gets a piece of cucumber, which capuchins are not so impressed by. The monkey that gets the cucumber looks across at the other monkey and its grape, apparently becomes outraged, throws the cucumber at the experimenter and shakes the bars of its cage with frustration.</p> <p>The TED audience laughs at this, but what it confirms is that capuchins show inequality aversion. If they are not treated fairly \u2013 equal pay for equal work, in this case \u2013 then they protest. All human societies, no matter how unequal in reality, have the same moral basis. People all over the world tell their children \u201cbe nice to each other\u201d, \u201cshare\u201d, \u201cdo as you would be done by\u201d, and so on. And as any parent knows, children are acutely averse to inequality \u2013 not just when it affects them negatively, but also displaying generosity toward the have-nots. De Waal\u2019s experiment revealed that something like this key feature of human psychology and morality also exists in the furry heads of members of a primate lineage that separated from our own more than 40m years ago.</p> <p>To understand why animals \u2013 and humans \u2013 behave the way they do, we need to look at their natural history. In his opening section, De Waal highlights the work of the early 20th-century German biologist Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, who argued that, before we can correctly interpret the behaviour of an animal, we need to understand the animal\u2019s <em>Umwelt</em>, or \u201csurrounding world\u201d. For Uexk\u00fcll, and for De Waal, ecology explains everything \u2013 it includes not only the physical environment, but also the animal\u2019s sensory and social worlds. Humans, capuchins and many other primates are inequality averse because their social systems are built on reciprocity. This in turn can be explained by the particular ecology the species evolved in, and the existence of genes that, in unknown and complex ways, produce the structures and chemicals that enable these social behaviours to occur.</p> <p>De Waal does not explore the underlying processes producing the complex and intriguing behaviours described here: we know very little about them. Instead, he focuses on observations and behavioural experiments from the growing field of evolutionary cognition. These allow us to peer into the minds of non-human animals \u2013 mainly social animals such as primates and corvids (crows and their relatives), but also dolphins, elephants and one invertebrate, which differs from the others not only in its anatomy but also in its solitary behaviour: the octopus.</p> <p>De Waal\u2019s holistic and empathetic approach to animals contrasts starkly with the arid dead end of BF Skinner\u2019s behaviourism, which dominated studies of animal behaviour in the second half of the 20th century and banished all talk of feelings or mind, looking instead at learned behavioural responses.</p> <p>Despite his hostility to Skinner, De Waal slices through overcomplex explanations of animal behaviour \u2013 he describes how various animals respond appropriately to quite detailed sentences spoken by keepers or experimenters, but argues that they probably did not understand the exact words, but instead interpreted vocal tone, body language and gestures. Being confident as to when to embrace a more complex description of animal behaviour is clearly something of an art.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The lesson of De Waal\u2019s book is that something like teaching will eventually be seen in our ape cousins</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One aspect of behaviour not dealt with in the book, and which for the moment does remain uniquely human, is teaching. To impart knowledge involves realising what someone else does not know and working out how to get them to understand it. All tool making and culture in animals seems so far to involve observational learning, not active teaching. The lesson of De Waal\u2019s book, however, is that something like teaching will eventually be seen in our ape cousins.</p> <p>He skirts around the central question that many readers will be most intrigued by \u2013 the nature of consciousness, and its potential existence in non-human animals. His explanation for this approach is simple: he is not sure what consciousness is (no one is), and so it is hard to see how to study it or to devise an experiment that could test for its presence.</p> <p>The best proxy we have for consciousness is the mirror self-recognition test: this involves getting an animal used to a mirror and then putting a mark somewhere on its body where it cannot be seen directly. If the animal shows behaviour directed towards the hidden mark when it is looking in the mirror, then it has passed the test. But what that implies is unclear.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaMylwohL14\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GaMylwohL14?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch how animals respond to their reflections </figcaption> </figure>   <p>The list of animals that can pass this test is very short: humans, chimps, bonobos, gorillas (though they really do not like the eye contact the mirror involves), orangutans, dolphins, an Indian elephant called Happy (African elephants are hard to study as they tend to smash up the mirror), and a particularly smart magpie called Gertie. As well as touching artificial marks, these animals will also use the mirror outside of the experiment, to inspect body parts they cannot normally see \u2013 the inside of their mouths, or their backsides.

It has become extremely popular, and lucrative, to rent out a flat or room here on one of the short-stay rental platforms, of which Airbnb is by far the biggest. An estimated 22,000 rooms and flats in the Dutch capital are now <a href=\"https://www.amsterdam.nl/wonen-leefomgeving/wonen/nieuws-wonen/amsterdam-versterkt/#h80fede74-010e-487d-846c-949eb3dcc794\">offered for rent this way</a> at least once a year. In the most popular neighbourhoods, as many as one in six homeowners rent out a room or flat on Airbnb.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Dutch bank ING <a href=\"https://www.ing.nl/nieuws/nieuws_en_persberichten/2016/04/airbnb_heeft_flink_opwaarts_effect_op_amsterdamse_huizenprijzen.html\">stated in a report</a> that Airbnb drives up real estate prices, because people are prepared to pay more for a flat when they can make extra money by renting it out. The bank found the effect to be \u201cconsiderable\u201d, although not everybody agrees on this conclusion. \u201cThe studies that have been done are not very well founded,\u201d says Janine Harbers, a spokeswoman for Amsterdam\u2019s city council. \u201cBut some effect seems likely.\u201d</p> <p>According to Peter Boelhouwer, professor of housing systems at the University of Technology in Delft: \u201cWhen so many flats are rented out to visitors, it has an effect on the availability of real estate. There is a great shortage in the housing market in Amsterdam and this doesn\u2019t do it any good \u2013 but one shouldn\u2019t exaggerate it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"482aa0bd7765f422596123edfe2b85ac33e34ba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/482aa0bd7765f422596123edfe2b85ac33e34ba9/0_0_4724_3454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists sail in downtown Amsterdam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amsterdam hosts millions of tourists each year, with many of them choosing to stay in Airbnb rentals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boelhouwer says the \u201cAirbnb effect\u201d is by no means a primary factor in the city\u2019s gentrification, which \u201chas been going on for a long time in the central areas of Amsterdam\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe council welcomed it at first because it meant an upgrading of the city,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut now that it continues, you see the rise of very unilateral neighbourhoods. Families with children are leaving this city because they can\u2019t afford to live in the good areas.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Amsterdam has taken some steps to address the impact of Airbnb on its housing markets. Back in 2014, it was the first city to <a href=\"http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/media-centre/city-hall/press-releases/2014-press-room/amsterdam-airbnb-agreement\">sign an agreement with the multinational</a>, which saw Airbnb agree to levy and hand over tourist taxes to the city, remove addresses where the council has intervened because of complaints, and inform users of its rules (typically, that apartments should be rented out for no longer than 60 days per year, to not more than four guests at a time).</p> <p>What the city has been unable to do, however, is make Airbnb disclose the identity of those hosts who do not stick to its rules. The company still refuses to do so on privacy grounds. </p> <p>This means that enforcement of these rules is difficult. According to the independent website <a href=\"http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/\">Inside Airbnb</a>, around half of the Amsterdam flats on Airbnb are rented out more than 60 days a year. A quarter of the hosts were found to have multiple listings \u2013 with some identified as \u201cmore likely to be running a commercial business and to violate the rules\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/30/vancouver-canada-house-prices-solution-super-heated-housing-market\">Has Vancouver found the solution to a super-heated housing market?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harbers from the city council, however, says the problem is less serious than Inside Airbnb suggests. \u201cAccording to our statistics, a majority 81% of the hosts respect the rules \u2013 and we are working on [those who do not].

CBA and ANZ counterparts on Tuesday and Wednesday but has faced a slightly tougher grilling.</p> <p>What we\u2019ve learned this morning:</p> <ul> <li>Thorburn said that the sacking of 43 financial planners at the bank over five years \u201cwas not a systemic issue\u201d and he didn\u2019t believe any senior executives\u2019 employment had been terminated owing to the problems in that division</li> <li>He said NAB decided to stop political donations \u201cto be clean, direct and decisive\u201d and stop the perception that banks were conflicted or seeking favours from politicians</li> <li>NAB wrote to some but not all the customers of financial advisers who were deregistered by Asic</li> <li>Thorburn said that tellers were \u201chungry\u201d to refer customers to other products when it was in their interest but claimed they would stop up-selling products using customer data purchased from third parties if they objected</li> <li>The NAB executives joined CBA and ANZ in expressing openness to a bank tribunal</li> <li>NAB rejected that its employees engaged in rate-rigging but won\u2019t comment further as Asic has started a law suit over the allegation</li> <li>Unlike ANZ, the NAB executives did not suggest they would restructure credit card interest rates</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

  "<p>The headline on the front page of the Daily Mail definitely made me sit up and take notice. \u201cCycle lane lunacy!\u201d it boomed, next to a photo of a cyclist on a bike lane, kept safe from a line of cars by a kerb.</p> <p>My first thought was: ah, good, the Mail finally agrees it\u2019s lunacy we have so few decent bike lanes. It seemed gratifying, if unlikely. But then I saw the smaller headline below, and my heart sank: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3822518/Cycle-lanes-lunacy-built-Britain-causing-gridlock-pollution-maddest-thing-empty.html\">The new blight paralysing Britain</a>.\u201d</p> <p>It sank not so much because of an ill-informed article about cycling in the national press \u2013 that\u2019s almost to be expected \u2013 but for another reason. This was another example of what you might call post-truth journalism, which has leaped the fence from the internet to the mass media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/783417835494240256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wednesday&#39;s Daily Mail:<br>May savages liberal elite<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XM3UIWDcG6\">pic.twitter.com/XM3UIWDcG6</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/783417835494240256\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This phenomenon isn\u2019t new and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth\">well documented</a>. But it\u2019s still depressing. This particular example of it, expounded in the Mail, argues that bike lanes are disproportionately to blame for vehicle congestion and associated pollution in British towns. As with many similar ideas, it began as the most fringe of activist memes, mainly expounded through social media.</p> <p>In London, I first saw it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/automagicdog/status/781593412227268608\">put forward by taxi driver groups</a>, enraged by the construction of the capital\u2019s first comprehensive pair of properly designed and separated lanes, and then by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stopcs11\">tiny collections of campaigners</a> opposing plans for a northward expansion of these routes.</p> <p>The bike lanes, they laughably claimed, had brought London to a standstill, and thus choked it in the smog of thousands of stationary cars. They were a menace and must be dug up. This was fairly marginal stuff, reserved in the main for slightly grumpy vested interest groups or a handful of people with Twitter accounts and too much time on their hands.</p> <p>But now the Mail has taken the idea mainstream. The paper\u2019s almost entirely evidence-free, anecdote-based article takes London as a starting point, but goes on to claim that new bike lanes are also causing \u201ctraffic chaos\u201d and \u201cgridlock\u201d in places as far afield as Manchester, Cornwall, Gloucester and Cambridge.</p> <p>It\u2019s so silly that my first temptation was to ignore it completely. But there\u2019s an argument for saying such myths and inventions should be challenged before they take hold. So here goes.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to focus in London, in part as it\u2019s the argument I know best, but also as the various factors behind its traffic congestion are, as ever, most densely focused.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s begin with the idea that London\u2019s bike lanes are useless as they are only used at rush hours.</p> <p>They are certainly popular. Both the new so-called cycle superhighway routes have seen cyclist numbers shoot up by 60% since they were built, <a href=\"http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/cycling-surge-in-london-due-to-protected-cycle-superhighways-says-tfl/019677\">according to Transport for London figures</a>. On one section, by Blackfriars Bridge, bikes make up 70% of peak-time traffic.</p> <p>This is usually the point at which a bike lane naysayer points to a tweeted photo of an empty bike lane, often in the middle of the night. This is, if anything, more fatuous still. </p> <p>These are primarily commuter routes, and as with many roads, more used at peak hours. And they are massively used \u2013 a small part of my commute takes in the east-west cycle route, and at times the queues of bikes at red lights can be dozens deep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/757627010860679168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This queue of cyclists seems to get bigger every day. <a href=\"https://t.co/mZIQB24QUU\">pic.twitter.com/mZIQB24QUU</a></p>&mdash; Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/757627010860679168\">July 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Yes, at other times the traffic is thinner, though I can\u2019t remember ever being alone on the lanes at any hour. But then, many residential pavements near me are barely used outside certain times. Perhaps the Mail thinks they could be turned over to cars, too.</p> <p>Paul Tuohy, the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK</a> campaign group, makes the additional point that without a proper network of safe bike lanes, people will generally use what routes that exist only for direct commutes, not everyday riding:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the the writer would like to see cycle tracks in use at different hours of the day, perhaps he should take a visit to Cambridge or the Netherlands, where good-quality provision exists in residential areas.</p> </blockquote> <p>What of the traffic \u201cstandstill\u201d? Road traffic in London does appear to be worsening, with a knock-on effect not just on those who use cars or trucks, but <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/london-busses-are-getting-slower-and-less-reliable-each-year-costing-tfl-millions-in-fares-a3313706.html\">also bus passengers</a>. And yes, slower traffic can bring more pollution.</p> <p>But do bike lanes really play such a key role in this? Protected cycleways \u2013 the sort with kerbs, which vehicles can\u2019t stray into \u2013 take up a small proportion of the lane space of about 3% of all roads in the centre of the capital. In virtually all other towns and cities in Britain the proportion is even less, and is often zero.</p> <p>For such a tiny reallocation of space to bring traffic to a halt, there would have to be something very odd going on. As Tuohy adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To blame congestion problems on cycling is clearly a nonsense. Just do the maths: one lane of a typical road can carry 2,000 cars per hour, or 14,000 cycles. By enabling more people to cycle safely, cycle tracks make highly efficient use of scarce road space.</p> </blockquote> <p>The more likely explanation? A freelance feature writer spinning an extremely tenuous story, which began as a conclusion borrowed from the fringes of the internet, with the evidence then sought out, not very successfully.</p> <p>Reducing vehicle congestion in somewhere like London has one main solution, which has a simple premise but a fiendishly complicated set of associated practicalities: reduce the amount of motor traffic.<br></p> <p>The number of motor vehicles on London\u2019s roads has increased in recent years, a product of factors including a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/09/london-booming-population-growth-success-challenges\">bigger population</a>, the Uber-fuelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/aug/25/private-hire-vehicles-licensed-uber-london\">explosion in private cab numbers</a>, more construction traffic and the fleets of vans delivering internet purchases.</p> <p>A congestion charge has been shown to reduce vehicle numbers. London still has one, though its efficacy has reduced in recent years, especially after Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/24/boris-johnson-london-congestion-charge\">axed a westward expansion</a> of the zone following his election as mayor.</p> <p>This was a publicly popular move at the time, which is not uncommon. The same people who bemoan traffic often enjoy driving cars or taking cheap cabs, or having their Amazon purchase delivered the next day.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the paradox at the heart of all this \u2013 cycling is one of the few easy wins for policymakers. Give over a small amount of road space for proper bike lanes and, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/11/cycling-fights-new-york-mean-streets-janette-sadik-khan\">city</a> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/28/seville-cycling-capital-southern-europe-bike-lanes\">city</a> has shown, more people cycle, thus freeing up space for cars and trucks. The bikes are the solution, not the problem. </p> <p>If you\u2019re being really ambitious, you could even offer incentives to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/02/cargo-bike-city-courier-truck\">electrically assisted cargo bikes</a> to deliver many of the relatively small packages currently tossed into the vast cargo bays of vans which then get stuck in traffic.</p> <p>But rather than show vision, for some people it\u2019s easier to wrongly apportion blame on to a niche group. </p> <p>The Daily Mail is on the wrong side of history. Its former sister paper, London\u2019s Evening Standard, used to be similarly sceptical but is now far more balanced. </p> <p>Such is often the way with ideas which originate on the internet. A cheap myth can be much more convenient for people to absorb than a more difficult argument, one backed up by actual facts.</p>",

As well as the usual selection of kale crackers and paleo egg protein boosters, there were promises of wizardry, such as a packet of Alchemy Organic Super Blend Energy Elixir (\u00a340 for 300g of powder). But never mind the food. Life, in 2016, is liquid. Opposite a display of untouched pastries and assorted bread products (who, in Planet Organic in Notting Hill, still eats bread?), were the waters.</p> <p>There was Life, Volvic, Ugly, Sibberi (birch or maple), Plenish, What A Melon watermelon water, Vita Coco, Coco Pro, Coco Zumi, Chi 100% Pure Coconut Water, Rebel Kitchen Coconut Water and coconut water straight from the nut (\u201cyou have to make the hole yourself\u201d, explained a shop assistant). Also: an electrolyte-enhanced water pledging to hydrate you with 40% less fluid than ordinary water (Overly Fitness), a birch water offering \u201ca natural source of anti-oxidising manganese\u201d (Tapped) and an alternative birch water promising to \u201celiminate cellulite\u201d (Buddha). There was also a \u201cwater bar\u201d \u2013 a tap in the corner of the shop \u2013 that, according to the large sign hanging from the ceiling, offered, for free, the \u201ccleanest drinking water on the planet\u201d, thanks to a four-stage process conducted by a \u201creverse osmosis deionising water filter\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/24/liquid-assets-how-the-business-of-bottled-water-went-mad-podcast\">Liquid assets: how the business of bottled water went mad \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Planet Organic\u2019s display was impressive, but only hinted at the full range of waters available to the hydration-conscious consumer. Right now, the global bottled water industry is in one of those strange and energetic boom phases where every week, it seems, a new product finds its way on to the shelves. Not just another bland still or sparkling, but some entirely new definition of the element. It is a case of capitalism at its most hyperactive and brazenly inventive: take a freely available substance, dress it up in countless different costumes and then sell it as something new and capable of transforming body, mind, soul. Water is no longer simply water \u2013 it has become a commercial blank slate, a word on to which any possible ingredient or fantastical, life-enhancing promise can be attached.</p> <p>And it\u2019s working. Over the past two decades, bottled water has become the fastest-growing drinks market in the world. The global market was valued at $157bn in 2013, and is expected to reach $280bn by 2020. Last year, in the UK alone, consumption of water drinks grew by 8.2%, equating to a retail value of more than \u00a32.5bn. Sales of water are 100 times higher than in 1980. Of <em>water</em>: a substance that, in developed countries, can be drunk for free from a tap without fear of contracting cholera.

According to James Salzman, the author of Drinking Water: A History, monks at holy wells produced special water flasks for pilgrims to take away as proof of their visit \u2013 a medieval example of the power of branding. For centuries, wealthy Europeans travelled to spa towns to sample the water in a bid to cure specific ailments. The spa visit was a signal of health, but also of status: somewhere to be seen, an association of liquid and individual that broadcasted social elevation \u2013 a distant precursor to Kim Kardashian clutching a bottle of Fiji, if you like. In 1740, the first commercial British bottled water was launched in Harrogate. By 1914 Harrogate Spring was, according to its website, the largest exporter of bottled water in the country, \u201cproudly keeping the troops hydrated from England to Bombay\u201d.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, however, a water revolution nearly killed the nascent business. After early attempts in Germany and Belgium to chlorinate municipal drinking water, a typhoid epidemic in Lincoln in 1905 prompted the public health crusader Alexander Cruickshank Houston to try out the first extended chlorination of a public water supply. His experiment worked, and soon, chlorination of municipal water had spread around the world. In 1908, Jersey City became the first US city to use full-scale water chlorination, and the practice quickly spread across the country.</p> <p>The bottled water industry almost collapsed as a result. In the past, buying clean water had been a necessity for the rich (the poor simply endured centuries of bad drinking water, and often died from the experience). Now it was freely available to all. Why would you continue to spend money on something that now came, miraculously, out of a tap in your kitchen?</p> <p>The answer arrived in 1977, in the form of what must be one of history\u2019s greatest pieces of television advertising narration. \u201cDeep below the plains of southern France,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qHv4yh4R9c\">rumbled Orson Welles</a> in a voice that sounded as if it were bubbling up from some unreachable subterranean cave, \u201cin a mysterious process begun millions of years ago, Nature herself adds life to the icy waters of a single spring: <em>Perrier</em>.\u201d As viewers watched the water descend into a glass, and admired the glistening green bottle, marketing history was made. The advert was part of a $5m campaign across America \u2013 the largest ever for a bottled water \u2013 and proved a major success. From 1975 to 1978, Perrier sales in the US increased from 2.5m bottles to more than 75m bottles.</p> <p>The Perrier triumph was part of \u201ca perfect confluence\u201d, Salzman told me, of a sudden craze for aerobics in the US, prompted, in part, by Jane Fonda releasing her first exercise video \u2013 Jane Fonda\u2019s Workout, the highest-selling video of all time \u2013 in 1982. There was a new drive not just to be healthy, but to be seen to be healthy. In 1985, Time magazine noted that \u201cwater snobbery has replaced wine snobbery as the latest noon-hour recreation. People order their <em>eau</em> by brand name, as they once did Scotch.\u201d</p> <p>Soon enough, rumours circulated of Madonna bathing in bottled water, and Jack Nicholson was photographed brandishing a bottle of Evian at the Oscars as if it were Cristal. There was also a key practical innovation: in 1977, plastic or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles were introduced into the soft drink market. By 1990, they were being used for bottled water, making it as convenient and portable as a fizzy drink. The big soft drink brands, spotting the obvious commercial opportunity, soon launched their own waters: PepsiCo\u2019s Aquafina in 1994, Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani in 1999, and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Pure Life in 2002. Water was back.</p> <p>Water\u2019s glorious renaissance wasn\u2019t just about fashion or convenience. Bottled water can be marked up like no other substance on earth. The \u00a31 that a bottle of water often costs could pay for around 1,000 gallons of tap water. Some waters \u2013 Evian, Perrier, Highland Spring and Harrogate Spring \u2013 come from natural sources, so at least you feel you\u2019re paying for geography, for the fantasy of a shepherd sitting on a rock catching the icy flow in a glass jar specifically for your pleasure. But plenty of bottled waters are simply refashioned tap water.</p> <p>In February 2004, Coca-Cola attempted to launch Dasani in the UK. (\u201cDasani\u201d, by the way, means nothing.) Five weeks later, the company took all 500,000 bottles off the shelves after headlines such as the Daily Star\u2019s \u201cAre They Taking Us For Plonkers!\u201d Coca-Cola had followed its successful strategy in the US and purified tap water, added some mineral salts, and was selling it for 95p a bottle. The company hadn\u2019t, however, accounted for Britain\u2019s long memory for sitcom storylines \u2013 in this case, the episode of Only Fools and Horses when Del Boy and Rodney bottle tap water in their flat and sell it as Peckham Spring. Then there was the issue of a batch of minerals contaminating Dasani with a possibly carcinogenic bromate. In a little more than a month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/apr/18/foodanddrink\">Dasani was dead</a>.</p> <p>Ten years later, Coca-Cola launched a new bottled water in the UK. In the intervening decade, the industry, after a brief dip following the 2008 financial crash, had entered its hyperactive new phase. Vita Coco \u2013 one of the first of the \u201cnew\u201d waters \u2013 came to the UK in 2009, and in its wake soon appeared a flotilla of further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/27/is-it-worth-it-coconut-water\">coconut waters</a> (the coconut water market is now worth \u00a3100m in the UK).</p> <p>The industry received a further boost this year from the former chancellor George Osborne, who announced a sugar tax on soft drinks in his final budget. As the \u201cplain\u201d bottled water market continued to expand, new inventions began to spring up. \u201cStrong established growth leads to offshoots,\u201d explained Richard Hall, chairman of Zenith International, a market research company that organises the annual and thrillingly named <a href=\"http://www.zenithinternational.com/events/205/13th%20Global%20Bottled%20Water%20Congress\">Global Bottled Water Congress</a>. Water had begun its reinvention: enter maple, birch, energy and even ocean.</p> <p>Coca-Cola\u2019s new water is called Glac\u00e9au Smartwater. The water, which comes from a spring in Morpeth, Northumberland, is \u201cvapour distilled\u201d, then injected with electrolytes. In other words, the water is evaporated and then condensed again, a process Coca-Cola describes as being \u201cinspired by the clouds\u201d.</p> <p>Ten years ago, this, surely, would have got the Peckham Spring treatment from the media. But we live in new times. Glac\u00e9au Smartwater is now worth \u00a321.9m, and, earlier this year, Coca-Cola announced an investment of \u00a315m to expand the factory where it is produced. At present, it turns out 56,000 bottles of water per hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"79f6d67abf043635d0794b0e46dd0f65e1b3b5d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f6d67abf043635d0794b0e46dd0f65e1b3b5d7/0_0_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If the last decade witnessed water\u2019s great commercial expansion, 2016 could perhaps be defined as the year the market lost its mind. There now seems to be no limit on what a water can be, or what consumers are willing to buy. It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers.</p> <p>This summer alone saw the launch of Fl\u00f5 Essence Water, Omega Enhanced Health Water, BiPro Protein Water and Svalbar\u00f0i polar iceberg water. Other recent additions include blk. water (black water), FATwater (water containing \u201cquality fat\u201d) and deep ocean water harvested from off the coast of Hawaii (which allegedly hydrates you twice as fast as \u201cnormal\u201d water). In July, the Evening Standard ran an article that only semi-ironically described water as a \u201csuperdrink\u201d.</p> <p>Powering this proliferation of new brands is a new breed of start-upper: the water entrepreneur. I met one such man \u2013 a 27-year-old named Rahi Daneshmand \u2013 in Planet Organic on that hot August day, doling out samples of his new product, Virtue Energy Water. Virtue offers, in a 250ml can (\u00a31.35), a sugar-free sparkling water that contains \u201cyerba mat\u00e9\u201d, ginseng, citric acid, guarana and natural fruit flavours<strong>, </strong>and offers a \u201cnatural\u201d caffeine hit equivalent to a cup of coffee. It comes in two flavours, berries and lemon and lime. The response from the clientele was varied: \u201cMore fun than normal water!\u201d said one woman, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s not too sweet,\u201d approved another. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid sweetness.\u201d Some were a little bemused. \u201cNatural caffeine? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked a younger customer. \u201cIs it for the 3pm slump or after clubbing? What\u2019s it <em>for</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Virtue is Daneshmand\u2019s big idea. In fact, it\u2019s his second big idea \u2013 after Virtue Iced Tea, which did quite well (it\u2019s stocked on Ocado). In his mind, iced tea has now been surpassed by the great hope of his new creation,<strong> </strong>which he claims is Britain\u2019s first ever naturally sugar-free energy water. Daneshmand is a committed, joyous entrepreneur. After a few childhood years in Iran, he moved back to England with his family, went to Newcastle University, and somewhere along the way picked up the look and accent of an indefatigably cheerful rugby player. He wears polo shirts, lives by mantras \u2013 \u201cnothing in life is worth getting stressed about\u201d \u2013 and is the kind of hyper-motivated person who reads two business books in a weekend. (In mid-August: Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organisation and Ego is the Enemy.)</p> <p>Daneshmand says he went into water because he wanted to make something pure. \u201cWater is something that everyone needs and something that everyone drinks,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe went with the term water because it has zero sugar.\u201d</p> <p>This, he pointed out, is not always the case. Many of the so-called \u201cwaters\u201d crowding the market are jammed with sugar. Coca-Cola\u2019s Glac\u00e9au Vitaminwater (\u201cvitamins. electrolytes. unstoppableness\u201d) used to contain 23g of sugar, until the public outcry forced the company to start swapping sugar for the sweetener stevia. (Then there was a subsequent outcry about the new taste, so it swapped back.)</p> <p>\u201cPeople are just trying to put water into everything,\u201d said Daneshmand, shaking his head. His water, from the mains supply, is subject to \u201cultra-filtration and reverse osmosis\u201d to remove minerals and make it \u201cclean\u201d. Its added ingredients are entirely natural. On this point, Daneshmand is evangelical: \u201cThat\u2019s what a water is and what a water should always be.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon this summer, I watched Daneshmand pitch his water to Rahil Vora, managing director of the health food chain Revital. Things seemed to be going well. It was a fiercely hot day, which made any cold liquid seem appealing, and there was the happy synchrony that both Virtue and Revital had incorporated a leaf into their logo. Moreover, Vora was buying into the concept. \u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s an energy \u2018water\u2019 rather than an energy \u2018drink\u2019,\u201d he said. He liked the can, too \u2013 more environmentally friendly than a plastic bottle \u2013 and the natural ingredients, yerba mate in particular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2015/jul/09/where-does-your-bottled-water-come-from-in-pictures\">Where your favourite bottled water comes from \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou know about it?\u201d said Daneshmand, almost disappointed. \u201cIn south America they drink it religiously \u2013 it\u2019s their equivalent of tea.\u201d</p> <p>Vora didn\u2019t need schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pick up as a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it a year and you\u2019ll see it become not quite as big as green tea but \u2026 it\u2019s one of those ingredients.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Daneshmand. \u201cWe put the accent on the mat\u00e9 as I think people were reading it as yerba mate.\u201d</p> <p>New water samples were arriving on Vora\u2019s desk every week. \u201cIt\u2019s a fashion thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWater in a can was the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Water in a can? \u201cLiterally. I got sent a box of samples. And it was just water. In a can.\u201d</p> <p>Vora shook his head in disbelief. No yerba mate, no aloe, nothing \u2013 330ml for 99p. Vora paused. \u201cFor <em>water</em>, though.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Water in a can, it turned out, was CanO water, launched by three young British entrepreneurs in January this year. I went to see them in their office in Stanmore, north London \u2013 one room, laptops, a mini basketball hoop on the wall. Ariel Booker, 24, and Perry Fielding, 29, sat opposite each other. (Their third cofounder, Josh White, was away.) Business was going well.</p> <p>Before they had formally launched, CanO had secured the right to supply London Fashion Week and a purchase order from Selfridges, which has banned all plastic bottles from its store as part of its environmental programme, Project Ocean.<strong> </strong>(CanO also managed to land a celebrity endorsement on Instagram from the model David Gandy: \u201cNo excuses not to be hydrated this summer\u201d.) By March, CanO was stocked in Whole Foods.</p> <p>I mentioned Vora\u2019s bewilderment at their product. \u201cWe have this problem on the phone,\u201d said Booker, the fast-talker, in a monochrome printed shirt and silver bracelet. \u201cWithout seeing it, it can be a bit mind-boggling! Why? What? How? When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople just think of it as a Coke can filled with water,\u201d said Fielding, the creative, a sun tattoo on his arm and silver chain around his neck. \u201cIt seems very unexciting when you think of it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Everything changes, they believe, when you see CanO. The water, which comes from the foothills of the Austrian alps, is packaged in a minimalist black (sparkling) or white (still) can. \u201cThe visual aspect dictates everything we do,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a product or a company or a drink, it\u2019s actually an aspirational brand that you\u2019d want to buy into.\u201d On the brand\u2019s Instagram feed, the cans pose sexily next to MacBook Airs, old-fashioned cameras, swimming pools and YSL handbags. Water just happens to be the thing inside.</p> <p>Fielding had the eureka moment last year while drinking a canned fizzy drink. \u201cIt just dawned on me, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to be able to drink water out of a <em>can</em>?\u2019\u201d The can, made of aluminium, is easily recyclable and has a resealable lid \u2013 a piece of German design that means you can put the can back in your bag without worrying about it leaking.</p> <p>\u201cI think some people look at this and think it\u2019s a gimmick,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve packaged it nicely doesn\u2019t actually make it a gimmick.\u201d</p> <p>The brand name, meanwhile, was their second choice. Fielding originally wanted to call the product \u201cWater\u201d, but lawyers informed him that you couldn\u2019t trademark the word that simply described the contents of the can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4515a56908457e5888661c594714a6875cc9d5c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4515a56908457e5888661c594714a6875cc9d5c2/0_0_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The arrival of plain water in a pretty German-engineered can feels like some kind of apex, where the market\u2019s relentless demand for novelty has pushed a basic substance to its limit. We are surely only a small step from the unquestioned purchasing of emotions or air. (This, inevitably, is already happening: as Andrea Leadsom excitedly pointed out in her recent Tory party conference speech, a young British entrepreneur, Leo de Watts, now sells glass jars of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Welsh or Yorkshire air for \u00a380 each, mostly to the Chinese.)</p> <p>Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing. Everyone has their pet farce. For Ariel Booker of CanO, it was black water: \u201cWhat is the need to have water that\u2019s black?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is none.\u201d For Daneshmand, it was Rockstar, an American \u201cenergy water\u201d brand that had the same sugar volume as Red Bull (9g per 100ml). \u201cAbsolutely <em>mad</em>, that was.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Riese, whose website describes him as \u201cthe world\u2019s foremost expert on water\u201d, directs his disdain at Glac\u00e9au Smartwater: \u201cSorry, Smartwater, but you are not a premium product,\u201d he told me in his thick German accent. \u201cYou are a highly processed product and your water belongs in the trash can, nowhere else!\u201d For Riese, a purist, \u201cbottled water has to come from nature\u201d. Any kind of processing is, he believes, \u201cthe biggest scam on planet Earth!\u201d</p> <p>Riese really, really loves water. \u201cIt started for me as a very small child,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was four years old, on vacation with my parents, and I was blown away by the fact that the tap water in the city tasted differently.\u201d After school, he started working in restaurants in Germany, put together what was possibly the world\u2019s first water menu in 2005 for a Berlin bistro, and wrote a book: Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Waters). \u201cIt\u2019s a German book, so you\u2019ll have to learn to read German to read it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A bottle from the Luxury Collection Diamond Edition costs $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with over 850 diamonds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, Riese has become part of water history. After receiving his certificate as a mineral water sommelier from the German Mineral Water Trade Association, he moved to America in 2010 and became that country\u2019s first water sommelier. In 2013, he launched the longest water menu in Los Angeles at Ray\u2019s and Stark Bar, and cofounded his own brand of mineral water: Beverly Hills 90H20.</p> <p>This self-proclaimed \u201cchampagne of waters\u201d quickly won FoodBev Media\u2019s Beverage Innovation award for the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Still or Sparkling Water\u201d. A case of 24 500ml bottles is $72, while a bottle from the \u201cLuxury Collection, Diamond Edition\u201d will cost you $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with more than 850 white and black diamonds and holds the profoundly questionable honour of being the world\u2019s most expensive bottle of water. If you buy it, Riese will present the bottle to you in person at a private water tasting anywhere in the world.</p> <p>At present, Riese sommeliers at Patina, a restaurant in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. There, he guides the diners through his water menu, helping them to select the ideal water to accompany their meal.</p> <p>Riese talked me through his technique.</p> <p>First: \u201cDo you prefer sparkling or flat?\u201d</p> <p>Then: \u201cDo you prefer your bubbles a little bit more progressive, like very intense, or do you like your bubbles a little bit on the smaller side, like champagne bubbles, very tiny?\u201d</p> <p>Finally: \u201cDo you prefer something on the high mineral end, on the salty and bitter side, or do you prefer something on the smoother side, with a lower mineral composition, like maybe a little bit on the fruitier side?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople will tell you right away, then, what they want,\u201d said Riese. Perhaps the clientele at the Patina restaurant are better versed in the mineral composition and fruity or salty aspects of water than the rest of us. At a basic level, the taste of water varies according to the total dissolved solids (TDS) it contains. These solids can be any substance, but the key elements are sodium, magnesium and calcium. Any filtered or chemically treated tap water will usually contain fewer solids than a bottled water that still carries the minerals from the water\u2019s source, be it glacial, maple sap or spring.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/nov/04/water.g2\">Fiji water</a>, for example, contains 210mg/L TDS, including 18mg/L sodium, 13mg/L magnesium and 18mg/L calcium. (Fiji appears to have pulled off some fairly heavy-duty trademarking, including \u201cUntouched by man\u2122\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s finest water\u2122\u201d.) Compare those numbers to San Pellegrino, which contains quadruple the TDS, at 925mg/L, including 33.6mg/L sodium, 53.8mg/L magnesium and 178mg/L calcium. Fiji, with far fewer solids, tastes smoother, while the San Pellegrino is bolder, saltier and naturally fizzy.</p> <p>Nothing, however, compares to Riese\u2019s favourite water, the Slovenian spring water Roi. \u201cI\u2019m always calling it the Big Boy,\u201d said Riese. Roi has a TDS of 7,400mg/L, including more than 1,000mg/L of magnesium. For Riese, the experience of drinking this water is extraordinary, and emotional. He sits with a glass on its own \u2013 no mixer, no food, no distraction \u2013 as if he\u2019s drinking a rare cognac. \u201cThis is something very, <em>very</em> special.\u201d</p> <p>Riese knows how his obsession with water might be perceived. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m the biggest scam artist,\u201d he told me. He believes that he is simply applying the principle of wine to water \u2013<em> </em>terroir. The taste of natural water, just like wine, is affected by geography, earth, the rock it passes through. And Roi is the ultimate example: \u201cIt has way more electrolytes than Gatorade,\u201d Riese said, his voice climbing in ecstasy. \u201cThink about it! Way more electrolytes than Gatorade! But it\u2019s from Mother Nature!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Take an investigation into the bottled water industry to its logical conclusion and you find yourself drinking melted icebergs. Last year, the Merchant hotel in Belfast launched its water menu to a global chorus of tabloid mockery. \u201cWould you pay \u00a326 for a bottle of water (even if it IS from a Canadian glacier)?\u201d ran the Daily Mail headline. Gavin Carroll, the Merchant\u2019s general manager, gave the whole episode its only possible name: Watergate. When I visited this summer to sample the menu, he still seemed a little puzzled by the reaction. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Really? It\u2019s just water.\u2019\u201d For \u00a326? \u201cWe\u2019re a five-star hotel. We have to offer our customers choice.\u201d</p> <p>The Merchant\u2019s executive chef, and the chief architect of the water menu, Patrick Leonard \u2013 a man so passionate about water that before every sip I took, I could sense him shuffling to the edge of his seat in anticipation \u2013 brought out the notorious \u00a326 bottle, called Iceberg. The water comes from the Canadian Arctic ice shelf in Newfoundland, frozen around 10,000 years ago. \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to remove parts of icebergs,\u201d said Leonard, \u201cso they have to wait until they separate. They detach naturally, and then they\u2019re netted, brought on a boat to land and allowed to melt.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a beautiful thing, this bottle \u2013 more like a premium vodka bottle, made of thick glass, decorated with white snowflakes. Leonard poured a portion of the ancient iceberg into a tumbler. The pressure mounted; I was painfully aware that the glass of water in front of me was worth a tenner, and I still had my bottle of airport-purchased Boots\u2019 own brand on the table. I sipped, swallowed, felt the passage of liquid down my oesophagus \u2013 and couldn\u2019t taste anything at all. This was not a total failure of my unsophisticated palate. Melted iceberg essentially has no taste, having the lowest TDS (9mg/L) of any water on earth. It is like the ur-water, the water that pre-dates all other waters. \u201cThis is your starting point,\u201d said Leonard, gravely. \u201cYour baseline.\u201d</p> <p>We moved on to Whitehole Springs, a Somerset-sourced, calcium-rich still water that passes through Tufa rock; Vichy Catalan, a salty Spanish sparkler; and finally De L\u2019Aubier Sap Water, from Canada, a byproduct of the maple syrup manufacturing process.<strong> </strong>Along the way, Leonard explained the origin of his water preoccupation: a radio interview he heard with \u2013 who else? \u2013 Martin Riese: \u201cIt just got me hooked; that was it.\u201d For a chef already infatuated by taste, water was the natural extension. \u201cWe pay so much attention to food and wine, but we forget about the water,\u201d he said. His favourite? Vichy Catalan. \u201cI just had friends for dinner, and instead of bringing out the wine, I brought out three bottles of that.\u201d He looked absolutely delighted. \u201cIt was so much fun!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to maintain cynicism in the face of a true enthusiast. Leonard loves water so much he has water parties. This is not to be mocked. And, I\u2019ll admit it, tasting this quartet of waters taught its own lesson. Pay attention, as with anything, and you notice more, appreciate more. These waters tasted dramatically different from each other, had their own peculiarities and characteristics. The maple sap water was sweet, earthy; Whitehole Springs thicker and chalky. And after the featureless purity of the melted iceberg, the Vichy Catalan was like snorting peppercorns.</p> <p>Of course, there is <a href=\"http://www.icebergwatereurope.com/home/#harvesting\">something deranged about the idea</a> of netting an iceberg and waiting for it to melt \u2013 apparently, applying heat would ruin the taste. There is also something disturbing about paying nearly \u00a330 for the experience of drinking the end result. But, for the connoisseur, all of this makes as much sense as buying a vintage claret instead of Jacob\u2019s Creek, a fillet steak instead of a Peperami. Passion has no limit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5334bc172f03a0a4bf9ceb8f39518ac11e011ce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5334bc172f03a0a4bf9ceb8f39518ac11e011ce4/0_0_7130_4278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is something deranged about the idea of netting an iceberg and waiting years for it to melt.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is something deranged about the idea of netting an iceberg and waiting years for it to melt.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At some point, surely, we will reach \u201cpeak\u201d water. Perhaps it will be the moment consumers lose faith in the cellulite-eradicating powers of Buddha water or wonder if it\u2019s really worth paying over the odds for birch sap<strong>.</strong> You hope for cold logic to kick in, some sort of mass awakening to this lunatic capitalist experiment. What are we even looking for, in all these waters? The same thing, perhaps, that we are hoping to find when we buy quinoa crisps, or gluten-free seed bars: perfect health, moral relief, a sense of inner purity that somehow erases all the wine we drank last night. We want to be better people.</p> <p>The peak, however, is not in sight: for now, experts can only see growth steadily increasing in the bottled water market, at 5-6% across the industry over the next five years, according to Zenith\u2019s Richard Hall. The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas. There are waters that haven\u2019t even been thought of yet, niches still to be fully explored. Minor brands \u2013 the endless coconut waters \u2013 will fall away over time, said the water historian James Salzman, and \u201cyou\u2019ll be left with those who have survived, who will be purchased by the major players\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas. There are waters that haven\u2019t even been thought of yet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the young entrepreneurs, like CanO and Virtue, the future is about staying in the game, making a product that a consumer didn\u2019t even know they needed six months ago, but that now inhabits their fridge door with the permanence of ketchup. In early autumn, things were going well \u2013 both Revital and Holland &amp; Barrett had ordered Virtue for their shops and Daneshmand had meetings set up with two of the four largest supermarket chains (he was too coy to name them). CanO, meanwhile, had shipped its first orders to China, Germany and Thailand.</p> <p>If there is a final frontier of water, then perhaps it is the waters now being invented for children. Zenith have forecasted that the kids\u2019 water category is set to grow even faster than \u201cadult\u201d water. In August, Capri-Sun (owned by Coca-Cola) launched a range of juicy waters; last November, Volvic released its Star Wars collection, including bottles decorated with Chewbacca and Darth Vader; and in May this year, the first ever sparkling water for kids was launched in the US, called Tickle Water.</p> <p>According to Heather McDowell, CEO, Tickle Water was her son\u2019s idea. When he was two, he asked for a sip of her sparkling water, loved it, \u201cand the next day he was like, \u2018Mommy, I want tickle water!\u2019\u201d she told me enthusiastically. Tickle Water comes in a transparent plastic can with an aluminium lid. \u201cSo the kids can feel like they\u2019re drinking a soda because it looks like a soda can, but the parents feel good because they see that it\u2019s clear, plain, transparent water.\u201d</p> <p>For McDowell, if making water look like Coke means kids drink more water and less Coke, this can only be a good thing. True, undoubtedly, but somehow it feels like the final twist in water\u2019s elaborate rebrand, the last stop on a journey that starts with turning on a tap and marvelling that something clean, healthy and potable comes out, and then pauses \u2013 for years \u2013 to watch an iceberg melt very, very slowly, and ends with a child drinking \u201ccola\u201d water (one of Tickle Water\u2019s natural flavours), because he likes the style of the can.</p> <p>From element to commodity, we finally got there: welcome to the age of Water\u2122. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 7 October and 8 November 2016.

  "<p>For well over a week now the air under the plum tree has reeked like the dregs of a half-drunk bottle of red wine left opened for a fortnight \u2013 alcoholic and vinegary. I can not remember such a good plum crop, ever. After the pies and the jam and the ones that were frozen or given away, the fallen plums could only be left to rot, but I piled some on the bird table in the sun.

When I touched them, most merely responded with an irritated flick of their wings. Others flew in a circle, then returned. Two settled on me, on my arm and in my hair.

The plant, a <em>Buddleia x weyeriana, </em>produces abundant nectar until the first frosts and it was crawling with bumblebees, though bereft of butterflies.

Two speckled woods that tried to join in were seen off in a matter of seconds.</p> <p>Late this afternoon they were still there, some now with tattered wings, living their final days in their last chance saloon before cold nights, bad weather and the last of the plums brought their boozy feast to an end.</p> <p><em>Follow Country diary on Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnCountryDiary\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>",
