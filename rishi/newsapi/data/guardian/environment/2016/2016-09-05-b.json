  "<p>Human rights and equality campaigners are demanding an investigation into the decision to give the contract to run a discrimination helpline to G4S, the scandal-hit global security firm.</p> <p>A number of organisations, including Liberty, Tell Mama and Inquest, have written to Harriet Harman, the chair of the joint committee on human rights, and Maria Miller, the chair of the women and equalities select committee, to express \u201cprofound concern\u201d over the awarding of the contract to run the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) to G4S. <br></p> <p>They want the contract, due to begin on 1 October, to be halted until an inquiry is held into both the tendering process and the suitability of G4S to deliver the service properly. They claim that G4S is \u201cmanifestly ill-equipped to provide advice on discrimination and human rights\u201d and that the public would be unlikely to have confidence in it. </p> <p>The Law Centres Network, which represents 40 law centres in the UK and is one of the signatories to the letter, has begun a legal challenge to the tendering process and the awarding of the contract. The charity, which provides free legal advice to people on low incomes, accused the government of failing to properly assess the shortcomings of the EASS with stakeholders and said that it did not properly consider how to reform the service with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which ran it previously.</p> <p>In March, a House of Lords committee recommended that the government restore the helpline to the EHRC. A number of stakeholders told the committee that the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/03/a4e-major-government-contract\">outsource the service</a> had led to a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between disabled people and the body charged with advancing equality and human rights. When run by EHRC, it highlighted trends and issues important to them, they said. The matter is scheduled for debate in the House of Lords on Tuesday.</p> <p>The letter, sent on 5 September and <a href=\"https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/sites/default/files/Joint%20NGO%20letter%20to%20Parliament%20re%20G4S%20EASS%20contract%20Final.pdf\">signed by 41 organisations</a>, said the tendering process was flawed, \u201clacked openness\u201d, and did not require a contractor to have any relevant knowledge or prior skills in delivering equalities or human rights advice. It questioned the appointment of G4S, which it said had \u201cearned a reputation for serious systemic mismanagement and discrimination\u201d and was responsible for human rights violations against those in its care. It highlighted concerns expressed by many MPs over the competence of the security company and included a dossier of serious allegations and findings against G4S.</p> <p>\u201cThese include systemic failings \u2026 the repeated findings of racism and sexism among G4S staff, and harrowing official reports of G4S mistreatment of children, pregnant women and other protected groups,\u201d the letter said.</p> <p>The company most recently came under renewed scrutiny over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/moj-to-take-over-medway-child-jail-from-g4s\">its running of Medway youth jail</a>, which resulted in the government taking over the jail\u2019s management.</p> <p>The decision to award the contract to G4S has been criticised by union leaders, and a <a href=\"https://actions.sumofus.org/a/don-t-hand-the-government-s-discrimination-helpline-over-to-g4s\">petition by campaigning platform SumOfUs</a>, urging Justine Greening, the secretary of state for education, women and equalities not to give the contract to G4S but instead to give responsibility back to the EHRC, has received more than 53,000 signatures.</p> <p> Bella Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, said: \u201cThe EASS provides expert advice to those who face discrimination \u2013 whether refused accommodation because of their race, or sacked from their job because of their age. <br></p> <p>\u201cG4S has been responsible for countless human rights violations and the mistreatment \u2026 of people in their care. It\u2019s hard to think of a company more ill-equipped to provide this vital service. Liberty joins other equality and rights organisations in demanding that this perverse decision be halted while parliament investigates.\u201d</p> <p>Nimrod Ben-Cnaan, head of policy at the Law Centres Network, said: \u201cThis legal action is about ensuring access to justice for some of the most disadvantaged and often vulnerable people in society. It is already difficult for people to access appropriate advice on discrimination and human rights, which are complex areas of law. Our concern is that the government does all it should to ensure that the most suitable provider is chosen, and that the service is effective.\u201d</p> <p>Sondhya Gupta, senior campaigner with SomeOfUs.org, described the decision to award the contract to G4S as a \u201ckick in the teeth to everyone who faces disability, race, or sex discrimination\u201d. She added: \u201cWith hate crimes and discrimination on the rise in post-Brexit Britain, the kind of support that the EASS provides is now more important than ever.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A spokesman for the EHRC said: \u201cWe think the commission should have been given responsibility for running the service, and that remains our position. However, given that the contract has already been awarded, we are working with G4S and government to provide advice on how the service can best meet the needs of those who experience discrimination or an abuse of their human rights.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Miller said: \u201cWe are aware of the concerns that have been raised on this subject and will consider the matter carefully.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cThe Equality Advisory and Support Service is an important source of free advice and support for people facing discrimination or human rights issues. To ensure the service can continue and is run as effectively and efficiently as possible, we ran an open and competitive tender process to identify who is best to take it forward. Following this, G4S has been successful, and it will be running the service for three years from October 2016.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Malpas, the managing director responsible at G4S for this service, said the company would bring experience gleaned from its work at the DWP helpline for separating parents. \u201cWe were awarded the contract on the strength of our work handling other complex call centres including the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 (DWP) child maintenance options service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have supported that helpline for separating parents over the past three years and feedback from callers and the DWP has been positive.\u201d</p>",
  "<p> The Sellafield nuclear site is riddled with potentially lethal safety flaws, according to a BBC investigation.</p> <p> The Panorama programme, broadcast on Monday night, uncovered a raft of safety issues on the site in Cumbria which stores almost all of the country\u2019s nuclear waste.</p> <p>The investigation was prompted by a whistleblower, once a senior manager in Sellafield, who revealed a litany of safety concerns including degraded infrastructure, improper storage of highly radioactive materials and chronic under staffing across the site.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/14/sellafield-nuclear-waste-storage-safety-limit-relaxed\">Sellafield nuclear waste storage safety limit relaxed following accident</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Speaking anonymously, he told the programme he worried about the safety of the site \u201cevery day\u201d. Panorama revealed how radioactive chemicals are stored in plastic bottles on the site that should only ever have been used as short-term storage.</p> <p> Despite the efforts of scientists at Sellafield to try to eradicate the problem, the probe found more than 2,000 bottles with the toxic materials still on site.</p> <p>Dr Rex Strong, head of nuclear safety at Sellafield, said: \u201cThe organisation is now focusing on putting right some underinvestments of the past in order to support the hazard and waste reduction mission that the site has.\u201d<br></p> <p> Sellafield later said in a statement that plutonium and uranium samples were \u201ckept securely\u201d and that \u201cto imply that such material is inappropriately managed is simply not true\u201d.</p> <p> The whistleblower said that his biggest fear for the site was for one of the nuclear waste silos to go up in flames \u2013 the consequences of which would be dire. He said: \u201cIf there is a fire there it could generate a plume of radiological waste that will go across western Europe.\u201d</p> <p> It was also revealed that swaths of the plant often do not have enough staff to meet basic safety levels. Investigators for the programme found that in the space of 12 months between July 2012 and July 2013, minimum levels of safe manning levels were routinely breached.</p> <p> However Strong insisted that low staffing levels did not mean safety was compromised. He said: \u201cYou make alternative arrangements, so the things that have to be done, get done, and facilities are shut down if in fact we\u2019re not able to operate them in the way that we want to \u2013 it\u2019s not a level that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p> <p> One report on the site\u2019s infrastructure from 2013 featured on the programme said \u201cyears of neglect\u201d had lead to \u201cintolerable conditions\u201d in Sellafield.</p> <p> The programme makers linked an incident in the plant in 2013 to the crumbling infrastructure when an electricity substation exploded, leading to radioactive dust spreading into parts of the building.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/31/sellafield-nuclear-site-elevated-levels-radioactivity\">Sellafield nuclear site has elevated levels of radioactivity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sellafield\u2019s press office did not respond to repeated attempts to contact it on Monday night.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> However, a statement given to the programme the Nuclear Management Partners, who ran Sellafield until earlier this year, said the safety and security of the site have always been their \u201coverriding priorities\u201d and that over the past eight years the site achieved \u201cthe best overall safety \u2026 in its history.\u201d</p> <p> Strong added: \u201cThere\u2019s been huge and sustained investment in infrastructure at Sellafield over recent years. Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2016. An earlier version said Nuclear Management Partners ran Sellafield. The contract to own and operate Sellafield was transferred back to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in March.</p>",

After the excitement of the transfer window, there are some that don\u2019t seem too bothered about actual football, especially the kind that doesn\u2019t count towards their fantasy football team.</p> <p>I can assure you that is not the case with this MBMer. Nor, a tad more importantly, is it the case with a small group of people in Finland, hailing \u2013 through their heritage \u2013 from Kosovo. The Balkan state will start their first-ever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football\">World Cup</a> qualifying campaign this evening, but rather than spend the last few days in anticipation, it has been nothing but fret. After being granted admission to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa\">Fifa</a> in May \u2013 with players of Kosovan birth or heritage who had represented other countries invited to apply for a nationality switch \u2013 there has been a long, laborious process of admin to get some of these players cleared to play tonight. The 3pm deadline today came and went with no updates and until a few moments ago, six of the squad were unaware if they had been declared eligible \u2013 hardly ideal circumstances for the manager Albert Bunjaki \u2013 but they have all been given the green light to play. Cue bedlam in Turku! It\u2019s as though they\u2019ve already won the World Cup!

  "<p>Today, for the 13th time, the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/QSWUR16_PR\">QS World University Rankings</a> are released into the world. Although there is often particular interest in the individual institutional narratives thrown up by each iteration, closer examination of the datasets also allows us to discern trends both potential and current from the higher education landscape. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest trend this year is the regressive performance of Western European institutions. France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy all suffer to varying extents, but perhaps the most significant tremors are those felt by the UK.</p> <p>Taken alone, the University of Cambridge dropping from third to fourth might represent a minor fluctuation, as might King\u2019s College London falling out of the top 20. Rather, the small but noticeable drops of 38 of their 48 top-400 universities suggests that storm clouds are gathering over the British higher education system.</p> <p>Of more significance, however, are the trends visible when one looks at the dataset for citations per faculty, a measure of global research impact. Cambridge\u2019s drop in citations performance is more severe here, while, for the second consecutive year, the UK has fewer top-100 research institutions than does China. Across Western Europe, too, research performance as a whole remains broadly static, while universities in other parts of the world are making advances apace.</p> <p>China\u2019s rise is the best example of this, but the universities in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, and France also seem to be following a very different trajectory to those in the United Kingdom, both reputationally and for research performance. </p> <h2>What\u2019s happening?</h2> <p>As far as the UK is concerned, Brexit is an inadequate explanation. Almost all of the information used by QS for this year\u2019s rankings was collected well in advance of 23 June, while a number of their indicators track five years\u2019 worth of data.</p> <p>Perhaps the rankings indicate that national austerity policy is failing the nation\u2019s researchers, and the nation\u2019s students. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/funding/annallocns/1516/\">This year\u2019s \u00a320 million increase</a> to the Higher Education Funding Council for England\u2019s research budget is both the first since the coalition government took charge in 2010, and still insufficient to compensate for <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140711134143/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/invest/institns/annallocns/archive/2010-11/\">the real-terms cuts that came after the 2010-11 academic year</a>. Factor six years of inflation into the equation, and it becomes clear that the UK government is asking its universities to do more with less.</p> <p>The correlation holds across the world. Denmark and Sweden, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7092226/9-30112015-AP-EN.pdf/29eeaa3d-29c8-496d-9302-77056be6d586\">two of the three countries to have exceeded the European Unions\u2019s research and development spending targets</a>, see 12 of their 13 universities improve their research performance. France, which only recently reneged on the promise of <a href=\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/france-backpedals-on-last-minute-research-budget-cuts/1010359.article\">\u20ac256m (\u00a3200m) worth of education cuts</a> after an outcry from the academic world \u2013 while still cutting almost half of the proposed sum \u2013 sees consistent drops both overall and for research impact. </p> <p>The US, whose universities receive <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=73\">substantial private funding by means of endowments</a>, hold all of QS\u2019s top three places for the first time. Brazil, in the midst of its worst recession for decades and harbouring a higher education system <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/brasilia/education/inclusive-education/\">with troubling inequities</a> in terms of both funding and access, sees every single one of its ranked universities fall for research quality for the second consecutive year.<br></p> <p>Decreases in funding do not only affect QS\u2019s research indicators. They also affect, indirectly, other indicators like international faculty ratios and academic reputation scores. A nation\u2019s ability to provide world-class teaching and research is, in part, contingent on its ability to attract outstanding academics and students from abroad.<br></p> <h2>Before Brexit</h2> <p>Much has been made of the potential for Brexit to adversely affect the UK\u2019s desirability as a student destination, but this year\u2019s rankings also indicate that the UK is also \u2013 already \u2013 becoming a less attractive destination for foreign academics. More than half of the UK\u2019s universities are seeing drops in their international faculty ratio score, and it is important to note that the majority of the data used for this year\u2019s rankings was sourced pre-Brexit.<br></p> <p>It is difficult to foresee UK scores for indices of internationalisation improving as research budgets remain static, as <a href=\"http://monitor.icef.com/2016/07/the-uncertainty-of-brexit/\">uncertainty remains for students</a> about the potential costs of tuition, and as uncertainty remains for academics both national and international about their funding sources.<br></p> <p>It is here, too, that the use of reputational indicators becomes of essential importance. Governmental policy-makers, students both aspiring and current, and university administrators would all do well to remain aware of present feeling in the global academic community. QS\u2019s Academic Reputation survey is, to date, the world\u2019s largest aggregation of feeling in this community.<br></p> <p>That well over two-thirds of Western European universities see their standing among academics reduced suggests a number of troubling things about the state of European academia. It is difficult to ignore the correlation between <a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/pressure-to-publish-or-perish-may-discourage-innovative-research-ucla-study-suggests\">increasing publishing pressures</a>, reduced budgets, fears around the seemingly relentless marketisation of higher education, and the belief that Western Europe\u2019s universities are becoming <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0309877X.2016.1159287\">more stressful, less attractive</a> places for those academics upon whom they depend.<br></p> <p><em>Jack Moran is closely involved in the auditing and analysis of the QS World University Rankings alongside the QS Intelligence Unit</em></p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

  "<p>Toxic nanoparticles from air pollution have been discovered in human brains in \u201cabundant\u201d quantities, a newly published study reveals.</p> <p>The detection of the particles, in brain tissue from 37 people, raises concerns because recent research has suggested <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24873\">links between these magnetite particles and Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>, while air pollution has been shown to <a href=\"http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad140855\">significantly increase</a> the risk of the disease. However, the new work is still a long way from proving that the air pollution particles cause or exacerbate Alzheimer\u2019s.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a discovery finding, and now what should start is a whole new examination of this as a potentially very important environmental risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Prof Barbara Maher, at Lancaster University, who led the new research. \u201cNow there is a reason to go on and do the epidemiology and the toxicity testing, because these particles are so prolific and people are exposed to them.\u201d</p> <p>Air pollution is a global health crisis that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/16/more-people-die-from-air-pollution-than-malaria-and-hivaids-new-study-shows\">kills more people than malaria and HIV/Aids</a> combined and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/air-pollution-linked-to-increased-mental-illness-in-children?CMP=share_btn_tw\">mental illness</a> and <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001792\">reduced intelligence</a>. </p> <p>The new work, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1605941113\">published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, examined brain tissue from 37 people in Manchester, in the UK, and Mexico, aged between three and 92. </p> <p>It found abundant particles of magnetite, an iron oxide. \u201cYou are talking about millions of magnetite particles per gram of freeze-dried brain tissue - it is extraordinary,\u201d said Maher.</p> <p>\u201cMagnetite in the brain is not something you want to have because it is particularly toxic there,\u201d she said, explaining that the substance can create reactive oxygen species called free radicals. \u201cOxidative cell damage is one of the hallmark features of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and this is why the presence of magnetite is so potentially significant, because it is so bioreactive.\u201d </p> <p>Abnormal accumulation of brain metals is a key feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24873\">recent study</a> showed that magnetite was directly associated with the damage seen in Alzheimer\u2019s brains. Magnetite particles are known to form biologically in human brains, but these are small and crystal-shaped, unlike the larger, spherical particles that dominated the samples in the new study.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the magnetite particles we have found in the brain are very distinctive,\u201d said Maher. \u201cThey are very rounded nanospheres, because they were formed as molten droplets of material from combustion sources, such as car exhausts, industrial processes and power stations, anywhere you are burning fuel.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThey are abundant,\u201d she said. \u201cFor every one of [the crystal shaped particles] we saw about 100 of the pollution particles. The thing about magnetite is it is everywhere.\u201d An analysis of roadside air in Lancaster found <a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/maherb/papers/HalsalletalAtmEnv2008.pdf\">200m magnetite particles per cubic metre</a>.</p> <p>Furthermore, said Maher: \u201cWe also observed other metal-bearing particles in the brain, such as platinum, cobalt and nickel. Things like platinum are very unlikely to come from a source within the brain. It is a bit of an indicator of a [vehicle] catalytic converter source.\u201d </p> <p>Other scientists told the Guardian the new work provided strong evidence that most of the magnetite in the brain samples come from air pollution but that the link to Alzheimer\u2019s disease remained speculative.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very intriguing finding and it raises a lot of important questions,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.bme.ufl.edu/people/dobson_jon\">Prof Jon Dobson</a>, at the University of Florida and not part of the research team.

Corporate sponsorship of the Paris climate change meetings is only the most important of recent manifestations of this phenomenon, in this case not only helping to explain why people around the world appear to be losing faith in conventional politics, but also why so little is done to get to the roots of why fossil-fuelled capitalist globalisation has been allowed to put the very existence of the planet at serious risk.<br><strong>Leslie Sklair</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 You argue (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/the-guardian-view-on-green-leadership-a-challenge-and-an-opportunity\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 2 September) that Greens should concentrate on \u201ctheir\u201d issues (climate change, for example) and leave stuff like the economy, inequality, human rights etc to the mainstream parties.

It was the Conservative government who blocked EU plans to stop this practice, but now we are leaving the EU our new prime minister doesn\u2019t even think it\u2019s worth mentioning.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to allow Brexit to reduce our place in the world to silently sitting wishing someone will offer us a trade deal, like a nervous teenager waiting to dance at a school disco. We need a prime minister willing to fight for British industry and to make the case that the UK remains open, tolerant and united.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The soaring temperature of the oceans is the \u201cgreatest hidden challenge of our generation\u201d that is altering the make-up of marine species, shrinking fishing areas and starting to spread disease to humans, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of ocean warming.</p> <p>The oceans have already sucked up an enormous amount of heat due to escalating greenhouse gas emissions, affecting marine species from microbes to whales, according to an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46254\">report</a> involving the work of 80 scientists from a dozen countries. </p> <p>The profound changes underway in the oceans are starting to impact people, the report states. \u201cDue to a domino effect, key human sectors are at threat, especially fisheries, aquaculture, coastal risk management, health and coastal tourism.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Laffoley, IUCN marine adviser and one of the report\u2019s lead authors, said: \u201cWhat we are seeing now is running well ahead of what we can cope with. The overall outlook is pretty gloomy.</p> <p>\u201cWe perhaps haven\u2019t realised the gross effect we are having on the oceans, we don\u2019t appreciate what they do for us. We are locking ourselves into a future where a lot of the poorer people in the world will miss out.\u201d</p> <p>The scale of warming in the ocean, which covers around 70% of the planet, is \u201ctruly staggering\u201d, the report states. The upper few metres of ocean have warmed by around 0.13C a decade since the start of the 20th century, with a 1-4C increase in global ocean warming by the end of this century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T10:26:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Annual global sea surface temperature anomalies in degrees celsius\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T10:26:56/embed.html\">Annual global sea surface temperature anomalies in degrees celsius</a> </figure>  <p>The ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat created by human activity. If the same amount of heat that has been buried in the upper 2km of the ocean had gone into the atmosphere, the surface of the Earth would have warmed by a devastating 36C, rather than 1C, over the past century.<br></p> <p>At some point, the report says, warming waters could unlock billions of tonnes of frozen methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the seabed and cook the surface of the planet. This could occur even if emissions are drastically cut, due to the lag time between emitting greenhouse gases and their visible consequences.</p> <p>Warming is already causing fish, seabirds, sea turtles, jellyfish and other species to change their behaviour and habitat, it says. Species are fleeing to the cooler poles, away from the equator, at a rate that is up to five times faster than the shifts seen by species on land. </p> <p>Even in the north Atlantic, fish will move northwards by nearly 30km per decade until 2050 in search of suitable temperatures, with shifts already documented for pilchard, anchovy, mackerel and herring.</p> <p>The warming is having its greatest impact upon the building blocks of life in the seas, such as phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill. Changes in abundance and reproduction are, in turn, feeding their way up the food chain, with some fish pushed out of their preferred range and others diminished by invasive arrivals. </p> <p>With more than 550 types of marine fishes and invertebrates already considered threatened, ocean warming will exacerbate the declines of some species, the report also found.</p> <p>The movement of fish will create winners and losers among the 4.3 billion people in the world who rely heavily upon fish for sustenance. In south-east Asia, harvests from fisheries could drop by nearly a third by 2050 if emissions are not severely curtailed. Global production from capture fisheries has already levelled off at 90m tonnes a year, mainly due to overfishing, at a time when millions more tonnes will need to be caught to feed a human population expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050.</p> <p>Humans are also set to suffer from the spread of disease as the ocean continues to heat up. The IUCN report found there is growing evidence of vibrio bacterial disease, which can cause cholera, and harmful algal bloom species that can cause food poisoning. People are also being affected by more severe, if not more numerous, hurricanes due to the extra energy in the ocean and atmosphere.</p> <p>Coral reefs, which support around a quarter of all marine species, are suffering from episodes of bleaching that have increased three-fold over the past 30 years. This bleaching occurs when prolonged high temperatures cause coral to expel its symbiotic algae, causing it to whiten and ultimately die, such as the mass mortality that has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">gripped the Great Barrier Reef</a>. </p> <p>Ocean acidification, where rising carbon dioxide absorption increases the acidity of the water, is making it harder for animals such as crabs, shrimps and clams to form their calcium carbonate shells.</p> <p>The IUCN report recommends expanding protected areas of the ocean and, above all, reduce the amount of heat-trapping gases pumped into the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way to preserve the rich diversity of marine life, and to safeguard the protection and resources the ocean provides us with, is to cut greenhouse gas emissions rapidly and substantially,\u201d said Inger Andersen, director general of the IUCN. </p>",
  "<p>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, in his quiet and ambling fashion, has built up a steady body of work on his return to the tournament he won in 2009, and, with the crowd warming to every pistol crack of his huge forehand, he enters the quarter-finals on Wednesday as a dangerous contender.</p> <p>As with Andy Murray, the scene of his breakthrough major will always hold a special place in his heart, and the Argentinian seemed energised against the Austrian Dominic Thiem, who quit after only an hour and 12 minutes of their match on Arthur Ashe Court with a knee injury, when 6-3 and 3-2 down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/15/juan-martin-del-potro-us-open\">Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro shocks Roger Federer to win US Open title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That took Del Potro\u2019s total court time in four matches to eight hours and 21 minutes, blessed relief for a player who is still picking up the rhythm of the Tour after missing so much tennis with a lingering wrist injury over the past two years. He played only four matches last year, to Thiem\u2019s 64, and 10 the year before compared with Thiem\u2019s 45. This is Del Potro\u2019s his first grand slam quarter-final since Wimbledon 2013. He faces Stan Wawrinka, who later beat Illya Marchenko in four sets.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a good win. I wish all the best to Dominic. He has great future,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/andy-murray-beats-juan-martin-del-potro-rio-2016\" title=\"\">unseeded Olympic silver medallist </a>said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I have a good connection with the people of New York City. I am far away in Argentina but I feel at home here, in this stadium, in this city.

The American went on to lose in the semi-finals. There was a certain irony in Thiem\u2019s retirement: the 23-year-old\u2019s 69 matches for the year is the most of any player on the Tour, more than twice Del Potro\u2019s 30. Managing resources is a skill in itself and the former US champion looks as if he has mastered it. Despite his injury woes, it was clear who was the most weary on court on Monday afternoon.</p> <p>Thiem called for the trainer after struggling through the latter part of the first set and the early stages of the second. It was not a great surprise when he became the ninth player to retire during a match in the final grand slam of the season, which invariably has a high casualty rate. Although Del Potro hit only 10 clean winners in the shortened contest, they were invariably eye-catching and gave his opponent no chance of keeping the ball in play. He served efficiently, was lethal at the net, took all three break opportunities and hit a mere 10 unforced errors.Elsewhere, Kei Nishikori booked his place in the last eight with a straight sets victory over Ivo Karlovic in the last match to be held on Louis Armstrong before it is rebuilt. The Japanese was always in control against the big-serving Croat but needed a tie-break to seal the third set.</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Men and women ask for pay increases at the same rate, according to a new study, which seems to debunk one of the most common explanations cited for the persistence of a gender wage gap.</p> <p>Using data collected from 4,600 Australian workers across more than 800 employers, the study from the University of Wisconsin in the US and the University of Warwick and Cass Business School in the UK found \u201cno difference\u201d in the likelihood of asking between the two genders. A lack of assertiveness in negotiations is often cited as a potential reason why women might make less money than men for similar work.</p> <p>Researchers say the finding is important because it bucks against a theory that \u201cplaces some of the responsibility for the existence of gender differentials upon female employees and the choices they make\u201d, rather than structural biases.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2014\">According to the World Economic Forum,</a> there is no country on earth where women make as much as men for the same work. WEF research has predicted that it will take 81 years at current rates of improvement for women to reach parity.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how the numbers would come out. Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\u201d said study co-author Andrew Oswald, a professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick.</p> <p>Oswald said that Australia was the \u201cnatural\u201d testing place for these theories because \u201cit is the only country in the world to collect systematic information on whether employees have asked for a rise [in pay]\u201d. The gender pay gap in Australia is about 17%, slightly lower than the 21% gap that exists in the US.</p> <p>The study also claims to disprove the notion that part of the reason women don\u2019t ask for raises is that they are more likely to be sensitive to the harm that such requests could have on their inter-workplace relationships.</p> <p>Researchers did find, however, that younger women received raises just as often as younger men.</p> <p> \u201cThis study potentially has an upside,\u201d said co-author Dr Amanda Goodall a professor at Cass Business School of the City University of London. \u201cYoung women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\u201d</p>",

He replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Access to the single market is not really up for grabs. It is there for everybody. There are many, many countries, many countries outside the European Union, that do a better job, frankly, of exporting to the single market than we do, even without a trade arrangement. So of course we want to have access to the single market. We don\u2019t need to be a member of it to do it. Indeed, being a member of it has caused some of the problems of sovereignty that this referendum was driven by.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, when the pro-European Tory<strong> Anna Soubry</strong> asked Davis to confirm that he was willing to abandon single market membership, Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I\u2019m saying is that this government is looking at every option. But the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said he did not accept the claim that there was a trade off between getting control of immigration and protecting free trade by remaining in the single market.</strong> It was a false choice, he argued, because it was in the interests of both sides to promote free trade.

I will probably be writing that sentence again after David Davis\u2019s Commons statement, and probably quite regularly for the rest of the decade. In truth May and her team may have little idea what the final Brexit settlement will look like and, as they try to craft a deal acceptable to both Nigel Farage, the CBI and the EU, the outcome is likely to emerge slowly and haphazardly. (That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasongroves1/status/745278844135931904\">David Cameron once said a Brexit vote would mean \u201cthree years of Euro-wank.)</a></p> <p> But some of May\u2019s comments were moderately revealing. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May said that leaving the EU would give the UK \u201csome control\u201d over EU migration - suggesting that the restrictions on EU migration might just be partial.</strong> She said that at present the UK could not restrict EU migration. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we will now have an ability to do, which we haven\u2019t had before, is when we come out of the EU, we will be able to have some control on movement of people coming from the EU into the UK, which of course was one element over which we weren\u2019t able to have control before. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is not entirely clear what May meant, but hardline anti-Europeans like Nigel Farage (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0#block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0\">9.33am)</a> are likely to be worried by her tone. My colleague <strong>Alan Travis </strong>says this could be a hint that free movement could remain for EU citizens with job offers in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alantravis40/status/772767292937625600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May says she wants to &quot;gain an element of control&quot; over immigration.

She explained her point with a story about what she learnt when she visited Heathrow to speak to Border Force staff with David Cameron after they took office.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And we talked to Border Force officers there. And we said to them, \u2018What\u2019s the most important thing that we can focus on?\u2019 And they said, \u2018You need to look at the issue of students who come here, who appear to have met the criteria, they don\u2019t speak English, they don\u2019t know which institution they are going to and they don\u2019t know what course it is they\u2019re doing\u2019.

This is what May actually said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You really don\u2019t want to ask a former home secretary about the intricacies of a points-based system because it might take a very long time to answer your question. One of the issues is whether or not points-based systems do work.</p> </blockquote> <p>May said what people wanted was \u201can ability to be able to control the movement of people from the European Union ... not free movement as it has been in the past.\u201d She left reporters with the impression that EU citizens could still take priority over non-EU citizens under the immigration rules that will eventually be adopted post-Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Farage,</strong> the outgoing Ukip leader, has responded this morning by issuing a statement criticising May\u2019s stance. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May\u2019s track record on immigration as Home Secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me. There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May\u2019s reluctance to trigger article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted Leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding. </p> <p>The people were clear in wanting a points-based immigration system which is why so many went out and voted to Leave the European Union. Any watering down from that will lead to real anger.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage also said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d to give EU citizens priority under the post-Brexit immigration rules.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given that myself and others also campaigned for a migration system that would treat all who wanted to come equally, any preference for EU nationals would be totally unacceptable. If the establishment think they can stitch-up Brexit then they better be ready for the huge electoral consequences from a British public who on June 23rd voted for radical political change and now expect it to be delivered without failure.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8147a569d00ec5b6455039bdfe650c31cd3f4500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8147a569d00ec5b6455039bdfe650c31cd3f4500/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cd1e14e4b0c2a396c06d43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-05T08:09:54.430Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs return to the Commons today after their summer recess and the highlight will be a statement from<strong> David Davis</strong>, the new Brexit secretary, about the government\u2019s plans for leaving the EU.

In a statement released overnight Davis stressed that Britain\u2019s future outside the EU would be marvellous.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit isn\u2019t about making the best of a bad job. It is about seizing the huge and exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world.

He has previously talked of how he never knew his father and how as a boy he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a young man who had access to their tenement rooms.</p> <p>As a teenager he went to work in the coal mines, before joining the police force at 20, where he was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1965 and inspector in 1966.</p> <p>In the 1980s he was seconded to interrogate Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, and reportedly succeeded in establishing that the serial killer had attempted two further murders. Yet, true to form, even these efforts attracted controversy.</p> <p>One winter Hellawell visited Broadmoor, where he handed a Christmas card to Sutcliffe. \u201cIt was just part of the rapport thing [to get Sutcliffe to open up], that was all,\u201d he told the Sunday Times in 2000, but a disgusted Broadmoor staffer informed the Daily Mail and Hellawell was lambasted in the press. It scarcely represented the final attack.</p> <p>As chief constable of West Yorkshire from 1993, Hellawell was again brought to national attention. He was jeered and booed at a Police Federation meeting in response to changes he introduced to the West Yorkshire CID. And during his time as chief constable he advocated several controversial, liberal positions, including the legalisation of brothels and operating a policy of widespread cautioning of cannabis-takers instead of automatically prosecuting them. Even so, he opposed the legalisation of cannabis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31173e08188d6983c6d6d0b574a43db1004a011d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31173e08188d6983c6d6d0b574a43db1004a011d/31_0_1368_1709/800.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Hellawell\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Hellawell held his role as advisor to Labour on drugs policy, or the nation\u2019s \u2018drug tsar\u2019 from 1998 to 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Jordan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was his expertise in narcotics that led to his appointment in 1998 as the UK\u2019s \u201cdrug tsar\u201d, only for that position to be downgraded in 2001 to an advisory role.</p> <p>He fell out with his Whitehall bosses and, while he had already resigned, publicly announced his departure in 2002 during an interview on Radio Four\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>When quizzed about then home secretary David Blunkett\u2019s plan to downgrade the classification of cannabis from a Class B drug to Class C, Hellawell said on air that he opposed the policy.

Keep windows closed.</p> <p>I doubt the British authorities would choose a calm, precautionary approach over dousing our world with chemicals if faced with a public health panic. In 2014, woodland was aerially sprayed to kill the oak processionary moth, despite Natural England stating that repeated spraying would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/04/aerial-pesticide-spraying-uk-woods-fears-butterflies\" title=\"\">a serious impact</a> on rare butterflies. In Puerto Rico, however, the authorities have <a href=\"http://caribbeanbusiness.com/puerto-rico-wont-use-naled-against-zika/\" title=\"\">ruled out using Naled</a> during the Zika scare, and deployed an organic larvicide instead.

After her first bilateral meeting with Barack Obama, May was warned that the US wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of Pacific nations before considering a deal with the UK.</p> <p> This was swiftly followed by a message from Japan that there could be a string of corporate exits from Britain unless some of the privileges that come with access to the single market are maintained.

  "<p>The plaque says it all. Quite literally. \u201cMelhor Jogador Do Mundo\u201d \u2013 \u201cBest Player In The World\u201d.

But in Funchal there is only one contender for the crown. The plaque makes that clear too: \u201cCristiano Ronaldo\u201d. All there in bronze underneath a 10ft bronze statue of the man himself in classic pose: arms stretched down by his side, legs spread, hair immaculately groomed. Peak Ronaldo? Not quite. That would be the building the statue is directly facing: Museu CR7.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/22/cristiano-ronaldo-hotel-watford-chesterfield\">No room for half-measures in Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s gilded world of 110% | Simon Burnton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Ronaldo has his own museum in the city of his birth is not a surprise but what does raise an eyebrow upon visiting it, as I did on a sweltering August morning, is how easy it is to miss. From outside all you see is a single-storey building made up of an all-black frontage and a simple red-brick roof \u2013 hardly a sight that screams for your attention. But then you spot the statue, and the crowds gathered by it, and then, eventually, the giant \u201cCR7\u201d logos and it is a case of destination reached. Next up: entry, and everyone\u2019s welcome. Even you, Lionel.</p> <p>The museum is located at Pra\u00e7a do Mar, a square that stretches across the main port in Funchal, the capital of Madeira and where Ronaldo was born on 5 February 1985 (that\u2019s on the plaque, too). He is indisputably the most famous son of the city and of Madeira, an archipelago located 600 miles south of the Portuguese mainland that is inhabited by just over 267,000 people and draws thousands more in tourism each year, due, in part, to its fine wine and even finer weather.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3035f47923e1556497a08a6b00a288a64bff9615\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3035f47923e1556497a08a6b00a288a64bff9615/0_115_2448_3060/800.jpg\" alt=\"The 10ft bronze statue of Ronaldo that stands outside the main entrance to the museum and declares him to be the \u2018best player in the world\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 10ft bronze statue of Ronaldo that stands outside the main entrance to the museum and declares him to be the \u2018best player in the world\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sachin Nakrani/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of those who visit Madeira, and Funchal in particular, make going to Museu CR7 a must, with those who have done so since July visiting the new, improved and larger version of the museum.</p> <p>The original opened in December 2013 and was located in the nearby hills, on Rua Princesa D Am\u00e9lia. It was the brainchild of Ronaldo\u2019s older brother, Hugo, who after travelling to see his sibling at his villa in Madrid and noticing that his various trophies were scattered across the property, thought it would make sense to house them in one place. There were over 140, so a decent-sized building would be required; fortunately the younger Ronaldo had one in Funchal that needed filling and so a museum in his honour was created.</p> <p>And after the trophies kept on coming, it was decided a larger space was required. Hence the move to a site at Pra\u00e7a do Mar comprising of two stories and 1,400sq m of floor space shortly before Ronaldo was further enhancing his God-like status in Madeira by being a key part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/10/france-portugal-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">Portugal\u2019s Euro 2016-winning squad</a>.</p> <p>Museu CR7 is part of an empire, located as it is besides <a href=\"http://www.pestanacr7.com/en/hotel/pestana-cr7-funchal\" title=\"\">Pestana CR7 Hotel</a>, which also opened this summer and comes fitted with 48 rooms (the most basic of which are priced at \u20ac135-a-night), a CR7 suite (which will set you back \u20ac565-a-night) and a roof-top swimming pool that overlooks the harbour and towards the north Atlantic Ocean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33b5b5ea4f026604c3887c789d0c9a31f2b5332b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33b5b5ea4f026604c3887c789d0c9a31f2b5332b/0_78_5600_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the three replica Ballon d\u2019Or trophies that sit in the middle of museum\u2019s main section.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the three replica Ballon d\u2019Or trophies that sit in the middle of museum\u2019s main section.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Octavio Passos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the palm trees and white pebbled streets, the cafes and the bars, this is Ronaldo\u2019s territory.

The first thing to say is that it\u2019s reasonably cheap to visit \u2013 \u20ac5 per person, with free entry for under-10s. I expected tickets to be more expensive, and it came as a surprise that in this most brand-aware of venues there was not a \u20187\u2019 involved in the pricing structure. Perhaps that\u2019s to come; an extra free ticket for every seven-year-old, or for people who arrive in groups of seven, or for anyone who simply shouts \u201cseven!\u201d as they walk inside and towards the staff behind the tills in their CR7 tops.</p> <p>After buying a ticket it is a case of heading left and down the staircase, over which sit images of Ronaldo, most showing off that smile that says: \u201cLook at me \u2026 marvellous aren\u2019t I?\u201d A short walk later and you find yourself in the main section, a white-walled, black-floored bunker filled with trophy cabinets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a76ca99d65cad80ae3d0aa061e4dd08efd2ce674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a76ca99d65cad80ae3d0aa061e4dd08efd2ce674/0_56_3052_1831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Replicas of the Community Shield and the Premier League trophy.

Many saw his barking of orders from the touchline as a sign of disrespect towards the manager, Fernando Santos, but its inclusion in the video-telling of his career suggests Ronaldo thinks otherwise. It is a source of personal pride, a moment to be watched over and over again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ed3eff1a0e299a3497fa9e4775da8740e474e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ed3eff1a0e299a3497fa9e4775da8740e474e7/231_33_2881_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young visitor views the \u2018interactive timeline\u2019, which shows a range of clips from Ronaldo\u2019s career.

The number and range of them serve as a reminder that for all his preening, Ronaldo should be recognised as a supremely talented and successful footballer. Maybe not \u201cMelhor Jogador Do Mundo\u201d but undoubtedly worthy of being spoken of in those terms, in regards to this generation and those that have come before.</p> <p>And nowhere more so than in Funchal.

  "<p></p> <p>The mayor of Melania Trump\u2019s hometown is embarrassed. </p> <p>At 47, Sre\u010dko Ocvirk is just a year older than the world\u2019s most famous Slovenian. But even though he was a schoolmate of hers, the mayor of Sevnica said: \u201cI have to be honest, I cannot place her. In those days, Sevnica primary school had a lot of pupils,\u201d he added sheepishly. </p> <p>Born in 1970 to a textile worker and a car spares trader, Melania Trump has lived a life \u2013 judging by what is known of it \u2013 that could be romanced into that of a phoenix risen from the belching smokestacks of Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia. But the Trump campaign has opted not to go down that route. </p> <p>On a tour of Sevnica, a pretty medieval town that clings to vine-clad hills rising from the Sava river, it quickly becomes clear that the young Melanija Knavs did not stand out from the collective consciousness of the time as someone who would rise to global fame.</p> <p>\u201cIn the socialist days we were all the same,\u201d said a woman in the same age bracket as the 46-year-old. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b9aebd064cf688e8b3df6e66ea7f37e2a4ee644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9aebd064cf688e8b3df6e66ea7f37e2a4ee644/0_0_1030_684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"melania trump slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sevnica, the small Slovenian town where Melania Trump is from.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tanja Zibert/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, other residents can seem to make too much of an effort to recall her youth. At the Rondo Pizzeria, a couple of diners seem suspiciously well informed about the supposed early knitting abilities of Trump\u2019s future wife. At the market, a tomato seller named Matej said Melanija wrapped her schoolbooks with pages torn from Italian fashion magazines \u2013 only to confess that he learnt that detail from a recent television report.</p> <p>Not only are clues sparse as to Melania\u2019s transformation from model to the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s third wife, but few residents seem to hold strong opinions about her life, her immigration status or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/melania-trump-daily-mail-lawsuit\">the libel lawsuits pending over her references to her pre-Trump past</a>. No one in Sevnica can even confirm the oft-reported tidbit that Melanija\u2019s maternal grandfather developed a red onion variety, the Raka. </p> <p>\u201cSevnica was very different in the 1970s,\u201d said Ocvirk. \u201cIt was a young town, made up of people moving in from the rural areas.</p> <p>\u201cThey worked in large numbers at two or three factories, mainly making clothes and shoes.

Businessman Viktor dealt in cars or spare parts or both \u2013 no one seems quite sure. Amalija was a pattern cutter at the Jutranjka childrenswear factory and may at some point have gained a promotion to pattern designer. </p> <p>They lived in a five-storey block in the Naselje Heroja Maroka area. Later, Melanija and her older sister went to high school in Ljubljana, 60 miles away, and their parents built themselves a white villa in the pretty hills above the town, far away from the hourly clatter-past of the train. They still own the house but are rarely there, living instead in New York and helping look after Donald and Melania\u2019s son, Barron.</p> <p>The block where Melania once lived has been painted in mellow peach tones. The climbing frame in the playground is Lego green. The splashes of colour are townscape hallmarks of central European countries such as Slovenia that received development funds after joining the EU in 2004. Even the school bears no resemblance to the one Melania attended. With EU funds, it was rebuilt last year, to the annoyance of visiting television crews determined to see her locker. </p> <p>Trainee nurse Drita Mustafai, 21, knows nothing about Melania Trump, but says she \u201ccan only be a good thing for Sevnica. It is a lovely town which deserves more tourists\u201d.</p> <p>Mustafai helps out at her father\u2019s ice-cream stand and works in a hotel to help pay for her studies, and hopes to move to Germany when she graduates, because wages are better.</p> <p>Among Sevnica\u2019s 5,000-population, unemployment is 10.3% \u2013 roughly the national average. Jutranjka, where Amalija Knavs worked, is no more. Lisca, a lingerie brand named after the local mountain, survives, along with a shoe factory and a furniture company. But they employ fewer than 1,000 people between them. Many residents drive more than an hour to the capital Ljubljana to work.</p> <p>Asked what Donald Trump could do for his wife\u2019s home town, Ocvirk ruled out a skyscraper as \u201cunsuited to our natural beauty\u201d. Instead, with a sweeping arm movement reminiscent of a Trump Tower escalator, he suggested \u201ca golfing and fishing complex, spanning from the hills to the Sava river\u201d.</p>",

Men (and women) from all walks of life. I don\u2019t like the thought of it any more than you probably do, but I don\u2019t have the luxury of pretending it doesn\u2019t happen. It does. As a former escort, I\u2019ve lived it. I\u2019ve entertained men who, when the fun has ended, call their wives to tell them they\u2019re off to pick the kids up from school.

I haven\u2019t been exploited or abused and I resent middle-class know-it-alls trying to define my life choices. Back in May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/10/belle-de-jour-author-mps-prostitution-laws-brooke-magnanti\">I spoke at the home affairs select committee</a> on Britain\u2019s sex work laws, where Keith Vaz rather condescendingly told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe\u201d I\u2019d never met a sex worker who had been forced in to it. I haven\u2019t. For most people it\u2019s just a job. I know people who\u2019ve done it once or twice when they needed a bit of extra cash, and others purely for the thrill. That\u2019s right. Sex work can be fun. Exciting. Lucrative. And, believe it or not, sane adults can and do choose to do it of their own free will.</p> <p>Banning all sex work because of sexual exploitation is like banning all factories because of a handful of sweatshops. The difference between a willing sex worker and someone who has been forced to do it is the difference between a cleaner and a slave. We managed to explain this important distinction to the committee, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Let me be clear: from start to finish, the committee was heavily skewed towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/uk-nordic-model-prostitution-clients-buyer-sex\">the Nordic model</a> of criminalising those who buy sex rather than those who sell it. Yes, Vaz is a hypocrite if the claims about him are true, but that does not change the committee\u2019s important findings that criminalising sex work puts sex workers in danger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7a575d8ab0c47b0724d49422ba3be9f61b67f9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a575d8ab0c47b0724d49422ba3be9f61b67f9e0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Peter Tatchell\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/petertatchell\">Peter Tatchell</a>: \u2018There is no contradiction between Vaz\u2019s public pronouncements and private behaviour\u2019</h2> <p>Keith Vaz may have behaved recklessly and said some ill-advised things. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s blameless. But as far as we know he has not committed any crime and is not guilty of hypocrisy.</p> <p>Buying sex is not an offence, the men were consenting adults, there was no use of cocaine and poppers are legal. Vaz has supported gay equality and the decriminalisation of sex work. There is no contradiction between his public pronouncements and his private behaviour.</p> <p>So where is the public interest in outing him? This looks like a classic tabloid sting perpetrated by the Sunday Mirror for sensationalist motives in order to boost sales. The whole scenario may have been set up by the newspaper in collusion with the escorts, in order to entrap the MP. This could even include the paper assisting with the recording equipment and laying in wait outside the flat where the rendezvous with Vaz took place (although the paper denies this). It may even have prompted the escorts to ask Vaz leading questions about drugs. The Sunday Mirror allegedly paid the escorts \u00a330,000.</p> <p>This was not about defending the public interest. It looks like a sordid money-making conspiracy by the newspaper and the escorts \u2013 a throwback to the squalid tabloid excesses of the 1980s. To establish the truth, the Sunday Mirror must come clean about whether it knew in advance about the escorts meeting Vaz and whether it collaborated with them. How much did the paper pay the escorts for their story? Was there a signed contract? If so will the paper now publish it?</p> <p>Given the absence of any public interest justification, there is prima facie evidence that the Sunday Mirror has broken the press regulation code prohibiting unwarranted intrusion into privacy.</p> <p>It said that Vaz failed to declare an interest when his home affairs committee was investigating a ban on poppers and sex work criminalisation (he opposed both). Perhaps he should have declared an interest, but I am not sure that his failure to do so is a major lapse. After all, we don\u2019t demand that MPs who drink and smoke declare an interest when they discuss legislation affecting the alcohol and cigarette industries. There is never any insistence that MPs who have pension plans step aside from committees discussing pension regulation or that gay MPs must come out and declare themselves before voting on gay issues. I sense a whiff of double standards.</p> <p>Finally, I sympathise with Vaz\u2019s wife and children. Perhaps they never knew. But we must also remember how difficult it is for gay and bisexual people to come out in some sections (not all) of the Asian community. Homophobia kept Keith Vaz in the closet and we should be angry about that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"30806a87833875ab9c8b4c2b0fdcfb5526e8ebe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30806a87833875ab9c8b4c2b0fdcfb5526e8ebe9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Julie Bindel\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juliebindel\">Julie Bindel</a>: \u2018If Vaz is a sex buyer, how can he not have a stake in the committee\u2019s findings?\u2019</h2> <p>As predicted, the boys are out to defend Keith Vaz. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keith-vaz-prostitution-scandal-is-a-private-matter-says-jeremy-corbyn-a3336496.html\">Jeremy Corbyn has said</a> that the scandal is a \u201cprivate matter\u201d.

In its <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/prostitution/\">recent interim report</a>, the committee stated that it is \u201cnot yet persuaded that the sex buyer law is effective in reducing, rather than simply displacing, demand for prostitution\u201d. If the Nordic model was applied in England and Wales, those engaged in activities such as those Vaz is alleged to have partaken in would face criminal sanctions. If Vaz is himself a sex buyer, how can he not have a stake in these findings?</p> <p>The current law is that criminal charges can be brought if a person pays for sex with somebody who is \u201ccontrolled for another person\u2019s gain\u201d. Significant numbers of women and smaller numbers of men in the UK have been coerced into the sex trade, including those from poor and developing countries. To argue that Vaz, if he has paid for sex, can continue as chair of the very committee that will soon decide whether or not sex buyers should be criminalised is ludicrous. Vaz should step down now, and the interim report be scrapped and rewritten once the new chair is appointed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77d1edda41627f2cf86418c0b9bba776c1490c8d\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/05/Margaret_Corvid_opt.png\" alt=\"Margaret Corvid\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-corvid\">Margaret Corvid</a>: \u2018Prurient interest must not derail the chance for sex workers to live free from fear and stigma\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m no fan of Keith Vaz, but when I read that he\u2019d been accused of hiring male sex workers, I knew that defending him isn\u2019t about him \u2013 it\u2019s about our right as sex workers to work without threat of violence and arrest.</p> <p>The papers call him a hypocrite for alleged gay sex and for hiring sex workers when he\u2019s chaired a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/prostitution-report-published-16-17/\">parliamentary committee investigating the sex work laws</a>.

For the closeted, sex workers provide discretion: that discretion may have been violated by a newspaper sting, and disclosure rains down hurt upon Vaz\u2019s family, party and the essential work of the home affairs select committee. And if there was a sting, it makes <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/SexWorkerOU/status/772345591330406400\">sex workers less safe</a>, because potential clients are less likely to go through our screening procedures when they fear exposure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/05/why-the-sunday-mirror-was-justified-in-exposing-keith-vaz\">Why the Sunday Mirror was justified in exposing Keith Vaz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee has been investigating whether sex work should be fully decriminalised, as in New Zealand. Its groundbreaking inquiry heard testimony from current and former sex workers, receiving written submissions from hundreds of us, who asserted, in accord with the most rigorous research, that decriminalisation would drastically improve our safety and health, letting us work together and letting us go to police when we\u2019re robbed or assaulted, rather than fearing they will mock, arrest or deport us.</p> <p>The committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/prostitution-report-published-16-17/\">recommended the decriminalisation of sex workers</a> working together for safety; those recommendations were not the result of Vaz\u2019s alleged lusts. They emerged from a multi-party inquiry based on scientific evidence and the testimony of those affected most by criminalisation. Whether Vaz stays or goes, we must not let prurient interest in his personal life derail this precious moment \u2013 this chance for sex workers in the UK to live a life free from fear and stigma.

In Sweden, where what\u2019s known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/prostitution-sweden-model-reform-men-pay-sex\">the Nordic model of prostitution policy</a> was first introduced, a majority of the public now regards paying for sex as a form of abuse. Women and men who sell sex no longer face criminal sanctions but, crucially, people who buy it do.</p> <p>In this country, we still have out-of-date laws that criminalise vulnerable individuals who are in reality victims of a vast commercial sex industry. That\u2019s one of the reasons why many of us would like to see a sex buyers\u2019 law introduced in the UK, forcing men who drive this trade (and it is mostly men) to face up to their responsibilities.</p> <p>The Labour MP Keith Vaz chairs a powerful House of Commons committee that has been holding an inquiry into this key area of public policy. It has heard evidence from a number of organisations that support the Nordic model, yet no one knew that a change in the law may \u2013 if the <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/married-mp-keith-vaz-tells-8763805\">allegations in the Sunday Mirror</a> are true \u2013 affect the committee\u2019s chair directly.</p> <p>That\u2019s why these claims, no matter how luridly they have been presented, are in a different category from other stories exposing the private activities of well-known people. To take a recent example, the argument for publishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/13/mp-john-whittingdale-had-relationship-with-sex-worker\">details of the sexual relationships of the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale</a>, was undermined by the fact that there was no clear evidence they had affected the way he did his job.</p> <p>Vaz\u2019s situation is very different from Whittingdale\u2019s. To put it bluntly, he appears to have chaired hearings where campaigners proposed a change in the law that could, in theory, turn his own private behaviour into a criminal offence. This is jaw-dropping stuff, and it\u2019s hard to think of a more blatant conflict of interest.</p>",
  "<p>The most famous thing about pandas, apart from them spending all day eating bamboo and not having sex, is how endangered they are. However, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37272718\">the animal has just been moved off the endangered species list</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although the giant panda is still considered vulnerable, its population is much healthier \u2013 there are thought to be 1,864 adults, and although there isn\u2019t a definitive number of cubs, the total population now exceeds 2,000. It is, noted the IUCN report, \u201ca positive sign confirming that the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to conserve this species are effective\u201d. Few conservation measures have been as intensive or high profile. The work included increasing the number of panda reserves, protecting forests (such as reforestation and banning logging in panda habitats) and creating \u201ccorridors\u201d so isolated wild panda populations can mix and strengthen the gene pool. Anti-poaching patrols, and moving humans out of reserves also helped. Pandas are still at risk, particularly from a reduction in bamboo availability owing to climate change, but it shows conservation efforts pay off. Here are some other animals that have been brought back from the brink:</p> <h2><strong>Amur tiger</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7772679743c55ef3ec6d83850b5955dc7cc85a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7772679743c55ef3ec6d83850b5955dc7cc85a1/0_143_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amur tiger: in the 1930s, just 20-30 animals remained.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Amur tiger: in the 1930s, just 20-30 animals remained.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although they are still classed as endangered, the Amur tiger, mostly found in Russia, was once nearly extinct. In the 1930s, just 20 to 30 animals remained. Russia banned tiger hunting in 1947, and since then other efforts have <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/teacher_resources/best_place_species/back_from_the_brink/amur_tigers.cfm\">protected and increased the population</a>. These include reducing the hunting of their prey (such as deer) and anti-poaching measures. According to a 2005 survey, there are now an estimated 360 tigers (other estimates are higher) and it was moved from critically endangered to endangered in 2007. Poaching and low genetic diversity is still a risk.</p> <h2><strong>Arabian oryx</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1037dc08c10c8ccdfb7fec299b01cc0b8d335cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1037dc08c10c8ccdfb7fec299b01cc0b8d335cf/635_383_4669_2801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arbaian Oryx: hunted almost to extinction.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arbaian Oryx: hunted almost to extinction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mike lane / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1972, the last wild Arabian oryx, a large antelope that once lived across the Arabian peninsula, were shot. For decades, they had been hunted almost to extinction and had already disappeared from some areas. In 1982 in Oman, the Arabian oryx was released back into the wild following a captive breeding programme using the animals that had been captured previously, often from royal collections. In later years, more were released in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel and Jordan. With their numbers increased to around 1,000, and their populations stable, the IUCN downgraded the Arabian oryx from endangered to the lower threat-level of vulnerable in 2011.</p> <h2><strong>Greater one-horned rhinoceros</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2e794b1387ecfc6c82771e27639e6e3d95ace08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e794b1387ecfc6c82771e27639e6e3d95ace08/0_71_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The greater one-horned rhinoceros: in 1975, there were just 600 left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The greater one-horned rhinoceros: anti-poaching measures have increased their numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Indian rhinoceros, now extinct in Bangladesh and Bhutan, once roamed across the northern Indian subcontinent.

Take, for example, the rise of the so-called Instagram \u201cIt girls\u201d, such as the Hadid sisters and Kendall Jenner, as well as Vine star Cameron Dallas replacing Justin Bieber in the Calvin Klein ads. This has shone a light on the importance of an online personality bringing her or his personal brand and fan base to a fashion brand. The rise of transgender models like Hari Nef modelling for Gucci, and Andrej Pejic starring in adverts for Marc Jacobs and Gaultier, meanwhile, suggests both acceptance and an awareness of the column inches created by such casting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DondaCreate/status/772441534604140544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">YEEZY SEASON<br>SEASON 4 CASTING <a href=\"https://t.co/HdARavPAZN\">pic.twitter.com/HdARavPAZN</a></p>&mdash; DONDA (@DondaCreate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DondaCreate/status/772441534604140544\">September 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/03/yeezy-to-assemble-ikea-designs-giant-bed-for-kanye-west\">Yeezy to assemble: Ikea designs giant bed for Kanye West</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The racially diverse runway, meanwhile, is currently a norm. Designers like Nasir Mazhar and Balmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing have pushed a diverse agenda on their runways, featuring models such as Damaris Goddrie or Leomie Anderson. In fact, it was jarring when the modernist quake caused by the Vetements show was tempered by the lack of diversity of the models, a thing that its creative director, Demna Gvasalia, seemed to be mindful of in his debut collection for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/jun/22/ikea-chic-and-talking-heads-suits-balenciaga-gets-the-vetements-treatment\"> Balenciaga</a>. It is also speaks to an international economic reality. As Christopher Michael, executive agent at Society Management in New York, told Vogue: \u201cRight now the No 1 driving force is diversity. Brands are looking to global culture.\u201d </p> <p>Surely the main point about West\u2019s casting call to Yeezy hopefuls (a brand with an avant-garde take on athleisure and a haute price tag) was that it was an accurate extension of its brand: woke but also economically driven. </p>",

  "<p>The leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, tuberculosis (TB), is associated with immigration in the UK. There, I\u2019ve said it. Now let\u2019s move on because no Donald Trump-esque wall or Brexiteer is going to keep TB out. Perhaps we should ban all migration?

Not to mention the ethical considerations. In any case, there is currently no effective way to treat the latent form of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). So, to my mind, there really is just one choice \u2013 we must tackle TB on a global scale and that means overseas investment.</p> <p>For those of you that think TB was eradicated long ago, consigned to history with the likes of Edgar Allen Poe, think again.

Where I\u2019m from \u2013 Belfast in Northern Ireland \u2013 peace is intrinsically linked to the cooperation of nationalists and unionists, Protestants and Catholics. It is tied to the idea of a peace process, whereby the Good Friday agreement, a treaty tied to the European convention on human rights, has defined how two opposite sects can live alongside each other in harmony. </p> <p>But this peace is neither universal nor solid, as dissident groups and individuals seek to undermine it daily. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/brexit-northern-irish-politics-border-eu-good-friday-agreement\">potentially catastrophic implications for the peace in Northern Ireland</a>, first for the validity of the peace process itself, and second if there is further separation from the Republic by a physical border. As such, the region\u2019s peace is at risk, as well as its development. </p> <p>If sustainable development is to progress in poverty-stricken countries around the world, peacemaking must play its part. Money diverted to arms, and aid funding used to to repair the damage caused by conflict, takes away from investment in hospitals, schools and young people\u2019s futures. However, it is the attitude that comes with war that is most significant, the placing of personal ambitions and strategies for power over the progression of the lives of your people. In Northern Ireland, rejecting this doctrine has so far enabled the fragile peace to endure. </p> <p>Until this power-hungry perspective changes, NGOs must focus on how to control the cause of the conflict.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Lucy Keown, University of Glasgow, UK</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020d3ae1f019939de72b4df051c7ff7508df4134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020d3ae1f019939de72b4df051c7ff7508df4134/0_438_5303_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family walks past a mural depicting a scene from Bloody Sunday in Londonderry, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, walks past a mural depicting the events of Bloody Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Working collaboratively in conflict zones is vital</h2> <p>Development occurs in conflict.

  "<p>With university fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year, it\u2019s important to make an informed decision about what and where to study. So how can you use a university open day to help you make the right choice? </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to make your choice based on the big picture,\u201d says Verity Law, senior marketing officer for UK recruitment at the University of Northampton. \u201cBefore you even arrive at the open day, get prepared. Note down the things you and your family think are important and split the list up between you all. </p> <p>\u201cMaking sure the course is right is one of the most important uses for an open day. It\u2019s your chance to find out exactly what your course involves, so ask questions about the topics you will study and what the work is like.\u201d </p> <p>David Seaton, head of student recruitment and engagement at the University of Bedfordshire, says: \u201cMake sure you have a good look at the halls. This is where you will be living, so it should form a big part of what you take away from the day. Speak to current students to hear what it is like to study at the university.</p> <p>\u201cThe town or city you are in could be your home for the next three years, so it\u2019s important to go off campus to get a feel for the area. Book a night in a hotel and make a day of it. Bring your family and friends \u2013 the more the merrier!\u201d </p> <p>Mandy Pine, development manager for recruitment and reputation management at Nottingham Trent University says lots of students turn up without a precise idea of what they want to study: \u201cIt is an opportunity for students to see the range of courses available \u2013 including some opportunities they may not have considered before, or even knew existed.</p> <p>\u201cBut, when it comes down to it, most people have a gut reaction to a place. There may be several universities that offer the right course and the right environment but don\u2019t feel right \u2013 so it\u2019s vital to visit and not just rely on information online or in the prospectus. It is always a personal choice.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Open days are usually the first time students get to visit a university campus and it can be a daunting experience knowing which questions to ask \u2013 and who best to approach for answers. </p> <p>\u201cWe generally find that students ask questions linked into three areas \u2013 course, university and location,\u201d says Karen Richardson, head of student recruitment and admissions at Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln.</p> <p>\u201cI always find that students are the best people to put questions to, as they are honest, have no hidden agenda and will tell it like it is. On the other hand, staff are crucial in areas such as accommodation fees, facilities, etc, so it\u2019s good to prepare the questions that are important to you and ask a few different people \u2013 you will get a different perspective depending upon who you speak to.\u201d</p> <p>Susan Kay-Flowers, senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, says students should look to find out what a course involves \u2013 the subjects covered, how many hours a student will be in timetabled teaching and what assessment methods are used. \u201cThese questions are best put to the course tutors, as they will be able to provide specifics,\u201d she says. \u201cStudents should also ask the course tutor about whether they will have an opportunity to take a year out or study abroad.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to questions about accommodation, students should ensure they make time to visit some of the halls provided by the university. \u201cThis way they can get a feel for them first hand and see whether they would be comfortable living in that particular environment,\u201d says Kay-Flowers. \u201cTo get the \u2018inside\u2019 information about what it is like to live there, it\u2019s a good idea to ask students who live or who have lived there before.\u201d</p> <p>Loughborough University school and college liaison manager Kirsty Wilkinson says: \u201cOpen days are an invaluable opportunity to meet and question the course tutors, hear about the different course modules and take a look at the facilities that will be available to you. No two courses are the same and content varies between universities, so it\u2019s important you understand the course content and how it will be taught and assessed. </p> <p>\u201cLook at the whole package offered at the university. What extra-curricular activities can you get involved with? Do you like the accommodation? Where is the university located? Speak to current students and staff and make sure you get all your questions answered. No question is too silly \u2013 it could be the difference between enjoying your university and not.\u201d</p>",

Instead he keeps spreading his distorted point of view, suggesting that he\u2019s completely ignorant or he\u2019s lying.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, in front of the cameras he didn\u2019t have any choice but to recognise Mexico as a commercial partner, and the hard work Mexicans do in the US. Nevertheless, a few hours later, he came out again saying that Mexico would pay for the wall, when our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/donald-trump-former-mexico-president-vincente-fox-im-not-paying-for-wall\" title=\"\">President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto had said otherwise</a>.

And yet he has stooped even lower, using the needs of his followers to validate himself with a speech full of intolerance, racism and fear. There is no way a nation could grow and prosper with no hope, values or responsibilities. History has proved that \u201cleaderships\u201d based on fear and ignorance are doomed to failure.</p> <p>I know that Trump is witnessing his own demise; he\u2019s aware that every poll is against him. In the middle of all this, he chose to come to Mexico so he could stop his ship sinking, in order to return to his own country and push on with his dishonest campaign.</p> <p>Well, even though I\u2019m against walls, I\u2019d gladly build one around Trump, to spare the world from people like him.

  "<p>Like many good ideas, <a href=\"http://www.orderella.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orderella</a> was conceived over a pint. The pub, in London, was very busy. \u201cIt was my turn to get the next round, and I had to wait 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d recalls Dennis Collet, CEO and co-founder of the company. \u201cThat got us thinking, wouldn\u2019t it be nice not to have to go through all that rigmarole to be served?\u201d<br></p> <p>Orderella\u2019s proposition is simple: let your phone do the queuing. Its app (for Android and Apple mobiles) lets consumers order and pay for their drinks without leaving their table, so friends and colleagues can spend more time talking to each other. Users can also pre-order drinks in advance \u2013 from a taxi, for example. \u201cIf you lose half of your evening to queuing, that\u2019s a lot of banter you\u2019re missing,\u201d Collet notes.</p> <p>The lightbulb moment came in 2012. Collet was working at Ernst &amp; Young, as a consultant specialising in mobile payments. \u201cHailo had just started \u2013 you could hail a cab from a few miles away, but in a bar you couldn\u2019t order a drink to come across the room,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Collet and his four co-founders, who have backgrounds in finance, legal and IT, funded the launch themselves, with help from family, friends and business contacts. This paid for initial development of the app, by a German IT agency. </p> <p>Consumers download the Orderella app for free \u2013 70,000 have downloaded it to date \u2013 and more than 10,000 actively use it. In a typical venue offering the facility, 5 to 10% of customers will order their drinks this way, says Collet. There is no surcharge for using it: drinks cost the same as paying cash at the bar.</p> <p>\u201cAt first we charged the venues a commission, and a lot of them were interested in trying the app,\u201d he explains. But not everyone followed through, which meant the company had invested time getting them up and running for nothing. So in 2015, the business switched to a fixed monthly subscription fee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/aug/12/use-logic-emotion-negotiate-entrepreneurs\">'Show me the money!' \u2013\u00a0do you use logic or emotion to negotiate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Orderella covers all the transaction costs. \u201cThis encourages venues to promote the app, because they\u2019re avoiding credit card fees,\u201d explains Collet. Its primary market is bustling city pubs, sports bars, student unions and bars with large outdoor areas. \u201cThe app comes alive where it\u2019s busy or there is a distance to the bar,\u201d Collet says. </p> <p>The real money-spinner for the business is in selling promotions to brands \u2013 for example, drinks companies like Diageo. Other commercial customers include PayPal who can run their own campaigns, perhaps offering a discount to customers who pay through its channel. Together, these commercial partners account for 70% of Orderella\u2019s revenues.</p> <p>Orderella isn\u2019t the first app that aims to put an end to queuing. Kate Nicholls, CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.almr.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers</a> warns that similar apps have failed to crack this market, perhaps due to a lack of take-up by venues, or apps not working as they should in practice. Nicholls says: \u201cTo succeed, apps like this need widespread functionality and reliability. If customers cannot use the app in their favourite bar or are struggling with reliability issues, they will abandon it pretty smartly.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Mann, owner of <a href=\"http://theearlspencer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Earl Spencer</a> in London, was an early adopter of Orderella. However, a family-orientated venue with a constantly changing menu, the pub found it added an extra layer of programming each day and so no longer uses it. Another complicating factor was that the app wasn\u2019t integrated with the till system, so staff had to also enter orders into the till.</p> <p>Mann sees Orderella\u2019s appeal for venues that have fixed menus or just serve drinks. \u201cThey\u2019ve had huge success in some pubs. If I had just a bar I\u2019d be using it for sure, it\u2019s a fantastic idea.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Perkins, head of consumer research at Deloitte, says one challenge for ordering apps is demonstrating that they improve efficiency. Pubs have a bar with staff behind it because this has traditionally been the most efficient way of serving a large volume of customers, says Perkins. </p> <p>However there is a trend towards a more independent and empowered consumer. \u201cWhat we may see with these apps is that traditional pubs or hotels need to adapt and change their environment.\u201d For example, in the future pubs might not have a bar, says Perkins.</p> <p>Collet says venues that use Orderella can process more orders as they handle fewer transactions \u2013 it typically saves staff 90 seconds per order, he says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/15/the-doctor-will-see-you-online-now\">The doctor will see you online now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To date, around 150 venues across the UK and Ireland have come on board, including temporary venues at festivals, banquets and awards events, and corporate VIP locations.</p> <p> The startup has so far raised \u00a32m in market funding in addition to the initial sums from existing contacts.

But with growth has come controversy around the impact of big money.</p> <p>Participants at the three-decade old festival, which is based on an ethos of co-creation and mutual self-reliance, traditionally all pitch in to build the event. It is built around a radical \u201cgifting\u201d culture, where even strangers who wander into a camp are supposed to be served; in turn, they are expected to do the same for others. </p> <p>But as Burning Man has become more popular, it has become seen as an annual fixture for global elites who pay others to build them exclusive camps called \u201cplug and plays\u201d, which allow them to swoop in, turn on and drop out for a few days before returning to corporate life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad676576349e688fe8832ec86a2917f3f0da5b70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad676576349e688fe8832ec86a2917f3f0da5b70/53_0_3394_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants fill the Playa as about 70,000 people from all over the world gather for the Burning Man festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants fill the Playa as about 70,000 people from all over the world gather for the Burning Man festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Urquhart/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White Ocean, co-founded by entrepreneurs Timur Sardarov, the son of a Russian oil magnate, and Oliver Ripley, and involving the trance DJ Paul Oakenfold, is viewed as one such camp, although it provides one of Burning Man\u2019s biggest stages and claims to \u201cfeed hundreds of non-White Ocean burners a day\u201d.</p> <p>In an apparent response to criticism, White Ocean\u2019s Facebook post says: \u201cThis year has been quite the challenge for our camp.

  "<p>Londoners, Labour politicians and left-leaning journalists often blame rich foreigners for high housing prices in the capital. This has provided opportunities for people like Boris Johnson to teasingly suggest that they are being xenophobic and, more importantly, has demonstrated a regrettable readiness to seek easy culprits for complicated problems. A BBC TV report on the combined effects of Brexit and changes in property tax on London\u2019s housing market may give this tendency fresh impetus. But it has also underlined its flaws. </p> <p>In the report, investors from Hong Kong are shown purchasing homes that are still under construction in Zone 4 <a href=\"https://www.barnet.gov.uk/citizen-home/libraries/local-studies-and-archives/pocket-histories/hendon-and-golders-green/colindale-hendon-nw9.html\">Colindale</a>. The fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum has given wealthy global shoppers like them a further incentive to buy future London bricks and mortar \u201coff-plan\u201d, and changes in stamp duty and levies on second homes have made purchasing handfuls of units of half-built suburban housing more profitable than buying fewer of them in Kensington.</p> <p>Outrage! Are those archetypal \u201crich foreign investors\u201d now buying up the suburbs too at the expense of native Brits? Shouldn\u2019t they be stopped? What would happen if they were? \u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d warns one house builder. \u201cBecause in the UK, and in London in particular, they play a very vital role in underpinning every [housing] development.\u201d And those developments include much of the affordable housing supplied for Londoners on low and middle incomes as part of the planning deals struck with boroughs.</p> <p>Here, once again, is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/27/london-luxury-property-versace-aykon-tower-housing-crisis\">uncomfortable truth</a> about the relationship between big foreign money and Londoners on ordinary incomes looking for homes they can afford to rent or buy. It is that in the absence of enough public money, the former have long provided a lot of the cash that pays for the building of the latter. If they stop investing, the provision of \u201caffordable\u201d housing starts getting more difficult. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise: \u201cRed\u201d Ken Livingstone worked it out 15 years ago.<br></p> <p>Another heresy to take on board is that the Honk Kongers featured in the BBC piece have no intention of leaving their new properties empty. \u201cBuy to leave\u201d certainly occurs, but the extent of it is contested and hard to quantify. And why would you simply leave a brand new flat gathering dust when you can profit from letting it? London needs a growing stock of professionally-run new homes for private rent. Should we oppose foreigners supplying it?</p> <p>There\u2019s something quite familiar about all this; something reminiscent of the early days of Mayor Johnson, when the economic downturn kicked in, the credit crunch bit and overall housing supply in London became increasingly dependent on hot money seeking safe havens from abroad. The other recurring theme is its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/27/london-luxury-property-versace-aykon-tower-housing-crisis\">complete absurdity</a> as a mechanism for addressing the UK capital\u2019s housing needs - one of its most fundamental infrastructure problems. The problem is a shortage of alternatives.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s successor, Sadiq Khan, intends to try to alter the housing finance equation in London, believing this will generate better results. His plans include restrictions on off plan sales overseas in the hope of holding down prices and giving Londoners a better chance of buying new housing as it comes on stream. The worry is that fewer homes of every kind will end up getting built, although there have been hints that he might seek to channel more foreign finance into the kinds of housing London most needs more of. </p> <p>Wish him well with such endeavours. But don\u2019t pretend that foreign investors are the cause of every problem or that, like it or not, they aren\u2019t going to remain part of the solution. </p> <p><em>Watch the BBC\u2019s report from Colindale <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-37260267\">here</a>.</em> <br></p>",
  "<p>Think of the words used to describe successful leaders: tough, uncompromising, driven. But these words translate differently when applied to social care. Our interaction with vulnerable people makes the difference, so here\u2019s my list of the top five essential leadership qualities for the sector:</p> <h2><strong>Can-do attitude</strong></h2> <p>Soon after I joined Regard I visited a service and noticed a toilet was not as clean as it should have been. I asked for the kit to clean the loo myself, proceeded to do so, then said: \u201cNow this meets my standards.\u201d Word spread like wildfire. I never needed to do anything like that again.</p> <p>A can-do attitude means you\u2019re prepared to set an example by tackling whatever needs doing, including the less pleasant parts of a job. It\u2019s much more effective than harsh criticism: when your actions communicate to colleagues that you\u2019re in active pursuit of common goals, there\u2019s a huge emotional appeal.</p> <p>This quality can be learned, usually from a colleague whose attitude has motivated you. I\u2019d like to think I set an example that inspires a can-do attitude at Regard \u2013 certainly, my staff work incredibly hard and get on with their jobs in a positive way.</p> <h2><strong>Honesty</strong></h2> <p>This is vital in all walks of life, even when dealing with a negative situation. Ignoring something unfortunate won\u2019t make it go away. Facing a problem makes it easier to deal with: the ostrich mentality just doesn\u2019t work.<br></p> <p>Sometimes I have to go to our board of directors with news they\u2019d rather not hear, but it has to be done \u2013 it\u2019s part of the job.</p> <p>You can\u2019t have integrity without honesty, supported by strong moral principles \u2013 and how could you provide excellent social care without that? Everything needs to be above board. I don\u2019t think honesty can be learned; by adulthood you either value honesty, or you don\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>Decisiveness </strong></h2> <p>In social care, maybe more than most sectors, an indecisive leader is an ineffective leader: even a wrong decision can be better than no decision. If a leader is indecisive, support staff become uncertain themselves, and this creates a difficult working environment. And because the individuals we support are so vulnerable, lack of consistency can cause genuine anguish.</p> <p>Of course decisiveness must be tempered by being well-informed \u2013 fact-finding is crucial \u2013 but those decisions have to be made. In my experience, people either procrastinate or are decisive, not both, but individuals can be trained to be more decisive.</p> <h2><strong>Hardworking </strong></h2> <p>In my day you didn\u2019t need to go to university to get on in the world, and I didn\u2019t go. You could build a successful career by working hard without a degree. But I mean working hard, not just working hard enough.</p> <p>It\u2019s not about being the last one to leave the office, it\u2019s about focus and application. Work-life balance is very important \u2013 outside responsibilities and interests all make demands on our time \u2013 but while you are at work you should be applying yourself wholeheartedly to what you are expected to do.</p> <p>When leaders are hardworking this often rubs off on employees, but a willingness to work hard is probably innate, not learned.</p> <h2><strong>Passion </strong></h2> <p>Having a passion for what you do is especially important in social care because caring is not an easy career. We are surrounded by rules and regulations and face daily challenges that can get you down. But what we do really matters. And if you show you\u2019re passionate about the care you deliver it becomes an addictive thing for your staff.</p> <p>It can manifest itself in small ways. Should an employee come to me with a small request \u2013 say new literature for their reception \u2013 it demonstrates pride in their job. Although it may be a long way down your to-do list, it may be at the top of theirs. It takes courage to approach the boss with such a request, so it\u2019s important not to ignore this kind of initiative. It makes me angry if I\u2019ve passed on a simple request from a junior colleague and it isn\u2019t promptly actioned.</p> <p>The same goes for whistleblowing \u2013 what courage that takes \u2013 and because it\u2019s always a big deal for those concerned, it absolutely demands a leader\u2019s full attention.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been involved in all manner of charity work over the past three decades, which has taught me much that feeds into my approach towards a client base that needs a passionate lead from the top.</p> <p><em>Sandie Foxall-Smith is chief of care provider Regard, one of the UK\u2019s largest organisations supporting people with learning disabilities, mental health needs and acquired brain injury.

Those consequences include one or both of: very severe and costly emission cuts in the mid to-late 2020s; or, repudiation of Australia\u2019s international commitments and free riding on the efforts of the rest of the world. The latter would weaken global momentum for an effective response to climate change and harm the nation diplomatically.</p> </blockquote> <p>What\u2019s more, Hamilton and Karoly have suggested the authority has effectively ignored its previous recommendations based on a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d approach. This \u201cbudget\u201d has suggested Australia must not emit more than 10.1bn tonnes of greenhouse gases between 2013 and 2050.</p> <p>Hamilton and Karoly say that under the CCA\u2019s latest recommendations, more than 90% of that budget will already be used up by the year 2030.<br></p> <p>I spoke to Hamilton and asked why he thought the authority had apparently shifted away from its previous advocacy for more rapid cuts and stricter targets. He wouldn\u2019t comment. <br></p> <p>So was he intending to stay at the authority? He told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re still members and we\u2019re not going anywhere. It has been suggested that we might resign. We are not resigning and we\u2019re there until out five-year terms expire in July next year. We have an important contribution to make within the terms of the authority\u2019s act.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hamilton said he had started to become concerned about the direction of the authority\u2019s latest report \u201ctwo or three months ago\u201d: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I crossed a point where I thought that [the report] goes too far to try to accommodate political circumstances \u2013 or an assessment of the political circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>He told me the CCA was modelled on Britain\u2019s Climate Change Committee and had two key functions \u2013 \u201cexpertise in its advice\u201d and \u201cindependence from government interference or dictation\u201d. He said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that all that an independent authority like the Climate Change Authority can do is to attempt to adhere to that. Of course, no one can be purist and everyone wants their report to have an influence rather than get dusty on shelves, but you can go too far and be too clever by half and second guess the political process.

The Jamaican artist was once the go-to man for dancefloor dynamite, songs that urged us all to \u201cshake that booty non-stop, when the beat drops just keep swinging it\u201d. Get Busy, Gimme The Light, the Beyonc\u00e9-featuring Baby Boy, Breathe with R&amp;B singer Blu Cantrell \u2013 these songs became commonplace, at carnival, in a bougie Chelsea bar or a suburban Oceana club. Back then he was among the world\u2019s pop elite.</p> <p>But while his 2002 album Dutty Rock launched dancehall into the mainstream, musical tastes inevitably moved on. And though Paul himself has been critical of some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/jamaica-music-anti-gay-dancehall-homophobia\">dancehall\u2019s homophobic content</a>, there was outcry over the derogatory lyrics of contemporaries like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/aug/17/advertising.arts\">Beenie Man</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/dec/10/gayrights.popandrock\">Elephant Man</a>.

In 2015, the Grammy award-winning performer left his label and became an independent artist for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>Over the past year, however, dancehall has been dutty wining its way back into the worldwide consciousness. Diplo, long in debt to dancehall\u2019s digital rhythms, brought them to an even wider audience as Major Lazer. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqeW9_5kURI\">Lazer\u2019s track Lean On</a> became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/spotify-most-streamed-track-all-time-major-lazer-lean-on\">most streamed single of all time</a>, albeit one that\u2019s since been given the dubious title of \u201ctropical pop\u201d.

Sean Paul still lives in Jamaica, but we meet in LA because this is where he has come to work on his new album. The surprise success of Cheap Thrills, his recent chart-topper with one-woman pop hit machine Sia\u2013 which not only reacquainted the star with the top of the charts but also landed Sia her first Billboard number one \u2013 has spurred him to finish his new material quickly. As the 43-year-old says himself, no one is better placed to \u201cbring back some authentic dancehall\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYh-n7EOtMA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nYh-n7EOtMA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He is outspoken about the new generation of artists who\u2019ve appropriated the sound of dancehall without acknowledging its roots. \u201cIt is a sore point when people like Drake or Bieber or other artists come and do dancehall-orientated music but don\u2019t credit where dancehall came from and they don\u2019t necessarily understand it,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cA lot of people get upset, they get sour. And I know artists back in Jamaica that don\u2019t like Major Lazer because they think they do the same thing that Drake and Kanye did \u2013 they take and take and don\u2019t credit.\u201d</p> <p>While Paul says he\u2019s a fan of Drake (\u201cI love some of his songs but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the best rapper\u201d) the bashment hooks and patois phrases used in Views From The Six are seen by Paul as less of a homage to dancehall and more of an exploitation. He\u2019s not alone.

One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/popcaan-dance-hall-kingston\">crossover artist Popcaan</a>, for example, who appeared on Views From The Six and has also worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/04/jamie-xx-in-colour-sam-smith-dance-music-snobbery\">Jamie xx</a>, has, according to Billboard, struggled to work in America because of past marijuana-related offences.</p> <p>Sean Paul is equally dismissive of \u201ctropical house\u201d, a music genre which began as a way to describe the soft, Balearic-infused synth of DJs like Kygo but has since been attached to tracks which clearly draw from dancehall. Rolling Stone\u2019s review of Rihanna\u2019s Work described it as \u201ca tropical house-flavored track featuring Drake\u201d while a Wall Street Journal article described how Bieber\u2019s What Do You Mean? was pioneering the \u201cCaribbean, beach-party vibe\u201d of tropical house in the mainstream.

So I want this album to bridge that gap.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past year, he\u2019s penned more than 200 tracks, both on his own and in collaboration with musicians and producers back in Jamaica, and recruited a series of starry producers, such as Blood, who was behind Bieber\u2019s Sorry. There\u2019s a track with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/16/wiz-khalifa-see-you-again-breaks-record-most-spotify-streams\">Wiz Khalifa</a> as well as another with one of this year\u2019s breakthrough pop stars, yet to be announced. It doesn\u2019t sound too far off familiar Sean Paul territory, only with more EDM drops.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s attitude is more one of pragmatism than puritanism when it comes to making sure this album repeats his successes of a decade ago. He\u2019ll seemingly work with anyone who is up for it. \u201cI just worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/27/clean-bandit-new-eyes-exclusive-album-stream\">Clean Bandit</a>, and another English pop group\u2026 what are they called?\u201d There is an awkward pause as he tries to remember. \u201cOh yeah, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/05/little-mix-get-weird-review-no-growing-up-for-candy-coloured-pop-stars\">Little Mix</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The one constant is Paul\u2019s ole purpose to make people dance: he\u2019s the first to admit he makes party music because it was one of the few levellers he had as a child. Growing up in a middle-class suburb in Kingston, Paul was just 13 when his dad was sentenced to 15 years in jail for drugs offences.

  "<p>One of the country\u2019s biggest childcare charities, which provided thousands of low-income families with nursery, after-school clubs and parenting services, has collapsed.</p> <p>4Children, which was the government\u2019s official Early Years strategic partner, went into administration after a rapid corporate expansion fuelled by private loans unravelled in the face of government cuts. </p> <p>Charity leaders blamed the collapse of 4Children, a respected and nationally recognised charity, on an increasingly tight financial environment for charities delivering council-funded services and described it as a a warning sign to ministers about the sustainability of children\u2019s services in a competitive public sector marketplace.</p> <p>Kathy Evans, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.childrenengland.org.uk/\">Children England</a>, which represents children\u2019s charities, said the closure of one of the sector\u2019s biggest names had surprised many. She said: \u201cThe serious financial fragility of the children\u2019s services \u2018marketplace\u2019 is a very real and urgent problem, for large and small organisations alike.\u201d</p> <p>Imelda Redmond, who was brought into 4Children as chief executive just over a year ago, said that although massive financial losses had been brought under control in recent months the board felt the charity was not viable in the long term. \u201cWhen we looked at the horizon it looked too precarious,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The rapid expansion of 4Children was overseen by Redmond\u2019s predecessor, Anne Longfield, who left 18 months ago after being <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-childrens-commissioner-appointed\">appointed children\u2019s commissioner</a> for England by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan.</p> <p>Longfield said in a statement on Friday: \u201cWhen I handed over the reins of 4Children after over 20 years leading it alongside an extraordinarily committed group of trustees, I considered it to be in good shape with a positive future ahead. </p> <p>\u201cTimes are tough for charities though and it\u2019s right that they work together and merge services so that they minimise risk and reduce back office spend in order to provide the best possible support in as cost-effective a way as possible, and I understand their decision to do this.\u201d</p> <p>The closure will come as a blow to the government, which needs a stable childcare market to help deliver its employment and poverty agenda. Ministers have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-parents-benefit-from-30-hours-free-childcare-early\">promised to double free childcare</a> from 15 to 30 hours for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/03/free-childcare-may-leave-nurseries-struggling\">working parents of three- and four-year-olds from 2017</a>. However, critics warn that childcare providers cannot afford to take on the extra demand.</p> <p>Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: \u201cThe collapse of [4Children] should serve as a stark reminder to government of what can happen when childcare providers are no longer able to remain financially sustainable, a challenge facing many \u2013 large and small \u2013 across the country due to a continued lack of adequate funding.\u201d</p> <p>Redmond said the impact of the closure this week was softened by a decision taken four months ago to wind down the charity in an orderly way and arrange for other organisations to take on its contracts, a process overseen by the DfE.</p> <p>As a result, all but three of its 151 different sites had moved into new ownership last week, reducing disruption to families and minimising the number of redundancies. Of 1,068 4Children staff, 46 have lost their jobs as a direct result of the collapse.</p> <p>The charity Action for Children has taken on the bulk of the contracts, which are mainly let by local authorities. Other services have been moved back under council control. </p> <p>However, the news came as a shock to parents, and <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/22288/fundraising_and_contracting_pressures_force_closure_of_4children_with_the_loss_of_85_jobs\">angry messages</a> were left on the charity\u2019s website after families arrived at centres last week to find the doors locked. </p> <p>One parent said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t given my girls a chance to say goodbye, they will never understand why they cannot return to their nursery, a place they felt so happy. In fact, I cannot think of a more disruptive, unsettling and hurtful way you could have done this.\u201d</p> <p>All but one of those services have since found new owners and will reopen from Monday.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE), which had funded 4Children to the tune of over \u00a37m during the past five years, said: \u201cWe are working closely with 4Children and Action for Children to make sure that disruption is minimised for children and families. We are confident that Action for Children will successfully deliver our work with the early years sector, and no public money will be lost as a result of this transition.\u201d</p> <p>Action for Children\u2019s managing director of operations, Carol Iddon, said changes required to sustain the services in future included the possibility of introducing or raising childcare charges. She said that although Action for Children was confident it could make the services viable, there could be no long-term guarantees. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive market, and challenging market, and 4Children were not the only charity facing these kinds of challenges,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The demise of 4Children follows the high-profile closures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/05/kids-company-founder-camila-batmanghelidjh-confirms-charity-closure\">Kids Company</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/leading-adoption-fostering-charity-baaf-closes-economic-problems\">adoption charity BAAF</a> in August 2015.</p> <p>Questions are being asked about the suitability of private finance in a market where council childcare spending has been cut so deeply that charities are unable to make a sufficient financial margin to repay interest on loans, despite ratcheting down costs and wages and making widespread use of zero-hours contracts for staff.</p> <p>4Children embarked on its rapid expansion plan under Longfield in 2011, more than doubling income to \u00a330m within four years after an aggressive pursuit of council contracts. \u201cIt went hell-for-leather. They were not market-averse; they had a capitalist view of how to do business,\u201d one sector insider told the Guardian.</p> <p>In October 2014, it raised \u00a31.7m in loans to fund the plan, including \u00a3700,000 from <a href=\"https://www.bigsocietycapital.com/\">Big Society Capital</a>, the body set up by former prime minister David Cameron to encourage charities delivering public services to adopt a more commercial and business-like approach to capital funding.</p> <p>HSBC bank loaned \u00a31m to 4Children as part of the deal, which was brokered by <a href=\"http://www.thefsegroup.com/\">FSE Group</a>. It was trumpeted at the time as a way of attracting investment into charities normally unable to secure private finance. FSE said the loans would promote \u201ca financially sustainable future for the charity\u201d.</p> <p>4Children declared soon after that it was \u201cnow considered as the pre-eminent children\u2019s charity\u201d. Within months, however, Longfield had left to become children\u2019s commissioner, and the charity admitted in its <a href=\"http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/FinancialHistory.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=288285&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0\">annual accounts</a> for the year to the end of March 2015, that its financial performance was \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d. </p> <p>It had run up a \u00a33m loss on income of \u00a330m, and drained its financial reserves. \u201cEconomic conditions continue to be difficult and we have not responded as well as we would have liked to that environment, particularly in not making the savings required in delivering and supporting our services,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Cliff Prior, chief executive of Big Society Capital, said: \u201cSince 2012, Big Society Capital has made 50 investments, working with our fund managers and co-investors to bring more than \u00a3270m to over 300 charities and social enterprises. Unfortunately, not all of these organisations are successful. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe always explore how we can learn from failures and we are working to develop principles of best practice with our fund managers and co-investors.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Six hundred \u201cgreen mosques\u201d are to be created in Morocco by March 2019 in a national consciousness-raising initiative that aims to speed the country\u2019s journey to clean energy.<br></p> <p>If all goes to plan, the green revamp will see LED lighting, solar thermal water heaters and photovoltaic systems installed in 100 mosques by the end of this year.</p> <p>Morocco\u2019s ministry of Islamic affairs is underwriting <a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/32825.html\">the innovative scheme</a>, paying up to 70% of the initial investment costs in a partnership with the German government.</p> <p>Jan-Christophe Kuntze, the project\u2019s chief, said: \u201cWe want to raise awareness and mosques are important centres of social life in Morocco. They are a place where people exchange views about all kinds of issues including, hopefully, why renewables and energy efficiency might be a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>Morocco has established itself as a regional climate leader with high-profile projects, ranging from <a href=\"http://www.sunwindenergy.com/news/africas-largest-wind-farm\">the largest windfarm in Africa</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project\">an enormous solar power plant in the Sahara desert</a>, which opened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/morocco-to-switch-on-first-phase-of-worlds-largest-solar-plant\">earlier this year</a>.<br></p> <p>In November, <a href=\"http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/unfccc-cop-22\">Marrakech will host the COP22 climate summit</a> to discuss preparations for implementing the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>The country\u2019s environment minister, Hakima el-Hait\u00e9, told the Guardian that religion could make a powerful contribution to the clean energy debate, shortly before an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/islamic-leaders-issue-bold-call-rapid-phase-out-fossil-fuels\">Islamic declaration on climate change</a> last year.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very important for Muslim countries to come back to their traditions and remind people that we are miniscule as humans before the importance of the earth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to protect it, and to save humankind in the process.\u201d</p> <p>The new green mosques project plans to do this with established technologies that can be adapted to public buildings and residential homes. By training electricians, technicians and auditors, it hopes to direct Morocco\u2019s clean energy along the path followed by German\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://energytransition.de/\">Energiewende</a>,</em><em> </em>(energy transition).</p> <p>But Kuntze stressed that Germany was offering technological support, rather than financial opportunities for its own industries.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not representing any German business interests at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good thing about this project is that the Moroccan government came up with the idea themselves. It is something new and really innovative and it has not been tried anywhere else before, to my knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>The initiative has broken new ground for gender equality in Morocco too. Many <em>mourchidates</em> (female clerics) have been involved in the project, as well as imams, and about a quarter of the participants in recent seminars have been women, Kuntze said. </p> <p>Under the project\u2019s energy service contract model, contractors will eventually be paid by the energy savings generated from the clean power systems they install. As the renovations should cut the mosques\u2019 electricity usage by 40%, these should be substantial.</p> <p>The first 100 mosques to get a green makeover are mostly based in big population centres \u2013 such as Rabat, Fez, Marrakech and Casablanca \u2013 but the project will quickly move on to smaller villages and towns. With 15,000 mosques dotted around the north African country, the idea\u2019s growth potential is clear.</p> <p>The objective was to kickstart a renovations industry for sustainable companies that could employ many Moroccans in the clean energy sector, Kuntze said.</p>",

  "<p>The past few years have been a grim time for savers. After the Bank of England cut its base rate last month to a record low, anyone hoping to earn from their funds will be forgiven for uttering a sigh of desperation.</p> <p>Among the most notable casualties have been cash Isas, with the average rate paid standing at just 0.99%, and potentially more gloomy news ahead. \u201cSavers should brace themselves for more cuts to come,\u201d says Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts. Last week, NatWest became the latest bank to slash rates: its cash Isa now pays just 0.01%. But amid the gloom some solace for savers can be found at Principality Building Society, which pays online savers 1.1% on \u00a31 and above.</p> <p>However, for those who want to try and make their savings work harder there are alternatives \u2013 but with greater returns comes greater risk.</p> <p><strong>Premium bonds</strong></p> <p>Around 23 million Britons hold almost \u00a350bn in Premium bonds, lured by the prospect of winning between \u00a325 and \u00a31m in the monthly prize draw. Each bond costs \u00a31, with a minimum investment of \u00a3100 and maximum of \u00a350,000. Your money is 100% secure and all prizes are free of tax.</p> <p>Justin Modray at Candid Financial Advice says this is a safe way of having a flutter, and today\u2019s average prize rate of 1.25% looks reasonable. But he adds: \u201cDon\u2019t put too much faith in striking it rich. If you do win a prize, 93 times out of 100 it will be just \u00a325.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 2/10</strong> Bonds pay no interest and you may never win anything.</p> <p><strong>High-interest current accounts</strong></p> <p>In a strange twist, many current accounts now pay up to 5%, far higher than cash Isas and savings accounts. Santander 123 pays 3% on balances between \u00a33,000 and \u00a320,000, but this will fall to 1.5% on 1 November.</p> <p>\u201cIt still offers cashback on your everyday spending, but you can get better interest rates elsewhere,\u201d says Anna Bowes at rate tracking service <a href=\"https://savingschampion.co.uk\">SavingsChampion.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Nationwide FlexDirect pays 5% for 12 months on the first \u00a32,500, but you must pay in at least \u00a31,000 each month. TSB Classic Plus also pays 5% on up to \u00a32,000 if you pay in \u00a3500 each month.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 1/10</strong> Your cash is safe, but only a small amount attracts interest.</p> <p><strong>Peer-to-peer</strong></p> <p>Science writer Hazel Muir, 49, has invested in cash Isas since their launch but now gets more than double the return by lending money through peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms.</p> <p>Muir, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, gets up to 4.8% from <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=P2P+ratesetter.co.uk&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=z1XJV6z9C4T98wf1zraIDQ\">P2P ratesetter.co.uk</a>.\u201cP2P rates have also fallen, until recently you could get 6%,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Online-only P2P platforms work by taking money from savers and lending it to vetted borrowers.

It has also performed over the past 12 months, rising 45% against just 0.4% on cash.\u201d</p> <p>However, this supposed safe haven can be volatile; its price dropped 25% in 2013. It also pays no income, you incur trading costs and it has to be stored securely.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 7/10</strong> Gold has dazzled but could be vulnerable at current high prices.</p> <p><strong>Fine wine</strong></p> <p>Fine wines are one investment you can drink to. Industry index the Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 is up 10.7% over the past year, though it trades 22% lower than five years ago.</p> <p>Simon Staples, sales director, fine wine, at merchants Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, says around \u00a310,000 is needed to start. He recommends sticking to Old World wines, typically Bordeaux, Burgundy and champagne, but says they must be stored carefully, ideally in a humidity- and temperature-controlled warehouse. If it does not perform financially at least you can drink your losses.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 8/10</strong> Beginners really have to know what they are buying.</p> <p><strong>Venture capital trusts</strong></p> <p>High-risk venture capital trusts offer tax breaks to incentivise people to invest in smaller, growing companies. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says you get 30% income tax relief for subscribing to new fund raisings. You can invest up to \u00a3200,000 each tax year, though you cannot save more income tax than you actually pay. Most returns are paid as tax-free dividends during the life of the VCT, Khalaf says. You can start with as little as \u00a33,000 and should hold it for at least 10 years. \u201cIf you sell in the first five years you must repay any tax relief,\u201d Khalaf says.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 9/10</strong> High risk but the tax breaks make it worthwhile for some.</p> <p><strong>Spread betting</strong></p> <p>Instead of 1%-2% a year from cash, you could earn 5%-10% in a day from spread betting \u2013 or lose the lot. Josh Mahoney, market analyst at IG, says spread betting involves speculating on the price movement of a stock, index, commodity or currency without buying the asset itself. This allows you to speculate on the outcome of a major political event \u2013 such as the impact of Brexit on sterling or the oil price during an Opec meeting. Such betting is classified as gambling so there\u2019s no stamp duty or capital gains tax on winnings.

  "<p>Sun, sea and sand might be among Australia\u2019s finest selling points but this combination comes at a cost, given the country is also the <a href=\"http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/the-australian-continent\" rel=\"nofollow\">driest inhabited continent in the world</a>.</p> <p>With a drop in average annual rainfall in recent years, ominous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/31/climate-change-making-droughts-in-australia-worse-as-rain-patterns-shift\">climate change projections</a> and an ever-increasing population, the federal government has begun releasing <a href=\"http://minister.agriculture.gov.au/joyce/Pages/Media-Releases/budget-dams-2016.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">billions of dollars in funding</a> to help realise the water infrastructure required to support the growth of regional economies.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the government looking to optimise and conserve water use and make more resilient cities.

Another approach goes beyond self-sufficiency in terms of water use, aiming for net positive water.</p> <p> The concept of being truly net positive water is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/net-positive-feasible-water\">contentious</a>, but Veolia\u2019s regional energy manager and project manager, Matthew Lee, explains it as \u201cexporting more treated water from a site than the amount of potable water taken in\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/01/what-happens-to-olympic-venues-after-the-closing-ceremony\">What happens to Olympic venues after the closing ceremony?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lee is working to make <a href=\"http://www.lendlease.com/projects/barangaroo-south/?id=b7d8e348-d6fa-45f3-be0e-e502b5aba8a7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lendlease\u2019s Barangaroo South</a> development in Sydney (consisting of three main commercial towers, three 10-storey residential buildings, and several multi-use buildings) net positive water. This is part of the property group\u2019s ambitions to make the project the country\u2019s first large-scale carbon neutral community. The project is also committed to the C40 Cities-Clinton Climate Initiative\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.c40.org/networks/climate-positive-development-program\" rel=\"nofollow\">Climate Positive Development Program</a>.</p> <p>The managing director for Barangaroo South at Lendlease, Andrew Wilson, describes the project as a \u201cpetri dish to test ideas that will help define the future of the build environment \u2026 and ensure we leave a positive legacy for the community\u201d.</p> <p>But how do you actually create more water? In the case of Barangaroo, all water used and produced on the site will be recycled; the usual greywater and blackwater will be captured from toilets, showers, laundries, waste rooms and restaurants, while additional water will be pulled from rainwater harvesting, cooling tower backwash, and \u2013 during times of low load (i.e. night time) \u2013 from water mined from Sydney Water\u2019s sewer main. </p> <p>Lendlease expects that up to 500,000 litres of potable water a day will be used at Barangaroo South once it is completed, with the recycling plant producing up to 1m litres of recycled water a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a4ba9473d64a743c6b3acdfef22b6d06a054b88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a4ba9473d64a743c6b3acdfef22b6d06a054b88/0_184_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barangaroo South\u2019s basement cooling plant operations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barangaroo South\u2019s basement cooling plant operations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Moment It Clicks Pty Ltd/Lendlease</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee explains: \u201cThere\u2019s a common basement area running under the development and the recycling water plant is housed in there. The technology used there isn\u2019t anything new. It\u2019s your usual water recycling steps: screening and filtering; biological processing; membrane processing; UV sterilisation; and chlorination \u2013 but it\u2019s putting it all together and co-ordinating it with the water capture of mains water, interconnections with the trade waste and sewer, and connecting up the recycled water mains to export that is the new and more complex part.\u201d</p> <p>Now in the commissioning phase, the water treatment plant is expected to be operational in October 2016. However, although the plant will begin recycling and producing recycled water for use on site immediately, it cannot become net positive water until customers commit to take on the treated water too.</p> <p>Lee says: \u201cThe connection between the precinct and the outside is done, but it\u2019s not connected up to anything yet. What we need are external customers to want to use the water.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/23/uber-for-couriers-australian-logistics-software-promises-to-minimise-traffic-and-emissions\">Uber for couriers: Australian logistics software promises to minimise traffic and emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although there are no agreements in place yet, the City of Sydney is helping to promote the use of recycled water by building a ring main that can connect businesses to Lendlease\u2019s recycled water system. There are also plans to export recycled water to new buildings nearby, such as the Crown Sydney Hotel Resort and One Sydney Harbour, due for completion in 2021.</p> <p>If no one signs up to use the recycled water, the development will not be net positive water but \u201cnet positive water ready\u201d \u2013 as is the case with several other developments in Australia, such as <a href=\"http://www.centralparksydney.com/explore/a-sustainable-habitat\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flow System\u2019s water recycling plant</a> in Sydney\u2019s Central Park. The precinct will continue to use the recycled water on site.</p> <p>But Lee believes this is unlikely. \u201cThis is not some crazy idea that won\u2019t happen. When you recycle water to the level we are, it\u2019s attractive to use in things like commercial cooling towers, because it has a lower salinity level than potable water and doesn\u2019t need to be refreshed as often [thereby reducing corrosion]. So we think there is a good market there for our recycled water.\u201d</p> <p>He says this type of net positive water project is \u201cvery transferable and scalable\u201d, but concedes there are several barriers that may deter less sustainably-minded businesses from taking on such a scheme.</p> <p>\u201cBuilding a water treatment plant is a significant cost \u2026 more than $10m for a plant of our size,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a large precinct looking for that carbon neutral/net positive water/sustainability tag, there\u2019s little incentive to do it. It\u2019s not necessarily going to make a development more profitable, because there aren\u2019t any financial incentives or rebates from government to do so [there are currently no national water efficiency measures for commercial buildings], and the cost of potable water is still relatively inexpensive.</p> <p>\u201cIn order for net positive water to become the norm, we have to stop undervaluing water. If the price of potable water was more, and government provided incentives to be net positive water, it would start to drive the economics of doing this.\u201d</p>",
