  "<p>The first two answers are \u201cshort people lifting enormous weights over their heads\u201d and \u201cKitty Chiller\u201d. The questions that prompt them are \u201cWhat do you want to see more of in Seven\u2019s Australian Olympic coverage?\u201d and, well, \u201cWhat do you want to see <em>less</em> of in Seven\u2019s Australian Olympic coverage?\u201d In those respects at least, the host network has so far triumphed.</p> <p>But first to matters of practicality and scorn. Unlike the London Games four years ago, this time Australians are not able to indulge in the multi-channel splendour of Foxtel\u2019s supplementary coverage, with rights holders Seven maintaining exclusivity to spread the action (at least in theory) over three digital channels of their own. In what must have seemed a straightforward exercise at planning stage, they augmented the old-fashioned TV coverage with a loudly-trumpeted, once-off-payment <a href=\"https://mumbrella.com.au/seven-blames-rio-olympic-app-failure-386350\">$20 streaming app that has promptly cacked itself</a> for most of the first week of competition, leaving significant numbers of Australians stranded without coverage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/australias-emma-mckeon-claims-bronze-as-alicia-coutts-signs-off-olympic-career\">Australia's Emma McKeon claims bronze as Alicia Coutts signs off Olympic career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The people, unsurprisingly, are not happy, and have descended on the reviews sections of the GooglePlay and iTunes stores with the type of icy vengeance normally seen from Russian judges in the gymnastics arena. If they could have seen or heard it, neither would they have been impressed by the apology offered early in the piece by Seven host Jim Wilson, who prefaced the network\u2019s mea culpa with a head-wobbling boast about their booming TV viewership figures \u2013 like a fish \u2018n chip shop proprietor regaling you with an account of his daily takings instead handing over the dinner you just paid for.</p> <p>Instead, huge swathes of the population have swapped glorious Olympic action for the sight of their own crumpled, rage-filled faces reflecting back at them from blank iPad screens. At that angle, not even Gisele B\u00fcndchen can avoid self-loathing. In lieu of a solution, by Tuesday Seven\u2019s Basil Zempilas doubled down on the bragging and claimed the digital venture had been \u201cdownloaded in record numbers,\u201d which was both ill-advised and about as plausible as the IOC-generated myth that three billion people watch the opening ceremony.</p> <p>On that topic, there was something drily amusing about<strong> </strong>Fernando Meirelles producing the kind of prolonged, advertiser-spooking global warming rant against which commercial networks would normally recoil. The less said about Zempilas, Bruce McAvaney and Johanna Griggs\u2019 recitation of the Brazilian tourist board script the better. Might they have gently queried the host nation\u2019s occasionally selective interpretation of history, from which the Wright brothers, for one, were entirely wiped?</p> <p>The other sin for which Seven has so far copped a not-unjustified pasting is in continuing to provide their standard overgenerous helpings of breakfast show Sunrise. It grinds on uninterrupted even as live sport takes place elsewhere in Rio. But far more fuss should be made of the ludicrous situation on weekdays between 5pm and 7pm, when Seven\u2019s three channels are quite astonishingly an Olympics-free zone, what with all those episodes of American Pickers, Pawn Stars and 60 Minute Makeover to broadcast. Such disdain for viewers is puzzling given the vast amounts of lucre involved in securing Olympic rights in the first place. There is no Olympic flag where TV executives live. They\u2019re lodged in a different planetary realm.</p> <p>All these logistical farces are a bit of a shame. When it\u2019s actually been available for viewing, the content itself hasn\u2019t been too bad, if hampered by the usual giant splashes of jingoistic swill (can we rule out unhinged patriotism in the mysterious case of the diving pool turning green?). The pillar of the operation is In Rio Today, the network\u2019s two-hour nightly studio highlights recap. In that, Hamish McLachlan is doing his usual snappy job wandering around a circular podium as a dizzying series of graphics swirl around him. The only shame is that these visual aids often contain dot points of the lines he\u2019s about to read out on cue, rather than something useful like a medal tally or a schedule of upcoming events. It also makes McLachlan look like he\u2019s performing the world\u2019s least essential TED Talk. As with hosts using touch screens, this is another in the long line of needless scourges we must tolerate in modern sports broadcasting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e5ecb203533b3cad2cb0e2f65714fb9edae3031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5ecb203533b3cad2cb0e2f65714fb9edae3031/0_78_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rugby sevens players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s women\u2019s Rugby Sevens gold medalists have emerged as stars of Seven\u2019s television coverage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seven\u2019s other hosts are a mixed bag, though as long as the big events are actually being shown live we could probably put up with Warwick Capper and an animatronic kangaroo back in the studio. You don\u2019t have to have been an athlete to describe them, of course, but it seems to have helped<strong> </strong>Jim Wilson\u2019s<strong> </strong>career that he at least <em>sounds</em> like one, and an Oss-straylee-unn at that. \u201cWe can catch our breath now,\u201d Wilson said at one point as he read out a series of tweets sent on behalf of Michael Phelps\u2019 infant child. It must be exhausting. Much more broadcasterly, ironically, is the work of former jocks Griggs<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Todd Woodbridge,<strong> </strong>while other hosts such Kylie Gillies and Mel McLaughlin have been solid contributors too . </p> <p>That\u2019s mostly left Mr Olympics Bruce McAvaney to cool his jets until the athletics events commence, perhaps a good thing while he\u2019s comparing Phelps to Sir Donald Bradman. The sight of McAvaney wearing a gaudy polo shirt was also slightly disconcerting. Wasn\u2019t he born in a network blazer and tie?</p> <p>As for the actual commentary, unfairly maligned Zempilas and his analyst Giaan Rooney<strong> </strong>have been, periodic abandonment of impartiality aside, a decent combo in the swimming. Zempilas has mostly resisted the verbose Norman Mayisms of some predecessors and Rooney sounds a hell of a lot happier talking about swimmers lapping up and down a pool very quickly than in other TV roles she\u2019s filled. Funny that. The only time Zempilas truly grates is when he overreaches in search of gravitas. \u201cThere\u2019s the record book, then there\u2019s the Michael Phelps book!\u201d he bellowed as the American won the 200m butterfly gold. Not one we\u2019d read, Baz.</p> <p>Undoubtedly helped by the compelling performance of the Australian women\u2019s team, Mark Braybrook has been a clear and concise caller of the Rugby Sevens, a compelling spectacle that has revealed itself as ripe for further televisual exploitation, especially with characters as genuinely appealing as Sharni Williams, Charlotte Caslick and Ellia Green. Australia claimed medals in trap shooting and archery too but for all the combined skill and vague sense of danger in those events, in TV terms you suspect they\u2019d be out-rated by surveillance footage from a golf driving range.</p> <p>Of the other expert callers, Debbie Watson has been our favourite for explaining the myriad tactical permutations of water polo, which, with no disrespect intended to our glorious Olympians, otherwise appears an entirely lawless game of poison ball played by swimming team delinquents. Over at the equestrian, Martin Gostelow was to our inexpert ears absolutely perfect for his role, in that he sounds like a man who also plays royal tennis and applies his shaving cream with a badger-hair brush.</p> <p>The support cast have been energetic enough too. Given the plum job of sideline interviewer at the pool, perma-ecstatic Nathan Templeton peaked early in the role of official specs-holder for golden boy Mack Horton, but crashed back to earth on day two when he misread Emma McKeon\u2019s failure to win a medal in the 100m butterfly final as a moment of mild jubilation and not, as was actually the case, a personal nightmare of tearful proportions. As the awkwardness dawned upon Templeton and he deftly retreated, you wanted to hug both of them. Fortunately they were reunited in happier circumstances when McKeon claimed bronze on Wednesday. It\u2019s a long haul, the swimming.</p> <p>The other podium effort so far has come from Seven\u2019s roving news reporter Chris Reason, who doggedly pursued Chinese hero Sun Yang in the wake of his headline-grabbing imbroglio with Horton. Reason\u2019s sustained prodding was rewarded when the swim star eventually stopped in his tracks and snapped: \u201cI don\u2019t know, what is Horton?\u201d There are many ways to avenge a loss but denying your opponent\u2019s very existence is certainly a novel gambit.</p> <p>When assessing their various disasters so far, maybe Seven management can look to the Aussies in action for inspiration. Speaking of one mishap by the women\u2019s synchronised diving pair, who couldn\u2019t always nail the seemingly fundamental requirement of landing in the water at the same time, analyst Loudy Wiggins cheerfully suggested: \u201cthe judges won\u2019t see that.\u201d They <em>did</em>, of course, but the Aussies still took out bronze regardless. For now the broadcasters themselves remain out of medal contention, but not without hope.</p>",

The early groups of asylum seekers who arrived on Nauru came under Australia\u2019s previous Labor government. Although the government\u2019s policy had hardened against the prospects of resettlement in Australia, many still hoped they could find a way there.<br></p> <p>These hopes began to dim. The children, particularly, began to try to fit into life on Nauru. Teachers were brought to the island, mostly from Australia, and a school was set up within the detention centre to give them lessons.</p> <p>\u201cThey were welcoming, they were keen to learn and also they were very tolerant of each other,\u201d Davies said.<br></p> <p>At the primary school, Rose said, she usually had 95% attendance. \u201cThey want to learn, they\u2019re very passionate about education.\u201d<br></p> <p>They would draw in classes, play football. But the days were monotonous. Processing their asylum claims was slow, and the Australian government\u2019s increasingly tough policy began to weigh heavily on the asylum seekers.<br></p> <p>Living there was difficult, particularly for the children. Entire families would live in a single canvas tent. For teenages, the lack of privacy made it hard for them to develop naturally. \u201cThey were under surveillance constantly,\u201d Reen said.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was so upset at that moment, and I was nervous so I drunk cleaning liquid</p> <footer> <cite>Five-year-old boy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat feeling that the children had that they were criminals, because they were escorted everywhere \u2026 they were wanded in, wanded out; their bags were checked,\u201d she said, referring to the guards\u2019 use of metal detectors.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are no private moments in the camp, so that\u2019s really difficult for teenagers. They\u2019re at a stage of development where they need to express themselves, and grow into their personality.\u201d<br></p> <p>And as the length of their detention increased, so too did rates of self-harm and other of other serious incidents. The Nauru files show a steady increase in the number of critical incidents as time in detention increased.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about exposure,\u201d Reen said. \u201cEven the children who weren\u2019t directly affected by assaults themselves they were constantly exposed to incidents and to adults who were experiencing psychiatric disorders as a result of their prolonged incarceration.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd the children always knew that \u2013 and they were just living on a knife\u2019s edge all the time.\u201d<br></p> <h2>School shut down</h2> <p>Weeks after the Australian immigration department announced it was shutting down the school, officials interrupted one class so they could measure it for use as an office.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1012f08d0539d29d7c7b5cd79b7a497a6f78fec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1012f08d0539d29d7c7b5cd79b7a497a6f78fec9/0_362_1075_1153/932.jpg\" alt=\"An asylum seeker holds a letter asking for the school to remain open\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An asylum seeker holds a letter asking for the school to remain open</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teachers all pointed to the closure of the Australian-run school as one of the lowest points for children at the detention centre. The immigration department made the decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/31/asylum-seeker-children-start-campaign-to-save-their-nauru-school-from-closure\">to shut the school</a> in March 2015. From September, the children would be funnelled into Nauruan schools. All asylum seekers aged between seven and 17 were to attend local schools, while children under seven would stay at the detention centre.<br></p> <p>School was more than a place of learning for the asylum seekers on the island, the teachers said. It was also a place they could be safe in what was becoming a more volatile environment. The Nauru files show that the pace and frequency of serious incidents at the detention centre steadily increased between 2013 and 2015.</p> <p>Children would sometimes just curl up in a beanbag in a corner, Davies said. \u201cThey were safe there without any possibility of being hurt,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe one last thing left in their life was the school.

After years of \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d the ABS was holding itself together with duct tape and prayers.</p> <p>The census in 2011 cost $440m, so for an agency under severe budget constraint, stopping a half a billion dollar exercise is not just one way to save money, but given the importance of the census, is also a good way to make the issue of ABS funding very public.</p> <p>And it worked \u2013 in <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/bp2/html/bp2_expense-21.htm\">the 2015 budget</a> the government included $234.7m in funding over five years to the ABS.</p> <p>But it was too late to help this year\u2019s census and too late to undo what has been a long running and bipartisan approach.</p> <p>The ALP under Kevin Rudd in 2008 cut funding to the ABS along with other government agencies as part of its \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d. As a result the ABS cut the job vacancy survey.</p> <p>It meant they cut the survey in August 2008 just as the global financial crisis was about to hit, and thus at the precise moment the figures would have been most useful, given job vacancies are a leading indicator of employment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qBkyt/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other funding cuts meant the ABS had to find savings elsewhere. </p> <p>One saving was in the labour force figures.

Perhaps the only survey the ABS does which is more high profile is the census, and this time round we have a similar result.</p> <p>Due to abject failure to consult openly about its proposed changes of the holding of people\u2019s names, and an utter inability to explain the reasons for those changes, a mistrust of the census began to arise.</p> <p>Now mistrust of the census is almost an Australian tradition, but this time round there was little heed of what were legitimate (if, in my view, overstated) concerns. </p> <p>While the ABS itself was shown to be incapable of adequately responding, so too was the government. From December 2014 to September 2015 Kelly O\u2019Dwyer had oversight of the ABS. In her time on the front bench, O\u2019Dwyer has not exactly met expectations. Her abilities, shall we say, seemed much more sparkling when they were not being used while she sat on the backbench, but she did at least secure that extra funding for the ABS. Prior to the election, Alex Hawke had carriage.</p> <p>But after the election, the prime minister also showed a complete disregard of the census. It wasn\u2019t until Wednesday last week that it was clear that Michael McCormack was the minister responsible \u2013 less than a week before the census.</p> <p>And even worse, his attempts to assuage public fears were pathetic.</p> <p>He suggested that worries about <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/minister-says-census-no-worse-than-facebook-as-nick-xenophon-risks-jail-20160808-gqnobg.html\">the privacy fears</a> about the census were not a big deal given the people worried were also using Facebook. Such a statement indicates that McCormack is woefully out of his depth and totally unqualified to handle this responsibility. His attempts this morning to suggests the DDoS attack was not an attack because the attack didn\u2019t succeed, even though it did, does nothing to allay fears that our government is run by fools.</p> <p>But really when you get down to it, the failure of the census on Tuesday night is not just about poor risk management, poor government oversight, poor administration; rather it is as the ABS\u2019s head, David Kalisch suggested part of a \u201cconfluence of events\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/the-census-farce-is-reminiscent-of-wile-e-coyote-running-off-a-cliff-in-pursuit-of-road-runner\">The census farce is reminiscent of Wile E Coyote running off a cliff in pursuit of Road Runner | Dan Nolan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that confluence of events is not about DDoS attacks and the failure of a router (god help us, really?) but of a generation of thinking that the public sector can be cut every year and somehow continue to fulfil all its functions. It is the culmination of thinking that paying fewer people to do the same work and to put off spending to upgrade IT systems to \u201csave money\u201d is good budgeting.</p> <p>It is part of the belief that a generation of privatising and outsourcing work to the private sector does not have institutional impacts on talent and quality of service in the public sector.</p> <p>The ABS does work that for the most part could not be done with the same level of trust by the private sector. Yes the funding cuts and \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d have helped save some money over the past few years, but the cost to the reputation of the ABS from this bungle is enormous.</p> <p>And the ABS, above all, relies on its reputation.</p> <p>There will no doubt be the desire to call for someone to be sacked due to this failure \u2013 and rightly so.

  "<p>Robert Wright (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/lancastrians-will-never-surrender-their-territory\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 6 August) may well lament the loss of Lancastrian acres to the Yorkshire Dales national park. However, this is but a \u201cpaper loss\u201d. Far more grievous to those from the Broad Acres were the huge political losses of 1974, when Mickle Fell, Sedbergh, Dent and Saddleworth were lost to Cumbria and \u201cGreater Manchester\u201d; though Westmoreland also disappeared and Cumbria swallowed Barrow and Coniston. Perhaps it would be some compensation if the historic boundaries were displayed on roadsides (as still exists on the M62), then we could rejoice in Coniston, Lancashire and Sedbergh, West Riding of Yorkshire.<br><strong>Granville Heptonstall</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 What has Lancashire done to deserve this? Well, I will tell you. In 1974 Lancashire seized Barnoldswick from the West Riding and made it part of Pendle. This was akin to the recent annexation of the Crimea by Russia and the inhabitants of Barlick are still hurting. The amalgamation of the huge area surrounding the Howgills into the Dales national park is a small price for Lancashire to pay 42 years after that dastardly act. The good people of Barnoldswick will take some comfort from the acquisition but still long to return to Yorkshire, or so my partner asserts, having lived there for 30 years.<br><strong>David Handley</strong><br><em>Gargrave, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Present day \u201cadministrative\u201d Lancashire is but a shadow of its former self. From the summit of the Old Man, looking south the length of Coniston Water, over the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas, from Walney to Warrington, Liverpool and Manchester, all would have been within the county. The Forest of Bowland is but a welcome consolation prize for the litany of lost lands that once&#xa0;were Lancashire.<br><strong>Austen Lynch</strong><br><em>Garstang, Lancashire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Green (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/yorkshires-owed-a-bit-of-lancashire-so-stop-complaining\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 9 August) missed the biggest disadvantage of towns such as Barnoldswick being transferred to Lancashire from Yorkshire in 1974.

Landlords, tenants? If it\u2019s to cover the inevitable drop in house values, it\u2019s not enough. If it applies to tenants, can I move into an affected area, take the money, then move on or will there be a length of residency requirement? Will each adult in a household get the payment or will it only apply to council tax payers? For those worried about future environmental issues, can they get extra if they have children? Will sick and disabled residents with less chance of moving away from the area be given priority when the timescale is worked out? What will be the radius of the area attracting payment? Will the scheme be extended to those living near proposed telecom base stations, nuclear power plants etc? Will beneficiaries be obliged to sign an undertaking that they will never take any legal action against the government or fracking companies relating to future pollution problems or other detrimental impacts? Given that we apparently don\u2019t have enough civil servants to cope with Brexit negotiations, will the assessments be farmed out to an Atos-type organisation? If so, is this another scheme designed to transfer public money to private companies?<br><strong>Karen Barratt</strong><br><em>Winchester, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rather than compensating communities for fracking, it would be perverse if individual households who might be completely oblivious about fracking over a mile underneath their property were compensated, unlike those living alongside local back roads who could suffer serious disturbance. Local highways budgets are tightly stretched enough without proposals with little idea of the impact on different transport corridors depending on the subsurface geology, which in some cases has not been properly mapped since the 1880s.</p> <p>A prime example is Holderness in East Yorkshire, recently covered by an Environment Agency-commissioned British Geological Survey report to gain a better understanding of shallow groundwater movements and flood risk without fresh 1:10,000 geological mapping. Based on random borehole data, the composite geological map shows hitherto unmapped superficial deposits, including gravel in Beverly adjacent to some chalk rather than glacial till still shown on the bowdlerized online Geology of Britain viewer, which promptly contracts itself when you pick though the borehole records.</p> <p>There is a wealth of difference between 21st century scientific methods and hand watercoloured Victorian geological maps. And yet in its wisdom the BGS has ended systematic geological mapping, without which it is impossible to maintain enough staff with a detailed knowledge of regional ground conditions with which to advise the public and local planners. It would probably only cost around \u00a350m to complete the third of Britain without high quality coverage compared to potentially squandering a \u00a31bn compensating the wrong people.<br><strong>David Nowell (Fellow of the Geological Society)</strong><br><em>New Barnet, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></em></strong></p> <p>\u2022 The final letter was amended on 11 August 2016 to add a missing million on the figure of \u00a350m.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump does have an economic policy, it seems. But if you\u2019re trying to find any hint of ideological coherence in the odd mish-mash of positions that the GOP presidential candidate laid out in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">nearly hour-long speech in Detroit on Monday</a>, your quest will be in vain.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech was meant to put his campaign back on track and it did \u2013 briefly, before he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">derailed it again</a> with his suggestion that gun-supporters might take aim at Hillary Clinton, so to speak. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">Trump's economic plan: no 'death tax', less business tax, and fewer regulations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To many voters, he is stronger on the economy than rival Hillary Clinton, who will speak on the issue Thursday. But while the speech clarified some details of his plans, it also showcased their many faults and their favoring, for this supposedly populist candidate, of the 1%.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s stated objectives range from the outright protectionist (tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) to the business friendly goals of putting a moratorium on new regulations and introducing an energy policy that pays no heed to concerns about climate change or global warming.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Then there are the measures that are downright tricky to evaluate on the surface. It sounds great when a presidential candidate promises to simplify the tax code, cutting the number of tax brackets from seven to three and reducing the tax owed by those in the top tier to 33% from 39.6%. </p> <p>It\u2019s a plan that enables Trump to claim that everyone will be paying less, since individuals earning less than $25,000, and couples making less than $50,000, wouldn\u2019t owe any federal tax. The problem, of course, is that while all the attention is focused on the absolute rates, less is devoted to unravelling the complicated question of just how the taxes would be levied. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s new plan includes a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/09/tax-loophole-in-trumps-plan-would-create-windfall-for-the-rich.html\">big windfall for his fellow billionaires</a>, in the form of the rate at which \u201cpass through\u201d income will be taxed. This income \u2013 which earns its moniker by flowing through a separate business, partnership or limited liability company before reaching an individual \u2013 is now taxed at the individual rate. Trump proposes to tax it at a new, much lower rate of 15%, giving the wealthy individuals who establish these structures a big, big payday.</p> <p>While camouflaging that payday for the wealthy, Trump trumpeted his populist credentials with two other parts of his economic game plan. The problem? Neither offer the benefits to ordinary Americans of the kind that the candidate suggests they might.</p> <p>Let\u2019s consider the (in)famous \u201cdeath tax\u201d.</p> <p>If you listened to Trump\u2019s speech, you might imagine that this is something that the typical American family is up in arms about \u2013 that we stay up at night worrying about the IRS showing up to take away Grandma\u2019s collection of silver and china or Grandpa\u2019s woodworking equipment to satisfy the \u201cdeath tax\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo family will have to pay the death tax,\u201d Trump proclaimed. \u201cAmerican workers have paid taxes their whole lives. It\u2019s just plain wrong and most people agree with that. We will repeal it.\u201d</p> <p> Well, families like Donald Trump\u2019s may have worried about, and paid, estate taxes. But the rest of us? Not so much, unless, that is, our parents and grandparents bequeath us an estate worth north of $5.4m. That\u2019s the current threshold at which the IRS starts to get a share of the proceeds \u2013 so Grandma\u2019s silver is safe. You can probably sell some of her stocks and bonds to satisfy the taxman before you have to worry about family heirlooms.</p> <p> The estate tax, which affects about 2% of Americans, or about one in every 700 deaths annually, does generate about $25bn a year in revenue for the country\u2019s coffers. I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s a case to be made for waiving or cutting it when a small business owner\u2019s death might force his heirs to close or sell that business: that surely isn\u2019t the intent of the tax. </p> <p>On the other hand, repealing it so that wealthy families can simply pass on all their wealth to their heirs, while governments struggle to deliver basic services to families who themselves are struggling in a country where the wealth gap has become a wealth gulf? That idea becomes even more unpalatable when promoted by a billionaire-turned-politician who, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trump-lays-out-tax-plan-that-would-benefit-his-family-w433267\">along with his family, so clearly will benefit personally</a> from the policies he\u2019s promoting. </p> <p>It becomes even more odd when you consider the fact that many of the country\u2019s wealthiest families are now so rich that they are signing on to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/01/giving-pledge-new-members-2016/\">the Giving Pledge.</a> Joining an effort launched by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, its signatories promise to give away at least half of their net worth to philanthropic causes. Obviously, they\u2019d prefer to choose where their money goes rather than have Uncle Sam decide it belongs to the US treasury, but the fact remains that the country\u2019s wealthiest citizens \u2013 those most likely to be hit by the \u201cdeath tax\u201d \u2013 are spending down their billions already rather than fretting about turning their heirs into next-gen billionaires. The rhetoric about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d is squarely aimed at those middle-class Americans who feel financially squeezed and over-taxed and oppressed by government red-tape of all kinds, but who never will have to pay a dime in \u201cdeath taxes\u201d in their lives.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give Trump the benefit of assuming that his goal in proposing a childcare initiative was benign; it at least means that he finally is acknowledging that it\u2019s a topic that he needs to take seriously. In the run-up to his Monday speech, the rumor was that he was about to suggest a \u201cnew way\u201d for families to deduct childcare costs from their taxes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the \u201cnew way\u201d wasn\u2019t really that new after all. Trump simply proposed that households be able to \u201cfully deduct\u201d their childcare expenses against their taxes. That\u2019s revolutionary rhetoric for a Republican candidate, admittedly, but it ignores the fact that about 45% of Americans don\u2019t pay federal income taxes, and so wouldn\u2019t benefit from that deduction. </p> <p>For them \u2013 and for that matter, for all working parents \u2013 the key issue is affordability. For a low-income family, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/rising-cost-of-child-care-may-help-explain-increase-in-stay-at-home-moms/\">childcare costs can chew up 40% of household income</a>, according to a Pew Research Center report. That means many women are kept out of the workforce altogether by a lack of affordable, accessible childcare options.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s focus on the narrowest part of the childcare conundrum, and the most self-evident solution (the one that benefits the middle class and more affluent families who have already found and can pay for childcare) shows just how oblivious he remains to the real problems that beset his constituency, and how tissue-thin his populism is. It\u2019s a solution that he thinks should fit the problem, rather than one that addresses the real issues.</p> <p>For the GOP candidate to Make America Great Again for those on the wrong side of the wealth gap, he\u2019s going to have to try a lot harder than this.</p>",

For nearly a decade relations between Russia and the UK have been frosty, ever since the murder in November 2006 of the dissident and Putin critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">Alexander Litvinenko</a>.</p> <p>One of Gordon Brown\u2019s early acts as prime minister was to expel four Russian diplomats from London, in protest at Putin\u2019s refusal to extradite the two men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/feb/26/cctv-andrei-lugovoi-dmitry-kovtun-millennium-hotel\">Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi</a>, who slipped radioactive polonium into Litvinenko\u2019s tea. Brown refused to meet Putin. The government\u2019s private view was that this was a Russian state plot.</p> <p>In 2010, however, Cameron signalled a fresh approach and indicated that the Litvinenko affair could be \u201cnegotiated\u201d around. Cameron\u2019s foreign policy priority was mercantilist: to sell stuff to foreigners. As part of his reset, Cameron invited Putin to watch the judo with him at the 2012 London Olympics. It was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQb9_5XFDPw\">gruesome moment</a>, with the two sitting awkwardly as contestants rolled around a yellow mat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"368710f379ed32f09d50e83a689f673c5ee82d9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/368710f379ed32f09d50e83a689f673c5ee82d9d/0_85_4536_2721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron and Vladimir Putin watch judo at the London Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron and Vladimir Putin watch judo at the London Olympics. \u2018A gruesome moment, with the two sitting awkwardly as contestants rolled around a yellow mat.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May\u2019s own record on Russia shows the same depressingly accommodationist instincts. As home secretary, she turned down a request by Litvinenko\u2019s widow, Marina, to hold a public inquiry into her husband\u2019s death. She admitted that \u201cinternational relations\u201d were a factor in her decision \u2013 in other words, it might annoy Putin.</p> <p>This was shameful stuff. As Marina Litvinenko put it: \u201cAs one woman to another, I ask her [May] to consider how she would feel in my position. If her husband had been murdered in this horrible way, wouldn\u2019t she want to get to the truth?\u201d The high court overturned May\u2019s ruling, and a public inquiry opened last year. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">evidence presented</a> to a retired judge, Robert Owen, was sensational. The two assassins brought polonium to London several times, we learned, only poisoning their target on the third attempt. They left an extraordinary radioactive trail: in their hotel rooms (they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/06/alexander-litvinenko-and-the-most-radioactive-towel-in-history\">chucked the polonium down the U-bend</a>), restaurants and a gentleman\u2019s nightclub in Jermyn Street.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">Alexander Litvinenko: the man who solved his own murder | Luke Harding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Owen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.litvinenkoinquiry.org/report\">report</a> in January went further than anyone had imagined. Based in part on secret UK intelligence reports, it concluded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/alexander-litvinenko-was-probably-murdered-on-personal-orders-of-putin\">Putin had \u201cprobably approved\u201d Litvinenko\u2019s murder</a>, together with his spy chief, Nikolai Patrushev (then head of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/fsb-putins-modern-day-kgb\">FSB, the successor to the KGB</a>). Afterwards, May met with Marina but politely declined her request to ban from the UK those involved in the murder, including Putin.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s president, then, is \u201cprobably\u201d a murderer, who wipes out his personal enemies in spectacularly vindictive fashion. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/29/boris-nemtsov-investigators-name-chechen-mastermind\">Putin\u2019s critics at home</a> have an uncanny habit of ending up dead. What made the Litvinenko case unusual was its target (a British citizen) and its location outside Russia (which meant an evidence-led Scotland Yard investigation).</p> <p>As May knows perfectly well, there are many forms of terrorism, including the state variety. According to Downing Street she and Putin agreed that \u201ccooperation on aviation security in particular was a vital part of the international counter-terrorism effort\u201d. She seems to forget that Litvinenko\u2019s killers flew from Moscow with British Airways; polonium was discovered on Lugovoi\u2019s seat, 23D.</p> <p>And what of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/flight-mh17-two-years-on-putin-killed-my-son-richard-mayne-ukraine\">Malaysian Airlines MH17</a>, shot down two years ago over eastern Ukraine? According to Dutch investigators, pro-Russian rebels \u2013 or Russian soldiers \u2013 downed the jet by mistake, using a Buk missile system smuggled across the Russian border. Ten British citizens were killed. Their families are demanding justice.</p> <p>Putin views western leaders such as May as weak and ephemeral. He\u2019s not greatly interested in notions of \u201ccooperation\u201d. Rather he has a concrete goal: to end EU sanctions against Russia, imposed after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\">2014 annexation of Crimea</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-armed-crimea-incursion\">Russian troop buildups in Crimea this week</a> have raised fears of further military moves against Ukraine.</p> <p>Brexit opens up new political possibilities for Moscow, and badly undermines European unity at a time of multiple global crises. May needs to emulate another leader to whom she\u2019s superficially compared: Angela Merkel. The chancellor grew up in East Germany, speaks Russian, and understands Putin\u2019s dark KGB world-view perfectly.</p>",
  "<p>I want death: three plain words encapsulate the horror and the shame of the treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru. That a child at the very start of life should want only to end it is a tragedy. That so many held in Australia\u2019s offshore immigration centre express that kind of despair, as revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">in documents leaked to the Guardian</a>, tells you the system is a disgrace. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">The Nauru files</a> tally callousness and outright cruelty towards the hundreds of asylum seekers held on the island since 2012.</p> <p>Each of these cases is an affront. But their volume matters too; this is not about isolated errors or abuses. There are more than 2,000 incident reports, more than half involving children, who account for less than a fifth of those incarcerated. They include seven reports of sexual assault, 59 of assault, 30 of self-harm and 159 of threatened self-harm \u2013 and yet staff from Save the Children, who wrote many of these reports, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/former-save-the-children-workers-say-nauru-files-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg\">say they are the tip of the iceberg</a>. We know, too, that adults on the island live in fear and despair. We read of a mother-to-be begging authorities to take her baby, knowing she cannot protect it.</p> <p>The guards \u2013 and the company that employs them, Wilson Security \u2013 must take the blame for some of what happens on Nauru. Though some appear compassionate and committed to supporting detainees, others are clearly unfit to work there. No doubt they are hardened by the daily misery, but it is hard to imagine how any human could laugh upon seeing that a traumatised child <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca140787\">had sewn her lips together</a>, as some officers allegedly did. The bigger issue is that the system dehumanises the desperate. The psychiatrist who previously oversaw their care has described the environment as \u201cinherently toxic\u201d.</p> <p>The justification for Nauru \u2013 and a second detention centre on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island \u2013 was that they would deter asylum seekers from boarding boats to Australia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/a-short-history-of-nauru-australias-dumping-ground-for-refugees\">More than three-quarters</a> of those whose claims have been assessed have been found to be refugees, with a well-founded fear of persecution and a legal right to protection. The boats are still setting out, but being turned back \u2013 in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/vietnamese-asylum-seekers-forcibly-returned-by-australia-face-jail\">taking their passengers to jail</a> for their attempts to leave. In any case, no one is deterred by misery that they cannot see; and they cannot see it because it has been hidden deliberately. Media access is expensive and has been highly selective. Since last year, those working in the system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/08/why-cant-we-know-whats-happening-on-nauru-and-manus-island\">can be jailed for \u201cunauthorised disclosures\u201d</a>. Some have blown the whistle anyway; traumatologist Paul Stevenson said <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime\">he had never seen more atrocity</a> in a four-decade career that included helping victims of the Bali bombings and Boxing Day tsunami.</p> <p>Officials and politicians appear to hope that, once out of sight, asylum seekers will be out of mind, too. But ignoring the problems does not and cannot make them go away. They mount as the days pass because humans cannot live without hope. The UN high commission for refugees warns of a progressive deterioration in the situation.</p> <p>This is not \u201coffshore processing\u201d but warehousing. The centre holds a relatively small number of refugees: 442. A few hundred more live outside on this impoverished island of just 9,000 citizens, with tensions already evident. If Australia will not accept them, it should explore a third country option seriously. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/turnbull-rejects-new-zealand-offer-to-take-150-refugees-from-detention\">it rejected New Zealand\u2019s offer</a> to take in 150.</p> <p>Both the government and the opposition back the current arrangements, though Labor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/labor-will-reintroduce-bill-to-force-mandatory-reporting-of-child-abuse-after-nauru-files\">Bill Shorten has now called for increased oversight and the appointment of a children\u2019s commissioner</a> to protect the welfare of those in immigration detention. Those measures, like increased transparency \u2013 ensuring access for the media <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/un-investigators-denied-access-to-nauru-detention-centre-20140409-zqspk.html\">and UN investigators</a>, for instance \u2013 might bring minimal improvements but cannot address the fundamental shortcomings.</p> <p>If the test of a civilised society is how we treat the vulnerable, there can hardly be a greater condemnation than indifference towards those exposed twice over, because of their age and because they have fled their country. Britain, too, has a wretched record in this regard. It has taken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-refugee-crisis-action-not-words\">just 20 unaccompanied children</a> of the hundreds it promised to accept, while more than 600 remain in squalor in Calais. Nauru cannot offer a home and should never have been made a dumping ground. But even if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">growing clamour over its miseries</a> can bring an end to this system, it embodies a hostility to asylum seekers \u2013 in Australia and beyond \u2013 that will persist and must be tackled.</p>",
  "<p>Evolutionary biologists from British universities have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37025088\" title=\"\">found new evidence</a> to support their theory that, despite their infertile state, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10451533\" title=\"\">post-menopausal killer whales</a> play a beneficial role in the lives of their grandchildren. The scientists have a serious purpose: they want to find out why orcas go through the menopause, a characteristic shared only by pilot whales and humans. But their work produces delightful insights, starting with the reminder that even orcas, most familiar from blood-soaked natural history documentaries, are in fact family-loving creatures that live in caring extended kinship groups, in which the females usually outlive the males by at least 20 years. So&#xa0;far, so very interesting. The danger comes when others take their research and use it to promote their own view of what constitutes a&#xa0;well-ordered society.</p> <p>Evolutionary biologists have been studying orcas for more than a decade in the search for an evolutionary benefit to the menopause that would explain why it happens. They now conclude that in mammal species where family groups stay together (rather than young males or females being forced to leave), there is a benefit in the form of what <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/06/24/rspb.2010.0988\" title=\"\">they term late-life helping</a>. This is not a new idea: it originated in the 1950s. One <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/05/why-killer-whales-go-through-menopause-but-elephants-dont/\" title=\"\">more recent study</a> suggested that it was actually mothering, not grandmothering, that was crucial: where grandmothers survived, their mature sons lived longer.</p> <p>But it is important to be clear about what is cause, and what is mere correlation; and in evolutionary biology in particular it is never straightforward. A team of Canadian scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/13/cradle-snatchers-cause-menopause-biologist\" title=\"\">has argued</a> that the only rational explanation for women\u2019s loss of fertility is the outcome of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/30/menopause-natures-way-older-women-sexually-attractive\" title=\"\">cradlesnatcher syndrome</a>. Since men prefer to have sex with younger women, older women gradually ceased to be fertile. Other research, by evolutionary demographers, examined parish records in Finland and found a beneficial connection between the longevity of grandmothers and mortality rates among grandchildren. A&#xa0;study of Hazda families in Tanzania found maternal grandmothers played a critical role in bringing up their grandchildren. Another <a href=\"http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/publications/list.php?inpress=1&amp;grouping=grid&amp;show_grid=1&amp;filter=list&amp;value=27152221&amp;view=abstract\" title=\"\">study of data from Guatemala</a> seemed to confirm their importance, and even suggested that paternal grandmothers had the reverse effect. In all of these, there is a correlation between the presence of post-menopausal grannies and healthier grandchildren \u2013 but whether it is enough to be understood as an evolutionary pressure that caused the menopause remains a matter&#xa0;of argument.</p> <p>This is the real lesson. Evolutionary biology is an absorbing discipline. It is fascinating to try to find out whether, for example, the New Caledonian crow bends a stick <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2100535-genius-crows-tool-bending-behaviour-may-be-natural-to-its-kind/\" title=\"\">to make a tool</a> that deals with the problem in front of it, or does it because it fits in its beak better. But appreciating crow intelligence, although it should make humans nicer to them, says nothing about our social organisation. If the human female orgasm is, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/01/mystery-of-the-female-orgasm-may-be-solved\" title=\"\">as new research argues</a>, a hangover from the time when orgasm stimulated ovulation, it may at last answer an evolutionary conundrum. But it is irrelevant to its role in feminist theory. The value to a family of orcas of having granny around is interesting but it is not about the human menopause, nor about the worth of older women. That is about human values, and nothing to do with orcas at all.</p>",

  "<p>Salvage experts fear that tonnes of diesel has leaked into the Atlantic after a drilling rig ran aground, breaching its fuel tanks, in the Western Isles of Scotland earlier this week.</p> <p>The specialists believe two of the four fuel storage tanks on the Transocean Winner platform were damaged as well as water stability tanks, when the 17,000-tonne <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/salvage-crew-board-oil-rig-transocean-winner-blown-ashore-lewis\">rig crashed into rocks near Carloway</a> on the Isle of Lewis in a heavy storm.</p> <p>The platform, which ran aground close to Dalmore beach, a popular surfing spot, was carrying 280 tonnes (70,000 gallons) of diesel, but there has been no sign so far of an oil slick or other visible evidence that fuel was still leaking into the sea.</p> <p>Hugh Shaw, the UK government\u2019s representative for maritime and salvage, said a Maritime and Coastguard Agency spotter plane was now scouring the area south of the rig for signs of a slick, but nothing had been seen or smelt since Monday. He said that suggested any fuel leak happened as the rig, which was unmanned at the time, first hit the rocks. It is unclear how much diesel has escaped.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not getting any reports of anything or that anyone is seeing anything,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt may well be that if the tanks have been breached, and we\u2019ve lost the contents, it might well have been lost on Monday morning in the adverse weather when the installation ran ashore.\u201d</p> <p>Shaw disclosed that it could be several months before the rig, which was being towed from Norway to Malta when a tow rope snapped during a gale at about 4.30am on Monday morning, could be removed.</p> <p>The breached tanks were detected by a team who spent three-and-a-half hours on the platform on Tuesday, using sounding pipes to test how much oil and ballast was in each tank.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A plan to winch a larger inspection team down on to the rig on Wednesday morning, to continue those investigations over a full day, were scuppered because the wind was not strong enough to give the helicopter the right flying conditions for a safe operation.</p> <p>The forecast shows the weather is likely to worsen greatly for the next four days, further hampering the investigation, Shaw said. \u201cWe do know from the forecasts we\u2019re getting from tomorrow, it\u2019s going to start deteriorating,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Speaking from Lewis, where he is overseeing the salvage operation, Shaw said that the salvors and Transocean, the rig\u2019s owners, had to establish what kind of repairs were needed to seal up the ballast tank and oil tanks to make sure it was seaworthy. \u201cWhere she\u2019s sitting, that could be very difficult,\u201d he warned.</p> <p>They needed to get the right barges on site and wait for a clear weather window before attempting to pull it clear. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not talking days. We might not be talking weeks; it may be much longer than that\u201d before the rig could be refloated, he said. </p> <p>The incident is now under investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch, with two tugs on standby, including the MCA\u2019s emergency tug ETV Herakles. </p> <p>The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has imposed a 300-metre exclusion zone around the site, to prevent onlookers hampering the salvage teams and emergency services, and to stop onlookers venturing onto cliffs close to the beached rig.</p> <p>The disclosure of the suspected leak added further urgency to questions from the Scottish government and conservationists about the decision to tow the vessel during a storm, and the UK government decision to scrap an emergency tug based in Stornoway on Lewis in 2012.</p> <p>Dr Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the leak could pose a serious threat to local wildlife, including whales, dolphins and seabirds. Seven miles west of the grounding site was EU-protected Loch Roag coastal lagoons system.</p> <p> The risks posed to the marine environment by oil installations was likely to increase, with further decommissioning of rigs due soon and climate change certain to increase the severity and unpredictability of violent storms in the Atlantic.</p> <p>\u201cIf the diesel oil leaks into the environment, the clamour for answers as to why such a risky trip was attempted will grow much louder,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cWhy was the rig taking this dangerous route off the mainland in such a storm? How do we make sure that companies don\u2019t repeat these mistakes?\u201d</p> <p> Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said her government was already pressing the UK government for information on why the Transocean Winner was allowed to transit UK waters when a storm had been forecast.</p> <p> \u201cAlthough the diesel is expected to rapidly disperse in the current sea conditions, the environment group, which is chaired by [the government agency] Marine Scotland, has put in place measures to swiftly identify any potential environmental impact on this precious and fragile marine habitat,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Isn\u2019t there a wonderful irony in our admiration for the feats of US and British swimmers at the Olympics this week?

It makes them cowards.\u201d</p> <p>Following the example of Miss Hepburn (with whom I once spend a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/portrait-of-a-lady-111105.html\">memorable morning</a> in her Upper East Side house, where she tried to feed me crabmeat from a half-open can), I swim off Cape Cod in January, following the advice of the New York Times of 23 August 1883, which recommends the Cape shores to \u201cthose looking for good surf-bathing\u201d, so empty even on a summer\u2019s day that \u201cif one wishes to go in in his bare pelt he may do so without the fear of shocking propriety\u201d. I swim there in the summer too, occasionally in the company of John Waters, who hitchhikes to the beach. (We once got a ride in a cop car. John quipped as we got out: \u201cWe\u2019ve been paroled to the beach\u201d).</p> <p>The summer stirs our relationship with the water, and swimming has a noble tradition in the United States, a rebellious republic bound from sea to shining sea. The act of abandoning land and gravity has a sensual, even decadent air. On his 1882 tour of the US, which turned him into an international celebrity, Oscar Wilde <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2015/05/orchid-prairies\">spent an extended stay on Fire Island</a>, already fashionable as a resort for New Yorker swimmers. Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper portrayed him in flowing Pre-Raphaelite locks and a <a href=\"http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/features/a-scene-at-long-beach.html\">daringly tight</a> swimming costume, the ultimate in aesthetic undress. Wilde\u2019s son said his father swam like a powerful shark. Wilde v Phelps swim-off, anyone?</p> <p>More obviously macho was Jack London, self-declared \u201cblond beast\u201d and highest paid author in the world by 1913. An inveterate swimmer, London wrote ecstatically of midnight swims \u201cunder the starshine\u201d in water \u201cwarm as tepid milk. The good salt taste of it was in his mouth, the tingling of it along his limbs; and the steady beat of his heart, heavy and strong, made him glad for living.\u201d</p> <p>But Henry David Thoreau is my man when it comes to transcendental swims. It was one of the reasons for building his hut at Walden: \u201cI got up early and bathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise, and one of the best things I did.\u201d The philosopher even tried to analysise the colour of the water \u2013 \u201clying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both\u201d. Less idyllically, modern analysis of Walden Pond in midsummer reveals a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/why-has-the-olympic-pool-turned-green-the-good-news-is-its-not-urine\">high volume of human urine</a>.</p> <p>Swimming was also an essential part of Thoreau\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thoreausociety.org/news-article/threshold-chaos-henry-thoreau-cape-cod-elizabeth-kalman-nicholas-holdgate\">celebrated visits</a> to Cape Cod.</p> <p> Locals told him there was \u201cno bathing on the Atlantic side, on account of the undertow and the rumour of sharks\u201d. Undeterred, he continued to swim there, \u201conly observing first from the bank if the cove was preoccupied\u201d. At Ballston beach, where I\u2019ve skinny-dipped in the company of passing humpback whales, Chris Myers <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/metrodesk/2012/08/03/man-who-survived-shark-attack-off-ballston-beach-truro-calls-himself-very-lucky/RC6VoTuTt23Rt8Liy7tOfL/story.html \">was bitten</a> by a great white shark in 2012, sustaining severe injuries to his legs. Only last week, three Cape beaches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/great-white-shark-feast-video-massachusetts\">were closed</a> when great whites were seen feeding on a rotting minke whale a mile off shore. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69c3ec9ab7ae0fbe697a0c03b9841114f9d67b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c3ec9ab7ae0fbe697a0c03b9841114f9d67b40/0_68_2610_1567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The author preparing to swim at Provincetown, Massachusetts, in winter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author preparing to swim in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat de Groot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what is swimming if not a sublime brush with mortality? Recently, a fisherman showed me a photograph on his phone from Race Point beach. A great white breaks the surf, barely in the water, its teeth around a grey seal. Ouch. As my friend Todd Motta, a tough captain on the Dolphin Fleet whale-watch boat, says: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go like that, boy.\u201d Foolishly, I continue to ignore his advice.</p>",
  "<p>Agriculture and the overexploitation of plants and animal species are significantly greater threats to biodiversity than climate change, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/536143a\">new analysis shows</a>.</p> <p>Joint research <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/536143a\">published in the journal Nature</a> on Wednesday found nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s threatened species faced these threats, compared to just 19% affected by climate change.</p> <p>It comes a month before the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) hosts its <a href=\"http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/\">annual summit in Hawaii</a> to set future priorities for conservation. </p> <p>The team from the University of Queensland, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN assessed 8,688 near-threatened or threatened species on the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\">IUCN\u2019s \u201cred list\u201d</a> against 11 threats: overexploitation, agricultural activity, urban development, invasion and disease, pollution, ecosystem modification, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/20/more-than-1000-species-have-been-moved-due-to-human-impact\">climate change</a>, human disturbance, transport and energy production. </p> <p>It found that 6,241 (72%) of the studied species were affected by overexploitation \u2013 logging, hunting, fishing or gathering species from the wild at rates that cannot be compensated for by reproduction or regrowth. </p> <p>These included the Sumatran rhinoceros, western gorilla and Chinese pangolin \u2013 all illegally hunted for their body parts and meat \u2013 and the Bornean wren babbler, one of 4,049 species threatened by unsustainable logging.</p> <p>Some 5,407 species (62%) were threatened by agriculture alone. The cheetah, African wild dog and hairy-nosed otter are among the animals most affected by crop and livestock farming, timber plantations and aquaculture. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-10T10:36:28/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Species affected by 11 threats\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-10T10:36:28/embed.html\">Species affected by 11 threats</a> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the analysis showed, anthropogenic climate change \u2013 including increases in storms, flooding, extreme temperatures or extreme drought and sea-level rise \u2013 is currently affecting just 19% of species listed as threatened or near-threatened, and was ranked seventh among the 11 threats. <br></p> <p>Hooded seals are among the 1,688 species affected.

These activities need to be well funded and prioritised in areas that will reduce threat.\u201d<br></p>",

In effect the available market of gilts the Bank faces is much smaller. Hence hitting a snag on day two.</p> </blockquote> <p>Duncan also has three good suggestions to improve Britain\u2019s response to the Brexit vote:</p> <p><strong>1) The BoE should buy more short-dated bonds. </strong>This would push down borrowing costs over the next couple of years, giving more immediate help to households and businesses</p> <p><strong>2) The government should spend more, financed by higher borrowing.</strong> Record low gilt yields means borrowing has never been cheaper, after all.</p> <p><strong>3) A new \u201cBritish Investment Bank\u201d should be created.</strong> It would drive loans to small businesses, and to fund infrastructure projects -- with the Bank of England allowed to buy bonds issued by the BIB.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/763324125502902272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Making QE more effective - <a href=\"https://t.co/5ZGbjuN4TT\">https://t.co/5ZGbjuN4TT</a> - on yesterday&#39;s snag and the next steps the Bank could take.</p>&mdash; (((Duncan Weldon))) (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/763324125502902272\">August 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T11:01:32.996Z\">at 12.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aaf61ee4b0139724dfa175\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T10:05:32.014Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pension funds fear more pain from QE</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The recent slump in UK gilt yields is dire news for pension funds, whose deficits are steadily worsening.</strong></p> <p>With government bonds offering such meagre returns, fund managers must expect even lower rates of return in the years ahead.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the Bank of England struggled to buy enough bonds yesterday -- pensions are clinging onto the gilts they already own, as they\u2019re generating a higher income than stuff they could buy today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoelLewin/status/763308030352101376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This pretty much sums up why the BoE QE operation failed <a href=\"https://t.co/yv7FKLocPk\">pic.twitter.com/yv7FKLocPk</a></p>&mdash; Joel Lewin (@JoelLewin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoelLewin/status/763308030352101376\">August 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Patrick Bloomfield, Partner at financial consultancy Hymans Robertson, explains:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combined deficit of UK defined benefit (DB) pension schemes has hit \u00a3950bn for the first time ever.

Today\u2019s announcement has the Bank kicking the can down the road and has created a \u2018wait and see\u2019 scenario for investors looking at reasons for the failure. As quantitive easing was meant to have been a solution for the problems facing the British economy following Brexit, if this trend continues and monetary policy is unable to achieve its goals then the baton may have to be passed to the Treasury to find a solution.</p> <p>\u201cIt should be noted that the DMO will issue long term gilts, maturing in 2055 next week which may mean investors will be more eager to sell other bonds to make room for this new supply, which could make up for yesterday\u2019s shortfall. They could also continue to take advantage of the artificial demand QE has created to offer bonds at values well above the current market price. However, with plummeting government bond yields and pensions schemes desperate not to increase deficits further, we could well see more bond purchase failures, with low coverage ratios a likelihood for some time.</p> <p>\u201cLonger term, if quantitative easing continues to fail this could mean a fiscal response such as a VAT cut of 2.5% in the Autumn Statement as the Treasury steps in. This could help to curb inflation as the Bank of England is currently forecasting medium term inflation above its stated 2% target.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aaea22e4b0aa844e0404ce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T08:56:13.322Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoE: Firms gloomy about Brexit vote</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England has also reported signs that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union vote is hitting the UK economy.</strong></p> <p>Its latest Agents Report, just released, warns that many firms expect capital spending, hiring and turnover to suffer.</p> <p>This backs up the concerns raised in last week\u2019s August inflation report (when the Bank slashed interest rates and restarted its QE programme).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/763294949811089408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Clearer signs of Brexit damage in July&#39;s BoE agents&#39; report.

It\u2019s great that Expedia has joined more than 100 companies that decided to leave Alec. Alec skirts tax and ethics laws, while lobbying for extreme policies. Other companies should follow Expedia and travel as far from Alec as possible. When customers realize the companies they patronize are funding such an extreme agenda they recoil and they make their voices heard.\u201d<br></p> <p>Expedia\u2019s decision follows another blow for Alec this month. Last week the retirees organization AARP announced it would no longer be making donations to Alec. <br></p> <p>The ties between the two organisations were first <a href=\"http://www.exposedbycmd.org/2016/07/28/revealed-aarp-funding-alec/\">exposed by the Center for Media and Democracy</a> and led to an online backlash from AARP members. Alec has consistently lobbied to cut government spending on programs that benefit seniors and has close ties to pharmaceutical companies.<br></p> <p>\u201cAfter hearing from many of you, we\u2019ve decided not to renew our membership to Alec. We would never work against the interests of older Americans and our engagement with Alec was NOT an endorsement of the organization\u2019s policies, but an opportunity to engage with state legislators and advance our members\u2019 priorities,\u201d AARP said in a<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AARP/videos/10154465159528960/?video_source=pages_finch_main_video\"> statement.</a><br></p>",

The organising committee, although it declined to make a comment, said ultimate responsibility lies with Fina, whose technical committee, according to the ROC, signed off on all times at a meeting last week. Neither body feels the credibility of the event has been affected.</p> <p>All of the swimmers in question were selected under Fina\u2019s \u201cuniversality rule\u201dthat allows countries where no swimmer has achieved the qualifying standard to nominate one man and one woman to compete at the Olympics. There are 220 universality swimmers in Rio. Fina said it had already identified and corrected as many as 40 similar mistakes but they missed these 17.</p> <p>Last August, the Mexican swimming federation <a href=\"https://swimswam.com/mexican-swimmers-and-federation-release-separate-statements-on-entry-times/\">admitted it had faked many of its squad\u2019s entry times</a> for those same championships in Kazan.</p> <p><a href=\"https://swimswam.com/cornel-marculescu-says-no-punishment-coming-for-mexican-federation/\">According to reports</a>, Fina\u2019s executive director, Cornel Marculescu, said there would be no punishment for the Mexican federation as entry times were used only to put swimmers in lanes and no Mexicans advanced to the semi-finals or finals. It was, however, later suspended from Fina and fined after it pulled out of hosting the 2017 world championships.</p> <p>John Leonard, the executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, said: \u201cFina clearly does not care about veracity in entry times to its events as it allowed the Mexican delegation to submit false entry times to the world championships with no penalty.\u201d</p> <p>The president of the WSCA, George Block, described the discrepancies as \u201calarming\u201d and said the universality rule was \u201csomething coaches have been concerned about for quite a few years\u201d.

He is one of the 17 swimmers whose entry time for Rio has changed. Bayusuf\u2019s time for the 100m backstroke was listed as 59.99sec, achieved in the first heat in Kazan on 3 August, 2015. The results sheet from that race shows his time was 1min 07sec. A Fina representative showed the Guardian the original nomination forms that listed Mohamed\u2019s qualifying time as 1min 07sec. The representative said Fina had no idea how the wrong time of 59.99sec appeared on the entry list.

  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3gEQlmp290\">The Sahara All Stars \u2013 Take Your Soul</a></h2> <p>With Nigeria being the most populous country in Africa (not to mention the seventh in the world) and Lagos being a truly international city, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that so many dancefloor-orientated genres \u2013 Afrobeat, Afrofunk and Afrodisco \u2013 flourished there in the 1970s and 80s. Despite its bloody colonial history (the country became independent from British rule in 1960) and terrible dictatorships after 1970, there was still rich cultural exchange between Nigeria and the UK. One of the country\u2019s most celebrated sons, Fela Kuti, learned his chops playing in London jazz clubs in the mid-60s. Likewise, heavyweight British musicians such as Ginger Baker and Paul McCartney fell in love with the musical culture of the west African nation, and for good reason: Nigeria is internationally famed for its adoption of highlife and its homegrown Afrobeat. But the creative club scene and cultural preference for live music over DJs meant local disco bands tended to be in demand. Every town had at least one world-class band, and this bunch of talented all-rounders were from Jos, in the middle belt of the country. The Sahara All Stars were as happy playing reggae as they were jamming out long Afrobeat numbers and cutting crisp disco funk tracks, as Take Your Soul shows. Their second album, Sahara All Stars of Jos, came out in 1976 on Nigeria EMI, but for those who don\u2019t fancy paying ridiculous prices, it is available on the essential Soundway compilation <a href=\"https://www.soundwayrecords.com/Shop/DownloadDetails?rid=SWR_RE_50\">Nigeria Disco Funk Special: The Sound of the Underground Lagos Dancefloor 1974-79</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Boiler Room logo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\">Boiler Room logo</a> </figure>  <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBxBvlGes34\">Joni Haastrup \u2013 Greetings</a></h2> <p>Joni Haastrup was born in Sierra Leone, but he grew up among Nigerian royalty and made his name \u2013 to a certain extent at least \u2013 on the dancefloors of his adopted country. The qualifier is necessary, because despite being one of the most important musicians involved in the country\u2019s highlife, rock, Afrobeat and disco scenes, he has remained relatively unknown. Perhaps it is understandable given that he recorded under a bewildering number of aliases and spent a lot of his career collaborating with other musicians and playing second fiddle in their bands. He was a member of the Ginger Baker groups Salt and Air Force; he provided the vocals on the first ever Afrobeat album, Orlando Julius\u2019s Super Afro Soul, and he worked with Fela Kuti on other crucial releases. However, despite his own recordings being reissued, including the killer 1978 album <a href=\"http://hotcasarecords.com/release/joni-haastrup/\">Wake Up Your Mind</a>, his music has not gripped the UK Afro record-buying public\u2019s attention in the same way as Fela or, more recently, William Onyeabor have. Perhaps that will change. He features heavily on an excellent new soul jazz compilation Nigeria Soul Fever: Afrofunk, Disco And Boogie: West African Disco Mayhem! which is due out later this month. And this killer slo-mo disco track from 1978 also features on the indispensable introductory compilation <a href=\"http://www.strut-records.com/nigeria-70-definitive-lp-edition/\">Nigeria 70 \u2013 Funky Lagos</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/09/how-nigerian-artists-made-their-mark-on-british-music\">How Nigerian artists made their mark on British music</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPAZ87a_oE\">Orlando Julius \u2013 Disco Hi-Life</a></h2> <p>It just doesn\u2019t get much better than this. Orlando Julius came from Nigeria and had a solid grounding in many African musical styles and cultures, but he was also a true internationalist. He was a regular collaborator with the Detroit soul powerhouse Lamont Dozier, for example, and this adaptability left him well positioned to pull off this exquisitely balanced hybrid of languid disco and serotonin-drenched highlife in 1979. This unbeatably upbeat and sun-dappled floorfiller has undergone something of a revival over recent years (and deservedly so) after <a href=\"http://hotcasarecords.com/release/orlando-julius-disco-hi-life/\">Hot Casa reissued the EP</a> in 2014. Orlando remains a prodigiously talented musician, as his recent album <a href=\"https://orlandojulius.bandcamp.com/album/jaiyede-afro\">Jaiyede Afro</a>, recorded with London based spiritual jazz/Afro funk orchestra the Heliocentrics proves. <br></p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2laU08Ca5U\">Mixed Grill \u2013 A Brand New Wayo</a></h2> <p>I fail to see how anything that mixes Afrobeat, disco, reggae, funk and a selection of tasty grilled meats could be anything other than fantastic, and this record genuinely is amazing. Recorded in Lagos but mixed and mastered at Abbey Road, with an international release on Decca, Mixed Grill\u2019s 1979 album A Cry for Peace and Love was obviously made with one eye on crossover potential. But even if they were aiming at an American audience, you can\u2019t mistake where those drums come from. According to the sleevenotes, the keyboards on this LP were played by Lemmy. One would presume it\u2019s not the same one. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/aug/08/gateways-tony-allen-and-nigeria-from-afrobeat-to-afrobeats\">Gateways \u2013 Tony Allen and Nigeria: From Afrobeat to Afrobeats</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>5. <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/nigeria-soul-fever\">Arakatula \u2013 Wake Up Africa</a></h2> <p>In Nigeria, it has always been hard to ignore the heavily politicised and radical overtones that suffuse popular dance music. After suffering a terrible civil war that killed three million people in three years, and a police state giving way to a military dictatorship, working-class and middle-class Nigerians were not just worn out after the 1970 coup but also bitterly angry that they were seeing no benefits whatsoever from the discovery of huge oilfields or their country\u2019s membership of Opec. The gulf between the rich and poor could not have been wider. And it was in this atmosphere that the charismatic and rich-voiced Arakatula released the low-slung, agitated prop disco banger Wake Up Africa in 1979 \u2013 it features on the forthcoming soul jazz compilation Nigerian Soul Fever. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nigerian disco\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A3AR0lybjcXyeoJCVd1pON6\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/tee-mac-2-night-illusion\">Tee Mac \u2013 Hit Hit</a></h2> <p>Tee Mac Omatshola Iseli lived an unusual life by any standards. Born into Nigerian royalty in 1948, he was packed off to Zurich at an early age after his father \u2013 a successful businessman and diplomat \u2013 was assassinated at work. However traumatic it was, the move would prove fruitful for Tee Mac because it brought him under the influence and tutelage of Jean-Pierre Rampal, a brilliant and internationally respected flautist. After 14 years studying the instrument, the 22-year-old Tee Mac returned to Lagos, where he formed a series of heavyweight psychedelic Afro-rock bands including Tee Mac and Afro Collection and the amazingly named Tee Mac and the Backing Band. The former outfit featured Berkley Jones on lead guitar, Joni Haastrup on keyboards, Friday Puzzo on congas and for a short time, Ginger Baker on drums, before Baker absconded with all the musicians bar Tee Mac to form his own group, Salt. The flute-playing prodigy wasn\u2019t fazed and recorded an 18m-selling single called Fly Robin Fly under the pseudonym Levay, which set him up financially for life. He then served a stint as Shirley Bassey\u2019s arranger and bandleader before relaunching himself as a disco musician with the Party Fever LP in 1976. Keeping abreast of dancefloor fashions, he adopted a slick boogie style for 1980\u2019s stunning Hit Hit \u2013 which clearly would have been as suitable for Manhattan\u2019s Studio 54 as it was in his own Black Pussycat club in Yaba. As much as Tee Mac was a great band leader and flautist, his real secret weapon in the Nigerian boogie period was his powerhouse lead vocalist, Marjorie Bares, who carries this track effortlessly across a heaving, underlit dancefloor. Tee Mac remains a successful businessman and one of the most in-demand and highly paid flautists in the world. Hit Hit is taken from the album Night Illusion, which is <a href=\"https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/tee-mac-2-night-illusion\">reissued by Soul Jazz on 16 September</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/05/tony-allen-fela-was-right-but-i-detest-singing-militant\">Tony Allen: \u2018Fela was right \u2013 but I detest singing militant\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGNIHKIhCZ8\">Eno Louis - Hot Love</a></h2> <p>Eno Louis was a resident member of Fela Kuti\u2019s Republic of Kalakuta compound until a notoriously vicious army attack in 1977 caused him to flee to America. Confusingly, he didn\u2019t record his highly collectible Living in USA album until 1982, when he was back in Nigeria. The track Move! features his early experiments with the emergent rap scene, but Hot Love showcases his more disco boogie-leaning sensibilities. <br></p> <h2>8. Odion Iruoje \u2013 Identify With Your Root (Which One You De?)</h2> <p>The self-styled \u201csound president\u201d teamed up with Akika Omodele in 1983 to write the lyrics for this roots-conscious piece of disco-rap, directed at the African global diaspora. This glorious slice of ultra freshness spreads a positive message to African men and women the world over via rhyme schemes that paint Iruoje as the Nigerian Funky 4 + 1 or Sugarhill Gang. Except it should be pointed out that there can\u2019t be too many old school US rap jams featuring a masterly, lengthy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_drum\">talking-drum breakdown</a>. Again, the album this track is taken from, Down to Earth, could have reasonably been described as rarer than the original copy of the Bible until recently, but those good folk at Soundway are <a href=\"https://www.soundwayrecords.com/Shop/DownloadDetails?rid=SWR_RE_110\">reissuing it on vinyl later this month</a>. <br></p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmc87LsaGo4\">Tony Allen \u2013 NEPA (Never Expect Power Always)</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d95751ae311d24a923086a493434125d9ab5df74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d95751ae311d24a923086a493434125d9ab5df74/0_21_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Allen \u2026 Performing in 1988.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Allen \u2026 Performing in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Schellekens/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony Allen, as much as the charismatic Fela and Orlando Julius, was responsible for the Afrobeat sound. He was lionised \u2013 along with Klaus Dinger of Neu! and Clyde Stubblefield of James Brown\u2019s band \u2013 by Brian Eno for inventing one of the three most important drum beats of the late 20th century. Fela claimed Allen\u2019s ability to play four separate rhythms simultaneously made him feel like he had a quartet of drummers in his band rather than just one. Whether this 1984 Afro dancefloor staple \u2013 one of Allen\u2019s many solo outings \u2013 is strictly disco is open to debate, but the gloriously insistent locked groove and propulsive electronic elements necessitate its inclusion.<br></p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fnTxm1u_34\">William Onyeabor \u2013 When the Going Is Smooth &amp; Good </a></h2> <p>Despite a recent, long-overdue reissue project courtesy of Luaka Bop, William Onyeabor remains something of an enigma. He was a bright kid and, so the legend goes, was sent to study in Moscow during the 1970s on a scholarship. In more recent years, Onyeabor he has been ennobled into Nigerian royalty, taken over a successful flour mill and become a born again Christian. The upshot is that he now refuses to discuss his earlier life as a musician. The facts about his career remain pleasingly opaque. Maybe he set himself up as a film-maker and invested the profits into banks and banks of synthesisers before setting himself up as a futuristic funk star. There again, maybe he didn\u2019t. What we can say with some certainty is that by some means or other he developed a genuinely unique sound which made him more akin to an African Devo or Cerrone than Fela Kuti or Orlando Julius. His body of work features many immensely satisfying slabs of Lagosian synth funk and pulsating new wave disco, and nearly all of it remained Afrofunk\u2019s best-kept secret for decades. Until recently, Onyeabor had steadfastly refused to allow his back catalogue to be reissued, causing prices on Discogs to eventually spiral out of control, with only a couple of tracks such as the uncontested dancefloor destroyer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51cnVcbUAo\">Body and Soul</a> turning up regularly on officially licensed compilations. Collectors, DJs and fans had to make do with very low quality MP3s and YouTube rips until Luaka Bop wore the great man down and reissued most of his 70s and 80s material in 2013 and 2014. Good Name, Let\u2019s Fall in Love and Atomic Bomb are all electro disco gold dust, but this lesser-known 1985 track is both unusual and perfect, coming across like some hipster\u2019s torrid wish-fulfilment combination of John Bender, OMD, the Units, LCD Soundsystem and Ebo Taylor. </p>",

  "<p>The Scottish government is to redirect \u00a3100m from a budget underspend last year into a new initiative to help cushion the economy from the impacts of a post-EU referendum downturn. </p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the spending was needed to help stimulate the already weak Scottish economy in the wake of the \u201cdeep and widespread uncertainty\u201d caused by the Brexit vote in June.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK government has not yet taken any meaningful action to alleviate uncertainty or to boost confidence, and there are very real concerns that the damage to the economy and to jobs will be severe and long-lasting,\u201d Sturgeon said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is against this background that the Scottish government is announcing early action to boost confidence, stimulate economic activity and support business.\u201d</p> <p>The initiative, unveiled with a \u00a35m capital project for new medical facilities at the Golden Jubilee hospital in Clydebank, will be known as a capital acceleration programme and will largely be devoted to speeding up existing projects.</p> <p>Despite the implication that the government was bringing forward future spending or using new money, Sturgeon\u2019s official statement on Wednesday did not make it clear that the funds had come from a \u00a3115m underspend last year.</p> <p>A spokesman also added that the \u00a3100m had not yet been allocated or committed. There was no guarantee it would all be spent, and no date yet fixed for updating the Scottish parliament on how and where the money would be used.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a range of factors to be worked through. I can\u2019t say whether this money will be used for new projects or accelerated projects,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Holyrood was told in June that the Scottish government had underspent last year by \u00a375m in its resource budget for day-to-day spending in colleges, schools, and community and housing, and \u00a340m underspent in its capital budget. </p> <p>The finance secretary, Derek Mackay, also told MSPs there was a further \u00a340m underspend from financial transactions, which was ringfenced for loans and equity investments in the private sector. </p> <p>Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour\u2019s economy spokeswoman, said the \u00a3100m seemed like a drop in the ocean against the cost of major infrastructure projects. \u201cThis money coming from previous SNP government underspends shows that it could already have been invested in vital projects,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the SNP are taking Labour\u2019s advice on responding to the economic shocks of Brexit, but this is beginning to look like an attempt to grab headlines rather than a meaningful programme of investment.\u201d</p> <p>Economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) warned in late July that the Brexit vote would have a significant impact on Scotland\u2019s already weak economy, which has been underperforming compared to the UK overall since the global crash in oil prices, pushing it towards recession. </p> <p>The FAI downgraded its GDP forecasts for Scotland for each of the next three years, by 0.5% this year, 1.4% for next year and 1.3% in 2018. Scottish unemployment was likely to rise to 7% next year, it added.</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s announcement follows her visit to Berlin on Tuesday to meet Germany\u2019s Europe minister, Michael Roth, where she again set out her case for a favourable deal for Scotland with the EU in the Brexit talks. </p> <p>Little emerged about the content of the talks, but both ministers said they were constructive. Roth said his government was anxious to preserve Europe\u2019s cohesion during and after the Brexit process.</p> <p>In a statement issued through the Scottish government, Roth said: \u201cThis has been a very pleasant and constructive conversation between two dedicated pro-Europeans and has demonstrated once again that a degree of Europe\u2019s strength lies in its diversity. I hope that the UK finds a way forward that will benefit Europe as a whole in the end.\u201d</p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, was in Glasgow on Wednesday to meet business and community leaders to press the UK government\u2019s competing case for a collective cross-government approach to Brexit. </p> <p>Business groups and the Scottish TUC welcomed Sturgeon\u2019s announcement, although the Scottish Retail Consortium said it came as ministers were putting up business rates on top of a \u00a362m rates hike for larger shops. </p> <p>Grahame Smith, the general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said he strongly the new strategy strongly. \u201cThe Scottish economy, already weak due to the downturn in the oil and gas sector, risks falling into technical recession as a result of Brexit-induced uncertainty. In this context, it is important that the Scottish government accelerates capital projects where feasible in order to support employment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Being gay in Uganda has never made for an easy life. I\u2019ve long refused to hide my sexuality or to be ashamed of who I am.

The night ended in atrocities: violence, torture, arrest and the imprisonment of LGBTI people, including myself.</p> <p>I was seated in the audience when Ugandan police armed to the teeth walked into the venue. They wanted to immediately stop the proceedings. As I started talking to them, they arrested me and my colleague, one of the Pride organisers. My hands were cuffed together with another friend who had organised the event that night. Sixteen of us were arrested for sitting enjoying ourselves, committing no known crime. I was then pushed under the seats of a police pick-up truck and, amid insults and abuse, driven at a high speed to the police station where I was detained for about two hours.</p> <p>Other friends describe that some participants were being held at gunpoint at the club, as police forced them to sit on the ground and have their photos taken by journalists. Before I was taken from the club I saw police beating up transgender people, a trans woman was forcefully being dragged down the stairs by a man not in police uniform. Trans men and women were touched inappropriately as officers of the Ugandan police force tried to establish their \u201creal gender\u201d. They also pulled on a trans women\u2019s hair saying: \u201cWhat is this? This is women\u2019s hair; you are a man.\u201d I was told some police officers holding two men at gunpoint claimed that they were caught having sex. It is beyond me who would have the guts to have sex in that kind of situation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were arrested for enjoying ourselves, committing no known crime. I was then pushed under the seats of a police truck</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the police station, no one took our statements and we were literally thrown into police cells, where we were held for more than an hour. At some point during the night, inmates ordered us to bathe using a dirty water basin and a small piece of soap in a room lit only by a candle. I had to hand my clothes to another inmate who watched to make sure I bathed and there was only small a piece of cloth hanging by the bathroom door for privacy, what looked like an old torn curtain. The intention was clearly to humiliate and intimidate us. Some of my friends were beaten up for \u201cnot bathing properly\u201d.</p> <p>We were then called out of the police cell and paraded into a line and told that we would have to be physically checked to ascertain our gender. They had just picked out myself and five others when someone who was not in police uniform appeared and asked for us to all be released. I later learned that he was the police chief for the particular region.</p> <p>There has been no apology. I still do not know under what law I was arrested and detained. None of us was committing a crime. While gay sex is illegal in Uganda, going to a nightclub with friends for a party is not. Neither do you have to obtain a licence from the police to do so, despite the <a href=\"https://ugandamediacentreblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/government-position-on-the-activies-of-lesibians-gay-bi-sexuals-transgender-lgbt-in-uganda/\" title=\"\">inaccurate and offensive rant</a> that Uganda\u2019s ethics and integrity minister, Simon Lokodo, posted over the weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/20/gay-ugandan-law-tyrannise-life-anti-homosexuality-act\">I am a gay Ugandan about to go home.

  "<p>Peter Taaffe, the veteran leader of Militant \u2013 the hard-left group pushed out of Labour in the 1980s and now renamed the Socialist party \u2013 expects to be readmitted to Labour if Jeremy Corbyn wins September\u2019s leadership election.</p> <p>Taaffe, who was a founding editor of the Militant newspaper and has remained active throughout the movement\u2019s existence, said he had sounded out Corbyn indirectly, including through Mark Serwotka, the leader of the PCS union, about the possibility of reversing Neil Kinnock\u2019s ban on Militant.</p> <p>He said he had met Corbyn on a number of occasions over the years, and believed the leader would continue to open up Labour \u201cto all strands of socialist and working-class opinion\u201d and reject control by a \u201ctop-down, centralised elite\u201d. He added: \u201cThe lava of this revolution is still hot.\u201d</p> <p>The Socialist party\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/\">website</a> reports that members have attended a number of rallies and meetings of Momentum, the grassroots movement set up to back Corbyn. Taaffe said his colleagues had received a warm welcome from some in Labour. \u201cPeople say: you were a long time gone, welcome back.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cI know Jeremy, he\u2019s a good bloke.

But a group of 40, or even 20 or 30, MPs who consistently campaigned against austerity and defended workers in struggle would do far more to strengthen the fightback against the Tories than 232 \u2018Labour\u2019 MPs, a majority who vote for austerity, privatisation and war.\u201d</p> <p>Taaffe has remained politically active throughout the decades since being expelled.</p> <p>He hit back against the deputy leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">Tom Watson\u2019s claims</a> that \u201cTrotskyist entryists\u201d were infiltrating Labour, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether Tom Watson was active in the Labour party when we were. He\u2019s referring to entryists, but we were not entryists, we were born in the Labour party, and we were expelled because we fought Thatcher in Liverpool and defeated her.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he said MPs who backed Tony Blair \u2013 who won three successive general elections for Labour \u2013 were \u201cTory entryists into the Labour party\u201d.</p> <p>Neil Kinnock\u2019s purging of Militant, which culminated in a strongly worded conference speech in 1985 in which he berated the Militant deputy leader of Liverpool council, Derek Hatton, is regarded by many in Labour as a key moment in restoring the party\u2019s electability, though it was another 12 years before it won a general election.</p> <p>But Taaffe and his Socialist party colleagues still believe they should never have been thrown out. \u201cWe were the ones who mobilised people against the poll tax and brought down the Thatcher government,\u201d Taaffe said. Of Kinnock and his colleagues, he said: \u201cThey thought by an administrative measure they could erase social forces from history.\u201d</p> <p>Militant was criticised for operating as a \u201cparty within a party\u201d, but Taaffe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between us being affiliated to the Labour party, in an open and democratic way, and the Co-op party being affiliated?\u201d</p> <p>He said he saw Corbyn\u2019s leadership, and the rapid increase in the size of the Labour party, as part of a global phenomenon that could not be halted by opposition among Labour MPs. \u201cNothing they can do will stop the winds of history as they\u2019re developing at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday Corbyn\u2019s campaign team condemned Watson for \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories\u201d after he warned of \u201cold hands twisting young arms\u201d to shore up support for Corbyn.</p> <p>Taaffe rejected the idea that Socialist party members were only interested in promulgating political revolution rather than winning parliamentary representation.</p> <p>He pointed out that Militant had stood candidates in a number of elections, and its successor organisations had continued to do so, adding that the route to progress for the working classes was \u201cnot exclusively on the streets, or the industrial struggle \u2013 the parliamentary struggle is crucial\u201d.</p> <p>Taaffe\u2019s intervention will alarm many in Labour who fear that veterans of struggles to deselect sitting MPs regarded as on the right of the party in the 1980s have been emboldened by Corbyn\u2019s decision to shift Labour decisively to the left.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s allies have said they want to \u201ccircle the wagons\u201d if, as expected, he wins re-election, and tempt back some of the Labour MPs who resigned from his shadow cabinet.</p> <p>But Taaffe said he should resist the temptation to compromise on his commitment to anti-austerity policies. \u201cThe big mistake for Jeremy Corbyn would be to seek peace with these people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy Corbyn has said austerity is a political choice, not a necessity. That\u2019s the Ark of the Covenant of the movement at the present time.\u201d</p> <p>Later a spokesman for Corbyn said the party\u2019s policy on proscribed groups, including the Socialist Party, had not changed.</p> <h2>Militant history</h2> <p>The clash between the Labour party leadership and the far-left Militant faction was one of the definitive political battles of the 1970s and 1980s. Members of the Trotskyist group, which began as the Revolutionary Socialist League associated with the Militant newspaper, campaigned to get its members elected to key roles in the national Labour party in order to further its agenda.</p> <p>Reg Underhill, Labour\u2019s national agent, repeatedly tried to expel Militant in the late 1970s but the move was rejected by Labour\u2019s national executive committee. Labour\u2019s Young Socialist division was controlled by members of Militant by 1976, with a Militant member the party\u2019s national youth organiser.</p> <p>In 1982 the group was proscribed by the NEC for contravention of the party\u2019s constitution, which said groups could not be affiliated if they had \u201cprogramme, principles and policy for separate and distinctive propaganda\u201d. Five members of the Militant newspaper\u2019s editorial board were expelled from the party, along with many other activists over the following years. However, at its peak in the mid-1980s, membership numbered more than 8,000.</p> <p>The faction\u2019s biggest electoral success was in Liverpool, where the local party and city council were run by members of Militant who went on to set an illegal deficit budget in 1985, in defiance of party policy. The slogan of the local council was \u201cBetter to break the law than break the poor.\u201d</p> <p>With spending higher than income, the council was advised that it would be unable to pay staff wages by November that year, and Militant members decided to issue redundancy notices to every council worker, as a threat to the national government to increase the budget.</p> <p>Speaking at the 1985 Labour party conference, Kinnock condemned the \u201cgrotesque chaos of a Labour council hiring taxis to scuttle round the city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers\u201d. The Liverpool Labour party was suspended soon afterwards by the NEC.</p> <p>Several Militant members were elected as MPs: Dave Nellist and Terry Fields in 1983 and Pat Wall in 1987. Fields was imprisoned for 60 days for non-payment of the new poll tax, a strategy promoted by Militant. The group was a leading organiser of demonstrations against the poll tax, and set up local and national anti-poll tax unions. Kinnock opposed the strategy of non-payment, famously saying: \u201cLawmakers must not be lawbreakers. I have always made that clear.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Militant made formal moves away from the Labour party, setting up the independent Scottish Militant Labour and supporting candidates in Liverpool from a National Union of Students faction called Broad Left. In 1991, Militant declared itself a separate organisation under the name Militant Labour.</p> <p>Of the Labour MPs who had been backed by Militant, Wall died in 1990, and Fields and Nellist were expelled from the party before the 1992 election. Both stood against the official Labour candidates but lost their seats.<br></p> <p>After Tony Blair\u2019s election in 1997, Militant Labour changed its name to the Socialist party of England and Wales.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 August 2016. An earlier version said Terry Fields was expelled from the Labour party in 1991 and Dave Nellist was deselected. Both were expelled.</p>",

The development is a hub of the Fort Myers metropolitan area \u2013 one of the youngest cities in the US and home to 680,000 people. Many of the dark lines through this development on the Gulf of Mexico are not streets but a vast network of constructed canals totalling more than 400 miles. The canal system is so extensive that local ecology and tides have been affected. Boat wakes (image centre) appear as thin white lines on the wide Caloosahatchee river, which separates Cape Coral from Iona. The Caloosahatchee has been extensively engineered to assist river traffic. One such channel is the straight line (top left) cutting through the small islands, or keys. The 3,400ft (1,000m) long Cape Coral Bridge (lower right) was opened in early 1964, just a few years after the founding of the city. The bridge significantly reduces travel times to the cities of Iona and Fort Myers on the opposite side of the river. Another bridge (on the left) leads to Sanibel Island, a popular tourist destination. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"089ad8e50f89a573768c997cabddea38e8a9740b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/089ad8e50f89a573768c997cabddea38e8a9740b/0_0_6800_5200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baffin Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"765\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Credits: Modis/Aqua/Nasa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/Nasa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Summer usually brings foggy and cloudy conditions to Baffin Island, in the remote reaches of Canada\u2019s Nunavut Territory.

  "<p>Two days before he was due to meet the president of the US, Antonio Rodiles was arrested by the Cuban police.<br></p> <p>But this was nothing new \u2013 as a democracy activist in Cuba you get to know the police pretty well. Rodiles estimates that he has been arrested more than 50 times since the beginning of the year.<br></p> <p>I met Rodiles in his house in Havana, shortly after the US president\u2019s historic visit. He was eventually released and met with Obama, who spent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/obama-meets-cuban-dissidents-221095\">two hours with prominent Cuban dissidents and anti-Castro civil society leaders</a>. \u201cIt was a good meeting, but it doesn\u2019t mean we will have a good result,\u201d Rodiles says. And yet, despite plenty of negative experiences, the activist admits that these days, he has moments of optimism.<br></p> <p>Rodiles, a native Cuban, has been openly critical of the Castro government since his return from the US in 2010. A qualified physicist, he spent 12 years away from Cuba until he turned to political activism, concerned and frustrated by the lack of civic liberties in his country.<br></p> <p>His activism is mainly about reclaiming public space and intellectual freedom. Last year he launched <a href=\"http://www.todosmarchamos.com/\">#TodosMarchamos</a> (we all march), an initiative to exercise the right to freedom of expression and take back the streets from the government \u2013 there\u2019s a saying in Cuba \u201c<em>esta calle es de Fidel</em>\u201d (this street belongs to Fidel).<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/25/press-freedom-mexico-murder-threat-duopoly\">Murders, threats and duopoly: the state of press freedom in Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a smaller scale, every Thursday Rodiles hosts meetings at his house \u2013 an organisation called Estado de SATS \u2013 an open space to present art exhibitions, independent films and debates. They are \u201ca kind of therapy session for activists,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no space like this in Cuba. It\u2019s so important to have these kinds of events. People can come here and speak openly without limits. They can say they hate Fidel or even, well, we haven\u2019t had anyone say they like the Castros, but they could do that here,\u201d he jokes.<br></p> <p>And these meetings are poignant. Ex-political prisoners are given a microphone to share their thoughts on the future of Cuba and openly discuss their experiences of their restricted life. It seems to be a lifeline for those who think differently to the Cuban communist ideology; and it is perhaps now more important than ever to continue these discussions. The invitation to meet with Obama was a recognition of their work.<br></p> <p>This all comes against a backdrop of rising repression. \u201cIn general the repression is increasing,\u201d Rodiles says. \u201cThe regime is more violent, more comfortable. People care more about economics than promoting human rights in Cuba.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, there were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.co.uk/world/2016/mar/20/cuba-obama-visit-anti-castro-protesters-clash\">8,500 cases of arbitrary detention in 2015</a> and more than 2,500 in January and February of this year.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305XilibeFA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/305XilibeFA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Antonio Rodiles, after he was beaten by Cuban security agents in July 2015 on his way to a protest.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cWe are suffering more arrests. They [state security forces] are beating us hard,\u201d Rodiles says, his voice measured and calm. It seems he has become desensitised to this violence. If you search Antonio Rodiles online, you will find an image of him with reddened eyes wearing a bloody shirt, his face almost fully covered by a bandage on his nose which was broken, along with his eardrum, in a brutal beating by security agents last year. He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305XilibeFA\">says he was on his way</a> to the Sunday protest organised by opposition movement <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_in_White\">Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White)</a> in July 2015 when he was attacked \u2013 the protest he still attends every week. \u201cThe opposition movement needs to show people you can\u2019t be afraid. That\u2019s the main goal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Economic changes won\u2019t bring political changes; now human rights and democracy are not the priority</p> <footer> <cite>Antonio Rodiles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a political sense there may be no change. \u201cThe regime is more legitimate after the change in relations with the US,\u201d he says. In his view, the growing rapprochement, which began in December 2014, has given the Castro government greater international credit, legitimising a regime that continues to repress dissent. \u201cEconomic changes won\u2019t bring political changes; now human rights and the promotion of democracy are not the priority of the discussion.\u201d<br></p> <p>But for ordinary Cubans and their understanding of their rights, Rodiles is more hopeful. \u201cPeople are more frustrated, more tired, and so they are more engaged. It is like there\u2019s a small hole [in the power of the regime] and as that hole increases things move faster.\u201d<br></p> <p>He moves to show me a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7IZh2BpdfE\">YouTube video by Estado de SATS</a> of a recent demonstration in central Havana. A couple of activists walk down a busy street throwing pro-democracy flyers in the air, shouting \u201c<em>Libertad!</em>\u201d (freedom). After a few moments they are taken away in police cars, but this is when Rodiles gets excited. \u201cLook, look at the people pick up the papers. They are taking papers and reading. For us, this is amazing. People are feeling less afraid.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/09/the-phrase-economic-development-has-bad-associations-in-latin-america\">The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More Cuban people, Rodiles tells me, are talking about change, speaking in the streets about their frustrations, and more interested in a different future.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople are complaining openly and this has never happened before. Little by little people are realising more government broken promises. When you start to break that order you start to break the system. People need to feel as though they have the right to be a human being, and after that you\u2019re ready to face the regime.\u201d</p> <p>Rodiles rises abruptly from his chair \u2013 it\u2019s a Thursday and he needs to get ready for the the Estado de SATS meeting. Today they\u2019re showing Richard Attenborough\u2019s Gandhi. Perhaps he sees something of himself in the civil rights leader. \u201cI don\u2019t do this because I\u2019m brave,\u201d Rodiles says. \u201cI do it because I feel tired of these people.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

That figure showed at 3% but we know the real figure is far higher.\u201d</p> <p> Kett says there have been government efforts to support disabled people by including them in wider national poverty alleviation strategies. This is believed to be primarily due to effective lobbying by the Liberian disability community. But there is little dedicated support. She is leading a three-year <a href=\"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=ES/L005719/1\">research project</a>, funded by the UK Department for International Development and the Economic and Social Research Council, exploring the wellbeing and poverty experienced by people with and without disabilities in the same community.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that poverty and disability feed into each other. Poor people are more likely to become disabled through lack of access to healthcare, clean water \u2026 and disabled people are more likely to be poor. But what we are less sure of is how those links are perpetuated,\u201d says Kett.</p> <p>\u201cDisabled people are some of the most marginalised and excluded in Liberian society but unpacking whether they are marginalised because they are poor or because they are disabled is more of a challenge, but very important in terms of being able to address these issues properly.\u201d</p> <p>The research will help the drafting and implementation of new human rights and disability action plans for the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99639ad4d8b33e6448aae2c0be0da9c7dad7a753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99639ad4d8b33e6448aae2c0be0da9c7dad7a753/2688_0_3072_3840/800.jpg\" alt=\"Varney N Steward, who set up a school despite being blind and destitute, is led along by his son at his school in Lowah, Montserrado County.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Varney N Steward, who set up a school despite being blind and destitute, is led along by his son at his school in Lowah, Montserrado County.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Varney N Steward lost his sight after contracting <a href=\"http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/onchocerciasis_disease_information/en/\">river blindness</a> during Liberia\u2019s civil wars.

  "<p>One of the great things about science is that it allows you to make predictions. Three top climate scientists just made a very bold prediction regarding sea level rise; we should know in a few years if they are correct. <br></p> <p>As humans emit greenhouse gases, it\u2019s causing the Earth to warm. That\u2019s indisputable and proven. We can actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">measure the amount of extra heat</a>. Since most of it ends up in the oceans, we can also measure other changes in the oceans.</p> <p>For instance, the oceans are rising. We know that\u2019s indisputable. Measurements taken from physical gauges and from satellites confirm sea level rise. The cause of the rise is more complex. <br></p> <p>Part of the rise is from ocean warming \u2013 warm water is less dense so the sea level rises as temperatures increase. Another part of the rise is from melting ice, especially ice that is currently on land (like glaciers and ice sheets). As this ice melts and flows into the oceans, the water levels rise. A third reason for sea level changes is from alterations of where water is stored on the planet. For instance, changing rainfall patterns and storage of water underground, in lakes, or in the atmosphere can affect sea levels. <br></p> <p>The three ways we know sea levels are rising are from physical tide gauges, from satellites that measure the water height, and from satellites that measure where ice is stored across the globe. While tide gauge measurements go back many years, they only measure water levels at their location. Many tide gauges have to be in place to get an accurate sense of what is happening globally. <br></p> <p>Satellites, on the other hand, are much more capable of taking global measurements. The problem with satellites is they have only been taking measurements since approximately 1993 (not nearly as long as tide gauges). So scientists try to combine these two measurements to get a long-term and global picture of what is really happening. <br></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31245\">very recent paper</a> published in Nature has evaluated the history of sea level rise, and what they find is really interesting. The lead author (<a href=\"http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/fasullo/\">John Fasullo</a> from the National Center for Atmospheric Research) and his colleagues tried to determine if the rate of sea level rise is changing. That is, are the water levels rising linearly, the same amount each year? Or, is the rate increasing (faster and faster each year)? <br></p> <p>Using satellite data, the authors found little evidence of an acceleration. However, they show that this is because the satellites began measuring in 1993, right after a large volcanic eruption (Mount Pinatubo). This eruption temporarily reduced global warming because particles from the eruption blocked sunlight. Just by coincidence, the timing of the satellites and the eruption has affected the water rise so that it appears to be linear. Had the eruption not occurred, the rate would have increased.</p> <p>This allows the scientists to make a prediction: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>barring another major volcanic eruption, a detectable acceleration is likely to emerge from the noise of internal climate variability in the coming decade.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This means that the authors will be able to statistically observe an increase, even though the Earth experiences natural changes that may mask any increase.</p> <p>I communicated with Dr. Fasullo, asking him why this paper is so important. He told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>This article shows that the acceleration of sea level rise is real and ongoing. It is also an example of how climate models can play a key role in both the interpretation of observations and the prediction of near-future climate.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>While only time will tell if they are right, I\u2019d put my money on the scientists. </p>",
  "<p>Val Aubrey parked her boat trailer on the shore of Eagle Lake, in north-eastern California. She walked to an overlook where a sign warned against swimming and diving. \u201cThis\u201d \u2013 she opened her arms wide \u2013 \u201cused to be the marina.\u201d<br></p> <p>Down below, docks sat among nettles and thistles growing on what used to be the lake bed. The boat ramp led to sunbaked dirt, and squirrels skittered across the concrete. </p> <p>\u201cThey put a tombstone right in the middle of it,\u201d said Aubrey, pointing into the undergrowth. Sure enough, a small Halloween decoration had been erected in the former harbor.</p> <p>One of the largest natural lakes in the state, Eagle Lake is a shock of blue amid a tawny, isolated upland. But it has fallen around 15ft since 1999, a decline thought to have been exacerbated by climate change.</p> <p>The main lakeside community of Spalding, a 30-minute drive north of the marina, is dotted with \u201cfor sale\u201d signs, and its tidy streets are empty. The waterfront is now a meadow, and the lake has receded to a thin strip in the distance, like an alluring mirage.</p> <p>There are no longer any restaurants, and the general store is shuttered. Adding to the air of misfortune, dozens of the wells that supply residents with water have gone dry, necessitating deeper ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd6e9ba1a5e62dd83b53f8f3bac9e0d24c34ddcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd6e9ba1a5e62dd83b53f8f3bac9e0d24c34ddcc/0_135_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Val Aubrey with her boat, Dream Catcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Val Aubrey with her boat, Dream Catcher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Gee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hardships facing the lake stand in contrast to its reputation as a fishery. <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/outdoors/article/Hard-times-have-ravaged-former-gem-8344561.php\">According to</a> the outdoors writer Tom Stienstra, \u201cIt was among the most prized lakes in America.\u201d </p> <p>Its main attraction is the indigenous Eagle Lake rainbow trout, whose salmon-colored meat is said to be uncommonly delicious. Anglers continue to land big, healthy fish. But half as many of them are visiting, in part because only one boat ramp on the entire, 13-mile-long lake is still operational.</p> <p>\u201cGimme water, lord,\u201d said Aubrey, a 56-year-old with a sea-dog vibe and a cigarette crackle in her voice. \u201cI think that\u2019s the thought of everyone round here.\u201d</p> <p>In the shadow of the disused marina, she backed her trailer down the ramp and into the glassy shallows as chub minnows darted away. There was a thump as the wheels dropped onto the mud at the end, a sign of how close the structure is to being unusable. Aubrey undid some clips, and her 19-footer, Dream Catcher, floated onto the lake.</p> <p>Chugging out, it was hard to tell that anything was amiss. The unruffled water stretched to sere, tree-speckled hills and a cloudless sky. White pelicans cruised past like ungainly swans. Grebes emitted tinkling chirps and chuckles, and pairs of them performed a courtship dance in which they lifted themselves off the surface and appeared to run across it. When the boat approached, they dove underwater instead of flying away.</p> <p>Once a fishing guide, Aubrey wore enamel earrings in the shape of trout. \u201cThere\u2019s more to Eagle Lake than just fishing,\u201d she said. \u201cOur hearts are here. Our souls are here.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, spurs of dry land have appeared where previously there was none. Aubrey pulled into the lee of a sand bar that had gradually risen out of the waves. \u201cBefore this area was above water, this was just black with grebes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Last year, some vast northern sections of the lake almost dried up completely, only to be regenerated, to a certain extent, by the winter rains. They were still too shallow for Dream Catcher. </p> <p>Back at the marina, operated by a couple named Grace and Scott McCullough, it was lunchtime. With vacationers perusing snacks and fishing lures in the large, well-stocked shop, and hot food on offer from a trailer, it felt like the vacation spot that Eagle Lake prides itself on being.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a309ae163a4c02579be257b79aa352b1ba5a6bf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a309ae163a4c02579be257b79aa352b1ba5a6bf6/0_131_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grace and Scott McCullough on the boat ramp at Eagle Lake marina, once full of water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grace and Scott McCullough on the boat ramp at Eagle Lake marina, once full of water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Gee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sitting in the storeroom, Grace ticked off some theories she\u2019d heard to explain the low water. Perhaps someone had bought the rights to the aquifer and was secretly draining it. Maybe cloud-seeding at a neighboring lake was leaving them with less moisture.</p> <p>As she sees it, the decline is part of a normal cycle. It\u2019s true that California is prone to drought, and Eagle Lake\u2019s level, determined primarily by precipitation, has oscillated over the decades. Its longtime historic low was in the 1930s, though in 2015 it went lower.</p> <p>At a picnic table outside, there was skepticism as to whether Eagle Lake was at the vanguard of a more ominous, human-influenced global shift. \u201cI\u2019m not an over-the-top believer that we can adjust the climate of this earth that much,\u201d said Scott McCullough, a retired marine.</p> <p>\u201cI agree with Scott,\u201d said Lee Crane, a semi-retired dentist from Sacramento, who was eating burgers at the other end of the table with his wife, Dottie. \u201cYou could take all the diesel stacks in the United States and let \u2018em go and the earth wouldn\u2019t know the difference, in my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Bobette Jones, an ecologist with the Eagle Lake ranger district, sees it differently. With less snow falling in the area, there is less snowmelt to recharge the watershed, while more dry months each year mean increased evaporation.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty strong trend that the lake is definitely going to be much more shallow in the future,\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a doom-and-gloom and not-happy story, but that is what the data is showing. Hopefully we\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"403f51d8d355ca4fba461fa873cc3c909eba321a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/403f51d8d355ca4fba461fa873cc3c909eba321a/0_461_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of the Eagle Lake marina in better days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo of the Eagle Lake marina in better days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Gee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As evening approached, boat mechanic James Watts was stood in the weedy lot of his repair shop in Spalding.</p> <p>\u201cOn opening morning, I\u2019d have boats lined up down the street,\u201d he said, referring to the start of the fishing season. \u201cNow as you see there ain\u2019t no boats around here.\u201d</p> <p>Watts fell for Eagle Lake on a fishing trip, and his family built the shop over 20 years ago. In 2013, he was forced to move the business to a nearby town, where there was more money to be made. All around him were the broken-down boats he was saving for spares and others he was storing for acquaintances. Almost the only sound was the shushing of wind through the trees.</p> <p>\u201cWe watched the water level go and every year it was like, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll come back, it\u2019ll come back. And three years ago was when it actually turned and went to nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Wearing a grimy work shirt bearing his name, Watts lit a cigarette, leaned against one of the hulls, and stared into space. Surely the lake would return to Spalding, he mused, even if not during his lifetime.</p>",

It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for victims and survivors to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/09/thousands-child-abuse-victims-invited-testify-truth-project-lowell-goddard-independent-inquiry\" title=\"\">have their voices heard</a> and for whistleblowers to share their knowledge and experiences of what went on \u2013 and in some cases continues to happen \u2013 within institutions that have failed children. The inquiry has statutory powers to compel witnesses to come forward, and now the infrastructure is in place it is progressing with its investigation. It wants to hear from victims and survivors if they were sexually abused while in an institution; or if they were failed by an institution, such as the police, social services or their school, after reporting the incident or incidences only for the appropriate action not to be taken.</p> <p>I joined the victims and survivors\u2019 consultative panel in July 2015. Since then, we have been working with all the different teams within the inquiry to put systems and processes in place, recruit and train staff, and set up offices to undertake \u201ctruth project\u201d sessions. In these sessions, victims and survivors are able to share their experiences of child sexual abuse with a facilitator, who will record what they are told. Alternatively, they can make written submissions to the inquiry.</p> <p>Many victims and survivors will not report abuse to their families or the police because they do not want to deal with the consequences. However, being able to share their experiences via the truth project and being believed (often for the first time), without being judged or cross-examined, will be a liberating moment for many. It is important that all victims and survivors of child sexual abuse (who want to) join together to make this inquiry a success.</p> <p>No one actually knows the true scale of child sexual abuse in England and Wales as it has been hidden from sight for decades. Most abuse happens within the home environment, but it was brought to the attention of the public via high-profile cases such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/27/jimll-fix-it-staff-were-told-not-to-leave-savile-alone-with-children\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a> and the gangs of men who sexually exploited underage girls in towns including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/26/three-brothers-jailed-over-rotherham-child-sexual-abuse\" title=\"\">Rotherham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rochdale-child-sex-ring\" title=\"\">Rochdale</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No one knows the true scale of child sexual abuse in England and Wales as it has been hidden from sight for decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In November 2015, the children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, in her report <a href=\"http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/learn-more/child-sexual-exploitation-abuse/protecting-children-harm\" title=\"\">Protecting Children from Harm</a>, stated: \u201cOnly one in eight children are known to have reported the abuse they suffered as a child\u201d. This means that only one in eight received the vital intervention needed to keep them safe and help them to overcome their experiences. It also means that seven out of eight children are growing up as adults whose lives will be impacted in some way \u2013 be it through addictions, depression and anxiety, relationship issues or other problems, as a result of the abuse they have suffered. Every victim and survivor deserves the opportunity to be heard and to be believed.</p> <p>We need to know the scale of the UK\u2019s child sexual abuse problem in order to put in place the necessary solutions. With or without Goddard, the inquiry will play an important role in working this out, and offer crucial recommendations to help victims and survivors move on with their lives and protect future generations.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour party has selected the MP for Liverpool Walton, Steve Rotheram, as its candidate to fight the Liverpool city region mayoral election in May 2017.<br></p> <p>Rotheram, who is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s private parliamentary secretary, won a decisive victory over the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, and the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Luciana Berger.</p> <p>The election was conducted under the alternative vote system. In the first round, Rotheram won 42%, Anderson won 34% and Berger 25%. In the second round, once Berger voters\u2019 second preferences were redistributed, Rotheram won 55% and Anderson won 42%.</p> <p>Of Berger\u2019s voters who named a second preference, 62% chose Rotheram and 38% chose Anderson. A total of 4,872 local party members placed a vote, a turnout of 72.6%.</p> <p>Rotheram, a vocal supporter of the Labour leader, is a former bricklayer and lord mayor of Liverpool, and has won fans locally with his active role in the campaign to get justice for the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster.</p> <p>The Liverpool city region has a population of 1.5 million and covers five Merseyside councils \u2013 Knowsley, Liverpool, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral \u2013 plus Halton in Cheshire.

I supported my best mate Andy Burnham and I did everything that I could to get Andy elected. But when the result came out in September 2015, we got whacked. There was an overwhelming support for Jeremy and, therefore, I think it\u2019s right that we get behind the leader of the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>Of the 17 MPs representing constituencies in the Liverpool city region, 15 are Labour, one is a Liberal Democrat and one is a Conservative. The dominance of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> party in the area means that Rotheram will be the odds-on favourite to win.</p> <p> Anderson, a prominent local government figure in Liverpool who campaigned for the creation of the metro mayor role, was initially the favourite to win the race and said he was heartbroken at the result. His role as mayor of the city of Liverpool is unaffected by the new metro mayor role and he will stay in post until May 2020 after winning a second term in this year\u2019s local elections.</p> <p>He has previously criticised Westminster politicians for standing for the metro mayor nominations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/01/liverpools-mayor-ignorant-insensitive-andy-burnham\">describing Burnham\u2019s assertion</a> that the role of metro mayor was a \u201ccabinet-level job requiring cabinet-level experience\u201d as \u201cignorant and insensitive\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful to every local government leader who has worked hard for their area\u201d.</p> <p>Berger, a former shadow minister for mental health, was the last person to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/luciana-berger-liverpool-mayor-should-be-global-ambassador-for-city-says-labour-hopeful\">declare she was entering</a> the race, becoming the second member of the shadow cabinet in a month \u2013 after Burnham \u2013 to announce their intention to stand for a metro mayor position.

  "<p>Do you trust the private sector? No? Neither do I. But I also know that we have to find a way to overcome the knee-jerk reaction that all private sector is bad, and all public sector is good. Because nowhere in the world do we have (or, in the main, want) a situation where we have all markets or all states delivering what we need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/14/i-quit-my-development-job-and-ate-some-humble-pie-this-is-what-i-learned\">I quit my development job and ate some humble pie: this is what I learned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My inherent cynicism isn\u2019t without evidence: there is an endless list of corporate wrongdoing in the developing world. The private sector has different incentives from the public or NGO sector and markets don\u2019t necessarily reward good behaviour. Indeed, quite often, at least in the short-term, they offer the strongest incentives for those who can find ways to cut standards and lower costs, exploiting anyone and everything in their wake.</p> <p>But nonetheless, I still think its time to get beyond the rhetoric. The arguments have hardly changed in fifteen years, and, quite frankly, I\u2019m bored. The lines are pitched as an argument between the pragmatists and the idealists: those who partner with the private sector, and those who campaign against them. On the one side, you get <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/the-power-of-collaboration-6-success-factors-for-private-ngo-partnerships-86366\">Care\u2019s partnership with Cargill</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/barbara-frost/clean-water_b_10923698.html\">Wateraid\u2019s partnership with Diageo</a>. For this camp, collaborating with the private sector is perceived as necessary and inevitable. Governments have failed people, they might say, and NGOs can\u2019t deliver to scale. Putting a private-sector lens to the challenge of development has brought innovation and the newly worn phrase \u201cdisruption\u201d to a tired industry. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Private-sector led development will be Priti Patel's calling card</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For others, however \u2013 let\u2019s call them the idealists \u2013 private sector-led development removes people\u2019s rights and individual freedoms, while further embedding corporate control of everything. For this camp, NGOs who partner with the private sector have undermined our mutual, long-term cause.</p> <p>The pragmatists are certainly more in favour with the government of the day. The UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID)\u2019s new minister, Priti Patel, the former tobacco lobbyist who once wanted to axe the entire department, will continue the priorities already set by her predecessor. Private-sector led development will be her calling card, and collaborations between NGOs and the private sector will be at an even greater premium. Any NGO wanting a future funding relationship with DfID will be expected to tow the line. They were already giving roughly a third of their budget away to the private sector or private sector partnerships with NGOs. This could easily rise.</p> <p>The idealist in me is concerned. Development agendas centred around rights and freedoms have been taking a back seat to the business of economic development \u2013 the pragmatists seem to have won. DfID\u2019s statement of purpose says, among other things: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development/about\">\u201cwe\u2019re ending the need for aid by creating jobs\u201d</a> as if development were just a matter of employment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs\">Forget 'developing' poor countries, it's time to 'de-develop' rich countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So who is right? The pragmatists or the idealists? Are those who eschew private-sector partnerships just ideologues, blind to modern realities? Or has the NGO sector really sold out to the highest bidder, throwing their ideals out the window?</p> <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that in roughly the same period as we\u2019ve seen a rise of private-sector led development, we\u2019ve also seen some worrying trends: rising levels of inequality over the past 15 years, more insecure work, environmental degradation and tax evasion on a massive scale. NGOs who enter into partnerships are clearly not to blame for these outcomes, but should we be asking: have they aided and abetted their rise, concentrating power into the hands of the wealthy?</p> <p>Frustratingly, it\u2019s not that simple. Moral clarity makes campaigning easier, but as Duncan Green pointed out to me recently: NGOs, even more radical ones, spend a lot more time working with the private sector than they care to admit. \u201cSmall farmers and SMEs or cooperatives are as important a part of the private sector \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than big irrelevant corporations,\u201d he said. We need to reframe this debate, he argued: it\u2019s not about private v public, but about size, scale, and form.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/07/sdgs-progress-stay-humble\">We won't conquer the mountains of the SDGs without humility</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crux of the matter is the relevant role of NGOs. A DfID model sees NGOs as just one vehicle to deliver economic growth, to help raise standards in the private sector or to provide some basic services to the poor. Where NGOs sing, however, is in their ability to challenge unfair structures, not to pander to them. Can NGOs really be both partner, and provocateur? Instead of bringing influence and innovation, have relationships with the private sector rendered NGOs role as advocate, watchdog and change agent, marginalised and ineffective?</p> <p>Sunita Narain, the chief executive of India\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cseindia.org/\">Centre for Science and the Environment</a>, speaking recently at the Institute of Development Studies\u2019 50th anniversary conference, said that many in development believe that over the past period, we\u2019ve empowered society through the growth of the market. Instead, she asked us provocatively: \u201cWhich society? The poor or the rich?\u201d</p> <p>If private sector-led development, and the partnerships it brings, can be about genuine power shifts, then I would shout from the rooftops. But for now, that small, cooperative private sector that Green refers to is hidden in the shadows, lacking power and toothless. Most NGOs will continue to take big corporate cash, while holding their critical tongues of dissent. All private sector development is certainly not bad \u2013 but the type of private-sector led development, I fear, that Patel foresees, is far from this type of genuine shift.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Mustang did manage to squeeze in a shirt sponsorship before their scheme ran out of puff, when during a six-month period in 2002, the brand graced the kits of <a href=\"http://www.futbolred.com/contenido/liga-aguila/noticias/fecha12015/IMAGEN/IMAGEN-15156655-2.png\">Millonarios FC</a> (that\u2019s the Millonarios of Di Stefano and Goycochea fame).\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, sponsorship in Indonesia led to some very oddly named competitions. \u201cIndonesian football (sadly) has a very close relationship with the tobacco industry,\u201d writes Adi Prasatya. \u201cWhen our pro league system was rebooted in the mid-90s, the league\u2019s main sponsor was Bentoel, a local tobacco giant. The inaugural season in 1994 was named \u2018Liga Dunhill\u2019, a cigarette brand distributed by Bentoel. As part of the sponsorship deal, all clubs must put the Dunhill logo in front of their shirts.</p> <p>\u201cDunhill lasted for two seasons, and for the third season Bentoel used the league to hawk their Kansas-brand cigarettes, which resulted in the ridiculously named Liga Kansas \u2013 no relation whatsoever with the heartland of America. Bentoel has since been acquired by the British American Tobacco. The league is no longer sponsored by the tobacco industry, but their grip on the football scene remains strong. You cannot watch a football game on TV without seeing a cigarette ad.\u201d</p> <p>But the relationship was not all one way. As Ben Marlow writes to point out, West Brom displayed <a href=\"http://www.sportsworldcards.com/ekmps/shops/sportsworld/images/west-bromwich-albion-garth-crooks-369-panini-football-86-rare-trading-sticker-36113-p.jpg\">an anti-smoking symbol on their shirts during the 1985-86 season</a> and John Terry has (inadvertently) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/03/john-terry-anti-smoking-india\">been involved in the anti-smoking message</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71d3d16e14cd0f5ff83635fd7cd9b8df44524e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71d3d16e14cd0f5ff83635fd7cd9b8df44524e3/239_284_2355_1574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Brom\u2019s squad for the 1985-86 season pose for a team photograph with their anti-smoking symbols.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Brom\u2019s squad for the 1985-86 season pose for a team photograph with their anti-smoking symbols.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Teams playing under another\u2019s crest</h2> <p><strong>Last week Giorgi Pirtskhelani emailed from Tbilisi, Georgia, with a photo from the 1997 top-flight meeting between city rivals Dinamo and Locomotive. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/03/football-transfer-records-broken-by-teams-outside-the-top-division#img-4\">As we see, Locomotive are wearing Manchester City\u2019s 1994-96 away shirt</a> and they played with it for the whole season.

Teams wearing seemingly random kits of other sides seems to be a rarer occurrence, although there are some examples.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/05/knowledge-teams-wearing-opponents-kit\">Which teams have had to wear their opponents' kit? | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn the 1972-73 season, the north-east\u2019s lower-division needle match, Darlington v Hartlepool, was held as usual at Feethams, with the Quakers in their usual white and black kit, and Hartlepool in blue (though not stripes on this occasion),\u201d writes Simon Atkinson. \u201cA close inspection of the badge on the visitors\u2019 shirts, however, revealed a very familiar sight though not in that context. Yes, a lion rampant, the letters \u2018CFC\u2019 and the detail: \u2018League Cup Final 1972.\u2019 </p> <p>\u201cThe reason was that a fire at the Victoria Ground had destroyed a lot of Hartlepool\u2019s kit. Chelsea had taken pity and kindly donated a set of shirts. Having lost that final, of course, Chelsea probably couldn\u2019t get rid of them quickly enough, though the name of the recipient\u2019s ground would have been a bitter reminder since the winners at Wembley had been Stoke City, then of another Victoria Ground.\u201d</p> <p>And here\u2019s a tale from Ian Williams: \u201cIn 2005, in the African Champions League, ASFA Yennenga of Burkina Faso turned up in Cape Town to play Ajax. Now, Ajax\u2019s kit is pretty iconic. And Yennenga\u2019s home kit has always been yellow and green, so far as I can determine. But they pitched up with a red away kit. With less than 24 hours to go, they realised they needed a kit, but by this time it was Saturday afternoon, and most sports shops were closed. </p> <p>\u201cNo problem \u2013 we are a tourist city after all, and South Africa was earmarked to host the 2010 World Cup, so buying a dozen Bafana Bafana shirts proved pretty easy. Slap on a set of numbers, good to go. But some genius decided that playing with the SA badge and flag was bad luck for the Burkinabe. So went to work with a marker pen, and scribbled over both national symbols. <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2005-03-21-burkina-faso-soccer-team-defaced-sa-flag\">Cue outrage from Safa</a>.\u201d</p> <h2>Four off?

Fredy Montero, for instance, on loan from Seattle Sounders, scored three as Sporting Lisbon beat FC Arouca 5-1. In the Bundesliga, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang marked his debut for Borussia Dortmund with three goals in a 4-0 win against Augsburg, and not a scuffer among them. In the Eredivisie, meanwhile, Zakaria Bakkali started life at PSV\u2019s Philips Stadion with a trio of goals against NEC Nijmegen (and funnily enough, another PSV player, J\u00fcrgen Locadia, scored a hat-trick on his league debut last season).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/20/footballers-playing-in-major-international-finals-after-club-relegations\">Footballers playing in major international finals after club relegations | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They add their names to a list that includes the likes of Fabrizio Ravenelli, who put three past Liverpool on his Middlesbrough debut at the start of the 1996-97 season (by the way, John Barnes\u2019s goal in that game is delightful); Wayne Rooney, who scored three against Fenerbahce on his Manchester United debut nine years ago, and none of them from closer than 18 yards; and Alan Shearer, who had previously come on as a sub for Southampton but made his full debut against Arsenal and scored three of the four goals that secured Southampton victory in April 1988. It made him the youngest player ever to score a top-flight hat-trick.</p> <p>These three-goal slackers obviously didn\u2019t match Lingard\u2019s feat, but there are those who have. Earlier in 2013, as the German club Energie Cottbus began their pre-season schedule, Charles Takyi made his debut in a 17-1 drubbing of Mullroser and scored four goals before being replaced at half-time. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t really count, but for the sake of completeness, you should also know about Patrick Weihrauch, who was \u2013 at the time of writing \u2013 yet to play a competitive match for Bayern Munich but scored four when he played in their sharpener against a Wildenau Weiden Fans XI. And while we\u2019re on training matches, we ought to nod to Emmanuel Ake, who stayed in Denmark in February 2012 just about long enough to score five goals on debut for Svebolle, who beat Frederiksberg 7-4 that day.</p> <p>Flicking back through the archives, we found a few further examples, all of them from bona fide competitive matches to boot. First to St James\u2019 Park, where on the first day of the 1989-90 season Micky Quinn, top scorer for relegated Portsmouth the season before, marked his arrival with four goals in Newcastle\u2019s 5-2 win over Leeds United. The visitors actually took a 2-1 lead after Quinn had opened the scoring from the penalty spot, but the tide turned in the second half. The crowd were beside themselves by the time Quinn ran through an exposed Leeds defence to slot his fourth past Mervyn Day. \u201cOh my word, it\u2019s that man Quinn again!\u201d This would become a recurring phrase that season, as Quinn scored 34 league goals and 39 in all competitions.</p> <p>Now to Turf Moor, January 1957, where a 17-year-old Ian Lawson was about to make his debut for Burnley in an FA Cup third-round match against Chesterfield. Within four minutes of kick-off, Lawson had given Burnley the lead and with the last kick of the game he scored his fourth to round off a thumping 7-0 win. In the next round, by the way, Burnley beat New Brighton 9-0, with Lawson scoring another three.<br></p> <p>And, finally, all the way back to November 1934, where Arthur Milne celebrated his move from Brechin Vics to Dundee United with four goals in United\u2019s 9-6 league win over Edinburgh City. In his three years at the club he scored 85 goals in 81 games.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</em></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/05/the-joy-of-six-sporting-pitch-fiascos\">The recent Joy of Six regarding pitches</a> reminded me of a story when Wales where playing a friendly against Brazil and narrowed the pitch before the game to counter the threat of the Brazilian wingers.

The truth is that China would have far, far too much to lose if it were to start compromising other countries\u2019 national security.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union had put the country in a difficult position regarding trade, where we needed China more than it needed us, Mandelson said in comments that suggested that Britain could not afford to alienate Asia\u2019s rising power. </p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are in a slightly invidious position in trade vis-a-vis China, despite the size of our market we are probably less relevant to China out of the European Union because we would be unable to influence that huge bloc\u2019s future trade policies anymore and out of the EU we are probably more dependent on China\u2019s goodwill because we will need to replace trade lost in Europe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95/0_121_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hinkley Point C power station site near Bridgwater.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hinkley Point C power station site near Bridgwater.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo we are not in the happiest of positions, but this is the reality and we have got to adopt a pragmatic approach to this.

Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point \u2013 and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman later<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\"> said the delays did not signal a cooling of enthusiasm for trade with China</a>. Treasury sources added that Philip Hammond, who travelled to China last month for the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in his first overseas visit as chancellor, was no less committed to securing Chinese investment into Britain than his predecessor, George Osborne, who had promised to inaugurate a \u201cgolden decade\u201d of cooperation between the two countries.</p> <p>EDF, the French state energy company which is due to build Hinkley point C, brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board help spread the financial load by taking a 33% stake in the project. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>The project is heavily subsidised by the UK taxpayer, and the government has promised to pay well over the current market rates for electricity generated by the new reactor. </p>",

Married at 12 to her cousin, she faced so much violence from him that her widowed mother returned 50,000 CFA francs (\u00a364) of the dowry in the hope of a divorce. But when Nafissa and her mother moved to Mbera in 2013, he followed them. He raped her and she gave birth to a boy, Mohamed, who is now 18 months old. Then, Nafissa began having epileptic fits.</p> <p>The local branch of humanitarian agency <a href=\"https://www.intersos.org/en/mauritania/\">Intersos</a> and the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, raised the money to pay back the balance of the dowry \u2013 250,000 ouguiyas (\u00a3535) \u2013 and applied to a judge for a restraining order against Nafissa\u2019s husband, which was granted.

  "<p>Scores of seals loll on the riverbank of the Stour, snorting and bellyflopping as they sun themselves a couple of miles outside Ramsgate\u2019s busy marina.<br></p> <p>Far from exceptional, these are just a smattering of the hundreds of seals that the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) hopes to count this week in the Greater Thames estuary. The mammals are sighted as far up as Teddington Lock, and <a href=\"http://sites.zsl.org/inthethames/#Public sightings\">Canary Wharf is a hotspot for seeing them</a>.<br></p> <p>A total of 905 common and grey seals were found along the estuary last year, up from 708 during the first survey in 2013, counted from plane, boat and on foot. ZSL\u2019s spotters take advantage of the seals\u2019 moulting season in August, when they shuffle up sandbanks to shed their coat and grow a new one, making double-counting less likely.<br></p> <p>But while experts have celebrated the rise of the seals along the Thames, there are fears this year of a triple threat to these marine predators.<br></p> <p>Several miles south-east off the coast from Ramsgate is Goodwin Sands, a sort of \u201cspaghetti junction\u201d for seals to haul out after travelling from Europe. It is here that the port of Dover hopes to dredge for sand to expand its operations, a move opposed by many local people and environmentalists.<br></p> <p>Joanna Barker, ZSL\u2019s conservation scientist, said she was concerned at the potential impact, after 75% of last year\u2019s grey seals were counted there. \u201cI think, and many other scientists think, it could be quite an important meeting point for seals coming from mainland Europe because it\u2019s one of most eastern sandbanks of its type.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are a bit worried about the impact on seals. We would like to see the dredging \u2013 if it does take place \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take place in important times in seal biology. We wouldn\u2019t want to see dredging in the pupping [breeding] times.\u201d<br></p> <p>A petition has attracted nearly 10,000 signatures and last month actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/05/mark-rylance-backs-campaign-to-stop-dredging-off-kent-coast-save-our-sands\">Mark Rylance backed a campaign against the dredging of the sandbanks</a>, which have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/19/dredging-proposed-kent-marine-conservation-zone-risk\">proposed for designation as a marine conservation zone</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f4a95b18487c83d6a423700dc66aca28306135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f4a95b18487c83d6a423700dc66aca28306135/0_0_2154_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A total of 905 common and grey species were counted along the estuary last year from Deal in Kent to in Lowestoft in Suffolk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A total of 905 common and grey species were counted along the estuary last year from Deal in Kent to in Lowestoft in Suffolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also concerns over a repeat of an outbreak of a deadly virus which wiped out thousands of seals in 1988 and 2002. Phocene distemper virus has been <a href=\"http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WM0301_5242_FRP.pdf\">described by government scientists</a> as one of the largest and most high-profile animal disease epidemics to have hit indigenous British wildlife.<br></p> <p>Barker said the apparent 14-year cycle suggested it could emerge again in 2016, though ZSL\u2019s fourth count so far has found no evidence yet in the estuary. One sign of human influence is the occasional \u201crusty seal\u201d among the common seals here \u2013 iron oxide in the water has turned their fur orange.<br></p> <p>Close to Ramsgate, these common seals are unfazed by daytrippers cruising by on boats, while those out at more remote sandbanks would take flight if humans approached. However, the common seals may have more to worry about from the much larger greys.<br></p> <p>Weighing up to 300kg, there is an increasing body of evidence that grey seals are spurning their usual diet of 8kg of fish a day and instead preying on both common seals and harbour porpoises.<br></p> <p>Video captured last year appeared to show a grey seal <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/grey-seal-eats-harbour-porpoise-5485690\">eating a harbour porpoise off the coast of Pembrokeshire</a>, while one study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/26/grey-seals-identified-as-killers-behind-mystery-harbour-porpoise-deaths\">laid the blame for a series of mystery porpoise deaths off the Dutch coast on greys</a>.

They could outcompete the harbour seal due to their size at haul-out sites but also by eating a lot of their prey,\u201d said Barker.</p> <p>While the ZSL surveys have found common seal populations in the area to be relatively stable, the number of greys has increased dramatically, she said. The 2015 survey recorded 451 common seals and 454 grey seals in the estuary, versus around 500 of the former and 200 of the latter in 2013.<br></p> <p>The results of the 2016 survey will be out in a few weeks, but in the meantime there is the practical work of counting them. Earlier in the morning, Barker flew around the estuary, tallying them on paper from the air, and taking photos to double check later with colleagues.<br></p> <p>On the Stour, she tots up 72 common and two greys, before passing a grey chewing on a huge fish in the marina as her afternoon\u2019s seal spotting draws to a close.</p>",

They said the launchers could be made operational, if needed, with rocket artillery rounds within two or three days.</p> <p>The Guardian was unable to verify the report, which cited unnamed western officials, and Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry said the information was inaccurate.</p> <p>Yet the report entrenches fears of militarisation and potential conflicts in the South China Sea, the most contentious issue in east Asia.</p> <p>Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines\">the Philippines</a>, Taiwan and Japan have overlapping claims with China to islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The region is thought to have significant oil and gas reserves and is a route for roughly \u00a33.17tn in trade.</p> <p>The launchers are believed to be part of Vietnam\u2019s \u201cExtra\u201d rocket artillery system recently acquired from Israel. They have a range of 150km (93 miles) and carry 150kg warheads that can attack multiple targets at once.</p> <p>Last month, Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">reacted angrily</a> to an international legal case that it lost to the Philippines over contested reefs and atolls, increasing global diplomatic pressure on China to scale back military expansion in the area.</p> <p>But Beijing instead appears to have continued building bases on islands it has reclaimed, and satellite images released on Wednesday show China has placed reinforced aircraft hangars on islands it controls.</p> <p>The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) <a href=\"https://amti.csis.org/build-it-and-they-will-come/\">published</a> recent satellite photographs showing the construction of the hangars on three reclaimed islands where Beijing has built military bases.</p> <p>China landed a military transport plane in the South China Sea last month but the runways it completed this year have not yet been used to land military jets.</p> <p>CSIS said the new buildings on each of the islets, Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, \u201cwill soon have hangar space for 24 fighter-jets plus three to four larger planes\u201d and \u201ccan easily accommodate any fighter-jet in [China\u2019s] People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force\u201d.</p> <p>That includes fighters such as the J-11 and Su-30 as well as larger bombers such as the H-6. The biggest hangars can accommodate the 46.6-metre-long KJ-2000 surveillance aircraft.</p> <p>China\u2019s president, Xi Jingping, said last year that he did not intend to militarise the South China Sea but the images suggest otherwise, with CSIS saying the hangars are reinforced to withstand military strikes.</p> <p>In February, China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/china-places-missiles-woody-south-china-sea-islands\">deployed</a> surface-to-air missile launchers on Woody Island, dramatically upping the stakes in the South China Sea. Tensions have also deepened this month over South Korea\u2019s decision to host an advanced US-made anti-missile defence unit, a move that angered China.</p> <p>South Korea and the U have said the radar system, called a terminal high altitude area defence (Thaad) unit, would only be used in defence against North Korean ballistic missiles.</p> <p>But the placement of the Thaad, made by Lockheed Martin, is seen by China as move to monitor its missile deployment in the region. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-thaad-china-defence-idUSKCN1050Y7\">said</a> the Thaad plan was an \u201cout-and-out strategic\u201d move.</p> <p>Carl Thayer, an analyst on the South China Sea at the Australian Defence Force Academy, told the Guardian the Thaad deployment, China\u2019s construction of military hangars and Vietnamese rocket launcher deployments had created emerging crisis spots in east Asia.</p> <p>\u201cEach of these hot spots represents an action-reaction cycle that has the potential to escalate,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAt a time of increasing tensions, accidents and miscalculations that likely hold of a clash between military ships and planes increases.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of Virgin Media owner Liberty Global has said that Netflix has lost its \u201ccool factor\u201d and is no longer a direct competitor or major threat to pay-TV companies.</p> <p>Liberty chief Mike Fries, who ultimately oversees cable TV operations in more than a dozen countries and is ITV\u2019s largest single shareholder, believes that despite its explosive growth Netflix\u2019s model is constrained.<br></p> <p>\u201cNetflix is now more of a programme provider, like an HBO or a Sky Movies, as opposed to a [direct competitor] like Sky,\u201d said Fries, in London for a recent board meeting. \u201cThe cool factor [of their technology] is gone, and we are now matching it, meaning they have to invest in content to attract subscribers.\u201d</p> <p>Fries was referring to the technological advances that Liberty Global has now made in its own right to bridge the gap with services such as Netflix, such as its video-on-demand service My Prime which has rolled out across Europe.</p> <p>Netflix is in a continual race for scale: in January it announced an <a href=\"http://%20https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/06/netflix-availability-country-added-china-english-north-korea-ces\">aggressive roll-out to all but a handful of countries globally</a>, and is running up huge costs to invest in content for its 80 million subscribers.</p> <p>The company, which saw its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/18/netflix-shares-plunge-miss-second-quarter-expectations\">share price plummet last month</a> after a big miss in analyst expectations of its subscriber growth in the second quarter, is facing spiralling costs of currently $10bn to acquire, license and produce TV and film content over the next five years.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem for Netflix is while it is a home of TV shows and films it doesn\u2019t have Sky or BBC [channels] which makes [it just] part of the meal,\u201d said Fries. \u201cWe want to be the big plate, if you want to look at it in those terms. The long tail [of the huge popularity of older archive programming] is a myth. People want Game of Thrones, Downton Abbey.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sports rights</strong></h2> <p>Fries reiterated that while Liberty Global is not interested in entering the \u00a35bn-plus bidding battle with BT and Sky in the next Premier League TV rights auction the company is actively looking at selective sports rights.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to bid on the Premier League, in the UK we are generally a taker [of content and channels] and rarely is it the case they aren\u2019t offered,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we are starting to see sports, particularly local market sports, as a real opportunity.\u201d<br></p> <p>About a year ago Liberty Global came close to acquiring Formula One and Fries said that the company intends to up its approximately 25% stake in electric-powered racing Formula E.<br></p> <p>As part of that plan he said that TV production group All3Media, jointly owned by Liberty Global and Discovery, is working on accompanying TV shows including a reality series and programmes about the drivers.<br></p> <h2><strong>Brexit</strong><br></h2> <p>Ahead of the UK\u2019s EU referendum Fries authorised a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4d78d52-33c9-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153\">\u00a3700,000 donation to support the Remain campaign</a>, one of the largest made by the corporate sector, and warned that the company would reconsider future capital investment in the UK in the case of Brexit.<br></p> <p>Fries now says that the company, which employs 14,000 people in Britain and is investing more than \u00a33bn upgrading broadband for 4m homes, says that the company is \u201cfull steam ahead\u201d despite the threat to scale back.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe were against it as a corporate business but as a corporate citizen we now have to just get on,\u201d he said. \u201cAs predicted there is uncertainty in this moment. Uncertainty is not great in our business, we prefer predictability. The contagion risk regarding other countries in Europe is a real one but we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. We\u2019re very much full steam ahead.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>Paul Ryan, the Republican party\u2019s most senior elected official, has survived an insurgent challenge in his own backyard from an outsider candidate dubbed a \u201cmini-Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>The US House speaker comprehensively beat maverick businessman Paul Nehlen in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary in Wisconsin\u2019s 1st congressional district.</p> <p>Ryan, who did not accept Nehlen\u2019s challenge to a debate during the campaign, told reporters in Janesville on Tuesday night: \u201cWe knew we were going to do well. The outcome is exactly what we were hoping for and what we were expecting. Desperate candidates do desperate things for attention and I think that\u2019s what we saw here.\u201d</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cCongratulations to my friend Paul Ryan on a well-earned victory.

The presidential nominee stirred party tensions further when he initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/donald-trump-paul-ryan-john-mccain-re-election-endorsements\">declined to endorse</a> 46-year-old Ryan.</p> <p>But Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-endorses-paul-ryan-wisconsin-rally\">finally gave in to pressure</a> and gave his endorsement last Friday at a rally from which Nehlen was barred.</p> <p>In reality Nehlen was always a long shot trying to pull off one of the biggest upsets of the century. Indeed Trump himself struggled to make an impact in Wisconsin, where he was soundly beaten by Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries. He lost the 1st congressional district by 19 percentage points.</p> <p>But Nehlen, 47, did win the backing of some prominent conservative figures including former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Rightwing commentator Ann Coulter campaigned for him.</p> <p>Nehlen was likened to Trump as he shared or took further some of the nominee\u2019s controversial positions. He called for the building of a wall along the Mexican border and suggested the deportation of \u201csharia-compliant\u201d Muslims. He criticised Ryan over trade, branding him a \u201csoulless globalist\u201d and promising to \u201crepatriate\u201d jobs to America.</p> <p>Nehlen, an executive at a water filtration company, made a web video of himself riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, showing his tattooed arms. He challenged Ryan to an arm-wrestling match if he refused to debate him. He also had the backing of veterans of the Tea Party movement.</p> <p>But all this proved futile against Ryan\u2019s strong local base and to local commentators the result was never in doubt. Ryan was first elected in 1998 and this is his first re-election win since becoming speaker in 2015. He out-raised the unknown Nehlen by a 17-to-1 ratio through the latest finance reporting period and shored up his position with TV ads, radio interviews and campaign stops.</p> <p>Ryan hosted a low-key, 10-minute press conference without a balloon or champagne bottle in sight at an events venue called The Armory.<br></p> <p>Across the street, the ornately decorated Monterey Hotel \u2013 which opened in 1929 and hosted John F Kennedy, Eleanor Roosevelt and Louis Armstrong \u2013 stands abandoned and boarded up. Janesville and other cities in the district have suffered decades of industrial decline and manufacturing job losses which, in theory, should have been fertile territory for a Trump disciple railing against global trade.<br></p> <p>But Nehlen failed to gain traction, with Ryan on course to gain about three-quarters of the votes cast. Asked if the broader lesson of Nehlen\u2019s thrashing is that Trump himself is doomed in the presidential election, Ryan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it means he\u2019s doomed in November. I think it means right here in Wisconsin people know me very, very well.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a local guy. People know who I am, they know what I believe in and they know I mean what I say and I say what I mean and I don\u2019t do it in a mean way, and I think that\u2019s the kind of politics, that the kind of policies that Wisconsite Republicans reward. That\u2019s why I think I won; I wouldn\u2019t ascribe anything other to it than that.\u201d</p> <p>Other prominent Wisconsinites include Priebus, the Republican National Committee chair, and Governor Scott Walker. All three are likely to play a leading role in rebuilding the party if Trump suffers an electoral meltdown.</p> <p>Stephan Thompson, a Republican strategist and ally of Walker, said on Monday that Nehlen was a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cbig joke\u201d who wanted his \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d. He described Ryan\u2019s balancing act \u2013 defending his seat, protecting the congressional majority and dealing with Trump \u2013 as \u201carguably the hardest job in politics right now\u201d.</p> <p>The speaker is officially backing Trump, although privately he is said to be tormented by the nominee\u2019s wayward antics. Yet another example reared its head on Tuesday. Ryan said he had a busy day and did not hear Trump\u2019s comment about the second amendment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">interpreted by some as an assassination threat</a> against Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt sounds like just a joke gone bad,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope he clears it up very quickly. You should never joke about something like that.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan refused to answer a question about whether he would consider running for president in future.</p> <p>As the primary result became clear, Nehlen, who was endorsed by a Super Pac affiliated with conservative activists known as the Tea Party Patriots, insisted he had a won a victory of sorts. \u201cWe very likely stopped TPP [the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal] and damaged Paul Ryan\u2019s ability to continue growing government,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of a fight we\u2019re ready to get started.\u201d</p> <p>Coulter posted a sarcastic tweet about the coverage of Ryan\u2019s win, comparing it with his Democratic counterpart Nancy Pelosi. \u201cCan you imagine a breaking news story: \u201cNANCY PELOSI WINS HER PRIMARY!\u201d she wrote.</p>",

They highlight serious concerns about the ongoing risks to children and adults held on the island. They show how the Australian government has failed to respond to warning signs and reveal sexual assault allegations \u2013 many involving children \u2013 that have never been previously disclosed. </p> <p>The most damning evidence emerges from the words of the staff working in the detention centre themselves \u2013 the people who compile the reports.

Australia supplies aid and buys services from Nauru\u2019s government and companies, leading to accusations Nauru is effectively a \u201cclient state\u201d. On the last official count at the end of June, 442 people \u2013 338 men, 55 women and 49 children \u2013 were held in the Nauru regional processing centre. The other offshore centre, on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, was holding 854 people, all men. <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/un-human-rights-chief-condemns-australian-governments-hostility-and-contempt-towards-refugees/\">Australia\u2019s policy has been criticised regularly by the UN.</a></p> <p>The Guardian is publishing the files because it believes Australians have the right to know more about the regime at the Nauru and Manus centres, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/09/offshore-detention-cost-12bn-senate-estimates-asylum-seekers-charter-flights\">which costs Australian taxpayers $1.2bn a year</a>. </p> <p>The documents cover the period examined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/20/save-children-moss-review-negligence-asylum-seekers-nauru\">in a review into allegations of sexual assault</a>, the Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s inquiry <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/forgotten-children-national-inquiry-children\">into children in detention</a> as well as the period examined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/all-children-should-be-removed-from-nauru-detention-senate-inquiry-finds\">a Senate inquiry</a> and beyond. They encompass the final days of Labor\u2019s time in government and the ruling conservative Coalition\u2019s time in office since September 2013. </p> <p>In each successive inquiry, the Australian government and its contractors, including Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield Services) and its subcontractor Wilson Security, have maintained that they are improving conditions and reporting measures to raise the quality of life on the island.</p> <p>In April 2015 the Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said he wanted to make Nauru a \u201csafe environment\u201d. He said he had \u201cinstructed the department to do whatever they possibly can, both domestically within the detention network here and with our partners in the regional processing centres, to make sure that the standard of care is as high as it possibly can be\u201d.</p> <p>Wilson Security has <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=1b5b3286-d44c-4ad7-b674-93f9f81068da&amp;subId=351259\">previously told the Australian parliament</a> it had \u201crobust policies, procedures and processes that support the operations in Nauru\u201d.</p> <p>It continued: \u201cAllegations of sexual assault are treated in a timely and sensitive manner.

Rather than serious events diminishing, they continued \u2013 and in some cases escalated \u2013 during the course of 2015.

Some had been granted permission to leave on day trips but were closely monitored to ensure they returned before curfews. Those found to be refugees were released into the Nauruan community \u2013 yet still remain effectively detained on the remote island. </p> <p>The primary evidence from the files backs up testimony from former immigration detention staff members interviewed by the Guardian as part of its investigation. </p> <p>Access to Nauru is tightly controlled. Events on the island are reported sporadically through refugee advocates and whistleblowers, but the Australian government\u2019s policy of shrouding its offshore detention centres in secrecy has prevented the reporting of many serious incidents. The Nauru files shatter that secrecy. </p> <p>In response to the Nauru files, the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection <a href=\"http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/the-nauru-files\">said in a statement</a>: \u201cThe Australian government continues to support the Nauruan government to provide for the health, welfare and safety of all transferees and refugees in Nauru.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents published today are evidence of the rigorous reporting procedures that are in place in the regional processing centre \u2013 procedures under which any alleged incident must be recorded, reported and where necessary investigated. Many of the incident reports reflect unconfirmed allegations or uncorroborated statements and claims \u2013 they are not statements of proven fact.</p> <p>\u201cAll alleged criminal incidents within the regional processing centre are referred to the Nauru Police Force (NPF) for investigation. Refugees living in the community are encouraged to report all criminal incidents to the NPF. A number of matters remain under active investigation.</p> <p>\u201cThe department is examining the matters published today to ensure all of these matters have been reported appropriately by service providers, consistent with the policies and procedures covering such matters.\u201d <br><br>The department added that it \u201calso takes seriously its role in supporting the government of Nauru to protect children from abuse, neglect or exploitation\u201d. </p> <h2>Sexual violence and threats</h2> <p>Allegations of sexual assault, particularly against young women, are a persistent theme of the files. In one report <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdf/sca140418.pdf\">an asylum seeker described being told she was \u201con a list\u201d written by local Nauruan guards naming single women they were \u201cwaiting for\u201d</a>. \u201cShe has received offers to get her pregnant when she gets out,\u201d the caseworker wrote.</p> <p>They reveal allegations of misconduct by Wilson Security guards at the detention centre.

But that\u2019s not how the media is spinning it. What\u2019s your reaction to it?\u201d</p> <p>Trump replied: \u201cWell, I just heard about that, and it was amazing because nobody in that room thought anything other than what you just said. This is a political movement. This is a strong, powerful movement, the Second Amendment \u2026 there can be no other interpretation. Even reporters have told me \u2013 I mean give me a break.\u201d<br></p> <p>Trump has been striving to show more discipline on the campaign trail after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">string of gaffes in recent weeks</a>. He remained in control in Detroit on Monday when a speech on the economy was repeatedly interrupted by protesters. But in Wilmington, he apparently could not resist going off-script.<br></p> <p>Campaigners for gun control expressed outrage at his off-the-cuff remark. Po Murray, chair of the <a href=\"http://newtownaction.org/\">Newtown Action Alliance</a>, said: \u201cDonald Trump continues to pander to the corporate gun lobby and the gun extremists who thrive on fear and rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cAny suggestion that gun violence should be used to stop Hillary Clinton from appointing supreme court justices is dangerous and reckless. It\u2019s no surprise that 50 GOP national security experts have signed a letter making a pledge to not vote for him.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkCGlaze?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mark Glaze</a>, former executive director of Everytown for Gun Safety, said: \u201cIt may well be an incitement to violence, but understand it\u2019s the basic theory on which the modern gun industry is built. Their core audience is people who hate the government and believe they\u2019re going to have to take up arms against it. My guess is this is a deliberate dog whistle to that significant number of people.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people out there who hear this kind of thing in a certain way, and if they\u2019re already inclined to hatred of government and Hillary Clinton and see guns as a public policy solution, who knows what could happen?\u201d</p> <p>The concern was echoed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBegala\">Paul Begala</a>, a former adviser to Bill Clinton in the White House. \u201cThis is not something that should be joked about,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI hope in the best case you could say he was joking. It didn\u2019t seem like a joke to me. Tony Schwartz, the guy who wrote [Trump\u2019s book] The Art of the Deal, says Trump never jokes.</p> <p>\u201cI fear that an unbalanced person hears that in this inflamed environment and, God forbid, thinks that was a threat. I certainly take it as a threat, I really do, and Trump needs to apologise.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and National Security Agency, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/763108278276468736\">said on the same channel</a>: </p> <p>\u201cWell, let me say, if someone had have said that outside the hall he\u2019d be in the back of a police wagon now with the secret service questioning him.\u201d </p> <p>As yet another controversy threatened to engulf him, Trump\u2019s campaign insisted that his words had been misunderstood. Jason Miller, a spokesperson, attempted to explain the candidate\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s called the power of unification,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won\u2019t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called the uproar over Trump\u2019s remarks a \u201cdistraction created by the dishonest media.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe NRA represents law-abiding gun owners and we support lawful behavior,\u201d she wrote in an email. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe NRA and Donald Trump are calling for Second Amendment supporters to protect their constitutional right to self defense by defeating Hillary Clinton at the ballot box,\u201d Baker said. \u201cSecond Amendment voters understand the stakes. They understand that the Second Amendment is on the ballot.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign went on the record in May saying that she believes the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller decision, a key victory for gun rights, was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">wrongly decided</a>.\u201d </p> <p>The 5-4 Heller decision struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban as unconstitutional, ruling that Americans have an individual right to own guns for self-defense in their homes. </p> <p>\u201cIf Heller is overturned, that paves the way for extreme gun control for decades,\u201d Baker said. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763158125721497600\">official NRA Twitter feed</a> compared Trump\u2019s remarks to a 2008 comment from then-Senator Joseph Biden, who said \u201cIf [Obama] tries to fool with my Beretta, he\u2019s got a problem,\u201d and asked \u201cWas Joe Biden\u2026suggesting violence here?\u201d</p> <p>Katie Pavlich, a prominent conservative writer who spoke at this year\u2019s NRA annual meeting, also slammed the media\u2019s coverage of Trump\u2019s remarks, tweeting: \u201cMedia totally exposed itself (again) today by assuming Second Amendment supporters are assassins instead of voters.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatiePavlich/status/763134167794135040\">she added</a>: \u201cThat said Trump is reason Trump has no credibility/isn\u2019t given the benefit of the doubt when actually misunderstood.\u201d She was referencing Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters\">remark in January</a> that \u201cI could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d </p> <p>Pavlich wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not defending Trump or his comments, I\u2019m defending Second Amendment supporters.\u201d </p> <p>The supreme court has become a central election issue since the death earlier this year of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative who has not yet been replaced. Trump claims that liberal judges could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/17/trump-texas-rally-second-amendment-guns-orlando-shooting-video\">threaten the second amendment.</a></p> <p>Progressive pressure groups that have been watching the process closely joined the condemnation of Trump on Tuesday. Michael Keegan, president of <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/\">People for the American Way</a>, said: \u201cThere has been no shortage of inexcusable rhetoric from Trump, but suggesting gun violence is truly abhorrent. There is no place in our public discourse for this kind of statement, especially from someone seeking the nation\u2019s highest office.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Sroka, communications director of <a href=\"https://www.democracyforamerica.com/\">Democracy for America</a>, added: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a little unclear whether Donald Trump was calling for his supporters to assassinate a Clinton court pick or take up an armed insurrection against a government that allowed her to appoint one. Either way, the only thing more insane than electing someone president who blows this kind of violent dog whistle would be buying the furious spin coming out of his campaign trying to explain it away.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has produced a shortlist of conservative justices that he hopes will appeal to the Republican base and deter those considering defecting to Clinton, who could set the court on a liberal trajectory for years to come.</p> <p>He told supporters on Tuesday: \u201cI guess there\u2019s a scenario in which this president could pick five supreme court justices, and if you pick two that are left, left, left, it\u2019s going to be a disaster for our country.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/nra-endorses-donald-trump-convention\">NRA had endorsed him early</a>, he added. \u201cWe want to replace with justices very much like Justice Scalia and that\u2019s going to happen, that\u2019s so important. One of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also told the rally that Clinton is \u201cdangerous\u201d and could destroy the country from within because of her immigration policies.</p> <p>Trump was introduced by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who brought up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/iran-executes-nuclear-scientist-shahram-amiri-returned-country-from-us\">the case of Shahram Amiri</a>, an Iranian nuclear scientist executed for spying for the US. Clinton received emails mentioning him on her controversial personal server when she was secretary of state.</p> <p>Giuliani said: \u201cRemember Hillary told us there was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">top secret information on her emails</a>? Remember she told us that. Well, she lied! And I don\u2019t know the connection between that and the death of Mr Amiri, but what I do know is it put a lot more attention on him when they found those emails. It certainly put him at great risk, even if they didn\u2019t find them, and it shows you that when the director of the FBI said she was extremely careless, he was being kind.\u201d</p> <p>But Giuliani repeatedly waved away chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p><em>Lois Beckett contributed reporting.</em></p>",

Political news has become addictive to a degree unheard of since those fevered weeks in November 1990 when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s long regime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/thatcher-resigns-from-archive\">was brought to an end</a> in an internal Tory putsch. The coup\u2019s primary provocation was Thatcher\u2019s surly attitude to Europe \u2013 and to her deputy prime minister, the Europhile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/10/geoffrey-howe-most-celebrated-quotes\">Geoffrey Howe</a>. Back then Howe was closely aligned with Thatcher\u2019s former chancellor Nigel Lawson, who has since reinvented himself as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/02/nigel-lawson-on-brexit-i-love-europe-but-eu-has-no-purpose\"> a bullish Brexiter</a>. Labour\u2019s current travails also remind us of its own internal differences over Europe. In 1981 Labour\u2019s hostility to Europe precipitated the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/14/liberal-party-history\">breakaway of the \u201cgang of four\u201d</a> \u2013 Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers \u2013 to form the Social Democratic party. Curiously, like Lawson, Owen too is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/eu-beyond-reform-says-former-foreign-secretary-lord-owen\">a convert to Brexit</a>, as is <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/jim-sillars-snp-members-should-back-brexit-1-4091234\">Jim Sillars</a>, the architect of the SNP\u2019s successful \u201cindependence in Europe\u201d policy. Europe has split parties, ruined political careers and prompted strange Damascene conversions; what it has not done until now is fan the interest of the British public.</p> <p>Turnout in the UK for elections to the European parliament has rarely risen above 35%. Why has something so seemingly peripheral to mainstream British politics brought about so much disruption? Benjamin Grob-Fitzgibbon, a diplomat in the US State Department and former academic, brings an outsider\u2019s perspective to our squabbles. He emphasises the ways in which the empire and Commonwealth influenced Britain\u2019s relationship with the European project. But his findings will dismay cod-Churchillian Brexiters.</p> <p>This is because Winston Churchill emerges from these pages as the champion of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d, a formulation that he first used in 1938 and returned to in opposition, after the war. Churchill\u2019s confident leadership of the United Europe movement \u2013 confidence derived from Britain\u2019s imperial standing \u2013 paved the way for the establishment of the Council of Europe in 1949, with British participation. Grob-Fitzgibbon is persuasively insistent that imperial commitments did not run counter to European ideals, but, surprising as it may seem, underpinned them. In the late 40s Churchill understood that Britain was pulled in different directions, by its empire, by the Atlantic alliance, and by the imperative to rebuild European civilisation on durable foundations. Yet these various demanding commitments were complementary. For \u201cimperial Europeans\u201d in the Conservative party, such as Churchill, Julian Amery, Duncan Sandys and Harold Macmillan, it was obvious that European renewal called for globally engaged leadership. Colonial possessions did not in themselves provide a structural impediment to European integration, quite the reverse. After all, France had its own overseas empire, and it was to these two global powers that the leadership of Europe must inevitably fall. In the immediate postwar era Labour\u2019s foreign secretary, the pragmatic trade unionist Ernest Bevin, shared some of these broad assumptions, though with some scepticism about Churchill\u2019s plans for a European Assembly. Bevin\u2019s own vision of a \u201cWestern Union\u201d \u2013 a sphere of industrial and military cooperation in western Europe \u2013 was also an imperial one, drawing on the resources of Britain\u2019s colonies and dominions.</p> <p>However, according to Grob-Fitzgibbon, British leadership of the European project evaporated in the spring of 1950. The fraught circumstances of the Berlin airlift in 1948-9 had convinced Bevin that western European cooperation was insufficient in itself, and required the external support of the US. Discerning British hesitancy, Jean Monnet, one of the architects of European integration, abandoned his existing vision of Anglo-French leadership and plumped instead for a Franco-German project. The result, rapidly formulated, was the Schuman plan for a joint authority superintending Franco-German coal and steel production. Although Churchill and the Daily Mail \u2013 then fervently Europhile \u2013 were enthusiastic about the Schuman plan, Bevin was lukewarm.</p> <p>All was not lost. Churchill\u2019s government of 1951-5 promised to be the most Europhile in British history, except for the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, who, while happy to use pro-European rhetoric from time to time, was much less enthusiastic about the prospects for a European army. Nevertheless, the vision of Anglo-French partnership remained alive, for a while. Eden himself, as Churchill\u2019s successor, orchestrated the calamitous collusion between the two powers at Suez in 1956. Under intense economic pressure from the US, Eden unilaterally decided upon a ceasefire, without consulting his French allies.</p> <p>The six members (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg) of the European Coal and Steel Community had already met at Messina in 1955 to plan a common market, which was launched in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome as the European Economic Community (EEC). But as far as Britain\u2019s swaggering \u201cimperial Europeans\u201d were concerned this was still \u201cLittle Europe\u201d. There was room for something bolder and more comprehensive. In 1959 Britain, along with Sweden, played a leading role in establishing the European Free Trade Association, which also included Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria. Nevertheless, the UK did not envisage the Efta seven as a long-term rival to the EEC six so much as a stepping stone for membership of the common market.</p> <p>However, the aftershocks of Suez lingered. French president Charles de Gaulle never forgot that Britain\u2019s primary relationship was with the US, and twice during the 1960s blocked British applications to join the EEC \u2013 first from Harold Macmillan\u2019s Tory government, and then from Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson. Yet De Gaulle \u2013 ironically \u2013 was no fan of EEC-style integration, preferring instead a looser, anti-federalist \u201c<em>Europe des patries</em>\u201d. As Macmillan confided to his diary, \u201cDe Gaulle wants the kind of Europe that we would be able readily to join, but he doesn\u2019t want us in it.\u201d</p> <p>Macmillan\u2019s application to join the EEC clarified Labour opposition to it. Hugh Gaitskell, James Callaghan and Douglas Jay favoured an outward-looking internationalism based on a global, multi-racial Commonwealth. The EEC they regarded as a sinister capitalist plot to stymie socialism. By the mid-60s, a stark division appeared to prevail between a pro-Commonwealth Labour government faced by a Conservative opposition, led by Ted Heath, which was committed to EEC entry. But the appeal of the Commonwealth \u2013 an increasingly fanciful panacea for Britain\u2019s economic woes \u2013 waned, and in 1967 Wilson\u2019s Labour government submitted its own application to join the EEC, which was promptly vetoed by France.</p> <p>With the demise of De Gaulle, Britain under Heath was at last admitted in 1973. However, the legislation paving the way for entry was only achieved with the help of 69 pro-European Labour MPs who defied their own party whip to support the government. For, with the passing of empire and the outward-looking confidence it engendered, the Tory backbenches had seen the first stirrings of Eurosceptic rebellion. In 1975 Wilson \u2013 crafty, cynical and competent \u2013 suppressed some of Labour\u2019s divisions with a referendum on Europe in which collective cabinet responsibility was temporarily suspended to allow ministers to campaign on either side. With the steady support of prominent Euro-agnostics \u2013 most notably Callaghan, by then Labour\u2019s foreign secretary, and Thatcher, the new leader of the Tory party \u2013 Wilson achieved his intended result: a 67% vote to stay in, which decisively confirmed British membership of the EEC.</p> <p>A few minor errors notwithstanding, Grob-Fitzgibbon has produced an absorbing account of our current predicament. He interprets the Euroscepticism of the last few decades as a post-imperial condition, in which the longing for a lost greatness is so desperate that it grossly distorts the objects of nostalgia. But all of us, remainers as well as Eurosceptics, have lazily bought into the dominant narrative. A zesty and ingenious Remain campaign \u2013 of the sort we conspicuously lacked \u2013 might have presented the Europhile Churchill as a patriotic anti-Brexit icon.

After last night I was a bit unsure but my coach just said pretend it\u2019s just trials...That\u2019s what I tried to do tonight. I think it\u2019s just about being tough.\u201d And tough she was was, hanging on for third in a mad scramble at the end. Veteran team-mate Bronte Barratt is beside her and finished out of the medals, but she\u2019s still ecstatic with a PB in this her third Olympic campaign.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa8545e4b03b51a99e19fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-10T01:38:15.023Z\">2.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That\u2019s a 20th gold for Phelps.

Indeed, that had long been the case - on pretty much every surface. The most dominant world No 1 in the history of the ATP rankings went on to win the French too - finally - and seemed in good shape for Wimbledon. But his early exit there, withdrawal from Serbia\u2019s Davis Cup against Great Britain last month and his early defeat here - in singles and doubles - were compounded on Tuesday when he withdrew from the Cincinnati Open ahead of the US Open. <br><br>For his sake, it is hoped it is only his tennis that has gone missing. Djokovic was mentally fragile early in his career but had built up an impressive psychological wall in recent years, winning easily when on top, getting out of impossible situations as well, and handling the odd defeat with good grace. However, he has rarely looked as emotional as when he blubbled on court here after losing to Juan Martin del Potro. <br><br>The US Open could be an intriguing tournament.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57aa14ffe4b033cb0795e7b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/timhill\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T17:50:30.515Z\">6.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The USA\u2019s Nate Ebner, whose day job is with the New England Patriots, with whom he won the Super Bowl in 2014, is playing for his country in the rugby sevens \u2013 but has not been forgotten by his team-mates back home it seems.

The hashtag Where\u2019s Daniel Goodfellow trended on Twitter after some newspapers showed a photo of Daley alone celebrating the win at the Rio poolside. </p> <p>Goodfellow\u2019s mother Sharon said: \u201cDaniel doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s quite happy to stay in the background.\u201d Goodfellow, 19, achieved the success at the 10-metre synchro event with Daley, 22, on day three of the Rio Olympics. Speaking on TV show This Morning, Ms Goodfellow said she was still \u201cquite in shock\u201d. She watched the competition unfold from the family home near Cambridge. </p> <p>\u201cI was going to just watch the first two dives but then I thought if they have a bad dive I will switch off,\u201d she said. While there were \u201cone or two that weren\u2019t up to his usual success\u201d the pair clinched bronze on the final dive. His Olympic honour follows more than a year battling back from a shoulder injury which left him unable to raise his arm fully. </p> <p>The former Cambridge Dive Team member had suffered an elbow injury in the build-up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow before sustaining a separate injury to the long thoracic nerve, which affected his shoulder. He was able to return to training following an operation, but the doubts meant his mother had not bought tickets to Rio. \u201cDaniel had a very serious injury,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite sure if he was going to make it to Rio.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T10:05:00.254Z\">at 11.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a9a90be4b0f5d064841bd2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T09:58:37.155Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for a recap of today\u2019s gold medals on offer, courtesy of my colleague Claire Phipps\u2019 exhaustive briefing earlier</strong>.</p> <h2>Diary</h2> <p>Find the full schedule in your timezone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-full-events-schedule\">on this link</a>.

He has criticised Westminster politicians for standing for the nominations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/01/liverpools-mayor-ignorant-insensitive-andy-burnham\">describing Burnham\u2019s assertion</a> that the role of metro mayor was a \u201ccabinet-level job requiring cabinet-level experience\u201d as \u201cignorant and insensitive\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful to every local government leader who has worked hard for their area\u201d.</p> <p>Rotheram, who serves as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s private parliamentary secretary and is a vocal supporter of the Labour leader, was the second to announce he would stand for the nomination.

  "<p>In 2013, at a conference on endangered languages, a retired teacher named Linda Lambrecht announced the extraordinary discovery of a previously unknown language. Lambrecht \u2013 who is Chinese-Hawaiian, 71 years old, warm but no-nonsense \u2013 called it <a href=\"http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21440949/nearly-lost-language-discovered-in-hawaii\">Hawaii Sign Language</a>, or HSL. In front of a room full of linguists, she demonstrated that its core vocabulary \u2013 words such as \u201cmother\u201d, \u201cpig\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d \u2013 was distinct from that of other sign languages.</p> <p>The linguists were immediately convinced. William O\u2019Grady, the chair of the linguistics department at the University of Hawaii, called it \u201cthe first time in 80 years that a new language has been discovered in the United States \u2014 and maybe the last time.\u201d But the new language found 80 years ago was in remote Alaska, whereas HSL was hiding in plain sight in Honolulu, a metropolitan area of nearly a million people. It was the kind of discovery that made the world seem larger.</p> <p>The last-minute arrival of recognition and support for HSL was a powerful, almost surreal vindication for Lambrecht, whose first language is HSL. For decades, it was stigmatised or ignored; now the language has acquired an agreed-upon name, an official \u201clanguage code\u201d from the <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html\">International Organization for Standardization</a>, the attention of linguists around the world, and a three-year grant from the<a href=\"http://www.eldp.net/\"> Endangered Languages Documentation Programme</a> at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/03/the-race-to-save-a-dying-language-podcast\">The race to save a dying language \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just as linguists were substantiating its existence, HSL stood on the brink of extinction, remembered by just a handful of signers. Unless the language made a miraculous recovery, Lambrecht feared that her announcement might turn out to be HSL\u2019s obituary.</p> <p>Three years after announcing its existence, Lambrecht is still unearthing her language sign by sign. She may be the only person in the world who still uses HSL on a regular basis, signing into a camera while a linguist named James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodward and a handful of graduate students from the University of Hawaii document her every move.</p> <p>Led by Lambrecht, Woodward, and researcher Barbara Earth, the project aims to document what may be the last-ever conversations of native HSL signers. The goal is to record at least 20 hours of high-quality video footage of natural HSL and then transcribe, translate, and archive it. The researchers hope that this work \u2013 along with a series of illustrated handbooks depicting over 1,000 signs, and a regular class at the University of Hawaii set to begin next year \u2013 will jump-start the revitalisation of HSL.</p> <p>The project faces numerous obstacles. The first is the scepticism of many of the remaining signers themselves. Hawaii\u2019s tiny Deaf community is deeply divided. Some say HSL is not a real language, others see it as backward; still others are sceptical of Lambrecht.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178/0_0_556_1155/481.jpg\" alt=\"Dying Language\" width=\"481\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Christian Montenegro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: dutchuncle.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the gravest threat to HSL is <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\">American Sign Language</a> (ASL), which is advancing across the globe \u2013 from Hawaii to Thailand to Togo \u2013 just as fast as English. The Deaf world, intensely local until recently, is consolidating and globalising in unprecedented ways. And the forward march of ASL, which in certain ways brings people together, also poses a significant danger to many of the estimated 400 sign languages used all over the world \u2013 most of which we know nothing about.</p> <p>Hawaii is a bellwether, but Deaf culture all around the world \u2013 for many on the inside it is a \u201ccapital-D\u201d culture, not a \u201clower-case-d\u201d disability \u2013 faces threats from every direction. The \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of deaf students means that they are placed in hearing schools, where they are encouraged to be just like everyone else but with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, in a process that some call deliberate assimilation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/16/bionic-ears-cochlear-implants-transformed-lives-children\">Cochlear implants</a> (and the potential of gene therapy) even more fundamentally endanger sign languages \u2013 some Deaf activists condemn such \u201ccures\u201d as <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/sociologylens/2011/02/24/cochlear-implants-miracle-technology-or-cultural-genocide/\">being akin to genocide</a>.</p> <p>If the loss of a particular language such as HSL means the end of a whole expressive system, the disappearance of sign language in general \u2013 the only fully fledged form of language completely independent of speech \u2013 would permanently impoverish human communication.</p> <p>Like every natural language, HSL is the evolved product of a specific history, the unconscious creation of a community. For it to survive, local signers will have to make a deliberate choice to use it. The same may be increasingly true of Deafness itself. The story of HSL raises crucial questions in an age of globalisation: Do cultures on the margins have a future? Will enough people choose to be that different, and will they do it together?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Though they parallel spoken languages in certain ways, sign languages represent a fundamentally different way of communicating. They neither derive from, nor correspond to, spoken languages. Nor are all sign languages mutually intelligible, as hearing people often assume \u2013 they are as various as spoken languages.</p> <p>Their historical evolution is distinctive. Infants can sign before they can speak, and the great sign language linguist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/us/william-stokoe-jr-sign-language-advocate-dies-at-80.html\">William Stokoe</a> argued that sign may have preceded speech in the history of human language. It\u2019s considered normal for one in 1,000 children to be born profoundly deaf, but places with higher rates of inherited deafness \u2013 such as the village of <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/deaf-arab-villagers-create-new-language/\">al-Sayyid in Israel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/theres-a-village-in-bali-where-everyone-knows-sign-language-511\">Bengkala in Bali</a> \u2013 have been natural hotspots for sign languages.</p> <p>For sign languages, and for Deaf culture more broadly, intergenerational transmission is far from straightforward. The vast majority of deaf adults give birth to hearing children, while most deaf children are born to hearing adults who have no connection with the Deaf communities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not just gestures that anyone can immediately grasp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not \u201cjust\u201d gestures that anyone can immediately grasp. \u201cIconic\u201d signs, where the gesture self-evidently expresses meaning, play a role in every sign language, but even they can be wonderfully nuanced. In HSL, for instance, \u201ccry\u201d is signed with spread-finger \u201ctears\u201d running out from the sides of the eyes, while \u201cbawl\u201d has the fingers running straight down. Still, abstraction and convention are essential, just as in speech, because not everything can be expressed with self-evident gestures. There is nothing obvious, for example, about the HSL sign for \u201cman\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d: a spread hand moving down across the head.</p> <p>For most of recorded history, sign languages have been effectively invisible to hearing people. It was not until William Stokoe\u2019s groundbreaking study of ASL, published in 1960, that any sign language had been analysed as a fully fledged communication system with a grammar of its own. In 1965 Stokoe published an ASL dictionary, also the first of its kind.</p> <p>Now that the kind of geographical isolation that once bred new languages is no more, sign languages represent something of a final frontier. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how many sign languages there are,\u201d says Albert Bickford of the global sign languages team at the language database <a href=\"https://www.ethnologue.com/\">Ethnologue</a>. \u201cIt seems reasonable to assume that the majority of sign languages currently in use in the world have not been discovered yet,\u201d Victoria Nyst, a linguist at Leiden University, told me.</p> <p>The most recent edition of Ethnologue, published earlier this year, mentions 141 sign languages. Over a hundred more have been reported, Bickford says, but no solid information on them exists \u2013 just the barest indication that Deaf people may sign differently in a particular place. We may never know much about these languages, or even confirm their existence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lambrecht\u2019s announcement in 2013<strong> </strong>was the culmination of a lifetime of work. Born deaf, she hears almost nothing, barely even the noise of a siren blaring in her street. \u201cI grew up very frustrated, thinking I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m hearing! I want to be an actress, I want to be a dancer, I want to be a movie star!\u201d Lambrecht told me late last year at the University of Hawaii. \u201cI was so frustrated that I couldn\u2019t be those things.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.linfo.org/teletype.html\">Teletype</a>, an early form of texting, and <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/closed-captioning-television\">closed captioning</a>, which made TV and films accessible, were life-changing developments for her when they became widespread in the 1970s. \u201cAfter that, I settled down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hated being deaf until that communication barrier broke down, when all those devices came out.\u201d</p> <p>The youngest of seven children, Lambrecht started signing HSL at home in the late 1940s \u2013 learning it from two of her older brothers, who were both deaf like her. She was probably one of the last people anywhere to learn HSL naturally, as a first language, and picking it up from family was particularly unusual. By then, the dorm at Hawaii\u2019s only deaf school was the closest thing HSL had to a homeland \u2013 it was there that one of her brothers learned it.</p> <p>But ASL was already coming in. Soon after the second world war, an unprecedented number of Deaf mainlanders came to Hawaii to work or retire. Within a few decades, ASL was dominant, HSL almost dormant. \u201cWe would get a lot of insults, a lot of negativity,\u201d Lambrecht recalled. \u201cDeaf people here would put themselves into an inferior category compared to the people who brought ASL. People said, \u2018They\u2019re from America, they\u2019re white people, they know better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lambrecht made a living by teaching ASL for 33 years, mostly to hearing people, but in her spare time she pursued HSL, tracking down old signers in hospitals and nursing homes. \u201cWe used to go to the other islands to drum up people, and now they\u2019re all dead, dead, dead,\u201d her husband, Jeff, said. Interested mainlanders had documented a small number of local signs, and they encouraged Lambrecht to do more. Years in, she realised she had been collecting the remains of a complete and original language.</p> <p>Without funding and without linguistic expertise, Lambrecht\u2019s efforts stalled until 2007, when a woman named Barbara Earth came to Hawaii and enrolled in her ASL class. After a career working on gender and development in Asia and Africa, Earth was going deaf and wanted to learn how to sign.</p> <p>Embracing Lambrecht\u2019s cause and digging into HSL history, Earth hunted for money to support the project. Three years later, she found enough for a pilot study, interviewing 19 elderly Deaf people and two children of Deaf adults on four Hawaiian islands. William O\u2019Grady, the linguistics department chair at the University of Hawaii, agreed to host the project at the university: \u201cBarbara knocked on my door and said there was an unknown sign language here in Hawaii, and she needed help to prove that it existed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf/0_60_5870_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An initial estimate of up to 280 surviving HSL signers was soon revised down to 40, then down to just 10 or so old-timers still likely to be competent in HSL. ASL had made deep inroads even among these signers, but there was evidence, especially from Lambrecht\u2019s signs, that HSL was distinct, and lay close enough to the surface to be recovered. Spoken languages such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/basque.shtml\">Basque</a>, Welsh, and Hawaiian have come back from the brink of extinction \u2013 could HSL be the first sign language to do it?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For James Woodward, the mass extinction<strong> </strong>of sign languages is bound up in prejudice and chauvinism. He believes that every local sign language should have the chance to become a valued, modernised language of education, giving communities a choice and a chance at continuity. Like the spread of English, the triumph of ASL might enable communication, but convenience cannot replace intimacy and history, which people soon forget ever existed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/07/british-sign-language-changing\">Signs of the times: deaf community minds its language</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One day late last year in Honolulu, I sat in on a gathering that included some of the last active HSL signers. Besides Lambrecht, there were the three other elderly signers who had joined the project within the last year. Their funny and furious signing was almost all in ASL, as usual, but here and there old bits of HSL were surfacing.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Deaf culture or what!?\u201d Hilda Lopez signed. \u201cI love it, I love it, I love it.\u201d She kissed her own hands as she signed. \u201cHSL is really number one in my life. The ones who don\u2019t like it are small-minded!\u201d</p> <p>Lopez explained to me that her first name in English is Hilda, but her name sign \u2013 her real, everyday name in the Deaf community \u2013 is a pointing gesture towards the mouth, based on an incident at her fifth birthday party when someone fired a BB gun and shot out some of her teeth. It\u2019s a classic HSL name sign: blunt, comic and personal, based on physical characteristics and memorable incidents.</p> <p>Like any language, HSL can be broken down by linguists, but its personality, its characteristic style of discourse, is harder to get a handle on. Even when signing ASL, Lopez seems to embody the HSL style. \u201cWhen they\u2019re using ASL, people talk too long and make other people bored,\u201d she told me. \u201cHSL is short and thrilling and fast.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>HSL has a bigger 'signing space' than ASL \u2013 anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>HSL has a bigger \u201csigning space\u201d than ASL \u2013 meaningful signs can be made anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso. Signs that occur not on the hands but elsewhere on the body also play an important role. \u201cKick\u201d is signed only with the leg, for instance, while a raised eyebrow is a vital bit of grammar, signalling a yes or no question, or a conditional clause beginning with \u201cif\u201d. The \u201cvocalisations\u201d accompanying certain signs, which fellow signers can sometimes lip-read, echo different spoken languages: borrowed words from <a href=\"http://www.polynesia.com/polynesian_culture/hawaii/languages.html#.V6m7VzYrKuo\">Hawaiian</a>, English and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/12/living/pidgin-english-hawaii/\">Hawaii Pidgin</a>.</p> <p>Lopez thinks and talks to herself in sign. \u201cI\u2019m 100% Deaf!\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI don\u2019t hear sound, but I can feel it, I feel the body vibrations in my chest: bass drums, police sirens. The only thing I can hear is fireworks \u2014 I don\u2019t like the smell of them, they make me sick, but I like the noise and vibration.\u201d</p> <p>Lopez never knew her biological parents, but she is fiercely proud of her <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/06/native-hawaiian-population/\">Native Hawaiian</a> and mixed-ethnic roots. At least one piece of evidence, an 1821 letter discovered by Barbara Earth, seems to link HSL to the Native Hawaiian past. In that year, an American missionary, newly arrived in the <a href=\"http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/political-history.shtml\">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, met a deaf man and bargained with him over 40 sticks of firewood and a pig. Some of the man\u2019s signs were \u201cin common use\u201d, seemingly among both deaf and hearing people, wrote the missionary. The signs he recorded for \u201cpig\u201d, \u201cmoney\u201d, \u201csee\u201d, and a system of counting by clapping, are still present in HSL today.</p> <p>The rate of inherited deafness in Hawaii is normal. But by the late 19th century, waves of Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese and Filipino immigrants were coming to Hawaii to work on the American-run plantations, and a new multi-racial Deaf community took shape in Honolulu, including boot shiners, launderers, and flower sellers. There was even what a contemporary newspaper called a \u201cfancy deaf wedding\u201d, where 80 of the guests used \u201cthe sign language\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe turning point, the beginning of the end of HSL,\u201d according to Barbara Earth, was the founding of Hawaii\u2019s deaf school in 1914. Like most schools at the time, it promoted <a href=\"http://www.deafwebsites.com/education/oralism.html\">oralism</a>, the system of lip-reading and speaking that is almost universally despised in Deaf communities for being painful, unnatural and ineffective. But for a while the school was also a unique environment for the clandestine transmission of HSL. One former student, Norman Galapin, told me that he learned HSL \u201con the playgrounds and in the dorm\u201d, though \u201cif the teacher saw you signing, sometimes they would slap your hands, or hit you with a ruler, or pinch your cheek.\u201d</p> <p>During the 1940s, HSL was already a language in transition, according to Galapin: \u201cThey weren\u2019t using the old [HSL] sign for \u2018mother\u2019, they were using this [ASL] one, but they were still using the old sign for \u2018father\u2019.\u201d Starting in 1939, a few charismatic teachers from the mainland played a vital role in overturning oralism and legitimising sign language, but they ended up promoting ASL over HSL in the process.</p> <p>Employment, education and access to government services \u2013 from court interpreters to mental health provision in sign language \u2013 were perennial problems in the community, but many deaf Hawaiians thrived as master carpenters, printers, mechanics, postal workers and even ukulele makers. As elsewhere, an informal Deaf Club was at the centre of an unusually tightknit community, organising Christmas parties, bowling nights and an annual summer camp-out on the beach, with up to 100 people fishing and cooking for two weeks straight.</p> <p>Yet Hilda Lopez, like many Deaf Hawaiians, left Hawaii for the mainland for education and for work, arriving in California in her teens. The culture shock was intense: \u201cIt was all ASL, and I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople seemed to know so much, I felt that I wasn\u2019t very smart\u2026. I got confused and I lost HSL, I didn\u2019t really remember it any more.\u201d Only now, haltingly peeling away the layers of ASL, is she starting to reclaim the language.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>No other sign language comes close to having the influence of ASL. Accurate, up-to-date signer numbers do not exist for any sign language, but most of the larger ones are not even yet secure in their own countries. There are more than 20 million deaf people in China, for instance, but <a href=\"https://www.start-american-sign-language.com/chinese-sign-language_html\">Chinese Sign Language</a>, which has hardly been documented, has only been acknowledged as a distinct language for the last 30 years.</p> <p>By comparison, ASL is a powerhouse, supported and promoted by institutions such as the <a href=\"https://nad.org/\">National Association of the Deaf</a>, and <a href=\"http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/\">Gallaudet University</a> in Washington DC, which describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s only university with programmes and services specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students\u201d. Gallaudet plays a critical role in the American Deaf community and in the life of ASL. Until recently, the university supported both a college prep centre in Honolulu (to ensure qualified deaf applicants to Gallaudet) and ASL interpreter training in Hawaii (to bolster ASL more broadly).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c/0_29_5311_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht and Emily Jo Noschese speaking in Hawaii Sign Language in Honolulu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht having a conversation in Hawaii Sign Language, Honolulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ASL may now be going global, but the language is at least partly rooted in local sign languages that have long since gone extinct. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French_Sign_Language\">French Sign Language</a> was the first modern, \u201cmethodical\u201d sign language, codified in the 1760s and 70s for formal instruction from existing signs used in the Deaf community of Paris by the <a href=\"http://giving.gallaudet.edu/HOF/pastinductees/the-abbe-charles-michel-de-lepee\">Abb\u00e9 Charles-Michel de l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e</a>. When America\u2019s first school for the deaf opened in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817, French Sign Language was imported and likely fused with a handful of existing New England sign languages. The result was ASL. (British Sign Language, dominant in the UK but only granted official status in 2003, is not directly related to ASL.)</p> <p>Today, there are at least 500,000 ASL signers in the US, while ASL and ASL-derived sign languages are also widespread across the Caribbean, the Pacific and much of Africa and south-east Asia. The language\u2019s increasing dominance in countries on every continent reflects the strength of Deaf culture in America and the role that well-meaning American missionaries and educators have played in spreading Deaf education through ASL.</p> <p>In the past, James Woodward told me, missionaries would often tell deaf people in other countries that they didn\u2019t have a language. \u201cIt\u2019s improving now,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I saw that going on as late as 1999 in Thailand, when some Americans came over. I think there\u2019s a growing awareness in the Deaf community in the US of how ASL has really endangered many other sign languages, and even destroyed some.\u201d</p> <p>As with English, prestige plays a major role in the growth of ASL. The linguist Victoria Nyst has written that \u201csigners in West Africa tend to perceive ASL-based sign languages as being superior to sign languages of local origin.\u201d Similarly, Misella Tomita, a young Gallaudet graduate from Hawaii, described visiting the Netherlands and seeing everyone using ASL rather than Dutch Sign Language: \u201cI felt like ASL is taking over the world.\u201d Closer to home, Woodward has studied Black ASL, which seems to have evolved in the second half of the 19th century at segregated deaf schools in the southern US. The dialect, which is an inspiration to Lambrecht, carries a heavy stigma and has become highly endangered. Almost all black signers now use standard ASL.</p> <p>At the Hawaii School for the Deaf and Blind, ASL became the standard in 1960. Today, more than half the teachers are Deaf and students are expected to sign ASL while learning to read and write English. HSL is only used, occasionally, by one dedicated teacher, and Linda\u2019s proposal to teach the language there was turned down.</p> <p>\u201cI think ASL is the reason for the decline of HSL,\u201d Woodward told me matter-of-factly, but then added: \u201cYou can\u2019t really separate the personal issues from the linguistic issues.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts enormous stress on a community. For years, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/mexico-language-ayapaneco-dying-out\">last two fluent speakers of Ayapaneco in Mexico</a> were not on speaking terms, until outside pressures and incentives convinced them to reconcile. According to William O\u2019Grady, one language with just 60 speakers has four competing writing systems. In any community that speaks an endangered language, there are often groups who think the language is not worth saving. \u201cBut usually when it\u2019s too late, there\u2019s a deep sense of regret,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.</p> <p>In Hawaii, the remaining community of HSL signers is deeply divided. Lambrecht is the face of the language, but as a past president of the Aloha State Association of the Deaf (ASAD), she is on the opposite \u201cside\u201d from many of the older signers, who belong to a group known as the Diamond Head School Alumni (after the former name of the deaf school).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts stress on a community. The remaining HSL speakers are deeply divided</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The two organisations are the institutional expression of a seemingly intractable split in the Deaf community that dates back to at least the 1970s. Some explain it as generational, historical and linguistic, but it is also personal, visceral and mysteriously self-perpetuating. In 2014, when the deaf school marked its 100th anniversary, there were two separate celebrations: one for the Diamond Head group, one for the group Lambrecht is a part of. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just natural now, this fighting,\u201d Lopez told me.</p> <p>Because HSL was in retreat by the 1950s, most younger Deaf people can hardly sign in the language \u2013 there was virtually nowhere for them to pick it up. Many take great pride in their identity as Deaf Hawaiians and emphatically support HSL as a symbol of that identity. But some of the most fluent of the older HSL signers, in the Diamond Head group, are deeply ambivalent about reviving the language. \u201cEven though they use it in their conversations, they don\u2019t feel that HSL is a real language,\u201d said Darlene Ewan, a community activist who teaches at the deaf school.</p> <p>Early on, Wanda Andrew, who is part of the Diamond Head group, warned off the researchers: \u201cI said, \u2018To tell you the truth, for HSL it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cThe loss of HSL is sad, but it was just sort of a mixture of everything, like chop suey, just kind of like an accent.\u201d For Andrew, who is in her 70s, ASL enabled a cosmopolitan life, from studies at Gallaudet to decades on the mainland and eventual marriage to a Deaf Australian man.</p> <p>Explaining why some keep their distance from the project, Andrew added that \u201cPeople will just say they don\u2019t want to, because they don\u2019t want to work with Linda.\u201d She continued, \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t remember [signs], then they just don\u2019t remember [them]. Or they might be afraid of what it\u2019s for, or they don\u2019t want to feel dumb\u2026 I don\u2019t support Linda, I think she\u2019s a little narcissistic.\u201d</p> <p>Others close to the Diamond Head group agreed that personal animosity and questions of authority \u2013 whose signs to record and revitalise? \u2013 are part of the problem. Lambrecht\u2019s supporters counter that she has almost single-handedly led the revitalisation effort. Lambrecht herself points to the lingering power of the stigma: \u201cHSL is in their hearts, but they\u2019re resistant. They want to be modern.\u201d</p> <p>The divide, which has implications for how the language is documented, is now reflected in a similar rift between the researchers. Earth and Woodward now acknowledge that ASL must have had a deeper impact than was initially understood, obliterating HSL and leaving in its place a hybrid of ASL and HSL that Woodward calls CHSL (Creolised HSL).</p> <p>Earth believes that when signers refer to HSL today, they may actually mean CHSL \u2013 a view Woodward does not share.After meeting more members of the Diamond Head group, Earth argues that CHSL is the only thing left: \u201cI have never seen pure HSL. Fewer and fewer old folks retain strong HSL elements\u2026 They cannot recover pure HSL because they never knew it.\u201d Woodward counters that \u201cthe past two years have shown that Lambrecht is using a different language from CHSL\u201d \u2013 during recording sessions where Earth, increasingly estranged from the project, was not present.</p> <p>The signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cyellow\u201d have become a particular flashpoint in this dispute. Woodward argues that Lambrecht\u2019s distinctive signs for these colour terms make semantic sense, because they are clearly related to the HSL signs for \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cbamboo\u201d and \u201cpineapple\u201d. But other signers were incredulous, saying they had never seen the signs before and suggesting that they might be specific to Lambrecht or her family. Their own signs for those colours were basically ASL, and they couldn\u2019t remember any others that might be original to HSL. Earth felt that the pressure to find such \u201coriginal\u201d non-ASL signs risked distorting the research.</p> <p>\u201cIf no other person has a sign and Linda has a sign, I don\u2019t know what else to do except use her sign,\u201d said Woodward, who worked with the last known signer of Chiang Mai Sign Language in northern Thailand before he died of complications from diabetes in early 2015. Lambrecht\u2019s signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, and \u201cyellow\u201d are likely to be the standard for teaching HSL going forward. \u201cIf there\u2019s only one person left,\u201d Woodward said, \u201cthen that\u2019s what you have to document.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Now in its final month, the three-year project to document and revitalise HSL has made progress, but the hardest work remains ahead. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to do everything we wanted,\u201d Woodward told me recently. He is applying to the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme for a six-month grant extension. Even now, he said, the team is still finding new signs.</p> <p>While she continues her work with Woodward, Lambrecht is looking beyond Hawaii, since ASL is spreading to other islands across the Pacific: \u201cI want to tell people there: it\u2019s not that you\u2019re stuck with your local sign language, you can borrow signs from ASL, but please don\u2019t throw out your local language.\u201d Woodward believes that many of the Pacific\u2019s innumerable islands had, or may still have, traditional, indigenous sign languages of their own \u2013 he has already identified one on Majuro, one of the Marshall Islands.</p> <p>\u201cTime is passing quickly,\u201d Lambrecht said the last time I talked to her. The oldest signer who had joined the project, a Japanese-Hawaiian woman named Mildred, was dying. \u201cI remember Mildred would always tell me, \u2018I don\u2019t like HSL, I like ASL, it\u2019s for educated people like me,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018No, no, no, it\u2019s our local language!\u2019\u201d Mildred was seen as one of HSL\u2019s remaining masters, but she had been reluctant to sign for the camera when I visited last year.</p> <p>Then in February, Linda told me, Mildred had a bad fall and went to the hospital. She couldn\u2019t walk and was now under hospice care, living with her son. Linda visited her recently: \u201cI saw her signing \u2013 and I noticed that she had reverted to HSL. We were just shocked. The others didn\u2019t understand her, I said let me translate. Now when I visit her I try to catch every story I can, while she\u2019s still here. Next time I go I really want to bring the camera and record her.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

But I couldn\u2019t just sit at home and do housework all day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1f9c4487364fe4abe0a2d03f3fa893dcde03a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1f9c4487364fe4abe0a2d03f3fa893dcde03a01/0_447_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lakshmi Sharma edits video reports sent from the field as Khabar Lahariya increases its digital presence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lakshmi Sharma edits video reports sent from the field as Khabar Lahariya increases its digital presence</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Khabar Lahariya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sharma was the first in her family to get a smartphone, a gift from her husband, who wanted to support her work. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked technical things, and I\u2019m the person in our house who knows the most about phones and technology,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are impressed by how much I know.\u201d</p> <p>Though smartphones have made reaching people easier than ever, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/india-mobile-phone-dropped-calls\">connectivity in villages is still a major problem</a>. \u201cI get calls from reporters saying they have been filming reports for two or three days, and they just can\u2019t get a 3G signal to send them,\u201d says Kavita, now the digital head. \u201cSome of them have to travel 20 or 35km by bus and on foot just to get a connection to send them.\u201d</p> <p>Shalini Joshi, who co-founded Khabar Lahariya, said that when she set up the paper there were very few women in journalism in rural India, and very few newspapers that were independent. \u201cBy independent I mean not influenced by corporate or political agendas. I saw a gap in rural Uttar Pradesh and that region, and I wanted to bring more women into journalism and establish an independent newspaper.\u201d</p> <p>She says the paper aims to tell stories from a feminist perspective. \u201cWe try to give women voices, and tell stories from their points of view when possible. We have a whole page dedicated to women\u2019s issues in the paper and a women\u2019s column on the website.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2960ef7f4370208ebad3fa19f7750bfbeed2b8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2960ef7f4370208ebad3fa19f7750bfbeed2b8e9/118_0_1833_1100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meera (M), photographed with fellow reporter Kavita (R), says video reportage has increased the prestige of the newspaper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meera, centre, photographed with fellow reporter Kavita, right, says video reportage has increased the prestige of the newspaper</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Khabar Lahariya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In rural India, women are still expected to work at home. Reporting news and discussing politics is seen as men\u2019s work, and many women on the Khabar Lahariya staff have faced threats and danger while working. \u201cMany women are intimidated and ridiculed for doing their jobs. We have one reporter who was threatened so seriously by a village chief that she wouldn\u2019t leave her house and wouldn\u2019t tell any of us what had happened. We had to spend hours talking to her, and counselling her, before she could go back to doing her job,\u201d says Joshi.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Meera recalls reporting a story about a land dispute. \u201cI was taking photos outside one man\u2019s house. He took me inside, blocked the entrance of his house with a motorbike and said, \u2018You like taking photos? Come, let\u2019s take some photos in my bedroom.\u2019 I managed to get out and call the police.\u201d</p> <p>For the Khabar Lahariya staffers, working at the newspaper has transformed their lives. \u201cIt is my dream job,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cThe villagers were not supportive at first, but now they say, \u2018You\u2019re the first woman from our village to do this kind of work.\u2019 They cut out my articles and frame them and put them up on the walls. Young girls in the village come to me and say, \u2018Sister, we want to be like you.\u2019 It makes me very proud.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Surnames not included at the request of the women, who feel using them leads to caste-based discrimination</em></p>",
  "<p>The publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, Fairfax Media, has posted a full-year net loss of $893.5m compared with an $82m profit last year after announcing a close to $1bn write-down of assets last week.</p> <p>The media company, which now makes 50% of its profits from online property business Domain, last week separated the profitable website from its struggling newspaper division.</p> <p>Total revenue also declined in the 12 months to 26 June, to $1.83bn, from $1.87bn the previous year, while net operating profit fell 7.6% to $132m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/01/fairfax-announces-billion-dollar-write-down-and-plan-to-split-off-domain\">Fairfax announces billion-dollar write-down and plan to split off Domain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite an increase in pre-tax profits at Domain and a 20% growth in group digital revenue, Fairfax was hindered by the continued poor performance of its flagship mastheads.</p> <p>Profits in its metro division, which houses the Canberra Times as well as the Herald and The Age, fell nearly 45% to $39m, while profits at local and regional newspapers fell 10% to $110.9m.</p> <p>There are 209,000 paid digital subscribers to the SMH, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, accounting for $38m but it is not enough to offset the losses on the newspapers.</p> <p>With print circulation revenue and print advertising revenue both declining Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood confirmed it was only a matter of time before the Monday to Friday editions of the metropolitan papers ceased publication in line with global trends.</p> <p>The national six-day-a-week Australian Financial Review would move to a \u201ctargeted printing\u201d schedule, he said.</p> <p>\u201cFor our Australian Metro Media titles The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age it should surprise no one, and certainly not us, that the seven-day-a-week model will eventually give way to weekend only, or more targeted printing in the case of The Australian Financial Review,\u201d Hywood said.</p> <p>\u201cThis trend is already occurring globally. Exactly when we move towards implementing this new model depends on the view we form about trends in consumer and advertiser behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>But after a torrid year which saw a strike by journalists in protest at forced redundancies Hywood was keen to emphasise the positive contribution of Domain and other digital businesses to the bottom line.</p> <p>Hywood talked up his transformation of Fairfax Media into a sustainable publishing model which has seen the company significantly reduce its editorial workforce, laying off hundreds of journalists, artists and photographers in recent years.</p> <p>In a worrying trend smh.com.au fell into third place in the Nielsen online news rankings in June, as the ABC News website soared into second place for the first time and <a href=\"http://news.com.au\">news.com.au</a> took top spot.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s result is proof that the transformation of Fairfax Media over recent years has succeeded,\u201d Hywood said on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThe stable top-line revenue and ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] make it clear that we have reshaped this company into a high-value, broadly based, digital rich business.</p> <p>\u201cDigital and non-print earnings now constitute more than 40% of Fairfax\u2019s ebitda. On current trends, next year this will be closer to 60%, reflecting the continued growth in digital and nonprint earnings. We are delivering a higher quality of earnings from our more valuable segments \u2013 including Domain, digital publishing and Events. This single fact underlines the extent of the transformation of the business in recent years.\u201d</p>"
