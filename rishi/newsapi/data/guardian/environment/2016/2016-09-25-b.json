  "<p></p> <p>Smoking should be banned in all parks and playgrounds to reduce the chances of children growing up thinking that using cigarettes is normal, environmental health officers have told ministers.</p> <p>Zoos, theme parks and anywhere else children play should also become no-smoking zones, in a significant proposed expansion of the outdoor areas in which smokers cannot light up.</p> <p>Smoking has been illegal in enclosed public places such as bars, nightclubs and restaurants, as well as public transport and work vehicles, across the UK since 2007.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/06/e-cigarette-vaping-ads-children-underestimate-smoking-risks-study-tobacco-cigarettes\">E-cigarette ads may cause children to underestimate smoking risks \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.cieh.org/\">Chartered Institute of Environmental Health</a> said on Monday it wants local councils to designate any place where children play or learn as a smoking exclusion zone, although adherence would be voluntary, not statutory. Banning it in those locations would also protect children from secondhand smoke, it says.<br></p> <p>A new YouGov poll commissioned by the CIEH shows that 89% of 4,300 adults surveyed back a ban on smoking in children\u2019s play areas, while 57% want it to end in public parks. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the vast majority of people would support restrictions on smoking in children\u2019s play areas. We would like to see smoking being stubbed out wherever children play or learn,\u201d said Anne Godfrey, the CIEH chief executive.</p> <p>\u201cThis would not only include children\u2019s playgrounds but could see no-smoking zones extended to public parks, zoos and theme parks. Children should be able to have fun and enjoy themselves without seeing someone smoking and thinking this is normal behaviour,\u201d she added.<br></p> <p>Some councils have already moved to try to stop people smoking in some outdoor places. For example, Coventry city council has asked parents not to smoke outside the gates of its 82 primary schools. The policy has gone down well with parents and headteachers, the council said.<br></p> <p>Wrexham has also decreed that playgrounds, school gates and bus shelters should be regarded as smoke-free places, while Nottingham city council seeks to ensure that all its outdoor attractions are smoke-free for the six weeks of the school summer holidays.<br></p> <p>\u201cPublic opinion \u2013 and not just among parents \u2013 has swung heavily in favour of protecting children from exposure to tobacco smoke and from the behavioural cues children pick up from seeing adults smoking. This is a real opportunity to make it easier for children to grow up healthy,\u201d said Jim McManus, the director of public health at Hertfordshire county council.<br></p> <p>\u201cParents and children, when given the choice, are overwhelmingly supportive of smoke-free playground. Local voluntary schemes have been popular. It\u2019s time to give parents what they are asking for. You might feel like this is the nanny state \u2013 you\u2019d be wrong,\u201d McManus added.<br></p> <p>Forest, the smokers\u2019 rights group, called to the plan \u201cOrwellian\u201d. Its director, Simon Clark, said: \u201cExtending the smoking ban to outdoor parks and play areas would be a gross overreaction. There\u2019s no evidence that a significant number of people smoke near children in outdoor areas, nor is there evidence that smoking outside is a threat to anyone else\u2019s health.\u201d</p> <p>Clark added: \u201cPublic parks are for the enjoyment of everyone, including smokers. Most smokers use their common sense and smoke accordingly. They don\u2019t need government dictating how they behave. The idea that children should be protected from the sight of someone smoking is Orwellian. Adults can\u2019t be expected to be perfect role models for other people\u2019s children.\u201d<br></p> <p>The owners of zoos and theme parks, because they are private businesses, should be allowed to decide whether smoking is banned, Clark said.<br></p> <p>It became illegal last October to smoke in a car in England or Wales carrying anyone under the age of 18. New figures last week showed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/number-of-uk-smokers-falls-to-lowest-level\">proportion of adults in England who smoke</a> had fallen to a record low of 16.9%.<br></p> <p> Deborah Arnott, the director of Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cWhile the ban on smoking in indoor public places resulted in significant health benefits, thousands of children are still exposed to smoke in the home and elsewhere. Growing up in a smoke-free environment is one of the best ways of ensuring that they are not attracted to smoking and lured into a lifelong addiction and ill-health.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Parents are being urged to boycott requests to disclose their child\u2019s nationality and country of birth over fears it could turn teachers into de facto border guards and stoke divisions in the classroom. </p> <p>Human rights groups are concerned that the data, collected for the first time this year from pupils aged two to 19 as part of the schools census, could be used against children and their families by immigration enforcement. </p> <p>The Department for Education (DfE) insists that the information will not be handed to the Home Office and that the data is being collected and input to the national pupil database (NPD) to ensure children \u201creceive the best possible education\u201d. </p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/pupil_data_sharing_with_the_poli#incoming-846569\">disclosures under freedom of information laws</a> have shown that the Home Office has been handed NPD data on 18 occasions since 2012, while police requests for information from the dataset were granted 31 times.</p> <p>Disclosure is not compulsory, but a recent <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/pupils-who-were-not-white-british-told-to-send-in-birthplace-data/\">investigation by the trade magazine Schools Week</a> found that schools were misinterpreting official guidance by demanding pupils\u2019 passport numbers and even specifically targeting the parents of non-white children. </p> <p>\u201cThat creates a climate where half the class is being told you\u2019ve got to bring in your passport and the other half haven\u2019t,\u201d said Gracie Mae Bradley, from Against Borders for Children. \u201cIn a post-Brexit environment, kids are already precarious; they are already feeling like it\u2019s not a good thing to be a migrant child and this further divides them.\u201d </p> <p>She called on parents to boycott the census questions. \u201cIf every parent in the country exercised that right to refuse, that would protect all undocumented children from any potential enforcement action and it also sends a very strong signal about the kind of society that we want to live in.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, more than 20 groups are writing to the education secretary, Justine Greening, to ask her to reverse the requirement for schools to collect the data, warning that the plan risked violating the right to privacy of children and families.</p> <p>\u201cOur grave concern is that the new data will be shared with the Home Office and therefore used for immigration enforcement purposes,\u201d says the letter, whose signatories include Liberty, the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network and Privacy International. </p> <p>\u201cWe have already seen data-sharing between the Home Office and other departments increase since the government announced its commitment to creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for undocumented migrants. Such measures deter vulnerable children and families from accessing essential services, exercising their human rights and participating on an equal basis in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners see the new census requirement as the latest step in a crackdown on what the government has dubbed \u201ceducation tourism\u201d. In 2013, ministers were forced to abandon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/27/ministers-immigration-crackdown-education-tourists\">proposals to exclude the children of undocumented migrants</a> from school, amid fears it would breach <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx\">international human rights law</a>.</p> <p>But two years later, Nicky Morgan, then education secretary, ordered officials to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11805477/Nicky-Morgan-orders-immigration-review-to-examine-education-tourism.html\">investigate how much of a \u201cpull factor\u201d state schools were for immigrants</a>, as part of measures to slash net migration. \u201cAnd then, in 2016, you get this announcement about monitoring the scale and impact of pupil migration on the education sector,\u201d Bradley said.</p> <p>Bella Sankey, policy director of Liberty, the human rights group, said the latest plan risked creating \u201ca chilling effect around school attendance\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHostile-environment policies are deeply problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cThey outsource immigration enforcement to private citizens and public sector workers whose roles have nothing to do with border control. This latest wave of reforms targets sensitive public services like healthcare and education. It is insidious to be targeting the kids and risks making them additionally vulnerable if they are then kept away from school.\u201d</p> <p>Don Flynn, director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, said the proposal jeopardised \u201ca decade of real advance\u201d in the relationships between schools and migrant communities. He said: \u201cPeople in migrant communities across the UK have been thrown into great uncertainty about their future as a result of the Brexit vote and the harsher tone of the public debate. </p> <p>\u201cThe DfE should not be adding to this anxiety by introducing a measure which will inevitably increase the sense of being watched and scrutinised by state agencies with a view to future deportations.\u201d</p> <p>The DfE insisted it took the privacy of children seriously and that the data would be used for research purposes and not be routinely published. A spokesperson said: \u201cThese data items will not be passed to the Home Office. They are solely for internal Department for Education use for analysis, statistics and research.</p> <p>\u201cThis information will be used to help us better understand how children with, for example, English as an additional language, perform in terms of their broader education and to assess and monitor the scale and impact immigration may be having on the schools sector.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s financial services are becoming increasingly anxious about life after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote</a>, according to the latest detailed survey of confidence in the sector. </p> <p>Optimism dropped for the third consecutive quarter in the three months to September, according to the research jointly produced by the CBI business lobby group and the accountancy firm PwC. </p> <p>It marked the longest run of deteriorating sentiment since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/05/interest-rates-quantitative-easing\">the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial system was in the midst of a deep and prolonged crisis</a>. </p> <p>The biggest drop in confidence was among finance houses, building societies and investment managers, and less so among banks. Optimism was broadly stable among life and general insurance providers.</p> <p>When asked to list their main concerns over Brexit, financial firms cited the top three risks as a negative impact on the economy, changes in access to EU markets and the prospect of lower yields.</p> <p>Andrew Kail, the head of UK financial services at PwC, said the continuing fall in confidence was a cause for concern, adding that businesses were considering moving their operations out of Britain because of the vote and uncertainty over future trading agreements.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/frankfurt-tries-to-tempt-the-bankers-fleeing-a-post-brexit-britain\">Frankfurt tries to tempt the bankers fleeing a post-Brexit Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early days and there is no real clarity on what future agreements will be reached.

That gave a balance of -13%, and comes just after a -16% balance for the previous quarter.</p> <p>Despite the drop in confidence, business and profits actually picked up in the sector over the three months. Business volumes were higher for 48% of firms, and lower for 13%, giving a rounded-up balance of +35%, compared with +22% in June. </p> <p>\u201cAs firms get back into the swing of things after the summer and continue to digest the implications of the EU Referendum, it\u2019s good to see that demand in the financial services sector has held up,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist.</p> <p>\u201cBut the challenges facing the sector have not gone away \u2013 they\u2019ve actually grown. Add the uncertainty caused by Brexit to low interest rates, technological change and strong competition, and it\u2019s plain to see why optimism is falling and pressure on margins remains intense.\u201d</p> <p>Newton-Smith said central to concerns about Brexit was the risk it posed to the wider economy in the years ahead. More than half of companies in the financial services sector felt the general impact of the vote was negative. About one in 10 said the impact was positive.</p> <p>She urged the government to calm fears within the financial community by communicating clear plans for negotiations to leave the EU and by producing an \u201cambitious\u201d autumn statement on 23 November that sets out a clear direction for growth.</p> <p>The Bank of England responded in August to the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote by announcing a package of measures that include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">a reduction in interest rates</a> to an all-time low of 0.25%.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/bank-of-england-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged\">the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee left the door open to another interest rate cut this year</a>.</p> <p>Employment was stable in the financial services sector in the third quarter, the CBI/PwC survey found.

They say the spikes were not a sign the market was not working: \u201cOn the contrary, in July the electricity market did what it was designed to do,\u201d the authors argue.</p> <p>With an increase in intermittent wind energy, there was a higher requirement for flexible energy sources to fill the gaps when the wind wasn\u2019t blowing.</p> <p>\u201cThe market\u2019s performance in South Australia in July indicates that it is doing what a market should do. High price volatility \u2013 on 50 occasions the spot price was above $150 a megawatt hour \u2013 encourages flexible generation in the form of gas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNew flexible generation will need to earn revenue through volatility in the price. For new intermediate generation, prices will need to spike at regular intervals,\u201d the authors say.</p> <p>This means that as the energy system transitions to renewables, there will be an inevitable increase in costs to pay for the shift. The thinktank argues politicians need to acknowledge and explain this to the public. </p> <p>\u201cThese two messages \u2013 that a major transition is going to happen and there will be a cost \u2013 need to be accepted and explained. Setting alternative expectations will leave the public frustrated and disappointed,\u201d they say. \u201cIncreased electricity costs when consumers are not expecting them could lead to a backlash that once again slows Australia\u2019s response to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The authors argue one cause of the problem in South Australia was the lack of effective and stable climate change policy. That discourages investment in new generation, and could discourage dirty power stations from shutting, as they wait to see what the next policy is.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the [emissions reduction fund] nor the safeguard mechanism provides an effective binding constraint on emissions in the power sector,\u201d they say. But since Australia has committed to reducing emissions to at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2030, \u201cthe result is unmanageable uncertainty for investors.\u201d </p> <p>The authors also argue that having a renewable energy target without a broader climate change policy is distorting the market. \u201cBy separating climate change policy from energy policy, Australia has caused changes in South Australia that are not as economically efficient or as environmentally effective as they could be,\u201d they write.</p> <p>Having a high renewable energy target, without a broader climate change policy, was driving a lot of extra capacity into the system and guaranteeing that energy was mostly wind, even if that wasn\u2019t the most useful type of energy supply.</p> <p>Wood, the lead author, said the overall picture was simple. \u201cWe desperately need to get climate change policy right in this country and integrate it with energy policy and energy markets if we want to achieve low emissions without skyrocketing prices or blackouts,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p>",

That\u2019s what football is going to become.\u201d In this future mushrooming evidence of traumatic brain injuries will turn the National Football League into a \u201cghettoised sport\u201d \u2013 Gladwell\u2019s words \u2013 avoided by the middle classes but still grimly embraced by the poor and desperate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/northampton-jim-mallinder-tv-officials\">Northampton\u2019s Jim Mallinder demands more consistent use of TV officials</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That logic could easily extend to other sports, including both codes of rugby, boxing, mixed martial arts and, yes, even football. Increasingly we are aware that it is not only crushing hits that scramble the brain but repetitive sub-concussive blows, too. Then there are the dangers of playing on with concussion. One study in the academic journal Pediatrics, published last month, followed 69 high-school athletes who sustained head injuries in football, ice hockey, soccer and volleyball and found that those who stayed on the field took twice as long to recover (44 days compared with 22 days).</p> <p>Yet the conference of the World Rugby Science Network \u2013 a global body of researchers interested in both codes \u2013 in Bath this month suggested that in rugby union\u2019s case significant steps are being made in tackling concussion and more could be on their way.</p> <p>The starting point was acceptance. As the Rugby Football Union\u2019s Matthew Cross pointed out, since the 2009-10 season there has been a year\u2011on\u2011year rise in the reported incidents of concussion in the Premiership and head injuries are now the most common injury in the league. Given players have not got taller or heavier in the past six or seven years, that is probably down to improved reporting rather than the game getting more dangerous.</p> <p>Cross then outlined the RFU\u2019s strategy to identify better and then to manage concussions when they happen. As anyone who has watched the Premiership this season will know, all teams now have a designated person to watch matches on an iPad to look out for potential head injuries. The 10-minute window for a player to have a Head Impact Assessment (HIA) is now 13 minutes so doctors can also carry out the King\u2011Devick Test, where players are asked to read a series of numbers as accurately as possible and their score is compared with their baseline.</p> <p>However, potentially the most interesting findings have come from a research project looking at a database of 1,516 professional matches between 2013 and 2015, which involved 611 HIAs. As the sports scientist Ross Tucker explained at the conference, this allowed World Rugby to code where each head injury occurred \u2013 whether it was in a tackle, scrum, maul and so on \u2013 and how it had come about. Tackles, unsurprisingly, topped the list, so they started diving deeper. How many players were involved in tackles where head injuries occurred? What direction or angles did the tackle come from? What were the speed of the players and their body positions? And how did all this change the risk of serious injury?</p> <p>Among the interesting findings were that 76% of head injuries happen in the tackle and about three quarters of those happen to the tackler. Smother tackles, which are often thought to be particularly dangerous, turn out not to be. A tackler bent at the waist, or diving, has a lower risk of picking up a head injury than one who is upright. And the most dangerous tackle of all \u2013 by far \u2013 is when both players are upright because it increases the risk of one head hitting another or smashing into a shoulder pad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/national-anthem-protest-college-football-kaepernick\">College players join in raising fists for anthem as Kaepernick's protest speads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was what Tucker said next that was most interesting. These findings had been presented to senior figures in World Rugby, as well as elite coaches and referees, and they all agreed that there needed to be \u201czero tolerance\u201d on head injuries in the sport and ways found to get the tackler lower. The research had led to a range of proposals, which are expected to be discussed shortly.</p> <p>Tucker also revealed that he wanted to make this head injury database open-sourced and be as open and collaborative as possible. Meanwhile Cross highlighted another forthcoming brain study investigating the potential effects of playing rugby union and concussion on the long-term health of elite players, which will involve physical and cognitive assessments as well as blood and urine testing to look at potential biomarkers.</p> <p>Of course rugby will remain a dangerous game. The Wales captain, Sam Warbuton, illustrated that particularly vividly when I spoke to him about the breakdown a couple of years ago. As he put it, it is \u201ca pretty ugly place when you\u2019ve got three 18-stoners flying in, trying to take your head off. Sometimes I\u2019m struggling to shampoo my head the next day because my head is hurting so bad.\u201d</p> <p>Rugby remains a tough game with obvious risks. But when it comes to concussion significant progress has been made in the five years since the 2011 Rugby World Cup, when 56% of players who were concussed stayed on the field and were diagnosed only afterwards. As Tucker points out, the use of data has built a compelling case for further change \u2013 and, who knows, may help rugby union avoid Gladwell\u2019s grim vision of the future.</p>",

  "<p>For a political party opposition is a difficult, exhausting and an unattractive business. If the purpose of a party is to bring about change in society and shape it to reflect the values of its own ideology, then parliamentary opposition seems the wrong place to be. Opposition is the antithesis of what parties are for. Or so it seemed. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s refreshed mandate as leader of the opposition has been cast as a triumph of party members over the party\u2019s members of parliament.</p> <p>The Labour leader\u2019s supporters say their \u201cmovement\u201d should be seen as part of a global trend comparable to the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/bernie-sanders-supporters/478005/\" title=\"\">grassroots success</a> of US senator Bernie Sanders or the advances of Podemos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/mike-pope/rise-of-podemos-and-its-people's-assembly\" title=\"\">people\u2019s assemblies in Spain</a>. While social movements have a dynamism missing from slow-moving parliamentary processes, it is a mistake to think representative democracy is redundant in an age of networked politics.</p> <p>The British parliament is the cockpit of the nation\u2019s history. A functioning opposition is not merely sufficient, it is necessary to provide serious scrutiny of government legislation, especially when such a prospectus is unapproved by the electorate. As the sage of parliament <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HOyzjmbSEIoC&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Walter Bagehot noted</a>, this country was the first that \u201cmade a criticism of the administration as much a part of the polity as administration itself\u201d.</p> <p>However integral the role is, parties do not seek opposition. They have it thrust upon them. Of course, losing an election might mean a party has time to reflect, renew and reinvigorate itself. MPs in opposition have to show that the policies and positions of the victorious party are damaging and wrong. Close, patient arguments can secure concessions from ministers that lead to real change in policy.</p> <p>That is why the relationship between Mr Corbyn and the party he leads is so important. Labour needs to come together, not come apart. Some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s more hardline supporters see the scale of his victory as a licence to expunge internal dissent. In this view, the renewed mandate from members must be deployed with force to refashion the party machine and its parliamentary representation to better reflect the leader\u2019s agenda. There will be pressure on nay-sayers to change their tune or quit.</p> <p>But the rebels are already chastened. Owen Smith\u2019s challenge failed. Those Labour MPs who expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/momentum-jeremy-corbyn-loyalists--confront-rebel-labour-mps\" title=\"\">no confidence in their leader</a> have no choice but to accept that their judgment has been overruled. They might not be able to change their opinion but they should be constructive and discreet with criticism. The running commentary on Mr Corbyn\u2019s performance from his own benches must stop. Likewise, the talk of punitive deselection for non-compliant MPs should be dropped. Labour has wasted the summer arguing with itself. That is not Mr Corbyn\u2019s fault \u2013 he was responding to an internal challenge. But it has, perversely, suited him. He has proved his strength in the small arena of party opinion, thus deferring the challenge of persuading the much wider audience that decides general elections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2016/sep/24/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-leadership-contest-in-pictures\">Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership contest \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His parliamentary enemies have obstructed his leadership, yet some of his supporters have come to rely on that obstruction to sustain the feeling that victory is available. A local enemy within the left is easier to fight \u2013 and much easier to beat \u2013 than a distant Tory government that hardly feels the need to engage in combat with Mr Corbyn at all.</p> <p>The parliamentary rebellion has neither the strength nor the authority to prosecute continuing war against the leader, and to try would be futile. Mr Corbyn has won. Twice. Labour\u2019s platform will necessarily become more Corbynite. But what exactly does that mean? His supporters believe he embodies a set of values that they want the party to represent. That is a mostly abstract proposition, made concrete in a handful of emblematic policies \u2013 nationalising the railways; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/11/jeremy-corbyn-vows-to-scrap-mays-grammar-schools-plan\" title=\"\">opposing grammar schools</a>. During the leadership contest, Mr Corbyn rarely came under pressure to develop his agenda beyond bullet points. It was sufficient to assert the ideal, without explaining how it is realised. That vagueness is a luxury he can no longer afford. After the railways, what else might Labour bring into public ownership? If Labour opposes grammar schools and mistrusts academies, would Mr Corbyn shut down the ones that exist already? With what would he replace them? Every assertion of principle begets multiple questions of practice.</p> <p>Unsupportive Labour MPs never stopped Mr Corbyn from giving answers before and are not stopping him now. The party is his to lead. The parliamentary rebels must let him lead it. But he must also set out more clearly how it is he intends to take them out of opposition and, yes, back into government.</p>",
  "<p>The illegal trade in endangered fauna and flora is the world\u2019s fourth biggest, after the trades in drugs, counterfeit goods and people. The difference is that there is no shortage of the other three. Every 15 minutes, an elephant is killed by poachers. A third of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were slaughtered between 2007 and 2014. On current trends, by the time that today\u2019s children reach adulthood, the African elephant will be extinct in the wild.</p> <p>This is not inevitable. Governments are about to embark on a three-yearly meeting to discuss the future of international wildlife protection. Cites, the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, brings together nearly every country on Earth in pledges to protect threatened nature.</p> <p>On Monday, the plight of elephants will take centre stage at the Johannesburg meeting and the results will affect all endangered animals. On the table is a proposal to allow a limited international market in ivory that proponents say will benefit conservation, by allowing countries with stockpiles of tusks \u2013 some historic, some confiscated from poachers, some from elephants that died naturally \u2013 to raise money that can be ploughed back into poaching prevention. It is a seductive argument. Unfortunately, in the case of endangered species, this does not work. The evidence from past tusk sales is clear: legalised markets in elephant ivory sustain demand and provide a cover for illegal trading and poaching.</p> <p>Encouragingly, the UK is set to take a stand and has moved ahead of Europe in tightening its own rules on the trade in tusks. British officials will not only oppose new legalised ivory sales but push our own domestic rules even further.</p> <p>At present, ivory produced before 1947 can legally be bought in the UK, but sellers can circumvent the law by claiming lack of knowledge of the provenance. Under tightened rules, they will have to produce evidence of the pre-1947 origin. This is a good and important step, and will help prevent the UK being a clearing house for poached tusks. Brexiters might relish the chance to thumb their nose at the European Union by advocating a total international ban on ivory sales, but Britain should not go too far. To forbid any kind of ivory to be sold anywhere would include everything from jumble sale ornaments to Steinway grand pianos. The evidence is that most illegal poaching takes place in countries where there is no possibility of future ivory sales.</p> <p>In this global arena, the real players are China and the United States. As long as there are buyers for ivory, elephants will be slaughtered. We must address the uncomfortable question of why some continue to prize the remains of dead, rare, beautiful creatures above their living nature, and how we can educate people to change this. China and the US have the opportunity in the Cites meeting to build on their newfound shared stance on the environment by extending protections to other globally endangered wildlife.</p> <p>In 1990 Cites banned the ivory trade to stem poaching, but the slaughter continues. The convention will fail in its aims to save disappearing species without government commitments to reduce demand and to increase funding for conservation. Cites can do without the tusks.

According to the association, the guard was working at a police checkpoint in August when she asked if she could wear the \u20ac500 (\u00a3430) women\u2019s bulletproof jacket she had bought herself rather than an official-issue men\u2019s one that did not fit. Despite being refused permission, she put on her own jacket. The guard is now facing insubordination charges under Spain\u2019s military penal code as the Guardia Civil is overseen by both the interior ministry and the ministry of defence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/female-police-officers-mexico-attractiveness-inspections-complains-queretaro\">Female police officers subjected to 'attractiveness' inspections in Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt may sound like that old joke \u2026 about soldiers asking the enemy for more bullets so they can keep on fighting the war, but sadly it\u2019s no joke,\u201d said the AUGC. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about workers who are trying to protect themselves in the face of apathy from the institution they serve and which, far from helping to solve things, chooses instead to prohibit them from taking their own steps to ensure their safety.\u201d</p> <p>Pilar Villacorta, women\u2019s secretary for the AUGC, said the case highlighted the desperate lack of bulletproof jackets for the thousands of women who serve in the Guardia Civil. \u201cThe jackets that we have to wear are men\u2019s jackets that are too big for us and which don\u2019t fit female bodies,\u201d she said. Not only do they not fit snugly \u2013 therefore reducing the protection offered \u2013 said Villacorta, they also make it hard for female officers to reach their guns, handcuffs and telescopic batons.</p> <p>Villacorta, who has been with the Guardia Civil for 23 years, said the situation reflected the scale of gender inequality throughout wider Spanish society. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re part of a society that is patently very masculine: we may be half the population, but it\u2019s men who get the big political jobs. It\u2019s exactly the same in the Guardia Civil: there aren\u2019t women in the big, decision-making jobs who can decide what we need. We shouldn\u2019t forget that out of 79,000 officers, only 5,000 are women.\u201d</p> <p>She said the decision to apply the military penal code in the Salamanca case was absurd given the routine policing context in which the incident had occurred, and pointed out that her colleague could face prison if found guilty of insubordination.<br></p> <p>Villacorta said the lack of bulletproof jackets for all officers had been a serious issue within the service for a long time. \u201cWe always need bulletproof jackets,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re asking is that when people graduate from the academy, they are given a bulletproof jacket along with their service weapon. If we are going to provide security and protection to the public, the Guardia Civil needs to be looking out for our own safety.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardia Civil did not respond to questions about the Salamanca case or the effect that badly fitting jackets could have on officers\u2019 ability to do their job. In a statement, it said the government had approved the purchase of 21,000 bulletproof jackets over the next three years. \u201cOf those, 2,000 will be female ones and will come in two different sizes adapted to the anthropomorphic characteristics of women\u2019s bodies. At the same time, a further 4,200 will be ordered as a reserve and for special necessities.\u201d</p> <p>According to the statement, the service currently has a total of 32,016 bulletproof jackets. </p> <p>The Guardia Civil, whose origins go back to the mid-19th century, performs a wide range of duties, from counter-terrorism and peacekeeping, to patrolling ports and airports and protecting the environment.</p>",

The general secretary is essentially a functionary - the party\u2019s most senior administrator/bureaucrat - and generally the speech is very dull.</p> <p>But this year\u2019s - for anyone interested in Labour party Kremlinology - was fascinating. The general secretary is <strong>Iain McNicol</strong> and he has an awkward relationship with Jeremy Corbyn. He was appointed before Corbyn was elected, he is not loyal to Corbyn, he used to work for the GMB, which backed Owen Smith, not Corbyn, and that Corbynites suspect that fixed the leadership contest rules as far as possible to maximise Smith\u2019s chances. It has also been reported that Corbyn would like to get rid of him, and replace him with an acolyte, although at the moment Corbyn does not have the votes on the national executive committee to make that happen.</p> <p>To a casual listener McNicol\u2019s speech may have sounded routine. But in fact it was full of coded support for Corbyn\u2019s opponents.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McNicol explicitly backed \u201cclause one socialism\u201d - the philosophy championed by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s critics that stresses the importance of Labour being an effective force in parliament. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour was created for a very specific purpose, explicit from the very start.</p> <p>And that purpose is stated in black and white in our constitution.</p> <p>\u2018To organise and maintain in Parliament and in the country a political Labour Party and \u2018The Party shall bring together members and supporters who share its values.\u2019</p> <p>That\u2019s our Labour party.</p> <p>A party founded to win elections and form governments.</p> <p>To make our values real through practical change.</p> <p>It\u2019s a powerful idea and I\u2019ve not heard a better one.</p> </blockquote> <p>This might sound like a statement of the obvious, and of course Corbyn would say that he wants Labour to be an effective force in parliament. But the leadership contest became a battle between those who said the wishes of Labour members should take priority (Corbyn) and those who argued a leader had to retain the confidence of MPs (Smith), and McNicol is explicitly siding with the latter. The quote about Labour being set up to \u201corganise and maintain in parliament ... a political Labour party\u201d is from clause one of Labour\u2019s constitution and Smith supporters quoted it during the leadership contest as a reason as a reason why Corbyn could not lead the party. And Progress, the Blairite pressure group which is loathed by some Corbynites, recently published <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2016/09/22/clause-one-socialists-will-win-the-day/\">an editorial explicitly urging \u201cclause one socialists\u201d to stay in the party and fight for their cause.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>McNicol said criticised people who wrote off the achievements of the last Labour government. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will always be those Tories who want to write off the Labour years, and pretend no good came from them.</p> <p>Let\u2019s make sure none of us ever falls into that Tory trap.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seemed clearly aimed at the Corbynites, some of whom seem to find it much easier to condemn the record of the Blair/Brown governments than to praise them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He praised party staff and said that he would always defend them \u201cwhenever they come under attack\u201d.</strong> There have been reports <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/how-jeremy-corbyn-will-reshape-labour-s-backrooms-after-victory\">(like this one, for example, by the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush) </a>suggesting that the Corbynites want to get rid of not just McNicol, but other staff at Labour HQ deemed insufficiently loyal. McNicol signalled that he would oppose this strongly. When he talked about staff coming \u201cunder attack\u201d, he did not mean from the Tories. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to say something about the people who work for the Labour party.</p> <p>We expect a huge amount from them.</p> <p>They work weekends and evenings. They drop everything to fight by-elections or local elections. They put this Party conference together year after year. They are some of the brightest and the best our movement has.</p> <p>I value them, I respect them, and I stand in solidarity with them whenever they come under attack.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explicitly praised the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), most of whom opposed Corbyn\u2019s re-election.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hard-working Labour champions, winning seats for Labour, and denying Tories, and SNP and Lib Dems an extra seat in Parliament.</p> <p>That\u2019s the PLP - Labour through and through, and deserving our whole-hearted gratitude and support.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ca9c11883261d0817beb4f9be3788ea0f9582bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca9c11883261d0817beb4f9be3788ea0f9582bc/0_19_3205_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain McNicol speaking at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain McNicol speaking at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T13:21:45.682Z\">at 2.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e7b70ae4b0f55a9f4030d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T11:39:26.486Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Heidi Alexander,</strong> who resigned as shadow health secretary, was on the Sunday Politics earlier.

But even amongst Corbyn\u2019s Scottish stalwarts, there is little appetite for another leadership election \u2013 the fourth in two years - this morning. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson set out her pitch to Labour moderates in <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/scotland/we-will-represent-the-moderates-that-labour-has-now-abandoned-wspbcjh3p\">an article for the Sunday Times Scotland</a>, promising to speak up for traditional Labour voters who now feel excluded by Corbyn, and stating she is \u201cdetermined to build a moderate Scottish Conservative party that appeals to the same people who supported Brown and Blair: one which knows that economic growth only has value if it works in tandem with social progress.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e7ade2e4b03598d1ce86ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T10:59:48.971Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I</strong><strong>ain McNicol</strong>, the Labour general secretary, is addressing the conference now.

But he insisted that he wants most MPs to stay. Asked if he wanted MPs to be reinstated, or if he wanted the process to result in a new breed of MPs being chosen, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wish them [existing MPs] well. The relationship between an MP and their constituency is a complex one. It is not necessarily all the policy, tick-boxing exercise. It is also the relationship with the community, the effectiveness of representation and all those issues. Let\u2019s have a democratic discussion. I think the vast majority of MPs will have no problems whatsoever.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn was making the point that, if local parties want to get rid of MPs, it might not necessarily be because of their political views. But the phrase \u201cthe vast majority\u201d suggests that Corbyn expects at least a few MPs to be replaced before the next election.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was opposed to a so-called \u201chard\u201d Brexit (Brexit involving giving up access to the single market). </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly rejected Parry Mitchell\u2019s claim that it is difficult for Jews to remain in the Labour party.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/25/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-liverpool-formally-opens-after-jeremy-corbyn-re-elected-leader?page=with:block-57e783a8e4b0831a514021c8#block-57e783a8e4b0831a514021c8\"> 9.05am.)</a> Commenting on what Mitchell, a peer, said about why is is leaving the party, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s unfortunate he would say that, because it\u2019s not a fair comment and I would hope that he would reflect on that because clearly there are diverse views within the party on issues in the Middle East, but there is absolute unity in the party of opposing any form of anti-Semitism, any form of racism in the party. That is very clear.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he wanted party members, and the party conference, to have more say in Labour policy making.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the investigations into alleged abuses by British servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan should continue.</strong> Asked if he backed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/24/tony-blair-end-this-army-witch-hunt-into-britains-brave-soldiers/\">Tony Blair, who this weekend said the investigations should stop</a>, Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have spoken to a number of soldiers that have served in Afghanistan and Iraq and I recognise the awful conditions that they were asked to serve under, and the difficulties they had with that.</p> <p>But I do think there has to be a recognition that we have signed up for international law on the behaviour of troops. America is going through the same experience, as do other European countries even though they\u2019re not signed up to the international criminal court. So I think there has to be investigations. Saying never to prosecute I think would be a step too far.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested the more of the defence budget should be spent on emergency relief. </strong>Asked if defence spending should be higher or lower, he said it should not be any higher. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it should be efficiently used, but I also think the defence budget should also be used where necessary so that Britain is very good at actually giving aid and comfort during emergencies. Look at what we did during the Ebola crisis and other things.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He questioned the need to expand the size of MI6.</strong> Asked if he backed i<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37434131\">ts decision to hire 1,000 more staff</a>, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t necessarily think that is particularly necessary.

But secondly, you know, this is about leadership and this is about becoming prime minister, and Jeremy\u2019s fine with his group of people and the membership who\u2019ve put him in, but at the end of the day you\u2019ve got to win an election and you\u2019ve got to appeal to middle England and I don\u2019t think he has a hope in hell of doing that \u2026. Jeremy has no leadership qualities whatsoever, his little group like him and they think he\u2019s the Messiah, but he will never become the leader and prime minister of this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mitchell also said that antisemitism in the party was a major factor in his decision.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m Jewish and I\u2019m very strongly Jewish and I make no bones about it and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Jeremy himself is very lukewarm on this subject. He\u2019s never been as vociferous in condemning anti-semitism as he should be, and when he does make a mention of it he combines it with other forms of racism, so he will never say specifically as far as antisemitism is concerned. But even more than that he surrounds himself with a coterie of people who hold violent, violent anti-Israel views and allied with it they are very hostile to Jews so, in my view, they\u2019re pretty bad guys.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s very difficult if you are Jewish and you support Israel to be a member of the Labour party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e7676de4b03598d1ce85d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T07:16:36.391Z\">8.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You might expect Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour conference to be dominating the news headlines this morning, but events in Liverpool are being slightly overshadowed by a Conservative party story - excerpts from a book by David Cameron\u2019s communications chief, Sir Craig Oliver, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37465452\">saying Cameron felt \u201cbadly let down\u201d by Theresa May during the EU referendum.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/779779700151517184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mail on Sunday front page:<br>How Theresa torpedoed PM Cameron<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sTDcZa2HrD\">pic.twitter.com/sTDcZa2HrD</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/779779700151517184\">September 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a reminder that Labour is not the only party beset by deep and bitter divisions - although the fact that the Conservative party is fundamentally split on the key issue of our time (Europe) doesn\u2019t seem to be doing them much harm.

Given the choice, I would choose to stand in safe standing areas (I used to swap a grandstand ticket for a terrace ticket at away games in the 80s) but I won\u2019t stand in seated areas, because I won\u2019t align myself with men (always men in my experience) who bully women, children and those less able to be on their feet for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Of course, it only takes a few at the front to stand and then we all have to, so the problem looks bigger than it is - but the solution is more straightforward too. Warn those standing to sit down and if they stand again, eject them from the ground. Firm stewarding, CCTV and (most of all) a will to eradicate it, has more or less banished racist chanting from football grounds - the same tactics should apply to standing in seated areas. And it will once someone is seriously injured.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t agree with all of this, I\u2019m afraid. In the first instance, it\u2019s not one or the other: most standing doesn\u2019t cause too much aggravation to the others around, in my experience. And, as I child, I stood on my chair and generally considered it part of the fun. I also find women to be generally capable of standing, though of course there is a problem with those who cannot, even if we must acknowledge that they are in the minority. </p> <p>So, I absolutely disagree that people who stand in seated areas should be hoofed out, and am generally loth to endorse anything that allows clubs to continue ridding their clubs of people they\u2019ve decided they no longer need; West Ham\u2019s use of \u201ccustomers\u201d is telling. Nor do I feel comfortable treating persistent standing in the same way as we treated racism, though you are right to note that sometimes people can get too aggressive; in experience, it is as much those who want to sit as those who want to stand.</p> <p>None of which is to say that you\u2019re wrong in identifying a problem, though luckily, the answer is simple: safe standing.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:38:26.233Z\">at 3.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e7dea2e4b0f55a9f40317b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:27:31.361Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As per the preamble:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034659207909377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Instruction to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHUSOU?src=hash\">#WHUSOU</a> stewards: &quot;Persistent standing will be discouraged &amp; in the 1st instance steward will ask customers to be seated&#39; 1/2</p>&mdash; Henry Winter (@henrywinter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034659207909377\">September 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034898577022977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;persistent offenders will be ejected if appropriate and the details of their seat recorded.

They needed late goals to see off Bournemouth and Accrington Stanley and lost to Astra Giurgiu and Watford, while supporters have also been taken time to, er, \u201c<em>settle in</em>\u201d. For all the branding and grandstanding, hype and hyperbole, they\u2019re still rattling around an athletics venue that has very little to do with them.</p> <p>The might have coped with upheaval were it for not some appalling luck with injuries. Diafra Sakho, Andy Carroll and Andre Ayew are all missing, Winston Reid has been absent too, and the squad no longer has a fit left-back \u2013 enough to unsettle any team. But, even so, three points from five games reflects neither the quality of West Ham\u2019s players nor the quality of their manager, and all concerned must advise themselves immediately.<br><br>Southampton, meanwhile, are improving. After a dicky start, they pushed Arsenal all the way and walloped Sparta Prague, before beating Swansea and Crystal Palace; Ronald Koeman and Sadio Man\u00e9 may have left, but the rest of the players know what to do.

  "<p>My mother, Mary Jones, who has died aged 94, was a headteacher and passionate believer in social justice.</p> <p>She was born in Littleborough, Lancashire (now in Greater Manchester), the daughter of Alice (nee Backhouse) and Norman Pickup. While Mary was still young, the family moved to Crumpsall, Manchester. Her mother died when she was 11, after which she was raised primarily by her grandmother.</p> <p>Although Norman was a humanist he insisted that his daughter went to the local Methodist church so that she could make up her own mind about religion. The church, a vibrant one with many activities, would come to dominate her life. Her ambition was to become a nurse and during the second world war she volunteered to work in the local hospital, but her involvement in the church scouts group steered her towards the care of children and education.</p> <p>In 1947 she enrolled on a teacher training course in Coventry, where she met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/28/john-jones-obituary\">John Jones</a>, also a teacher, at a dance, and they married in 1949.</p> <p>Mary started her career in 1948 at Hope Street school, Salford, where she set up a girl\u2019s netball team. The initiative was so popular that many female workers from the local factory would come to support the team after their shifts had finished.</p> <p>In 1952 she had her first child, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/09/rick-jones-obituary\">Richard</a>, and had to give up work. When Norman contracted tuberculosis she decided to nurse him at home. So Richard was one of the first children in Britain to receive a new type of vaccination against the disease.</p> <p>Following Norman\u2019s death, Mary returned to teaching in 1963 at Cheetwood primary school, next to Strangeways prison. She taught a mixture of children; some of their fathers were \u201cover the wall\u201d and some of them were prison warders. She said it was a time full of laughter, as the children said so many amusing things. In 1967 she became deputy head at Miles Platting primary school, which was \u201cfailing\u201d, and she often ended up having to teach 80 children when other staff could not cope.</p> <p>Miles Platting was closed after it was found to be built on top of a mine shaft and Mary was promoted to headteacher at Harpur Mount school in Harpurhey, which by chance was next door to the school where her husband was head, Collyhurst. It was in a major slum clearance area and together they provided the best possible educational environment for the children. Mary stayed at Harpur Mount until her retirement in 1980.</p> <p>She was for some time the secretary of the local Labour party in Manchester, and was a prolific letter writer. She disagreed with the war in Iraq and was involved in a number of issues, from CND and Amnesty International to anti-apartheid and, lately, anti-austerity, for which she attended her final demonstration in her 90s in a wheelchair, having just had a new heart valve fitted.</p> <p>When she retired she took to computers and swapped letter writing for an Instagram account on her iPad. She read the Guardian online, signing petitions and writing emails to politicians until a week before her death.</p> <p>John died in 2010 and Richard in 2014. Mary is survived by me, her grandchildren, Anna, Luke, Alice, Richard and Rachel, and four great-grandchildren.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s 6.45am at Camden ambulance station in north London, and the day shift is just beginning. Andy Donovan, who will drive the ambulance I will accompany for the next nine hours, is making me a cup of tea. His more senior paramedic partner, Dean Lowes, is running a few minutes late. When he does arrive, Lowes looks very sorry for himself: he\u2019s got an ear infection, picked up on a friend\u2019s stag weekend in Budapest. Lowes is the ambulance\u2019s first case of the day. They nip off to the nearby Royal Free hospital in Hampstead to get some ear drops. Paramedic, heal thyself.</p> <p>All this delays us for more than an hour, and we\u2019re not ready to \u201cgo green\u201d \u2013 telling the London ambulance service\u2019s call centre near Waterloo station that they are available for a job \u2013 until after 8.30am. Lowes, who along with Donovan is featured in the BBC\u2019s new three-part series on London\u2019s overstretched ambulance service, is suitably embarrassed. \u201cThis never happens to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m never ill.\u201d But full marks for at least getting here. Crewing an ambulance is challenging at the best of times.</p> <p>Soon after going green, our first assignment comes in, flashing up on a monitor at the front of the ambulance. It\u2019s just about as unpleasant as it could be. One word: \u201cHANGING\u201d, and the location. It is a \u201cRed One\u201d \u2013 the top-priority call sign, meaning life-threatening. Lowes and Donovan\u2019s speed of reaction is electrifying. One moment, Lowes had been playing a Kings of Leon track on his mobile and saying how much he liked the band; the next, the ambulance is tearing south towards King\u2019s Cross.</p> <p>The call comes through at 8.49, and we get to the scene five minutes later. My heart sinks when I realise it is student accommodation. Two policemen are arriving simultaneously, and we all head up two floors in the lift to a stuffy, antiseptic white corridor. I go up with the policemen, who are bemoaning the fact their car was the closest to the scene. \u201cYou had a feeling it was going to be a funny day,\u201d one says to the other. \u201cYou said you had a feeling in your bones.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says the other with a grim laugh, \u201cI should shut the fuck up.\u201d In situations like this, black humour is sometimes the only way out.</p> <p>Lowes, as senior paramedic, is first into the little study-bedroom. He has to decide if the student, who appears to have hanged himself, is dead, or, in the official language they use, to declare \u201clife extinct\u201d. It takes him just moments to satisfy himself that he is. The student is pronounced dead at 8.57. I can\u2019t bring myself to look at the body \u2013 the young man is fully clothed \u2013 for too long. What strikes me most is how peaceful he looks, and how red his hands are \u2013 the blood drains down to the hands and feet, a sign he has been dead for several hours.</p> <p>Within minutes there are half a dozen police on the scene, taking a statement from the traumatised fellow student who discovered the body, talking to the staff in the hall of residence, looking through the young man\u2019s possessions to establish his identity. It has ceased to be a medical emergency and become a police inquiry \u2013 and a personal tragedy for the family who do not yet know what has happened. It appears the young man, who was 23, was anxious about a dissertation he had failed to deliver. What a terrible, pointless waste.</p> <p>This is a shocking beginning. A suicide by hanging is rare. It is the first Lowes has witnessed. \u201cHe looked like a wax dummy,\u201d he says as we wait downstairs while he does the paperwork to certify the death. \u201cIt\u2019s when you see his passport and the picture of how he looked when he was alive that it hits you. That humanises it.\u201d Having been a body, he becomes a person. \u201cI try not to look at a dead person\u2019s effects too much,\u201d says Lowes, \u201cbecause you start to build a little story about them.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go into it too deeply,\u201d adds Donovan. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff you lock in the box.\u201d</p> <p>A paramedic team leader turns up. He doesn\u2019t say so, but Lowes and Donovan know he is there for their welfare \u2013 to make sure that having to deal with the young man\u2019s death has not affected them too severely. \u201cIf you want to take a bit of a break, that\u2019s fine,\u201d the team leader tells them. They don\u2019t particularly, although they do have a fag standing next to their ambulance. The morning is hot, and people stroll past the student block, laughing in the late-summer sunshine, not realising that inside a promising young life has been extinguished.</p> <p>By 11am, they are ready to roll again. They go green, pressing the button that declares the ambulance available, and in a second \u2013 literally \u2013 their next assignment flashes up. It\u2019s another Red One \u2013 a cardiac arrest in West Hampstead, a couple of miles to the north. The siren screams, I lurch around in the back of the ambulance feeling sick, and Donovan swears at the vehicles that block his way, costing him vital seconds that could mean the difference between life and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232/0_164_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Dearing/BBC/Dragonfly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The job is undeniably exciting, or at least seems so to me. Horrible, of course \u2013 no one wants to discover dead bodies \u2013 but also fascinating because of its unpredictable nature. You have no idea where you will go next or what you will have to deal with. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d Donovan had told me earlier. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to from job to job.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s like roulette, I suggest, and he tells me that is exactly what they call the last job of the day. If you go green with, say, half an hour left of your shift, the call centre will play \u201cred roulette\u201d. Instead of giving you a less urgent call (categorised from C1 to C4, depending on the degree of seriousness), they will give you something life-threatening. It seems mad, but the logic is that whatever you do is likely to take hours \u2013 every callout seems to generate a mountain of paperwork \u2013 so you may as well go to something that is worth your while. A practical, if heartless, way of looking at it. Paramedics often work 12-hour shifts, and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to get a final Red One at the very end.</p> <p>We get to West Hampstead in about six minutes. Another ambulance is already on the scene, as well as team leader April Barter, who has come by car. I bumped into her earlier at the ambulance station in Camden, and she was complaining about having nothing to do that morning. Now she has something to do. A man in his 60s has had a cardiac arrest \u2013 a heart attack in which his heart has stopped completely \u2013 and the struggle is on to save him.</p> <p>The man is lucky. I hadn\u2019t realised where we were when we arrived, but then it dawns on me \u2013 it\u2019s a bridge club, and dozens of middle-aged and elderly card players are watching the paramedics\u2019 attempts to revive their fellow participant. Even before the first crew arrived, some medically trained members of the club had starting giving him CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), that pounding of the chest that aims to kick the heart back into action. Without their prompt action, he would be dead. The paramedics continue the CPR \u2013 by now his chest looks as if it has caved in, but apparently this is quite normal \u2013 and administer defibrillation, an electric shock designed to correct his heart rhythm.</p> <p>After half an hour of attention, his heart is functioning again and he can be taken to hospital. He is still unconscious, but has a reasonable chance of surviving. His bridge partner, who tells me they had just played a very successful rubber, offers to go to hospital with him, while his wife is given the news at home. There is an impressive calm at the club as the man is carried out. Who knew bridge could be an extreme sport \u2013 or bridge players so unflappable?</p> <p>A cardiac arrest involving two crews generates an especially large volume of paperwork, and we are stuck outside the Royal Free for more than an hour while all the forms are filled in. Soon after we deliver the man to the hospital\u2019s heart centre, Barter tells me he has regained consciousness. \u201cThe fact he\u2019s awake, his eyes are open, he\u2019s moving around tells us his brain has more oxygen. Although potentially it has been starved of oxygen for a short period of time, that\u2019s a really positive sign and it\u2019s a potentially good outcome for him. That\u2019s a massive lift for us. Good times.\u201d She says she is \u201cbuzzing\u201d. \u201cIf I can make a difference to one person in a day, then I go home happy,\u201d Donovan told me earlier. It looks as if he and his colleagues have made that difference today.</p> <p>It is that difference, rather than the material rewards of the job, that attracts Lowes and Donovan. \u201cYou don\u2019t do this job if you want money,\u201d says Lowes, who is 37 and comes from the north-east of England. \u201cIt has other benefits. You go home and you sleep at night. You don\u2019t take any work home with you. You might take some kind of emotional stuff away at the end of the day but, as far as the working day is concerned, once you\u2019re finished, you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes, who is a fully qualified paramedic, tells me he earned \u00a336,000 last year. Thirty-year-old Donovan, a friendly, buoyant east Londoner who is one rung below his partner in terms of clinical qualifications, says he earns \u00a320,000 a year basic, which rises to about \u00a328,000 with the inner-London allowance, rest-break compensation (they will typically work through their breaks) and overtime, lots of overtime. They are contracted to work 37-and-a-half hours a week, but can do up to 56. Without the overtime, they would struggle financially. The staff need the relentless pressure on the service to earn enough to live.</p> <p>The upside, apart from the drama of the job and the satisfaction of saving lives and helping people at moments of crisis, is the flexibility. \u201cThere are a lot of other things out there that I wouldn\u2019t want to do, sitting behind a desk being one of them,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cAt least in this job you\u2019ve got a little bit of freedom. Once you\u2019re out on the road, you\u2019re your own boss.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/03/my-life-as-a-paramedic-when-every-second-counts\">My life as a paramedic: when every second counts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the paperwork for the cardiac arrest case is being done, I talk to Gary Nicholls, one of the paramedics in the first crew to arrive. He has clocked up almost 24 years on the job \u2013 Lowes and Donovan have each done seven. \u201cYou never know what the next call is going to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps us interested. But it doesn\u2019t matter what comes down on the screen, we can always deal with it. The workload can be relentless, but your colleagues are there to get you through the shift.\u201d</p> <p>The London ambulance service was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/27/london-ambulance-service-special-measures-care-quality-commission\">put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d</a> last year because of a number of failings, including staff shortages, poor response times, lack of leadership and concern that the service was ill-prepared to deal with a major terrorist attack. The cynic in me thinks the BBC series \u2013 and my ride in the ambulance today \u2013 are part of the PR fightback, and maybe they are, but there is no doubting the commitment of the dozen or so paramedics and backup staff I meet. This is a service under pressure, but by no means one that has lost heart. Nicholls really does believe they can deal with anything, including his first job that day \u2013 chasing a naked man who it was feared was high on drugs across Hampstead Heath.</p> <p>It is already well past 1pm. The complexity of the jobs, the paperwork and the fact that you need a bit of a breather mean crews will only do four or five callouts in a nine-hour shift, and six or eight in a 12-hour one. Just before 1.30pm, Donovan and Lowes go green again. This time it\u2019s a Red Two \u2013 slightly less urgent but still potentially life-threatening, a woman in Kilburn with chest pains and breathing problems.</p> <p>She is sitting on the stairs of her house when we arrive six minutes later. She looks remarkably well, and within about two minutes of arriving Lowes has diagnosed an anxiety attack. She had a heart bypass operation five years earlier, and clearly fears a heart attack. She has already been to hospital for a checkup that day, and now wants to go back, despite getting the all-clear earlier. It is unlikely there is a serious problem, but Lowes and Donovan can\u2019t take any chances, so take her to the Royal Free. It\u2019s not their most productive couple of hours, but they talk to her respectfully, calm her down, deliver her to A&amp;E and fill in a fresh set of forms.</p> <p>It\u2019s now 3 o\u2019clock, and we\u2019re on our way back to Kilburn. This time they\u2019ve received a less urgent C2 call, after an earlier Red One to another fatality was aborted. The monitor in the ambulance advises \u201cman in his 70s with severe behavioural change\u201d. When we get to the flat, we find an elderly man close to collapse \u2013 probably through dehydration \u2013 and his wife at the end of her tether. She thinks he has undiagnosed dementia, and there are suggestions he can be violent towards his family, though today he can barely raise himself from the sofa.</p> <p>It is an example of the social work side of paramedics\u2019 work. They check him over physically, but he is in reasonable shape apart from the dehydration. What he may need very soon is a place in a care home. That is the shadow that falls across the conversation Lowes has in the corridor with the man\u2019s wife \u2013 the sad but all-too-common conclusion of a 50-year marriage \u2013 while Donovan talks to the man\u2019s son about sport.</p> <p>As their appearance in the BBC series shows, they are very good at being de facto social workers, counselling the anxious, the elderly, the confused, the demented. \u201cWhen I first started this job, going into people\u2019s homes took a bit of getting used to,\u201d says Donovan, \u201cbut because you\u2019re wearing a uniform, in the eyes of the public you\u2019re a goodie. You\u2019re welcomed into most situations, whether it\u2019s for social reasons or for emergencies.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes calls the man\u2019s GP, who promises to come round. For the moment, there is nothing more that can be done. More paperwork and another cigarette in the afternoon sun. The shift is drawing to a close, and the crew do not fancy any red roulette. There is a general callout for an ambulance, any ambulance, to go to Victoria station, where a girl has fainted. They decide it\u2019s too far and head back to base. That\u2019s enough excitement for the day.</p> <p>As we drive back to Camden, their monitor is reporting that University College hospital has been temporarily closed, St Mary\u2019s in Paddington is accordingly under severe pressure and the Royal Free is \u201cbreaching\u201d \u2013 A&amp;E is missing its waiting targets and patients are being left in ambulances longer than they should be. It\u2019s going to be quite a night shift, and Lowes and Donovan are happy to be out of it. But tomorrow they will be back, and who knows where the spin of the roulette wheel will take them?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/39/ambulance\"><em>Ambulance</em></a><em> starts on BBC1 at 9pm on 27 September. </em></p> <p><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>The contest is over, the result was decisive and the question of the Labour leadership is settled. So Jeremy Corbyn is right to move things on and put the Labour party on a general election footing, given that this may well come next May or sooner. It is a recognition that, while creating a \u201csocial movement\u201d has its place, the primary function of a political party is to seek to implement its values in government. How else could we have established the modern welfare state, the NHS, the Equal Pay Act, the minimum wage and more?</p> <p>Divided parties don\u2019t win elections, but the unity we need won\u2019t come through demands and threats. It will come through dialogue and understanding. That is why the nod and wink given by the leadership to threats of deselecting good, hardworking, popular MPs must cease. Our leader has already said he sees no need to change the rules on the selection of parliamentary candidates, so he shut down that counterproductive debate by making it clear that the only talk of removing MPs that will be entertained is replacing Tories with Labour ones at the next general election.</p> <p>Believe it or not, we all share the same values in the Labour party, but there will always be differences of opinion on policy \u2013 that is in the nature of the broad-church political parties we have under our flawed first-past-the-post electoral system. We can\u2019t win under FPTP if any one strand of the Labour tradition is forced out of the party for not being slavishly \u201con message\u201d(I thought we had rightly given \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d the boot several years ago) \u2013 we need to build a coalition of support spanning from left to centre-left to be successful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can address immigration without aping and accepting the division and prejudice peddled by Ukip</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are some MPs who will choose to rejoin the frontbench. Fine. Some, like me, will seek to hold the executive to account through parliament\u2019s increasingly important select committees \u2013 as Margaret Hodge and Tom Watson did in the last parliament in respect of the Murdoch press and big multinationals on tax. Others will run campaigns from the backbenches, like Stella Creasy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/nov/25/stella-creasy-labour-wonga\">crusade against loan sharks</a>. Wes Streeting recently tabled no fewer than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/labour-mp-wes-streeting-higher-education-bill-amendments-nus\">30 amendments to make the higher education bill work</a> for students. There are many ways of contributing, and all are vital parts of Labour\u2019s campaign for social justice.</p> <p>To win at the next election we have to be future-facing and relevant to those we represent \u2013 and those we aspire to represent, too. Currently we fail this test. So we must all drag ourselves out of the trenches and look forward. This starts with dumping the obsession with redundant labels, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/20/labour-launches-tougher-policy-on-tsunami-of-online-abuse\">ending the online thuggery and abuse </a>to which too many lifelong Labour members have been subject. \u201cBlairite\u201d is a redundant term \u2013 Tony Blair ceased to be leader almost a decade ago and New Labour is over. Calling Labour people \u201cTories\u201d, \u201cRed Tories\u201d or \u201cTory-lite\u201d is not only juvenile but hardly sends the right message to the millions of people who voted Tory last time whose support we need to form a Labour government \u2013 giving potential converts to our cause the impression we think they are the devil incarnate is a curious way to win them over.</p> <p>And to be relevant it is no good endlessly talking about the things we like to talk about to those with whom we agree. In order to grow our support and win an election, I want to see our leadership addressing our weaknesses and engaging on the difficult issues where many take a different view from us. You cannot duck the difficult issues in the middle of an election campaign. True courage requires us to find a Labour response that talks to those concerns, heals the divisions in society and is consistent with our values.</p> <p>It is extraordinary \u2013 given that a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/\">third of Labour voters opted to leave the European Union</a> and took a different view from the party\u2019s official position on the EU referendum \u2013 that immigration hardly featured during this year\u2019s leadership contest. As democrats, we should not ignore the referendum result, which is why I disagree with calls for a second referendum. Nor should we patronise those who voted to leave by simply dismissing them as bigoted and racist.</p> <p>This does not mean aping and accepting the division and prejudice peddled by Ukip \u2013 that should always be challenged. But it does mean recognising that, while immigration has brought huge benefits, it has also posed challenges to local labour markets and to community cohesion. But it need not do so if we put in place the right policies to support communities and move away from a laissez-faire approach to integration.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-not-unpopular-but-divisive\">Professor John Curtice</a>, the pollster who came closest to predicting the result of the 2015 general election, found that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/21/pollster-john-curtice-warns-labour-majority-2020-election-improbable-politics\">concern about our ability to provide competent government</a>, particularly on the economy \u2013 aside from any considerations of ideological positioning \u2013 that did most to deny us office in last year\u2019s election.

Gutted, in fact. I couldn\u2019t even vote. Northern Ireland voted to remain, so at least my local community still wants me. But I feel there is little incentive to stay.\u201d </p> <p>Dillenburger, who has brought her university more than \u00a31m in research income, much of it European, and set up two successful master\u2019s courses, said she was \u201calready not getting the emails about future international collaborations I would have been getting before. UK universities are becoming irrelevant\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Ladomery, an Italian associate professor of biomedical science at the University of the West of England, said he too felt very uncomfortable. \u201cThe nationalistic and xenophobic climate really puts me off, and I don\u2019t want my child to be exposed to it,\u201d he said. Ladomery said he had received \u201cno interest whatsoever from EU applicants\u201d for a recently advertised, fully funded research fellowship. </p> <p>British academics are also considering moving away. Helen Fletcher, an associate professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Horizon 2020 funding for her consortium of about 30 Europe-wide partners was secure for the next two years. </p> <p>But because she is British, her continental partners are \u201cworried for the future ... They are thinking of the next tranche of funding,\u201d Fletcher said, adding that she would seek future funding through UK sources, rather than Horizon 2020. </p> <p>\u201cMy home is here, in the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if it gets to the point that I can\u2019t get research funding because the environment is detrimental to that, then I would move.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Off the coast of San Diego, America\u2019s eighth largest city, commercial fishermen harvest about 1,100 metric tons of seafood from the Pacific every year.<br></p> <p>That sounds like a lot. But it isn\u2019t much to Don Kent, who says he can do better with just one fish farm.</p> <p>If Kent gets his way, he would raise 5,000 metric tons of yellowtail jack and white sea bass in a grid of net pens measuring about a square mile, anchored four miles off San Diego in federal waters.

Whether consumers know it or not, about half of that is farmed in aquaculture facilities much like the one Kent wants to build. While the federal government has permitted shellfish farming for years, it didn\u2019t allow farming of finfish such as bass and salmon until earlier this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/15/wild-caught-salmon-seafood-sustainable-alaska-fishing\">This Colorado poet is disrupting Alaska\u2019s commercial fishing industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhy are we buying all of our yellowtail from farms in Japan when I could grow them four miles off our coast and lower the carbon footprint and the trade deficit at the same time?\u201d says Kent, president and CEO of<a href=\"http://rosecanyonfisheries.com/\"> Rose Canyon Fisheries</a>, which aims to build the project. \u201cThis is done around the world. It\u2019s just not done here.\u201d</p> <p>But Kent isn\u2019t likely to get approval soon, because the location is all wrong. The government is eager to promote offshore fish farming to alleviate pressure on overfished wild species. But it wants that to happen first in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Marine Fisheries Service adopted its first rules for finfish farming in federal waters for the gulf region in January this year. Next up is the Pacific Islands region around Guam, Hawaii and Samoa, where in August the agency began preparing a report to analyze the environmental impact of aquaculture.</p> <p>The mismatch between the proposal\u2019s location and the new rules reflects the government\u2019s difficulties in incubating a new industry. Kent\u2019s proposal, first submitted in October 2014, is the only fish farm proposal that the federal government has received so far. A lawsuit filed in February contends the new rules for the Gulf of Mexico could significantly harm the environment and commercial fishing, and it may be keeping away potential applicants who want to wait for the case\u2019s resolution before filing plans.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this on an industrial scale until we have better information,\u201d says Marianne Cufone, a professor of environmental law at Loyola Law School in New Orleans. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible the Gulf of Mexico will be altered forever if we move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Raising fish in coastal farms isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet in federal waters, which range from 3-200 miles offshore. Several states allow aquaculture in coastal waters under their control, which extend out three miles from shore, including Maine, Washington and Hawaii.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5028941c1cc18ce4c6bb32da715ab8e2abdf853c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5028941c1cc18ce4c6bb32da715ab8e2abdf853c/0_0_1024_731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aquaculture net pen operated by Blue Ocean Mariculture near Kona, Hawaii.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aquaculture net pen operated by Blue Ocean Mariculture near Kona, Hawaii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NOAA Fisheries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales by the US aquaculture industry totaled about $1.3bn in 2013, according to a periodic<a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/\"> census</a> by the US Department of Agriculture. That\u2019s a 25% increase over the prior census in 2005. Finfish account for about half the total, with catfish and trout \u2013 both freshwater species \u2013 dominating the industry.</p> <p>Offshore aquaculture works mostly the same everywhere: fish live in an enclosure created with nets that dangle underwater from floating rings or platforms on the surface. The whole apparatus is anchored to the ocean floor.</p> <p>The fish remain in the nets for as long as two years, from the time they are fingerlings. They are fed a diet that may include other fish \u2013 waste from canneries and commercial fishing \u2013 and processed pellets that may include corn, soybeans and other vegetables along with fish byproducts.</p> <p>The US is currently a small player in running coastal fish farms, though its long coastlines and<a href=\"http://www.afdf.org/wp-content/uploads/14d-The-Political-Economics-of-Marine-Aquaculture-in-the-US-Knapp-and-Rubino-2016.pdf\"> appetite for seafood could change that</a>.<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5798e.pdf\"> Norway leads the world</a>, followed by China, Chile, Indonesia and the Philippines, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.</p> <p>Opening up the far offshore could ease the nation\u2019s trade imbalance in fish commerce and rebuild waterfront industries that have slipped away as a result of overfishing, says Dianne Windham, aquaculture coordinator for the West Coast region of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p> <p>\u201cI think we actually have a great opportunity here to pursue the responsible and sustainable development of offshore aquaculture, and set the standard for what it ought to look like,\u201d Windham says.</p> <p>The opportunity was slow to materialize, though. The new rules for the Gulf of Mexico took 14 years to complete. Congress repeatedly considered \u2013 and then failed \u2013 to pass legislation to legalize offshore fish farming. So the fisheries services stepped in to regulate the industry under the<a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/msa/\"> Magnuson-Stevens</a> Fishery Conservation and Management Act, a law passed in 1976 to govern commercial fishing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for the Gulf of Mexico, but it\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d says Joe Hendrix, president of Seafish Mariculture in Houston, Texas, an aquaculture consulting group. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to implement these things because of a lot of ignorant people who have misplaced concerns.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a78db4ff6663346b00f21f9c74b26be46a0f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a78db4ff6663346b00f21f9c74b26be46a0f87/0_0_3072_2064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adult yellowtail, one of the species Rose Canyon wants to farm off the San Diego coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adult yellowtail, one of the species Rose Canyon wants to farm off the San Diego coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose Canyon Fisheries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hendrix is referring to critics who say their concerns are very real. This includes the risk of farmed fish escaping from their nets and breeding with wild fish and competing for food; water contamination \u201chot spots\u201d caused by fish excrement leaving the nets; and pharmaceuticals and genetic modifications used in some aquaculture operations. (The US Food and Drug Administration allows<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/319323/Opinion_on_the_welfare_of_farmed_fish.pdf\"> 18 different drugs</a> to be used on farmed fish).</p> <p>For instance, the new federal rules for the Gulf of Mexico require permit holders to report to the government only \u201cmajor escapement events\u201d, defined as 10% or more of cultured fish escaping from a pen. Anything less doesn\u2019t require reporting but may still disrupt the feeding and breeding of wild species.</p> <p>Interbreeding is a concern because farmed fish become a weaker genetic line, less able to avoid illness and parasites and to survive the hardships of the open ocean.</p> <p>\u201cTo date, we\u2019ve been unsuccessful in preventing escape from aquaculture facilities,\u201d says Cufone, who is also executive director of the<a href=\"http://www.recirculatingfarms.org/\"> Recirculating Farms Coalition</a>, a nonprofit that promotes aquaponics, a type of aquaculture in which fish and food crops are grown together. The group is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit to halt the aquaculture rules for the gulf. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think we would be 100% successful in the Gulf of Mexico, either.\u201d</p> <p>Examples of escapes are plentiful. In January 2015, for example, some 51,000 farmed Atlantic<a href=\"https://www.asf.ca/public-kept-in-dark-on-aquaculture-isa-and-escapes-in-nb.html\"> salmon escaped</a> from their pens off the coast of New Brunswick, Canada. In another case, farmed salmon have been found in Canada\u2019s Magaguadavic River and the rivers of British Columbia during spawning season.</p> <p>Hendrix and others in the industry counter that escaped fish are not a problem because, raised in pens and hand-fed, they lack the \u201cfitness\u201d to survive for long in the open ocean. In other words, they\u2019ll be eaten by wild fish before they have a chance to compete for food or interbreed.</p> <p>The new aquaculture rules for the Gulf of Mexico also have no conditions governing fish welfare or humane treatment of fish. Other nations, including<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/319323/Opinion_on_the_welfare_of_farmed_fish.pdf\"> Great Britain</a>, have recognized that fish feel pain and stress, and that aquaculture facilities should be designed and managed to prevent such suffering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/11/seafood-industry-sustainable-fishing-salmon-overfishing\">Reeling it in: global sustainable seafood market hits $11.5bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US federal government should have fish welfare rules in place before opening the sea to aquaculture, says Bernard Rollin, a professor of ethics and animal sciences at Colorado State University.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s well known by fish biologists that fish are enormously susceptible to stress, noise and crowding,\u201d says Rollin, a pioneer in the field of agricultural animal welfare. \u201cIf you screw it up, they\u2019ll all die.\u201d</p> <p>The fight over developing a sustainable industry means a longer wait for fish farm developers like Kent, who grew up in San Diego and remembers the city waterfront was once known as \u201cTuna Town\u201d because it served a huge tuna fishing fleet with businesses that built boats, repaired equipment, caught and processed fish. That work mostly left for Asia when regulations and public sentiment arose in the 1970s against the bycatch of dolphins by tuna fishermen.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got a working waterfront where the only work it\u2019s doing is entertaining people. It\u2019s not feeding people,\u201d says Kent, who is also CEO of Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, a nonprofit arm of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment.</p> <p>Kent says his $50m Rose Canyon project would generate 200 jobs for the region and employ newer cage technology that is submersible, a design that prevents the cages from getting destroyed by tussling waves during storms.</p> <p>Rose Canyon already faces opposition from environmental groups, and commercial fishermen are concerned that aquaculture could affect the wild fishery.</p> <p>Peter Halmay, a commercial fisherman based in San Diego and founder of the<a href=\"http://communityfisheriesnetwork.net/SDFWG.html\"> San Diego Fishermen\u2019s Working Group</a>, worries that farmed fish could develop viruses during captivity that would be released into the ocean and devastate native fish.</p> <p>He\u2019d rather see the government continue working to revitalize commercial fishing. For example, catch limits have been in place for years to limit harvest of important species, especially numerous varieties of rockfish.

This is a new business. It\u2019s an iconic British brand, steeped in history. We want to focus on that and move forward. Will we ever be international online or go back to bricks and mortar? Who knows? In retail you can\u2019t rule anything out, it\u2019s ever-changing.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough we are starting again in the UK, we have a number of advantages over a typical startup. We are nimble and efficient, but with a great brand, strong customer base and a proven and dedicated team.\u201d </p> <p>Most of the 84-strong workforce is made up of former BHS workers, and Anderson said he hoped to employ more people once the business was established.<br></p> <p>\u201cNearly everybody has worked with us before. We\u2019re trying to create jobs. We\u2019ve got to make sure what we\u2019re building is on strong foundations: we\u2019re not going to rush into this. As we grow, I do want to be able to recruit more people, especially former BHS workers.\u201d</p> <p>Prices will be \u201cthe same or lower\u201d than they were previously according to Anderson, who said there would be fewer promotions in the future. \u201cThere will be the odd promotion, but not the spectaculars and mega days that the old business used to do,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/19/dominic-chappell-owes-500000-in-tax-from-bhs-ownership-profits\">Dominic Chappell owes \u00a3500,000 in tax from BHS ownership profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anderson said BHS clothing was previously targeted at customers aged 45 or older, whereas its new ranges would be aimed at those aged 35 and older.

  "<p>What is Jerusalem? Or \u2013 this question is related \u2013 <em>where</em> is Jerusalem?<br></p> <p>Its status as part of Israel, which seized the city\u2019s east during the Six Day War and claims it as <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-we-want-peace-but-wont-divide-jerusalem/\">its eternal and undivided capital</a>, has long been one of the trickiest obstacles to peace, a position so contentious that the US supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/supreme-court-jerusalem-israel-passport\">had to step in last year</a>, to defend America\u2019s longstanding hedge on the sovereignty of the Holy City. </p> <p>This weighs on everyone, because Jerusalem is more than a place on the map: culturally it is the portal to heaven, perhaps even heaven itself. The real city and its eternal image bleed into each other. A few years ago, the mordant Polish artist <a href=\"http://www.postmastersart.com/archive/kozyra15/kozyra15.html\">Katarzyna Kozyra traveled to Jerusalem</a> and found dozens of foreigners with delusional, even psychotic visions of themselves as messiahs.

The show instead rewards slow, close looking at manuscripts and psalters, jewelry and liturgical finery. You\u2019ll spend much of your time crouching over vitrines, but don\u2019t mistake tidiness for modesty. This is an exhibition of sweeping ambition, which asks you to find the human in the divine and vice versa.</p> <p>It opens not with a holy relic from one of the three faiths that orbit Jerusalem but with something much more irreligious: a heap of coins, made of solid gold and worth enough to buy several houses. (The coins were found last year in a port north-west of Jerusalem, and have been loaned by the Israel Antiquities Authority.) Even for the pious, money talks. The rich, of whatever confession, know how to get what they want. Wealth and faith defined art and design in the medieval holy city. A necklace found at the port of Ascalon, dating to around 1100, features a rhomboid pendant with gold filigree recalling the most sophisticated of Islamic decorative arts. In fact, if written records are to be believed, it was included in the trousseau of a Jewish bride.</p> <p>This medieval Jerusalem was a metropolis in the midst of redevelopment and rediscovery. In the first decades of the second millennium, an earthquake struck, levelling parts of Jerusalem and leaving the al-Aqsa mosque in disrepair. Reconstruction got under way when the local caliph struck a deal with the emperor of Byzantium, and Jerusalem became not only modernized but diversified. It was a place for both religion and commerce, not to mention the biggest tourist trap of its day, drawing pilgrims from as far afield as Iceland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da2005beff9a5e07d9545fc44e661ece7d1d52ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da2005beff9a5e07d9545fc44e661ece7d1d52ce/0_0_1500_1308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An incense box, one piece on display at the Met\u2019s new exhibit, Jerusalem 1000-1400: Every People Under Heaven.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An incense box, one piece on display at the Met\u2019s new exhibit, Jerusalem 1000-1400: Every People Under Heaven.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sanchez, Marc Pelletre/Museum of Islamic Art, Doha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the covered markets around the city\u2019s churches and mosques, shopkeepers spoke a dozen languages and sold things like <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?exhibitionId=%257b3e2bd038-7aea-4779-9951-2974efca566d%257d&amp;amp;oid=652486\">an exquisite diptych of the virgin and child</a>, or a copper platter featuring an Orthodox warrior ringed by Arabic inscriptions.

Mosque lamps of brass and, rarer, of glass and enamel, are ringed with calligraphic ornamentation. God is in the details.</p> <p>In 1099, Jerusalem was captured by European crusaders. They constructed spectacular new sites for Christian worship \u2013 and massacred the city\u2019s Jews, Muslims and other Christians while they were at it. (They only held the city for 88 years. At the end of the 12th century, Saladin sacked it again.) The Met show doesn\u2019t shy from the violence of this conquest; indeed, curators Barbara Drake Boehm and Melanie Holcomb write that \u201cart became as complicit as oratory\u201d in encouraging the murder of those who prayed differently. </p> <p>One massive sword of steel and iron has both a Christian monogram and an Arabic inscription: it was, the double engraving implies, taken as booty after a later conquest. Nearby is <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/collection/crusader-bible/68\">a page from a picture Bible</a>, painted in Paris during the reign of St Louis, that features the ancient kings David and Saul in contemporary chain mail. The battlefields are jammed with soldiers and horses, and in the tumult bodies are rent in pieces. One Christian soldier has taken an ax to the head, a military version of St Peter Martyr. Young men are impaled on claymores or their heads tumble from their torsos. The violence is uncontainable \u2013 the image runs past the frame and into the margin.</p> <p>What would become of these fallen crusaders, Frenchmen whom this anonymous artist depicted as the chosen people? Their bodies were mutilated, but their souls were en route to heaven \u2013 or, to give it its other name, to the New Jerusalem. Both the Old and New Testaments describe the world to come as a place quite like Jerusalem. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the site of the <em>mi\u2019raj</em>: the ascent of Muhammad from the Dome of the Rock to eternity. </p> <p>In the last gallery we encounter someone we have not yet seen: the Prophet himself, who is not depicted in many Islamic traditions but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/drawing-prophet-islam-muhammad-images\">was regularly painted</a> in Persian and Central Asian art. The Paths of Paradise, a series of Timurid miniatures of almost unimaginable delicacy, portray the Prophet in a green tunic, riding his human-faced steed through golden clouds. On one sheet, he meets an angel with 70 heads, and by the gates of heaven he finds a basin with water sweeter than honey. At last, in a chamber of gold and blue, he meets a man in a purple shawl: Isa ibn Maryam, better known as Jesus Christ. </p> <p>Jesus and Muhammad gaze at each other, lips pursed, eyes locked in benevolent recognition. They know what men do in Jerusalem, and they know the world to come is a city just like it.</p> <ul> <li><em>Jerusalem 1000\u20131400: Every People Under Heaven is on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, through 8 January</em><br></li> </ul> <p><em><br></em><br></p>",

Ed Miliband would have been at the head of a coalition government and there would have been no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum.</a></p> <p>In the intervening period, Corbyn has won not one but two leadership contests, both by thumping majorities. His opponents in the party have been routed and he now has the job of getting Labour ready to fight the next election. That will be no easy task.</p> <p>Three months ago, the notion that the Conservative party would hold a double-digit opinion poll lead over the Labour party looked remote. David Cameron had just resigned after calling and losing the Brexit referendum and there were fears of a summer of financial and political chaos while the Tories chose a new prime minister. Labour had its problems but they appeared to be minor by comparison.</p> <p>The mood has now changed. Theresa May is enjoying a honeymoon period and political pundits assume that she will trounce Corbyn whenever she chooses to go to the country, whether that is at a snap election next spring or if the current parliament is allowed to run its full five-year course. The conventional wisdom is that Britain is facing another prolonged period of uninterrupted Conservative rule.</p> <p>But honeymoons - as Gordon Brown can testify - come to an end. Labour\u2019s last prime minister looked the part and had an assured start when he took over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007. Then the financial crisis broke, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/14/money2\">queues outside Northern Rock branches</a> and it was never the same again.</p> <p>May\u2019s honeymoon could turn out to be similarly brief. While the risk of an immediate recession has receded, it is possible that the government will make a hash of the Brexit negotiations when they eventually start. Before that, though, there is the possibility that the supposed cure for the last recession unwittingly creates the conditions for another painful downturn. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This is what is happening. Interest rates are low everywhere and have been for years. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are still upping the amount of stimulus they are providing, even though it is almost a decade since the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted in the summer of 2007.</p> <p>The only major central bank that is even thinking about tightening policy is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">US Federal Reserve</a>. The Fed took the first tentative step towards the \u201cnormalisation\u201d of interest rates (around 5% was the pre-crisis norm) last December and sent out signals that the cost of borrowing would be pushed up several times during 2016.</p> <p>Since then, though, the Fed has sat tight even though unemployment is low and consumer spending is strong. With negligible wage pressure and last year\u2019s fall in the cost of energy holding inflation down, the Fed has said it wants to see further evidence that the economy is strengthening before moving again. Wall Street has taken that as a strong hint to be prepared for a December rate rise although, on past form, it won\u2019t take much for the Fed to again decide to leave policy unchanged.</p> <p>In theory, the ability to borrow for the long term at ultra-low rates should be providing an incentive for US businesses to invest. That, though, is not what is happening. Rather than invest, corporations are borrowing money in order to buy back their own shares. This makes sense because, as Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research has pointed out, the cost of money is below the yield on stocks.</p> <p>But it also means the Fed has created the perfect conditions for a massive stock market bubble, which will pop the moment that interest rates start to rise. The US, courtesy of the dearth of investment, has weak productivity and inflation will start to pick up once growth accelerates to much more than 2%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32ffcba001766b07cb1670b6ae581ad9eeeac2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ffcba001766b07cb1670b6ae581ad9eeeac2c3/0_0_2208_3500/631.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Balls waltzing on Strictly Come Dancing\" width=\"631\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls waltzing on Strictly Come Dancing.

But delay means that the stock market bubble continues to inflate and that the bust \u2013 when it comes \u2013 will be even more severe. It is easy enough to envisage circumstances in which a panic on Wall Street leads to the second global recession in a decade.</p> <p>What would this mean for UK politics? Labour had two problems during the 2007-09 crash. The first was that it was in power when the banks nearly went bust. The second was that it was ill-prepared ideologically to challenge the basis upon which the global economy had been run for the previous 30 years. New Labour had bought into the idea that there was precious little governments could, or even should, do to tame the power of global finance.</p> <p>Clearly, Corbyn doesn\u2019t have the first of these problems. If there is another financial crisis, it is going to happen on May\u2019s watch. The more interesting question is whether Labour could respond to a fresh crisis with an economic programme that is intellectually coherent and politically attractive.</p> <p>This is a tall order. Labour does not tend to win power when times are tough; rather it wins during periods when the mood is optimistic and when the economy is strong, as in 1964 and 1997. In 1945, it was impossible to portray Labour\u2019s economic platform as dangerously radical, since state control of key industries had been necessary to win the war.</p> <p>The UK has the same economic weakness as the US: private investment has been too low even with interest rates at record lows. Corbyn\u2019s answer is higher public spending channeled through a national investment bank. There is nothing wrong with this. Indeed, it makes a lot of sense to remedy the UK\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies when borrowing is so cheap.</p> <p>Likewise, an idea that Corbyn floated in the 2015 leadership race - People\u2019s quantitative easing - would provide a useful policy weapon in the event of another severe financial crisis. There is little scope for central banks to cut interest rates further and the current QE programmes have encouraged speculation rather than investment. People\u2019s QE is a form of helicopter money: public investment financed by money creation by the Bank of England.</p> <p>But Labour has done little to turn higher borrowing or People\u2019s QE into mainstream ideas and is failing to counter the perception that it knows more about spending money than creating wealth. In that respect, Corbyn and Balls are alike: both are struggling to impress the judges. </p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s detractors have struggled to define him as long as he\u2019s been on the political scene. But in 2015 it was the famously tongue-tied Rick Perry who landed upon what seemed like the most accurate descriptor to date: he called Trump \u201ca cancer\u201d.<br><br>He was speaking in reference to conservatism and, rather amazingly, would later go on to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/perry-tries-to-live-down-trump-cancer-comment.html\">support Trump</a>; he was also on to something. We know how cancer cells evade the body\u2019s natural response by basically disarming the immune system \u2013 turning it off or otherwise poisoning it.</p> <p>But the way this election is shaping up, the better analogy might be an autoimmune disease. Such illnesses result from our body\u2019s natural defenses being marshalled against it with destructive results. Trump is exploiting our political immune system to the detriment and potentially grave peril of the republic. He\u2019s taken what actually makes America great, the systems of government designed to foster public good \u2013 the courts, the press, our charity and financial systems \u2013 and used them for personal gain at the body politic\u2019s expense.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to look far to find examples of Trump using the protective mechanisms of society to undermine it \u2013 and perhaps the most conspicuous example of it is the courts.</p> <p>They were designed as the legal instrument of justice: to prevent victimization; to accuse and punish evildoers; to protect wildlife and the environment from the tragedy of the commons. But Trump has perverted the system, hiring seasoned lawyers to bully his way to desired verdicts. (His $10m lawsuit against a Miss USA hopeful who wrote a Facebook post he disliked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">was just one</a> of an estimated 3,500 lawsuits involving Trump, according to a USA Today <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/\">tally</a>.)</p> <p>Recently he sought to impugn the authority of a judge ruling on the Trump University case, saying his Mexican heritage and involvement with a Latino lawyers\u2019 association posed \u201can absolute conflict\u201d.</p> <p>The courts aren\u2019t the only protective lever of government Trump may have attempted to exploit in order to shield himself \u2013 Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, received <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">$25,000 from a Trump charity</a> before her office decided not to move forward with a review of his university.</p> <p>Like so many aspects of American democracy, charities \u2013 and specifically the tax-protected nature of donations from them \u2013 are meant to encourage us to take care of the country\u2019s vulnerable and protect people from the worst possible outcomes. And the Bondi donation is far from the only time Trump may have perverted his charities\u2019 use. A Washington Post investigation revealed that monies from the Trump Foundation have been used to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/trump-foundation-charity-settle-legal-disputes-reporting\">settle legal disputes</a>. </p> <p>Trump has also found ways to subvert the financial system, and specifically its bankruptcy laws, for personal gain. The leniencies in bankruptcy law are meant to save people on hard times from complete financial destruction \u2013 allowing them to start over again. But for Trump they\u2019re <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/\">a modus operandi of sorts</a>. After four corporate bankruptcy filings, he was still a multi-billionaire.</p> <p>Then there are the ways he\u2019s used the press to his own ends. With its mission of truth-telling, journalism aims to protects society against illegal or otherwise destructive behavior by exposing it. But Trump, who parlayed the notoriety from his television persona on The Apprentice into a national political platform, exploits its weaknesses.</p> <p>His steady stream of lies is difficult to fact-check in real time, an advantage to him in debates and other events with live coverage. Moreover, he\u2019s worked to actively undermine people\u2019s trust in the press, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/donald-trump-vows-to-open-up-libel-laws-to-make-suing-the-media-easier-heres-how-he-could-do-it/\">vowing to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws</a> so reporters can be sued more easily.</p> <p>What keeps a democracy on course is believing its protective checks and balances \u2013 its immune system built up over years of evolution \u2013 will work to protect the whole. We need to believe the court systems strive for justice; that the government will represent the interests of the people and won\u2019t be bought; that the press can speak truth freely.</p> <p>Even if he loses in November, Trump will still continue to undermine trust in democracy \u2013 inciting the rage of his sometimes violent supporters with claims the election process is \u201crigged\u201d. It\u2019s a specter he and his have long floated; confidante Roger Stone predicts the ensuing chaos will be a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/roger-stone-says-there-will-be-a-bloodbath-if-election-is-stolen-from-trump/\">bloodbath</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Such a thing, should it occur, would be a violation of what is perhaps the most basic tenet of democracy: that we vote to see what society agrees on, and once it\u2019s been determined, we uphold it whether or not we agree.<br></p> <p>Trump seems to have little interest in any such civic-mindedness. And it\u2019s no coincidence Vladimir Putin is the foreign leader he most admires. In systematically curtailing Russia\u2019s democratic freedoms, Putin has already achieved what Trump seeks: authoritarianism, the worst perversion of democracy.</p> <p>Especially troubling for anti-authoritarians is that even if we succeed in stopping Trump this fall, through our imperfect system of checks and balances or whatever mysterious magic moves the public mind, one thing is certain: considerable damage has already been done.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s early September, the Colombian football team has just scored against bitter rivals Brazil, and the crowd gathered around a tiny TV screen rises and whoops, as it does in bars all over the country. Only this wooden hut is not exactly a bar; it is the recreation area for Camp Diamante, deep&#xa0;within the Colombian interior, a strategic nerve centre for the world\u2019s longest-running guerrilla insurgency.</p> <p>On neat rows of chairs, some girls sit on their boyfriends\u2019 laps; elsewhere it is a crowd of mainly young men and women sitting alongside each other \u2013 almost all in military fatigues. These are fighters from the Farc (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or the&#xa0;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). They are out for the evening, some distance away from their beds of bamboo cane and palm leaves, dug deep in the jungle. Until recently they were under ferocious bombardment by the Colombian air force.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/colombia-farc-rebel-ceasefire-agreement-havana\" title=\"\">a historic peace deal</a> is being forged with the Colombian government, ending the 52-year conflict between the Farc and the state; the evening is relaxed and playful. It is as unlike a guerrilla camp as is possible to imagine.</p> <p>This week, guerrillas from all over the country converged on this remote encampment to attend Farc\u2019s historic 10th congress and to ratify a&#xa0;peace agreement that ends the conflict. In doing&#xa0;so, they will also vote for their own dissolution as an armed organisation. The future, they say, is to turn the Farc into a political, not military, force.</p> <p>Tomorrow, 26 September, in the Caribbean city of Cartagena, before diplomats from around the world, Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, and the Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri (known by his nom-de-guerre Timochenko), will add their signatures to the peace treaty negotiated over four years in Havana, Cuba. Then the last stage in this tortuous process comes on 2 October, when Colombia votes in a plebiscite on whether to accept or reject the deal.</p> <p>If Brexit was momentous for Europe, then Sunday\u2019s vote will be Latin America\u2019s most important in decades. A Yes would end the world\u2019s longest-running war, one that has killed 220,000 people. The figure rises to 800,000 if you include the victims of narco cartels \u2013 indelibly linked to the conflict that cursed Colombia and caused the internal displacement of six million people. A No vote might plunge Colombia back into the violence that has scarred it for centuries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The paramilitaries have already started killing people.

But in the near distance an incredible structure is&#xa0;being built. In a race against time to be ready for&#xa0;the 10th congress, cabanas, conference halls, and sleeping quarters for journalists are being built. The site is abuzz night and day with activity, trucks crisscrossing it with building materials, bedding and audiovisual equipment, while fighters move purposefully from construction site to construction site.</p> <p>It\u2019s like a set from the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/24/dvdreviews\" title=\"\"><em>Fitzcarraldo</em></a>, this large space cleared in the middle of the jungle to make way for the congress\u2019s huge structure of bamboo cane and timber. From everywhere comes the sound of hammering, drilling, cement-mixing in wheelbarrows. Guerrillas work two shifts, one group on site from 6am to 6pm, to be replaced by another, who take the night shift.</p> <p>The young fighters \u2013 disappointed at a narrow 2-1 loss to Brazil \u2013 leave the bar and wander back to their bivouacs under palm trees, where guns now hang from hooks alongside clothes, water bottles, combs, toothbrushes and the small number of personal items they dot around their simple sleeping places.</p> <p>If Colombia endorses the peace process, those guns will soon be handed over to the UN as part of the agreement. If, on the other hand, Colombia rejects the deal, the future for this country is less certain, although the Farc has said that there will be no return to war, irrespective of the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a622a7645c2cfc04ed4702644289a708f71fff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a622a7645c2cfc04ed4702644289a708f71fff1/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Farc fighter Duan\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc fighter Duan, who joined the group at age 19. \u2018We are ready to return to normal life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Down the track from the main camp walks the lone figure of Duan, like many of these fighters drawn from a local indigenous tribe. He smiles broadly beneath the rim of his wide hat. \u201cI joined the Farc when I was 19,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I\u2019d like to study, preferably go back to working the land in Tolima. That\u2019s what God intended for me to do, but we were driven from our land by criminals, and had no option but to fight. But no one likes war. We have fought for so long, for our rights and for the poor, but we have families, and we are ready to return to normal life, still keeping a role within the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The vote is no foregone conclusion. A former president with significant support, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, vehemently opposes it. Many fear too that the Farc, with their communist origins, are a danger to the economic stability of the country. President Santos says: \u201cIf No wins, we will return to what we had at the beginning of this government, six years ago. We return to armed conflict. That would be a catastrophe for the country.\u201d</p> <p>To try to understand South America\u2019s most brutal and complex cycle of violence, the <em>Observer</em> has, during the past year, gone deep inside this last Marxist guerrilla movement. We have travelled into the jungle, to this redoubt in the Farc\u2019s heartland, and also to Havana, where we conducted interviews of unprecedented depth and detail with all five of the senior Farc commanders who negotiated the treaty with the Colombian government.</p> <p>Camp Diamante lies in the heart of an area known as the Yar\u00ed, after the river of that name, at a meeting point between the departments of Caquet\u00e1, Meta and Guaviare; it is steeped in the long history of war between narco-trafficking cartels, the Farc, the army and rightwing paramilitary formations.</p> <p>The Yar\u00ed land is strikingly beautiful; lush vegetation, soaring vultures and thick clusters of tiger butterflies at this time of year. It lies on a hinge between great plains to the north and thick Amazon jungle to the south-east, so that the terrain is perfect for both cultivation on the savannah and concealment within the pockets of dense equatorial foliage scattered across it. By the 1970s, the main crop across much of this terrain was coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.</p> <p>Few people can remember peace. \u201cWe and our&#xa0;parents have seen the worst of the war around&#xa0;here,\u201d says a woman called Marcela, hosing the mud off motorbikes in Las Damas, deep within Farc territory, a sort of bandit town where the government remit has never extended.</p> <p>The Farc were formed in 1964, in response to a government attack on rural enclaves of land occupied by armed peasants affiliated to the Communist party. These peasants had organised&#xa0;themselves into communes after being forced to resettle in remote lands. They were protesting against the systemic concentration of agriculture in the hands of a few landowners (often aided by powerful militias to help seize land), which had continued from Spanish colonial rule into independence. The narrative of&#xa0;conflict in Colombia cannot be told without the story of land&#xa0;concentration in a country of plenty fenced off to many. One especially merciless attack by the state in May 1964 was mounted against the so-called Marquetalia Republic, where 1,600 troops assailed up to 1,000 armed peasants in their rural enclave. The survivors scattered and retreated further into the jungle, and from among them the Farc was&#xa0;born.</p> <p>Soon after the Farc\u2019s formation, this part of Yar\u00ed was dominated, cultivated and variously contested by its enemies: the famous Medell\u00edn cartel of Pablo Escobar and rivals from Cali, which saw these untamed lands as ideal for coca cultivation \u2013 beyond the reach of the state.</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, Farc challenged the narcos. \u201cBy 1993, we had driven out the last of the&#xa0;mafia. There is blood in this soil,\u201d says a guerrilla officer, Juan Su\u00e1rez. \u201cAnd the following&#xa0;year we established Diamante camp.\u201d It is the control centre for Farc\u2019s extensive Bloque&#xa0;Oriental, or Eastern Front, which stretches for thousands of kilometres from the east-central plains towards the Brazilian Amazon&#xa0;forests.</p> <p>\u201cWe have taken on the role of government in an area where the Colombian state has never been,\u201d continues Su\u00e1rez. \u201cPeople here pay their taxes to us; we\u2019ve built 1,000km of road; we run the schools, hospitals.\u201d It is in these remote, neglected areas of Colombia that the Farc has thrived, developing the rural economy, providing medicine, building schools, imposing taxes \u2013 and running cocaine to pay for its war. Unlike other guerrilla groups, the history of the Farc is one of holding and governing territory, across significant swaths of Colombia\u2019s hinterlands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the country votes 'Yes', you won\u2019t see street parties and wild celebrations. It will be relief</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was here, deep in its heartlands of Caquet\u00e1 and Meta, that the Farc faced intense bombardment over the past 15 years, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/plan-colombia-cocaine-narcotics-farc-peace-deal\" title=\"\">Plan Colombia</a> battle strategy. Plan Colombia was initiated and supported by the United States in 2000 when the country bordered on collapse \u2013 under an attack from a combination of the Farc and narco-terrorism that disabled the institutions of the state. The police, press, judiciary and the body politic were all compromised by money or violence from leftwing terrorism, rightwing paramilitaries or cartels. Internationally, Colombia was widely seen as a failed state.</p> <p>Plan Colombia utterly changed the military balance between the government and the Farc. Laser and GPS technology turned the air force\u2019s clumsy 500lb bombs into weapons of deadly accuracy. Farc commanders could be targeted using their mobile phones. The onslaught reduced the numbers fighting for the Farc from some 15,000 in 2004 to an estimated 8,000 now \u2013 and, crucially, took out dozens of high-ranking leaders, killed by a new range of US guided missile technology. Hiding in their bamboo and canvas shelters and fighting with old Kalashnikovs and R-15 rifles, the Farc were beaten back, and very nearly wiped out. The government negotiating team in Havana are in no doubt that they bombed the guerrillas to the negotiating table.</p> <p>It was also here in Yar\u00ed that the politician \u00cdngrid Betancourt, three Americans and many others including Colombian senators and officials, were kidnapped. Betancourt was held for six years, much of that time alongside the three Americans. They were all eventually released by an intelligence sting in 2008. The three Americans subsequently wrote a book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/26/ingrid-betancourt-colombia-hostage-farc-book\" title=\"\"><em>Out of Captivity</em></a>, which detailed the horrific deprivations, loneliness and fear they suffered throughout their time in captivity. They recalled that, after weeks of marching through thick jungle when they didn\u2019t see the sun for days, they finally arrived at a jungle camp, were put in cages and forbidden to speak to one another. One of the men, Keith Stansell, a US intelligence analyst and an ex-marine recalled in an interview: \u201cYou have these kids who are just brainwashed and brought into this thing. They will, in one second, turn on you and kill you if they have to. In another second, they\u2019re just playing yo-yos.\u201d</p> <p>Kidnapping \u2013 which Farc calls \u201ctaking prisoners\u201d \u2013 of innocent people is the one activity&#xa0;many Colombians cannot forgive.</p> <p>They took 40,000 people hostage, sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks, sometimes for years. This was designed to fund the war effort, but also to enrich certain commanders. People&#xa0;were chosen as victims because their families were presumed rich enough to pay for their release. \u201cThey would stop buses full of people, and pick out the lighter-skinned people. They assumed that they would have more money,\u201d said one well-known Colombian journalist. He recalls a relative, a small&#xa0;dairy farmer who was kidnapped twice. The second time he was released after three weeks, but only after having paid a down-payment, and agreeing to monthly payments for a further three years.</p> <p>The Farc say that this was a system of imposing taxes in areas where they \u201cgoverned\u201d and provided services such as water, schools and&#xa0;hospitals where none existed. But for those who were kidnapped \u2013 and lived in fear even after their release, as they tried&#xa0;to pay the monthly instalments \u2013 it was a system of terror. At times, the Farc had upwards of 1,000 people in captivity.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Colombian army has been accused of \u201cdisappearing\u201d thousands of innocent civilians it claims were Farc combatants \u2013 the so-called \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2013 for which many army officers have been convicted. Rightwing paramilitarism in Colombia also has an inglorious history of targeting \u2013 or \u201cdisappearing\u201d \u2013 peasants, unionists, human rights activists and supporters of leftist political movements. The soil of Colombia is steeped in the sins of all these groups.</p> <p>Now, finally, the leaders of the Farc are starting&#xa0;to admit that this orgy of \u201cdisappearing\u201d people had nothing to do with their original struggle against political and economic injustice. Last Monday, in a significant intervention, and in recognition of the problem this issue poses for Farc, Ivan Marquez, leader of the Farc\u2019s delegation in Havana throughout the four-year talks, made an explicit apology for the kidnapping of thousands of people. He said: \u201cWe want to acknowledge, with humanity and reconciliation, that during the conflict the Farc caused great pain with the retention of people for ransom. That conduct, while always used to sustain the needs of the rebellion, resulted in harming entire families.\u201d</p> <p>Like other players in this conflict, the Farc lost their way in their fight for a more just Colombia. Finally, they are coming to terms with this past, in pursuit of a new political future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6c474d8fd8bca8c860d4595771d7f13b503ab47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c474d8fd8bca8c860d4595771d7f13b503ab47/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farc guerrillas butcher meat at Camp Diamante.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc guerrillas butcher meat at Camp Diamante.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the regional centre of Florencia, gateway to the old heartland of Farc, vultures snack on the roundabouts, old carthorses share the streets with motorbikes and crackheads sniff from their plastic tubes and bags of paste. Emaciated, desperate and close to death, these are the lost, the forgotten victims of a toxic conflict of cocaine, politics and economic injustice.</p> <p>In a basic, tiny bar, a singer of traditional vallenato music, Tito, makes a gesure of zipping his mouth when asked what he thinks about the peace process. Fear, suspicion and anxiety stalk every corner of these parts of rural Colombia. \u201cI don\u2019t think the peace can work, there are too many economic interests at stake.\u201d Tito, who is from a nearby city, cautions against speaking loudly \u2013 \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s here, or who\u2019s in control... narcos, rightwing paramilitaries, the Farc...\u201d \u2013 and motions us to quieten down. Nearby, Flora, from Florencia, is more optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it all here: narcos, Farc, the paramilitaries \u2013 it\u2019s been too much, we need peace at last.\u201d</p> <p>But Lisa, who works in a leather store in this hardscrabble town, shares the view of many Colombians when she says: \u201cWe cannot allow terrorists and kidnappers into politics.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are remarkable signs of forgiveness and reconciliation in these parts, and throughout the country, too. Javier, a driver, will vote for peace, despite the fact that his father, cousin and brother-in-law were all killed by the Farc for \u201ccrossing an invisible line in the territory\u201d when the turf war was at its worst. But Javier welcomes the accord, because, he says, \u201cit is better they do not have the guns than have them. It is better they are handed to the UN than kept in the jungle.\u201d You sense from all these people in the rural outposts of Colombia that bore the brunt that they have seen no winners in this 52-year war, only losers. They were the bystanders, the collateral, and feel beaten and brutalised. They are divided between those who hope for a better future, and those who long ago lost all hope.</p> <p>The plebiscite will deliver the popular verdict on whether the Farc are ready to be offered a way back into Colombian society. But many of those poised to vote Yes to peace are under no illusions. They are desperate for an end to the conflict, but are not driven by warmth toward the Farc. As one renowned Colombian writer \u2013 unwilling to be seen to be commentating openly \u2013 told us: \u201cTimochenko is not Mandela. If the country votes Yes, you won\u2019t see street parties and wild celebrations. It will be relief. We want peace, yes, because we are all tired, and it is better than war.\u201d</p> <p>And, unlike Mandela and the ANC, there is no prospect of the Farc storming to power in the near future. Even diehard supporters estimate that their initial electoral support might amount to about a million Colombians, which would represent a small minority of the total.</p> <p>There is also ambivalence from many of those who live in Colombia\u2019s large urban centres such as Medell\u00edn, Cali and Bogot\u00e1. In many respects the conflict did not impact much on their lives, as the Farc-army battles took place in the remote heartlands and only rarely, later on, did this war find its way into the cities. In fact, many Colombians will tell you that the savage narco wars between Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels of the 80s and 90s were a far greater scourge on their lives, when brutal massacres and car bombings ripped the hearts out of Colombia\u2019s major cities.</p> <p>But there was nothing minimal about the impact of the war in places like San Vicente del Cagu\u00e1n. Three hours south of Florencia, the Farc held this \u201cfrontier\u201d town until losing it a decade ago, during Plan Colombia. But the Farc, until now, has still controlled the trade routes in cocaine \u2013 which it \u201ctaxes\u201d \u2013 through San Vicente and beyond, with an iron hand. With the prospect of peace and the exit of the Farc as the enforcer in this town comes a vacuum and, already, armed criminal gangs and their paramilitary allies have arrived to fill it. There was a shootout and execution by men delivering drugs and cash from an armoured vehicle just days after we passed through town.</p> <p>Past San Vicente lies Las Damas. Truck after truck grinds its way down the pueblo\u2019s only street carrying supplies: bedding, food, clothing, fuel and the Farc\u2019s hallmark wellington boots. They are on their way to help with preparations for the 10th congress. A convoy of guerrillas from Farc\u2019s Bloque Sur \u2013 Southern Front \u2013 pitches up in the town for a meal, guns left in the rear of their 4x4s, barely drawing a glance from the locals. Their commander, Fernay, is pleasant, and eager to talk. War, he says, dehumanises us. \u201cWe have come to the end of our armed struggle. It had to end, and our war is now political.\u201d The pickups are full of very young guerrillas, who wait patiently for the food to be served before the ramshackle armed convoy heads off towards Camp Diamante beneath an indigo sky, through a torrent of rain.</p> <p>The headteacher at the school, built by the Farc, admits that the town\u2019s economy is dependent on the guerrilla presence, and their absence will empty its coffers. \u201cBut for as long as I can remember, Las Damas has lived outside the state; peace will bring the state to this place for the first time, and for the first time, Las Damas will feel like part of Colombia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbd04d54229ca7b0ca0918d28e2e1b4664446db2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbd04d54229ca7b0ca0918d28e2e1b4664446db2/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camp Diamante is in a remote, rural area where the Farc take the place of the absent state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camp Diamante is in a remote, rural area where the Farc take the place of the absent state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her observation touches on one of the deeper wounds in this war-torn country. There is no doubt that Las Damas \u2013 and many places like it that have lived under narco, paramilitary or Farc control \u2013 is ready to embrace the nation that has overlooked it. It wants, finally, to come in from the cold. It wants to lie within, not outside, the reach of the state. But is the state ready to embrace places like Las Damas? Colombia has unique physical challenges, with three Andean mountain ranges slicing between its Pacific, Caribbean, mountain and jungle identities. Transport is difficult, and the Caribbean north feels a world away from the rainforests of the south-east. For much of its 200-year-plus history the state has at best ignored, and at worst deprived, those living in the rural margins of this vast country. Does Colombia now, finally, have the will, the power and the money to bring to these regions the advantages of hospitals, schools, law and order and infrastructure that the urban areas enjoy? The peace deal says it is ready to do so. If so, it would be for the first time in history.</p> <p>Colombia is a country of extremes. There are bars and restaurants in central Bogot\u00e1 that would not be out of place in London or Rome \u2013 nor would the prices. But millions live in extreme poverty, either in shanty barrios on the edges of the big cities (mostly displaced by war in the countryside), or in rural areas. Neither of these two groups have access to basic sanitation, power, proper education or healthcare. The peace deal is partly about the Farc leaving its weapons behind, but it is also about trying to open a new chapter of social, economic and political justice in a country where these have long been absent.</p> <p>Las Damas is one such place, now a guerrilla protectorate, and where our rendezvous with the Farc for onward transport to the camp is supposed to happen. It fails to materialise and instead we meet a man \u2013 let\u2019s call him Ernesto \u2013 who is part of the Farc\u2019s underground political wing, also waiting for transport to the camp. Once the Farc comes into open electoral politics \u2013 which is an explicit part of the peace deal \u2013 its centre of gravity will not be the armed men and women in the camps but men like Ernesto, who operate in a network of affiliated organisations across the land and in the cities. Farc, to succeed, will work with the churches, unions, women\u2019s groups and environmentalists to try to build a social and political movement that will give voice to Colombia\u2019s marginalised and overlooked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/16/colombia-farc-female-fighters-in-pictures\">Colombia: Farc's female fighters, then and now \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ernesto does not want to be identified, because he fears \u2013 as does almost every guerrilla and their civilian Farc affiliates \u2013 that known connections to the Farc could be a death sentence once the movement emerges into the open, as the peace process requires. And with good reason. The Farc\u2019s last attempt to contest elections after a peace process was during the late 1980s, when they jointly founded \u2013 with the Communist party \u2013 the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica. This party won several towns and local seats, even a few in parliament. But over three years between 1987 and 1990, Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica was systematically wiped out by rightwing death squads. There are many shameful episodes in the recent history of Colombia \u2013 and the Farc is implicated in many of them \u2013 but the political extermination of UP ranks among the worst stains on a country with pretensions to being a mature democracy.</p> <p>\u201cFarc has many layers,\u201d explains Ernesto, \u201cacross the social movements. I\u2019m with an ecologist movement which will join with the new Farc, but not everyone will do so. And remember environmentalism in Colombia is not soft green politics. It has been a violent frontline between multinational interests and indigenous and land rights.\u201d In Colombia, environmentalism is about balancing access to land between business interests and indigenous people, an issue that has torn the country apart for decades.</p> <p>These remote lands on Colombia\u2019s margins, rich in mineral resources, are often settled by indigenous groups, and the clash of values and commercial interests threatens to spark a whole new battle once the peace deal is sealed. As if to illustrate this, while we journeyed towards the camp, an indigenous rights leader, Cecilia Culcu\u00e9, was murdered at her home in the state of Cauca by what is presumed to be a paramilitary hit squad. Culcu\u00e9 had been contesting investment by international conglomerates and also negotiating the rural reforms to which the peace deal is committed.</p> <p>Murders of people like Culcu\u00e9, human rights and trade union activists, have increased rather than abated with the peace process \u2013 there have been nine prominent executions in Cauca alone this year. \u201cOnce the government signed the peace with the guerrillas, many zones now free of conflict can be handed over to the multinationals for exploitation, which for our communities means pushing even harder to protect our natural resources,\u201d one of Culcu\u00e9\u2019s colleagues told the <em>El Pais</em> newspaper in Cali.</p> <p>Ernesto arranges a ride for us on the back of a truck in a Farc convoy with a troop of Medell\u00edn guerrillas. And so, with not a little irony, we end up hitching a lift to a remote camp with a group of guerrillas who until recently had specialised in kidnapping people. It turned out they are neither the best drivers, nor are the trucks the best equipped; a journey that should take two hours takes us eight as the vintage truck is held up time and again by deep potholes and mud. The frequency of the stops, and the depth of the water-filled craters, seem to defeat the Medell\u00edn troops who, time and again, drive straight into the holes, from which it takes hours to emerge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ac78653de813ab353fe4db51e55aa5f4c57234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ac78653de813ab353fe4db51e55aa5f4c57234/0_153_3945_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farc supreme commander Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, known by his nom-de-guerre Timochenko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc supreme commander Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, known by his nom-de-guerre, Timochenko, in Havana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, the track improves, at which point the elated driver presses hard on the accelerator, hurtling us on at frightening speed. Those in the back are thrown from side to side, praying that the truck stays upright and estimating what course of action would offer best protection if, as seems more likely, we career off the road. Eventually and safely, we arrive a few kilometres short of the camp where the Farc\u2019s warehouse stores are filled with mountains of grain, rice and flour. Outside, as if to preface the coming of peace, a group of guerrillas are playing keenly contested football on a pitch complete with makeshift goalposts.</p> <p>The entrance to the Diamante camp is marked by a Colombian flag with Farc\u2019s emblem on it and a red flag with the initials of the clandestine communist party, the PCCC, with hammer and sickle. Yet all around are the sights of everyday life. To the right, on a riverbank, a guerrilla fishes with a bamboo rod, while others cut meat and prepare an oven. To the left, the guerrillas\u2019 quarters are dug into the jungle; canopies of canvas strung atop bamboo poles. Most are empty while their occupants are about their business; in others, rebel fighters read, cook, watch films on their iPads, prepare coffee, play with a puppy or tend to weapons they will soon be handing over to UN monitors.</p> <p>Farc officer Juan Su\u00e1rez takes us through the camp. \u201cPlaces like this used to move every two or three days,\u201d he recalls of the Plan Colombia era. \u201cWe camped in groups of less than 25 comrades, the number below which a heat scanner can\u2019t detect us.\u201d He points to the deep mud at his feet, after another tropical downpour: \u201cThat\u2019s our other enemy,\u201d he says. And he recalls: \u201cMy worst moment in this war, when my father was killed during a bombing raid \u2013 I was 100 metres away. My mother left the camp after that, into the civilian movement.\u201d</p> <p>Chickens cluck and strut everywhere, steam rises from a beef stew. \u201cI want to stay with the movement whatever it does,\u201d says another guerrilla, Laura, preparing coffee. \u201cMy parents were in Farc, but they\u2019ve gone back to civilian life, still in the movement. I want to see them again. I\u2019ll do whatever the general staff says, but I\u2019d like to go back into the world.\u201d A guerrilla called Antonio makes his way along a little path, bare-chested. \u201cThere are still many problems out there,\u201d he fears. \u201cI\u2019ve been threatened by the paramilitaries before, and they\u2019ve already started killing people. This peace depends on the government too, as well as us. But we can\u2019t go back to war.\u201d</p> <p>These are the footsoldiers who, without&#xa0;exception, show remarkable,&#xa0;and sometimes unnerving levels of loyalty to their commanders and the organisation. There is a whiff of unhealthy group psychology at play, something that a new and flexible Farc will have to dispense with if they are to survive in a world of less-doctrinaire, open politics. The upside to that loyalty is a strong sense of collective spirit, and an organisation that provides a surrogate family, long after most guerrillas had left their own.</p> <p>One of these leaders, among the most charismatic, and likely to lead the Farc\u2019s new political movement, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/jun/25/farc-rebel-leader-colombia-interview-carlos-antonio-lozada-supreme-urban-commander-peace\" title=\"\">Carlos Antonio Lozada</a>. A little distance from the camp, he sits beneath a gazebo, sipping whisky, and talking animatedly about the past and future. He was one of five leading commanders at the negotiating table in Havana. Since March, the <em>Observer</em> has interviewed all five commanders at length for a documentary film, and can reveal the essential logic of the Farc\u2019s high command.</p> <p>When we met in Havana earlier this year, Lozada was still amazed at the idea that he \u2013 a senior Farc commander who had fought battles for years in the jungle, and lived clandestinely in the city too \u2013 was sitting opposite the very generals he had fought against. Here was adversary versus adversary. And it was this, the inclusion of serving Colombian military \u2013 from the army and police \u2013 in the negotiations that Lozada judges to have been critical to the peace deal. \u201cSince the first dialogue in the 1980s, we always said that the armed forces had to be at the negotiating table. And until now, we never managed to get a government to take that step. I never thought guerrilla fighters and military men could talk to each other and to get to know how we both see things.</p> <p>\u201cUndoubtedly we have a connection with the other side. Both sides faced the same risks, the same situations, and we started to get to know each other and found out that we speak the same language. We lived through the same places, the same battles; the same suffering. We can talk about situations we have experienced from different sides of the spectrum, particular battles, and we hear the story from the other side. That generates empathy, understanding.\u201d</p> <p>The Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Timochenko,&#xa0;is a former coffee plantation worker who cut a relaxed figure in Havana last March as we interviewed him for several hours in the garden of &#xa0;a restaurant on the city\u2019s outskirts, near the hotel in which his negotiating team had been locked in talks with the government for four years.</p> <p>He explained why he thought now, after so many years, the Colombian government and the Farc had been willing to find a way out. \u201cThey hit us very hard with Plan Colombia, yes. We never deny that. But they didn\u2019t finish us off. We\u2019re still there, firm. The guerrilla fight is very dynamic, it has fluxes and refluxes. And then Santos opened the door to talks. And I think it is because they didn\u2019t defeat us. Because they are tired. Because war has limits. The machinery gets tired and also men get tired.\u201d</p> <p>But those years of talks have clearly impacted all sides, including veteran guerrillas such as Timochenko. \u201cAll Colombians have felt the pain, for one reason or another. The pain of the mother of a guerrilla fighter is the same as the pain of the mother of a soldier. We are from the same fatherland, so we cannot use this process to throw salt into the wounds of the other side. It\u2019s about how we agree to heal those wounds. We cannot sow the seeds of another conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Timochenko paid tribute to Cuba and to the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez for enabling talks. \u201cUntil his dying breath, Ch\u00e1vez wanted us to find peace,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wanted us to enter politics and win our wars through elections as he did. He gave us the security to know that nothing would happen [to us] if we entered these talks. He was our guarantor there would be no dirty tricks.\u201d President Santos\u2019s first call as he considered initiating a peace process was to Ch\u00e1vez, to see if the Venezuelan president would support and, in effect, offer guarantees to Farc ahead of the talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03427eee9cc750b7e1162b82406d305a6aaff2b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03427eee9cc750b7e1162b82406d305a6aaff2b1/1437_25_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation for the peace deal, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation for the peace deal, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, in Havana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Muholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a remarkable move from Santos given that, under the hardline presidency of his predecessor, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, Colombia and Venezuela had been on the brink of war just months earlier. The Farc\u2019s relationship with Ch\u00e1vez was especially problematic, since Venezuela offered sanctuary to many guerrillas and senior commanders. Ch\u00e1vez also did little to close down narco routes across their shared border and helped arm the Farc at a time when Colombia\u2019s own army was under extreme pressure.</p> <p>The Farc\u2019s proximity to Ch\u00e1vez drew strong resentment from many Colombians who resented Chavez\u2019s influence over the Farc. In retrospect, given the then-tension between the two countries, the call from Santos to Ch\u00e1vez may prove to have been the most important of all.</p> <p>One of those Farc leaders who was given refuge in Venezuela was the leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez. He studied philosophy with a priest before joining the Communist party and then the Farc, emerging as a senior military commander and crucial figure in the guerrillas\u2019 strategic and doctrinal direction during war and towards peace. His discourse on war and politics is studded too with moments of personal loss, something common to Colombians from all walks of life in this conflict.</p> <p>We meet him in Havana in March among the lambent colours of a floral display in another restaurant garden, with the sound of crowing cockerels drifting through the tropical suburb. M\u00e1rquez too has had time to reflect on the pain caused both by the Farc, and to him personally.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of my brothers were victims of the repression and persecution. My brother Alvaro&#xa0;was murdered horribly in Florencia. He was captured by the intelligence services. I could&#xa0;never imagine those things could happen. His toes were cut off, his eyes were pulled out, he&#xa0;was burned with cigarette butts and they dragged him from Florencia to Morelia. There\u2019s a beautiful river there, and a high bridge. They threw him from the bridge into the river. He was&#xa0;not an activist, just my brother. In Florencia,&#xa0;a&#xa0;couple of years later, they took my other brother Alfonso. That was the fault of the military bosses.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/farcs-child-soldiers-start-new-life-after-peace-deal\">Farc's child soldiers start new life after peace deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is horrors such as these \u2013 perpetrated by all sides \u2013 with which Colombia now has to reckon. The peace agreement, says M\u00e1rquez, \u201cis a starting point. Because the political fight continues, but not with weapons any longer. With words, discourse, looking in earnest for a country in which people can live with more humanity.\u201d</p> <p>It is Carlos Lozada and others who are likely to be in the vanguard of pitching the Farc\u2019s new political project (and newly named party) to a sceptical public. Lozada insists that \u201cwhen Farc comes into the open, our idea is to embrace a rainbow of Colombians\u201d \u2013 an ambition that would&#xa0;make Farc a rare organisation, incorporating Caribbean Colombians from the north coast, mostly black Colombians from the Pacific edge, mountain people from the Andes, peasants from the vast plains and indigenous tribes of the rainforest \u2013 in addition to the urban masses, which include all of these.</p> <p>\u201cWe are betting on having a space in the political spectrum that runs from the democratic&#xa0;sectors to the left. It is not going to be&#xa0;a Marxist movement; it will be a wide proposal,&#xa0;where different sections can converge. When the Farc come out in the open, legal political fight, you will see an organisation that is a reflection of how we think of Colombians \u2013 if you go to the pacific coast, you will see a guerrilla made up of Afro-Colombians, if you go to the Cauca, those are indigenous, if you go to the Meta, they are people from the Llanos, and if you go to the northern front they are Caribbean. Our political proposal is going to be a reflection of our nation and an alternative to a regime of political domination over the decades.\u201d</p> <p>But at the heart of those talks in Havana were the victims of the conflict. Five groups representing those who had been bereaved in the war went to Havana to confront the government and the Farc. It was their participation that proved a turning point for all sides.</p> <p>Lozada recalls: \u201cWhen we started welcoming the delegates from the delegations of victims, we stopped seeing the victims as just&#xa0;statistics and numbers, but [instead saw them] as human beings and they have pain and suffering and inevitably that produces a transformation. We were quite struck that none of the victims that came here to Havana asked for revenge. They all asked us to continue this discussion at the table and not to stand up until we finish what we came here to do \u2013 which is essentially a peace&#xa0;agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one sees the tenderness of the people, the capacity of human beings for reconciliation, to forgive, that generates commitments, and one understands there is in the deep soul of our people a wish for peace and reconciliation. And so none of the opposing camps on the table can fail on that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago President Santos recognised this same mood when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/08/colombia-juan-manuel-santos-farc-peace-violence\" title=\"\">told the <em>Observer</em></a>, \u201cI am doing everything possible to teach people how to reconcile, and one thing I have discovered is that the victims are more ready to pardon and reconcile than the average citizen. If the victims are ready to pardon and to forgive, then that is a very strong basis for peace to be sustainable in the&#xa0;long run.\u201d</p> <p>Another day begins at Camp Diamante, with low but strong sunlight on the roof of a cowshed next to our quarters, from which \u201cranchera\u201d accordion music drifts across the savannah morning. A cowboy called Dimas herds cattle towards their milking parlour and says: \u201cI want peace, but I\u2019m a cowboy and I just want to stay here. I don\u2019t want to change my life and I don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d</p> <p>Concealed deep into the jungle lies the encampment\u2019s hospital compound, at the centre of which is a large, open-sided canopy hung with the Farc\u2019s emblem, the PCCC flag and a portrait of Che Guevara. In charge here is Dr Uriel Quindio, who has been performing state-of-the-art surgery in this remotest corner of Latin America. \u201cI learned medicine here,\u201d he says, \u201cat our own medical school \u2013 as good as any in Colombia.\u201d</p> <p>Quindio\u2019s worst memory, he says, was during the bombing, when many were badly injured: \u201cOne man in particular, after a 150mm mortar fell \u2013 he lost both arms and legs and had internal injuries. I attended to him and he kept saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die, hold me.\u2019 He survived here for two months.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6366ec35e1fe2a6de57ab765fdce5c5d8a0f63e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6366ec35e1fe2a6de57ab765fdce5c5d8a0f63e8/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Antonio Lozada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc commander Carlos Antonio Lozada, who came face to face at the peace talks with an army general who had tried to kill him during the war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quindio\u2019s story is as ironic as it is timely at this moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t join a guerrilla organisation,\u201d he explains. \u201cI joined in the village of C\u00f3rdoba, near here, when Farc had become a political organisation during the 1980s; Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica. There were no opportunities in the area, and so much poverty and violence I believed in a legal communist movement. But the UP was exterminated, and I was one of many young people at that time who found myself in the armed struggle because the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica had been eliminated.\u201d He agrees that \u201cthings have come around again, but this time we will surrender our weapons, so I hope for a different outcome\u201d.</p> <p>Diamante will now become one of 31 so-called \u201ctransition zones\u201d to which all the Farc\u2019s guerrillas and supporters in the clandestine networks are to converge after Sunday\u2019s vote, if it returns a Yes to the peace accords. There, the Farc\u2019s arsenal will be progressively handed over to monitors from the UN\u2013 proportionately, according to an agreed timetable \u2013 with rings of police and military nearby but not present. The process is to be completed within six months \u2013 the longest armed insurgency disarmed.</p> <p>Every organisation in Colombia\u2019s conflict has a justified charge sheet to answer for. The army, paramilitaries, narco cartels, and the Farc have all committed appalling atrocities. Reckoning with these is the guiding principle of a groundbreaking transitional justice mechanism devised between&#xa0;Farc and the government in Havana, and is crucial to the legacy of next Sunday\u2019s vote. Its guiding principles include one whereby confession to serious crimes by all parties entitles perpetrators to \u201calternative sentences\u201d such as house arrest and community service, while failing to come forward to confess crimes against humanity is punishable by lengthy jail sentences.</p> <p>The transitional justice mechanism was hammered out in the context of those that followed peace and justice arrangements in South Africa, Rwanda and Ireland \u2013 and is hailed as a landmark attempt to incorporate the best from all these experiences, while avoiding some of the&#xa0;pitfalls.</p> <p>It carefully balances all three models to create what seasoned international lawyers deem to be a gold standard, with the former president of the international criminal court in The Hague, Argentine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/luis-moreno-ocampo\" title=\"\">Luis Moreno Ocampo</a>, going so far as to liken it to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f31dd84-68b5-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f.html#axzz4KuREXWXA\" title=\"\">\u201ca work by Van Gogh that only gained public recognition after he died\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Salient whispers from both sides in Havana indicate that the process of truth and justice stands a chance of reckoning with three generations of violence. However, rigidity digs in, and to those voting against the peace process next weekend, this tentative common reckoning amounts to amnesty for, and appeasement of, terrorism. For those voting in favour, the plebiscite and peace constitute the epic moment of a lifetime: that is, not just to end South America\u2019s longest conflict, but to transform Colombia into a more equal, just society, free of the entrenched privilege that has scarred it since independence in 1810. A chance, too, to begin the search in earnest for Colombia\u2019s tens of thousands of missing, as well as reckon with its dead.</p> <p>To no small degree, the accords wrought in Havana, unthinkable five years ago, have been a&#xa0;matter of face-to-face encounter, and a mutual&#xa0;will to understand the other. M\u00e1rquez, reflecting in Havana on the past four years, says something extraordinary about General Mora, against whom he fought so many battles in the jungle. \u201cMora is a good guy. If I knew him beforehand I would not have battled him the way I did. It\u2019s surprising for me.\u201d</p> <p>If peace holds, maybe together they can help build a new Colombia, one where the next three generations escape the terrors of the last three.</p> <p>Before night falls at the camp, we repair to our quarters next to the cowshed, where one female guerrilla cuts, plaits and arranges another\u2019s hair. Both giggle uncontrollably, their 1980s Yugoslav-made weapons slung on to hooks beside the cooking area, in which meal after meal of rice, beans, plantain and beef soup are prepared. The cowherds and a couple of young fighters come in to watch a football game. This is all they have: the Farc is their family, the ideology their identity; none has a clear idea of life without this routine.</p> <p>On the other hand, a guerrilla called Antonio squelches his way from the riverbank bivouac to a sodden track through dense, dripping palm leaves. The cicadas chirp loud on the slipstream of the downpour, the red earth is soft with water \u2013 from across the road comes the sound of an axe chopping carcasses of meat, and the scent of woodsmoke. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of war,\u201d says Antonio. \u201cYes, there are risks out there, risks for everyone and especially for us, coming into the open.

This vast camp is now entirely abandoned, its installations reaching far into the dense foliage: bivouacs, tents and sturdier structures in what little dappled sunlight penetrates the roof of leaves overhead.</p> <p>There is a school, or what some would call a centre for indoctrination: a few sturdy wooden chairs remain and from the cane beams hang posters for ideological education: there\u2019s a eulogy to Timochenko, and a warning of: \u201cTotal Crisis. One day, the poor will have nothing left but to eat the rich.\u201d A poster with a hammer and sickle promises that \u201cThe Workers and Peasants Bring Change and Regeneration\u201d. And another, \u201cYou buried me and did not know I was a seed.\u201d Then there\u2019s one instructing on the use of Microsoft Office and Windows.</p> <p>Beneath the school, there is a large bomb shelter. Nearby, the commander\u2019s discreetly private quarters and beneath that another smaller shelter, his own. All now lie empty. There are cooking stations, bathing pools and innumerable paths that guerrillas presumably took to escape \u2013 for moments \u2013 the reality of endless war.</p> <p>There is almost total silence here, apart from the lazy purr of cicadas\u2019 wings and the occasional&#xa0;caw of a bird, and rustle of wings through the trees. Not a trace of wind in the humid pyrexia of mid-afternoon. The camp was evacuated eight days before our visit, in anticipation of the peace deal: the bustle and grime of guerrilla life, the bedlam of bombing, wailing of the wounded and crash of ordnance are all in the mind now. And if the peace deal is endorsed, in the past.</p> <h2>The peace accord: the key provisos</h2> <p><strong>1 Comprehensive rural reform</strong> in a country where unequal land ownership has been the cause of much violence, and of thriving coca-growing due to paramilitary and guerrilla control over tranches of land. The government will support rural communities and promote sustainable economic growth by granting more land accessibility though a special fund. There will be specific development, infrastructure and poverty reduction programmes as well as food and nutritional security initiatives.</p> <p><strong>2 Political participation by Farc, under a new name, in the democratic process. </strong>The condition of Farc laying down weapons and abandoning armed struggle is absolute. Having done so, Farc members will be provided with the possibility of advancing their political agenda through the Colombian democratic system. They will do so under the same rights and obligations as other political parties and movements. The government is committed to provide the necessary security measures to make sure Farc members can exercise their right to participate in politics, after the annihilation of Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica.</p> <p><strong>3 End of the conflict.</strong> Immediately after the final agreement, Farc members will start to establish 23 \u201cTransitory Rural Settlement Normalisation Zones\u201d and eight \u201cTransitory Points of Normalisation \u201d (smaller, for fewer guerrillas). Farc will then have 180 days to surrender all weaponry to the United Nations. At the end of the 180 days, the Normalisation Zones and Points will be disabled; Farc members, once totally and irreversibly disarmed, will start their reintegration process into Colombian society and the political process.</p> <p><strong>4 A solution to the problem of illicit drugs.</strong> A landmark achievement in the wider aim of the Colombian government to rewrite the premises of the war on drugs, solving the crisis at the production end, and turning a spotlight on the responsibilities of consuming countries. Farc commits to cut all links to drug trafficking, support an illicit crop eradication programme, and to provide information and support for mine-clearing efforts that will alleviate humanitarian concerns and make coca eradication more efficient. Pilot programmes involving joint patrols between the army and Farc have already begun.</p> <p><strong>5 Victims and transitional justice.</strong> A framework to satisfy victims of the conflict will balance reintroduction of guerrillas into public life and the punishment of war crimes. Negotiations drew on experience in the wake of crises and conflicts in South Africa, Ireland, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The government and Farc agree to create the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition. All sides will collaborate to tell and document historical truth, search for and identify missing persons, repair individuals and communities affected by conflict and investigate, prosecute and punish the most representative human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict.</p>",
  "<p>Tsai Ing-wen is new to the job and the strain is beginning to show. Elected president of Taiwan in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/taiwan-elects-first-female-president\" title=\"\">a landslide victory</a>, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/taiwans-new-president-tsai-ing-wen-vows-to-reduce-dependence-on-beijing\" title=\"\">took office in May</a>, buoyed by high approval ratings. Yet in a few short months, Tsai\u2019s popularity has plunged by 25%. The reason may be summed up in one word: China. Suspicious that Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive party, which also won control of parliament, harbours a pro-independence agenda, Beijing suspended official and back-channel talks with its \u201crenegade province\u201d and shut down an emergency hotline.</p> <p>More seriously, for many Taiwanese workers, China also curbed the lucrative tourist trade, which brought millions of mainland visitors to the island during the accommodating presidency of Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-tsai-snap-story.html\" title=\"\">Cross-strait investment and business</a> have also been hit.</p> <p>Tsai faces contradictory pressures. The public wants the benefit of closer economic ties with China but Beijing\u2019s intentions are rightly distrusted by a population that increasingly identifies itself as Taiwanese, not Chinese. Given President Xi Jinping\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006\" title=\"\">ominous warnings</a> that reunification cannot be delayed indefinitely, China\u2019s military build-up and hawkish suggestions that Beijing may resort to force, Taiwanese ambivalence is wholly understandable.</p> <p>This dilemma \u2013 how to work constructively with a powerful, assertive China without compromising or surrendering national interests \u2013 grows steadily more acute. It is shared by states across the east and southeast Asian region. From Indonesia and the Philippines to Vietnam, Japan, Seoul, Malaysia and Singapore, the quandary is the same. But the answers proffered by national leaders are different and sometimes sharply at odds.</p> <p>The China dilemma is felt strongly in Washington. The US has striven in recent years to strengthen Asian alliances, increase trade and raise its regional military profile \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s so-called rebalance or <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/03/the-legacy-of-obamas-pivot-to-asia/\" title=\"\">pivot to Asia</a> \u2013 in a bid to contain and channel China\u2019s ambitions peacefully. But analysts say the pivot appears to be in trouble. For Europeans fixated on Syria and immigration, this may not seem especially worrying or relevant. That\u2019s shortsighted. If Obama and future US presidents get China wrong, the resulting damage could be global, threatening the security and prosperity of all.</p> <p>Obama is already badly off-track. His grand plan to promote interdependent economic self-interest across the Pacific Rim while excluding China \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP (similar to the controversial US-Europe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP) \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/trans-pacific-partnership-provisions-questionable-says-productivity-commission\" title=\"\">in deep trouble</a>.</p> <p>Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, declared last week that the TTP was a crucial \u201cpillar\u201d of future US influence. \u201cSuccess or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system and [shape] the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d Abe said.</p> <p>His warning reflected alarm in Tokyo that a risk-averse Obama is again proving an unreliable partner and will fail to get the deal ratified by Congress. It has already been disowned by both his most likely successors, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf/68_0_2063_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington\u2019s painfully obvious inability to curb China\u2019s controversial island-building programme straddling the international shipping lanes of the South China Sea is seen as further evidence that the pivot is failing. Each week seems to bring news of another Chinese airstrip or newly fortified reef. Ignoring neighbouring countries\u2019 rival claims, Chinese has effectively unilaterally annexed 80% of the sea\u2019s area, through which passes $5tn of world trade annually. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by US warships, soon to be backed by Japan\u2019s navy, have had little discernible impact while increasing the risk of direct military confrontation.</p> <p>China has flatly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\" title=\"\">rejected a precedent-setting UN court ruling</a> that deemed its claim to own the Spratly Islands, also claimed by the Philippines, to be illegal. Beijing has taken a similarly intransigent stance in its dispute with Japan over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.</p> <p>Some observers detect ulterior motives. China\u2019s military construction on the Spratlys and \u201cits effort to exhaust and eventually displace Japan in a contest for the Senkakus can be seen as an attempt psychologically and physically to isolate Taiwan and to prepare the battle space for China\u2019s possible use of military force to unify the PRC and Taiwan\u201d, an <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/publications/strategic%20comments/sections/2016-e7c1/turbulence-in-the-taiwan-strait-c26e\" title=\"\">analysis</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies said.</p> <p>Perceived American weakness has led some allies to take matters into their own hands. It <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-taiwan-idUSKCN11R109\" title=\"\">emerged last week</a> that Taiwan\u2019s military is also engaged in island fortification, at Itu Aba, its sole possession in the South China Sea.</p> <p>More dramatically still, the maverick Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-14/duterte-turns-back-us-orders-philippines-buy-weapons-russia-and-china\" title=\"\">switched sides last week</a>, announcing Manila would cease maritime co-operation with the US. China, he said, was the stronger partner. Duterte\u2019s shift reflects his anger at American criticism of human rights abuses rather than a deep strategic rethink. But it will certainly hearten Beijing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This feeble anxiety to play down differences, and evident lack of confidence in US leadership, plays into China\u2019s hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other regional players are more cautious, an attitude encouraged by Beijing\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics. Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, meekly agreed in talks with Xi this month that \u201cmaritime co-operation through friendly negotiations\u201d was the best way forward. But like China, Hanoi is rapidly building military capacity and cementing alliances with India, among others, in anticipation of less amicable times ahead.</p> <p>Similar diplomatic hedging of bets was on display in Laos this month, when an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit deliberately avoided mention of the UN court ruling. This feeble anxiety to play down differences \u2013 and evident lack of confidence in US leadership \u2013 plays into China\u2019s hands.</p> <p>The China dilemma extends far beyond the South China Sea. Having made nuclear disarmament a top priority in 2009, Obama has failed dismally to halt North Korea\u2019s accelerating pursuit of nuclear weapons. The threat was underscored by Pyongyang\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\" title=\"\"> biggest ever test explosion</a> earlier this month. China, the only country with real leverage, has helped impose additional UN sanctions on North Korea. But it has consistently balked at taking game-changing measures, such as cutting off fuel oil supplies, which could force Kim Jong-un to think again. Beijing also says it will block \u201cunilateral\u201d measures by other countries.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s impotence has intensified questions in Japan and elsewhere about the credibility of the American security umbrella, encouraging nationalists who argue that Tokyo should re-arm in earnest \u2013 or even deploy its own nuclear weapons. But their main concern is not North Korea \u2013 it is China.</p> <p>Xi is not looking for a fight. His first-choice agent of change is money, not munitions. According to Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, his preferred path to 21st-century Chinese hegemony is through expanded trade, business and economic partnerships extending from Asia to the Middle East and Africa. China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.clsa.com/special/onebeltoneroad/\" title=\"\">massive Silk Road investments</a> in central and west Asian oil and gas pipelines, high-speed rail and ports, backed by new institutions such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, are part of this strategy, which simultaneously encourages political and economic dependencies. Deng Xiaoping once said to get rich is glorious. Xi might add it is also empowering.</p> <p>Western neoliberals are optimistic. They typically argue that market-based economic exchanges can produce a win-win situation for rival states. In this way, China\u2019s rise may be peacefully accommodated, they say.</p> <p>Xi must also calculate that time is on China\u2019s side. \u201cChina\u2019s economic development and military modernisation programmes have witnessed dramatic progress since the early-1980s,\u201d said Karl Eikenberry in the <a href=\"http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/06/09/chinas-place-in-u-s-foreign-policy/\" title=\"\"><em>American Interest</em></a>. \u201cChina\u2019s aggregate GDP in 1980 was the seventh largest in the world\u2026 By 2014, China\u2019s GDP had multiplied 30 times to more than $9tn and is now the second largest in the world\u2026 The PRC\u2019s military spending, less than $10bn in 1990, grew to more than $129.4bn in 2014, second only to that of the US.\u201d On current trends, China\u2019s 2035 GDP could be a third larger than the US, Eikenberry said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87/0_146_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet for less sanguine analysts, this prospective disparity, this growing lack of balance, plus the expanding number of potential flashpoints in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere, point only one way \u2013 towards future military conflict between the US and China. The Pentagon now officially refers to the Chinese \u201cthreat\u201d.</p> <p>This is the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/\" title=\"\">Thucydides Trap</a>\u201d, a reference to the Athenian historian\u2019s account of the seemingly inevitable conflict between the rising city-state of Athens and the status quo power Sparta in the fifth century BC. Nowadays, the US is the status quo power and China the bumptious usurper.</p> <p>Open conflict is not inescapable, but it is under active discussion. A recent <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/new-report-details-why-war-between-china-america-would-be-17210\" title=\"\">study by the Rand Corporation</a> made a detailed examination of who might \u201cwin\u201d such a military showdown. It concludes that it would probably be catastrophic for both sides. Yet the study also suggests that, if war cannot be avoided, the US might be best advised to strike first, before China gets any stronger and the current US military advantage declines further.</p> <p>The dilemma is clear: amid rising nationalism in both countries, China is not willing to have its ambitions curbed or contained and the US is not ready to accept the world number two spot. These two juggernauts are on a collision course. It\u2019s unclear who or what can prevent a pile-up.</p> <h2>The other players in the conflict between Beijing and Washington</h2> <h2><strong>JAPAN</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Faced by what it perceives to be a growing threat from China, Japan\u2019s government, led by its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has sought greater freedom to project military force beyond the country\u2019s borders. This is controversial, since it involves the \u201creinterpretation\u201d of Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution. Concrete steps include joint naval patrols with the US in the South China Sea and direct help for coastal states such as the Philippines.</strong></p> <h2>VIETNAM <br></h2> <p><strong>The communist one-party regime in Hanoi is an unlikely partner for the US, given still painful memories of the Vietnam war. But Vietnam has been wooed by Obama and George W Bush as part of Washington\u2019s attempts to control and channel China\u2019s regional ambitions. Vietnam has been involved in deadly fishing grounds clashes with China, with whom it fought a war in 1979. It has also sought help elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered a $500m credit line for defence co-operation. But Hanoi is</strong> <strong>also carefully hedging its bets by keeping</strong> <strong>diplomatic lines open to Beijing</strong>.</p> <h2>INDONESIA<br></h2> <p><strong>The world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia has vast human and natural resources and is seen as one of the new 21st-century economic players. Anxious to balance development needs and national pride, President Joko Widodo </strong><a href=\"http://time.com/4379401/indonesia-china-jokowi-natuna-sovereignty-maritime-fishing-dispute/\" title=\"\"><strong>recently visited the Natuna Islands</strong></a><strong> in the southern South China Sea, scene of repeated, minor fishing boat clashes with Chinese vessels. Widodo vowed to defend \u201csovereign territory\u201d against foreign encroachment. But, officially, Indonesia calls itself a \u201cnon-claimant\u201d country and says it is not formally in dispute with Beijing. This suits both countries, at least for now. By sidestepping their differences, they can get on with business.</strong></p> <h2>SOUTH KOREA <br></h2> <p><strong>The Seoul government is more worried about its unpredictable northern neighbour than it is about China. Its defence minister said last week that South Korea has </strong><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/23/asia/south-korea-plan-to-assassinate-kim-jong-un/\" title=\"\"><strong>plans in place to assassinate Kim Jong-un</strong></a><strong> and the North Korean leadership if the nuclear threat becomes critical. Seoul sticks close to the US, which maintains military bases in the country. But abiding South Korean distrust of Japan, Washington\u2019s other key east Asian ally, dating back to the Second World War, has undermined attempts to present a united front to Beijing \u2013 with which Seoul maintains friendly relations.</strong></p> <h2>INDIA<br></h2> <p><strong>Like China, India is rapidly expanding its military capabilities, spending an estimated </strong><a href=\"http://www.defenseworld.net/news/15986/Reliance_Defense_Eyeing_Indian_Defense_Market_Worth__100_Bn__Receives_16_New_Licenses#.V-U8hXqHr7I\" title=\"\"><strong>$100bn on new defence systems</strong></a><strong> since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014. Like China, its ambition is to project itself as a regional superpower looking both east and west. This potentially brings the two countries into conflict. They have long-standing border disputes in the Kashmir/Xinjiang and Arunachal Pradesh areas. In a forerunner to Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia, George W Bush\u2019s administration launched a strategic partnership with Delhi, partly as a counterbalance to China. For its part, Beijing maintains close</strong> <strong>ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s historical foe.</strong></p> <h2>RUSSIA <br></h2> <p><strong>China and Russia are old enemies dating back to the cold war, but these days, they claim to be close friends. A visit to Beijing by President Vladimir Putin in June saw the launching of a number of </strong><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/business/348391-putin-china-visit-rosneft/\" title=\"\"><strong>trade and oil deals worth up to $50bn</strong></a><strong>. China sees Russia as a valuable provider of raw materials but also as a political and military partner in relation to the US. In defiance of Washington, the two countries held large-scale war games in the South China Sea last week, practising taking over islands in disputed waters. Putin also values collaboration as a way of circumventing sanctions imposed by the US and EU after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Simon de Pury, 65, is a Swiss baron, art auctioneer and collector who has been dubbed \u201cthe Mick Jagger of art auctions\u201d because of his dynamic selling style (he is a DJ too). His new memoir, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/auctioneer.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Auctioneer: A Memoir of Great Art, Legendary Collectors and Record-Breaking Auctions</em></a>, ghost-written by William Stadiem, gives us the view from the&#xa0;podium.</p> <p><strong>To what extent is being an auctioneer like being an actor?</strong><br>I compare it to being a DJ \u2013 you cannot prepare, there\u2019s improvisation, you have to be in tune with your audience. If you conduct a jewellery auction, it is unlike a contemporary art or books auction. I\u2019ve seen auctioneers getting rough with audiences. That\u2019s a no-no. You need to be very polite.</p> <p><strong>You say \u201cclothes make the auctioneer\u201d \u2013 almost as if it people were bidding for you?</strong><br>I try to be impeccably dressed. And even though today the dress code matters less, I don\u2019t feel at ease without my double-breasted Caraceni suit.</p> <p><strong>Former Sotheby\u2019s chairman Peter Wilson said: \u201cYou have to covet art to appreciate it.\u201d Is that true?</strong><br>As a young man, I lived in a flat in London without any pictures. In my early 30s, I bought a work by Russian artist <a href=\"http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/erik_bulatov.htm?section_name=breaking_the_ice\" title=\"\">Erik Bulatov</a>. Once you have taken that first step and spent money on art, you get hooked. It is no longer enough to look and appreciate, you feel you must own.</p> <p><strong>What did your hero, the French auctioneer Maurice Rheims, mean when he said, \u201cDistrust objects\u201d?</strong><br>When you look at an object, it might seem seductive. But condition is important. Examine that old master under a blue light\u2026</p> <p><strong>You always eat an apple before a sale \u2013 how did that superstition start?</strong><br>I get incredibly nervous before each auction. The apple thing began in 1993. Sotheby\u2019s was selling some of the contents of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurn_und_Taxis\" title=\"\">Thurn und Taxis</a> family\u2019s castle in Regensburg, Germany \u2013 a six-day sale, the auction room was in their riding hall. All over the castle, they had big bowls of apples and each time I\u2019d go towards the podium, I\u2019d eat one. Six days of incredible success \u2013 the auction a triumph, I was convinced the apples did it.</p> <p><strong>Why do you say that when Elizabeth Taylor bid for a brooch of Prince of Wales feathers set in diamonds it would have taken nerve?</strong><br>It was the first time she\u2019d bought a piece of jewellery for herself instead of being given pieces by her male admirers. Bidding takes nerve. I sometimes bid for clients and try to look cool but inside your heart is beating strongly.</p> <p><strong>What is the most important thing when wooing a client?</strong><br>The key is to gain trust. Most collectors have a deep, personal involvement with their artworks \u2013 as if they were entrusting you with their children.</p> <p><strong>Or selling their children\u2026</strong><br>Definitely not. Three Ds in the art market explain the usual reasons for selling: debt, divorce and death.</p> <p><strong>You write about Russian oligarchs and the \u201cwild east\u201d. Where are the people with most money now?</strong><br>The art market has become truly global. Postwar contemporary art markets were dominated by west European and North American collectors. Now you have the former Soviet republics and eastern bloc countries, the Middle East, some African collectors of importance, Latin America and Asia\u2026</p> <p><strong>Has the internet transformed the life of an auctioneer in a positive way?</strong><br>Information once only accessible to insiders is now accessible to everybody. It has helped the market become easier to navigate. Art sold online will increase a lot over the next few years, especially if you are selling art between $10,000 and $2m \u2013 that segment of the market can be sold more effectively through the internet. At the top end, auctioning will continue in the bricks and mortar way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Leonardo DiCaprio is as charming with electricians and sound engineers as\u00a0with clients</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You describe eBay as the greatest flea market in the world.

  "<p>In a series of rooms in the <a href=\"http://www.flyfacility.gen.cam.ac.uk/Services\" title=\"\">Fly Facility</a> of the Department of Genetics at Cambridge University, around 5m fruit flies are kept in test tubes at any given time. They\u2019re stored at different temperatures to determine varying lengths of life cycle \u2013 at 25C, it\u2019s about 10 days; at cooler temperatures as long as five weeks.</p> <p>Out in the wild, there is no pest quite so sympathetic to human needs as the humble fruit fly. It may have spent the summer feasting on the contents of your fruit bowl, but not until your assembled plums and peaches were starting to rot. But while gastronomic sensitivity is a characteristic to be applauded in a fly, the drosophila, to give it its official title, has more going for it than good table manners.</p> <p>For the past century, it has also performed the vital function of a scientific and medical research tool. Today, it\u2019s often the first stop in research into a wide range of human illnesses, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, spastic paraplegia, cancer and obesity. By comparison with mice and dogs, let alone apes and humans, it\u2019s massively cheap and easy to work with and there is little chance of drawing protest from even the most radical anti-vivisectionist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The males follow the females and put out one wing and vibrate it\u2026 it\u2019s a\u00a0kind of love\u00a0song</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In many respects its position as a vital research tool is a historical accident. Between 1910 and 1915, the pioneering American geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan worked on <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> in his renowned Fly Room at Columbia University and showed that genes provide the basis for chromosomal heredity, for which he won a Nobel prize. It was a critical breakthrough, but there was no particular reason that it had to be made via the fruit fly. Yet ever since then, the tiny drosophila has been at the forefront of genetic research. In the 1920s, another American geneticist, Hermann J Muller, demonstrated that radiation leads to genetic mutation in fruit flies. The reason we\u2019re careful about exposure to x-rays is no small part due to Muller\u2019s work.</p> <p>But some of the mutations that Muller produced, such as flies with legs coming out of their heads, later played into the postwar period of atomic paranoia, informed George Langelaan\u2019s short story The Fly, which was made into a film first in the 50s and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-fly\" title=\"\">remade by David Cronenberg</a> in the 1980s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295d0a549fafa3c69abaae3aacf78a1809d77308\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295d0a549fafa3c69abaae3aacf78a1809d77308/0_0_3504_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Goldblum mid-mutation in David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 The Fly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Goldblum mid-mutation in David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 film The Fly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd /Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the story and the films, a scientist mutates into a fly, an idea that\u2019s disturbing precisely because we see ourselves as being so utterly different from flies, with their strange bodies and massive, honeycombed heads and distinctly creepy habits. This deep-seated anxiety about flies has led to some famous misunderstandings of biology. The most egregious example was in 2008, when Sarah Palin, running for vice-president in the US presidential elections, told an audience that their money was going \u201cto projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good. Things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/27/sarahpalin-genetics-fruit-flies\">Adam Rutherford: Sarah Palin and the fruit fly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite Palin\u2019s clueless misgivings, one of the reasons that flies have become important to much genetic and medical research in relation to humans is that they bear a remarkable genetic similarity to us. The sci-fi fear of a fly\u2019s otherness may well be based, somewhere way down, on its unsettling closeness to us.</p> <p>It was Michael Ashburner, the godfather of fruit fly research at Cambridge, who first established that of the genes that in their mutant form cause diseases in humans \u2013 cystic fibrosis being one example \u2013 around 75% have very similar equivalents in fruit flies. When Ashburner started out in the 1970s, flies were kept in milk bottles in a temporary lab on the outskirts of Cambridge. As a result of his foundational work, which includes his classic book <em>Won For All: How the Drosophila Genome Was Sequenced</em>, Cambridge has become arguably the world\u2019s leading centre of fruit fly research.</p> <p>Its Fly Facility is run by one of Ashburner\u2019s former PhD students, Simon Collier, who showed me around the labs and fly storage of the facility. He\u2019s been working with fruit flies for 25 years and in that time he\u2019s come to know and appreciate many of their hidden \u2013 to most human observers \u2013 characteristics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s pretty straightforward to look at their genome. You just squish them up in a tube and do some simple DNA extraction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you take a tube of flies and leave it here you notice that they have behaviours,\u201d he says. \u201cThe males court the females. They follow the females and put one wing out and it vibrates. There\u2019s a guy in Leicester who\u2019s researched this and what they\u2019re doing is producing a kind of love song.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently, the females are not looking for a long-term relationship and, indeed, they\u2019re likely in their short life span to have multiple partners. The problem with this for geneticists is that they store sperm so paternity is a disputed issue. To counter the confusion of this flagrant promiscuity, geneticists tend to work with virgin females.</p> <p>How can they tell? I ask.</p> <p>\u201cThe look in their eye,\u201d Collier says&#xa0;drily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdcf2ed5591e5cc85b833fed281eee1ccec0fd7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdcf2ed5591e5cc85b833fed281eee1ccec0fd7e/0_0_3770_2872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colourised SEM micrograph of the head of a fruit fly (Drosophila sp.), magnified 70 times\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A colourised SEM micrograph, magnified 70 times. of the head of a fruit fly, showing compound eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hartman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He shows me a magnification of a load of fruit flies that have been knocked out by carbon dioxide. They\u2019re still twitching but essentially stationary. He points out the differences between males (a bit smaller) and females and shows that young flies \u2013 virgins if you like \u2013 are pale and unpigmented.</p> <p>He explains that for research purposes special chromosomes have been developed that enable geneticists to trace exactly what genes have been inherited. With mice, for example, it\u2019s necessary to check gene by gene what\u2019s been inherited, which makes genetic research much more time-consuming and costly.</p> <p>Because the fruit fly\u2019s life cycle is so short and they reproduce so fast (sexually maturity is reached within eight days of hatching), drosophila are ideal subjects for the study of inherited traits, including genetic abnormalities, over many generations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The common ingredient in human and fly behaviour is the gene FOXP, closely linked to cognitive development in humans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, to the layman, even one slightly more versed in the exigencies of scientific research than Sarah Palin, there\u2019s something profoundly counterintuitive about doing genetic research on flies. For one thing, they\u2019re so small. Doesn\u2019t that make it a whole lot trickier?</p> <p>Collier shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward if you want to look at the fruit fly\u2019s genome. You just put them in a tube and squish them up and do some simple DNA extraction. What\u2019s more complex is going the other way \u2013 implanting genetic material into them.\u201d</p> <p>He takes me to a special lab where this procedure is carried out. They take the fly larvae and strip the eggs off their shells by sticking them in bleach. Then with a long and extremely fine needle, the relevant genetic material is injected into the posterior of the eggs where the germline cells are located.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531cf2b8000113b38517a168dc197fbf2a8b6ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531cf2b8000113b38517a168dc197fbf2a8b6ff8/185_325_4133_2192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drosophila melanogaster eye colour variations - white and red (wild type).

It takes about six months to master the minute motor skills necessary to do the job.</p> <p>\u201cUsually half the embryos will survive that procedure,\u201d says Collier. \u201cAnd we can breed from them and study them.\u201d</p> <p>But study what exactly? And to what end?</p> <p>Collier introduces me to two colleagues who are active in fruit fly research, a reader in genetics called Cahir O\u2019Kane and Damian Crowther, a director of neuroscience research and development at the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, who still retains links to the Fly Facility.</p> <p>We go out to lunch and talk fruit flies. I ask Crowther first of all why he left academic research to go into industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe story I tell,\u201d he says, \u201cis friends, and perhaps even enemies, would always introduce me as, \u2018This is Damian, he\u2019s the fly guy\u2019. In my time, I\u2019ve been a registrar in neurology and a research scientist in many areas \u2013 I didn\u2019t think fly guy really summed me up.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Kane echoes the point and both men agree that fly research has not brought them either the professional or social recognition they believe their work warrants.</p> <p>What seems to matter most, in terms of professional appreciation at least, is what is known as \u201ctranslation\u201d, that is, turning the findings of fly research into productive contributions to medical applications for humans. There is little doubt that fly research does contribute, in a wider sense of biological understanding of how all organisms work, but also in specific examples of human disease. However, it\u2019s not easy to make direct links.</p> <p>It\u2019s problematic, for obvious reasons, to go from fly tests to human tests; there usually needs to be a whole range of intervening stages in which other scientists take over and, inevitably, take the spotlight and accreditation.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s a drug that I\u2019ve tested on fruit flies [with an artificially created version of Alzheimer\u2019s disease] that\u2019s benefited the fruit fly that\u2019s then gone on to benefit the human,\u201d says Crowther.</p> <p>But, he explains, Alzheimer\u2019s involves the overproduction of proteins that form plaque in the brain that destroys neurons. \u201cSo you can make models of flies that produce these proteins, get their own plaque and die,\u201d he explains, \u201cand you can then test various ways of preventing the plaque formations.\u201d</p> <p>Fruit flies don\u2019t naturally develop Alzheimer\u2019s, although they have all the genetics of the Alzheimer\u2019s pathway in their brain.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to give them human equivalent genes and push it really hard to get them to have Alzheimer\u2019s in three weeks,\u201d explains Crowther.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b69a5635b3faac5150e25c31912a3ae20c8cf67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b69a5635b3faac5150e25c31912a3ae20c8cf67/0_0_3867_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life cycle stages of the fruit fly, Drosophila sp, showing larva, pupa, adult male (dark abdomen) and adult female\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life cycle stages of the fruit fly, Drosophila sp, showing larva, pupa, adult male (dark abdomen) and adult female.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Reschke/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of thinking of fly research as a direct route to medical breakthroughs, it\u2019s better to see it, Crowther argues, \u201cas a way of doing quick and dirty research\u201d. He believes that because it\u2019s so cheap, it should be used in a multiplicity of ways that might point the direction to more productive lines of research. And where there are drugs that have already been tested on humans and have passed safety requirements but have failed in their efficacy with the targeted complaint, they could be retargeted by first testing them on flies.</p> <p>\u201cThe thinking around really bad diseases like motor neurone disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, is if you can get anything to work in a cell culture replicated in an organism, that\u2019s the beginning \u2013 as long as it\u2019s safe \u2013 of quickly getting it to patients,\u201d says Crowther.</p> <p>O\u2019Kane is particularly suspicious of overblown claims for translation. For him, the beauty of the fruit fly is that it is a organism that rewards study in a larger context.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/20/fruit-fly-african-scientific-research-kampala\">Can the humble fruit fly help create a flourishing African scientific community?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in it because I think it\u2019s a great system for finding out how living things in general can work. I think by understanding the principles of how flies work then you can make better predictions for humans. The better you understand how we work the more rational you can be about trying to design therapies; I think even without directing your work towards therapy, then you can think more intelligently about therapies five or 10 years down the line.\u201d</p> <p>It has been said, not least by Collier, that more is known about the biology of the drosophila than any other animal on Earth. For instance, we know that fruit flies have a kind of built-in compass in their brains that enables a sense of direction. As all animals need to know how they move, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that it\u2019s a form of universal computation.</p> <p>Another study has shown that male fruit flies that are rejected by a female mate are more inclined to drown their sorrows in food spiked with alcohol than male fruit flies that had successfully mated. Again, a brain chemical that regulates the flies\u2019 appetite and is predictive of their thirst for alcohol has an equivalent that has been linked to alcohol consumption in humans.</p> <p>In another study, this time at Oxford, it was found that fruit flies are capable of what might be termed thoughtful deliberation. Rather than making purely impulsive decisions, they take time to react when presented with a difficult choice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obviously we're more sophisticated, because we're studying them, they're not studying us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In other words, once again their behaviour could be described as human-like. It seems that the common ingredient in both human and fly behaviour is a gene called FOXP, which is closely linked to cognitive development in humans. Flies with defective FOXP take longer to arrive at a decision, just as defects in the human type of FOXP have been correlated with low intelligence.</p> <p>It is this long and valuable history of study of the drosophila that should guarantee its continued involvement in genetic research. But much of what has been good about working with flies is now being replicated in human stem cell research, which has the added advantage of being species-relevant. This was the other reason why Crowther moved into the private sector: the competition from stem cells meant that he found it increasingly difficult to get fruit fly-based research funded.</p> <p>\u201cThe fly is yesterday\u2019s guy,\u201d he says, \u201cyesterday\u2019s technology. For me, stem cells are the next fruit fly.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Kane looks quite glum at the prospect and argues that there have been questions over the future of fruit fly research ever since he started his lab 25 years ago. But he maintains that the work he\u2019s done in hereditary spastic paraplegia would have taken 10 times longer to perform with mice. O\u2019Kane has grown to appreciate the rich biological and social development of fruit flies in the time he\u2019s been working with them.</p> <p>\u201cThe more you look at their behaviour,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more sophisticated you realise they are. Even in aggression, how a male fruit fly behaves in a fight will depend on his previous experience of fighting with other males and what the other males\u2019 previous experience of fighting is. It\u2019s amazing to think about all the machinery that\u2019s involved to be able to do that. Obviously we\u2019re more sophisticated, because we\u2019re studying them, they\u2019re not studying us.\u201d</p> <p>For the time being, until some over-ambitious genetics professor does manage to mutate into a fly, that\u2019s the way the relationship should continue. And both humans and fruit flies, it turns out, can drink to that.</p>",

The title refers to the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.\u201d</p> <p>For the new British black film-making hope, Adesunloye, access to funds and exposure remain the key issues, even with a voguish new transatlantic interest in telling the story of the African diaspora.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to do with who funds film and the kind of stories that they want to tell,\u201d he told a journalist at <em>Okayafrica</em>. \u201cFor example, <em>Beasts of No Nation</em> has been getting a lot of wonderful press but there is something problematic about the fact that that one wonderful story, which was written by an African (I haven\u2019t seen it, so I can\u2019t say) isn\u2019t made by Africa \u2013 or rather the director isn\u2019t African. But most importantly, the finance and the funding isn\u2019t African.\u201d</p> <p>Acclaimed for his short film, <em>Beyond Plain Sight</em>, Adesunloye\u2019s new film, <em>White Colour Black</em>, stars Dudley O\u2019Shaughnessy as a young mixed-race British man returning to Senegal to bury his estranged father. Born in Lagos, the director, screenwriter and producer is a graduate of the University of Aberdeen and the London Film Academy. \u201cWill African film-makers tell those kind of films differently? More problematic is why is it always stories about conflict or suffering that seem to get the most attention?</p> <p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s got to come down to funding. Africans have to find a way to fund stories that are about themselves,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s a bright Thursday morning in Oxford, and the <a href=\"http://www.thirstymeeples.co.uk/contact\">Thirsty Meeples</a> cafe on Gloucester Green market is thrumming with activity. As we sit at a sun-warmed window table, the maitre d\u2019, Gareth, introduces himself and presents a list of recommendations.</p> <p>First, he suggests <a href=\"http://boardgaming.com/games/board-games/forbidden-desert\">Forbidden Desert</a>.

Last, he recommends <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue\">Flash Point</a>, in which I, my wife and two sons would rescue people from a burning building. Pull enough of them from the flames and we all win. But if a certain number are lost to the inferno, we lose. We choose Flash Point. </p> <p>As we battle the conflagration, a 30-something couple next to us race against each other to construct railway routes in the Netherlands. Elsewhere, a young woman and two children play foxes raiding a farmyard. A pair of millennials create cartoon sushi meals depicted on playing cards.

Market research group NPD, which claims to measure around 70% of the UK toy trade, has recorded a 20% rise during the past year in the sales of tabletop games (including card and dice games, war games played with miniature figures and role-play titles such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, in which players imagine themselves as heroic warriors and wizards in imaginary, fantasy worlds).</p> <p>Ben Hogg, marketing manager at UK distributor <a href=\"http://www.esdeviumgames.com/\">Esdevium Games</a> (which imports the US-produced railway adventure Ticket to Ride, among many other titles) estimates that growth at closer to 35%.

When he started at Esdevium, Hogg says the gamers they supplied were primarily interested in \u201cgeekier titles\u201d, such as fantasy war game Warhammer.

But specialist retailers were rare, so they put in an offer on a small, semi-constructed shop space. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a floor,\u201d Wooding says. \u201cIt was all just rubble.\u201d They raided skips to decorate the shop\u2019s interior in medieval dungeon style and scattered straw over the unfinished floor.

She chose it as one of four focus games, alongside chess, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose\">Game of the Goose</a> and Monopoly, in her exhibition <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/exhibitions/gameplan/\">Game Plan: Board Games Rediscovered</a>. Howell describes herself as more of a traditional gamer, whose strongest memories of childhood are playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2016/sep/05/braconid-brett-smitheram-2016-world-scrabble-championship-quixoty-felty\">Scrabble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/09/cluedo-dr-orchid-sexy-scientist\">Cluedo</a> with her family. She confesses that, until she began thinking about the exhibition around five years ago, she wasn\u2019t familiar with the new wave of board games that populate the shelves of Orc\u2019s Nest and Thirsty Meeples, part of what she calls a \u201cdesigner-led resurgence\u201d that originated in Germany, then spread across Europe and North America. But she was struck by advances in game design that made the experience of playing these games far less fractious (and more enjoyable) than those family Monopoly sessions. </p> <p>\u201cEurogames\u201d, as they are known, are notable for their relatively gentle themes (farming, landscape-building, dock-working), the fact that they reduce the element of luck and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the way they ensure no player is eliminated before the end. The game zero for this revolution is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan\">The Settlers of Catan (now rebranded Catan)</a>, created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Since its publication in 1995, it\u2019s sold more than 22m copies in 30 languages. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, deeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion. \u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d says Howell, \u201cbecause nobody feels left out. That\u2019s the awful thing if you\u2019re playing Monopoly: the first person to become bankrupt is left in the corner while everyone else plays on.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/28/20-awesome-board-games-you-may-never-have-heard-of\">20 awesome board games you may never have heard of</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That crucial development finds its ultimate refinement in the most recent tabletop trend, the \u201cco-operative game\u201d, whereby every player wins or loses as a team member, whether fighting fires (Flash Point) or saving the world from infection (Pandemic). \u201cIt provokes a lot more social interaction,\u201d says Howell. </p> <p>Pandemic was created by a 43-year-old Californian, Matt Leacock, who is one of tabletop gaming\u2019s most successful designers. He was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2/reiner-knizia\">Reiner Knizia\u2019s 2000 Eurogame title Lord of the Rings</a>, which requires players to cooperate as one of the four questing hobbits from Tolkien\u2019s fantasy epic. \u201cWhen I played that with friends we got scared,\u201d recalls Leacock. \u201cThere was self-sacrifice.

At the time, he recalls, pandemics were \u201cin the news\u201d, with outbreaks of bird flu and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars</a>, \u201cso that was very much in the back of my mind\u201d.</p> <p>Pandemic has been a runaway success, and the latest version, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/25/pandemic-legacy-review-emotional-highs-agonising-lows\">Pandemic Legacy: Season One</a>, represents another leap forward in game design. Co-created with rising board-game star Rob Daviau, it incoprorates, Leacock explains \u201ca tremendous amount of storytelling. It\u2019s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. Irrevocably, in fact. It is an unveiling story. We named it Season One because it has an arc, so it\u2019s akin to watching a season of one of your HBO favourites.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/dont-worry-board-games-video-games-cant-steal-what-makes-you-great\">Don't worry, board games: video games can't steal what makes you great</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The growth of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/uk-video-game-industry-gets-4m-funding-boost\">video games industry</a> has, perhaps counterintuitively, been one of the biggest factors in the proliferation of these modern, innovatively designed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/board-games\">board games</a> \u2013 largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing.</p> <p>\u201c[Video games and board games have] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/22/what-video-games-can-learn-from-board-games\">learned an awful lot from each other</a>,\u201d says Esdevium\u2019s Ben Hogg. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a mobile gamer now.

If we\u2019re to emerge from the goddamn dumpster fire that is 2016 intact, we\u2019re gonna need to see our shared humanity, and I [hope to] show by example that tabletop gaming can be about the journey you go on together when you\u2019re playing a game. It can be about the friendships and relationships that form. So when I hear games are selling out all over the place, that thrills me. It means that people who are not already gamers, or maybe not as insane about it as I am, they\u2019re going out and buying them. It\u2019s like Muggles are buying tickets to Hogwarts.\u201d</p> <p>Back at Thirsty Meeples in Oxford, I talk to owners John and Zuzi Morgan. In 2012 they decided to sell tickets to Wheaton\u2019s Muggles, quitting their jobs as social workers to try and turn their love for tabletop games into a full-time business. </p> <p>They already had an extensive game collection, and John had heard about a cafe in Toronto named Snakes &amp; Lattes \u2013 the menu listed games rather than meals \u2013 that had sparked the spread of board-game cafes across North America. After a visit to sample its appeal, the Morgans opened Thirsty Meeples (a \u201cmeeple\u201d is a game component that represents the player, typically in Eurogames a plump, triangular wooden figure), and it\u2019s certainly paid off. \u201cThe trend is upwards,\u201d John tells me when I ask how business is doing.</p> <p>Why does Zuzi think the love of tabletop games grew to such a point that she and John could turn their hobby into their livelihood? \u201cThere\u2019s so much technology,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s busy and you want to bring people back together in a way that\u2019s not just staring at screens.

Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. In some digital gaming arenas, that anonymity brewed a poisonous atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cMulti-player video-gaming was fun,\u201d says Wil Wheaton. \u201cAnd then dickheads ruined it. It just became this cesspool of toxic aggression and unpleasant behaviour. I wonder if people who had enjoyed all that at first started looking for another way to play games where you could see the person you were playing with.\u201d</p> <p>Direct interaction is important to Matt Leacock, too. \u201cYou connect with people across the table,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very human thing.\u201d And it\u2019s tactile: \u201cYou need to handle the physical components, to get the feel for the texture on the cards and see the wood grain on your components.\u201d</p> <p>Gaming has always had a social function. Fernand Gobet, Professor of Psychological Sciences at the University of Liverpool and co-author of <em>Moves In Mind \u2014 The Psychology Of Board Games</em>, says that in some countries \u201cplaying a board game is part of the culture \u2014 such as mancala games in some African countries \u2014 and can be seen as a soft kind of initiation ritual.

In her fascinating first-hand introduction to the book, Hawk posits Aarons as a pioneer of the \u201cenvironmental portrait\u201d, wherein the setting is as important in its telling details as the subject. \u201cSlim had an almost childlike desire to idealise each mise-en-sc\u00e8ne,\u201d she writes, \u201cto embellish the everyday scenarios he found with his idea \u2013 his fantasy \u2013 of what their world of leisure should look like.

Caption: Laura Hawk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where, though, did Slim Aarons\u2019s devotion to depicting this exaggerated idea of the good life begin? He grew up in rural New Hampshire, where his grandmother gave him his first camera in an attempt to give structure to his unsettled teenage years. He took to photography immediately and, on enlisting in the army just after the outbreak of the second world war, was given the post of military newspaper photographer \u2013 he subsequently covered the invasion of Anzio without proper accreditation and sustained head injuries when a shell hit the press corps headquarters. Decorated for bravery, he returned a hero and began working as a stringer for various local papers before landing a job as Rome correspondent for <em>Life</em> magazine when they opened a bureau in the city. \u201cHe emerged from the second world war both disillusioned and determined and I really believe his motivations came from there,\u201d says Hawk, \u201cHe never set out to be a photographer of the rich and famous, but it just so happened that he landed a job for an upscale magazine and gravitated to that world. He was essentially a magazine photographer: he worked for the same magazine using the same formula for three decades.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f37c849913436c954b10c7b5f2f5d72e6d2cf480\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f37c849913436c954b10c7b5f2f5d72e6d2cf480/0_0_2700_2732/988.jpg\" alt=\"The championship swimmer and movie star Esther Williams poolside in Florida, circa 1955\" width=\"988\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The championship swimmer and movie star Esther Williams poolside in Florida, circa 1955.

Slim was an arch conservative and not shy about expounding his views. He loved to hold court and tell stories. He had charisma and he could turn on the charm, but he was also difficult and demanding. I had to do whatever was asked, including being a bouncer on outdoor shoots when the inevitable curious tourist would come up to ask what we were doing. He hated that, absolutely hated it.

  "<p>I\u2019m looking at two photographs of the main street of the small town in which I was born. Both are taken from the same vantage point \u2013 looking up the hill to the T-junction at the top. The two photographs are separated by nearly a century: the first was taken in the 1930s, the second sometime in the last few years.</p> <p>Topographically, the street remains largely unchanged: it\u2019s a straight road with two- or three-storey shops and houses on either side. But the two photographs show completely different streets. The 1930s one shows a spacious thoroughfare, with people walking on the pavements on both sides of the street: here and there, two or three individuals stand in the road, possibly engaged in conversation. The contemporary photograph shows a narrow, congested gorge. The pavements are crowded with pedestrians, but there are no people on the road. In fact, in some&#xa0;places, one cannot even see its&#xa0;surface.</p> <p>Why the difference between the two&#xa0;photographs? You know the answer: cars, vans and traffic. Both sides of the contemporary street have got lines of parked vehicles, effectively reducing the width of the road by 12ft. And there\u2019s a traffic jam, which means that even the vehicles that aren\u2019t&#xa0;parked are stationary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What most people want is affordable mobility without having to purchase, tax, insure and fuel a four-wheeled millstone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This picture is repeated in millions of towns and cities worldwide. A visiting Martian anthropologist would conclude that humans worshipped the automobile. Actually, you don\u2019t have to be a Martian to marvel at it. Just open your front door. \u201cNext time you walk outside,\u201d writes John Zimmer in his essay <a href=\"https://medium.com/@johnzimmer/the-third-transportation-revolution-27860f05fa91#.bxurjbcbr\" title=\"\">The Third Transportation Revolution</a>, \u201cpay really close attention to the space around you. Look at how much land is devoted to cars \u2013 and nothing else. How much space parked cars take up lining both sides of the street and how much of our cities goes unused covered by parking lots. It becomes obvious \u2013 we\u2019ve built our communities entirely around cars. And&#xa0;for the most part, we\u2019ve built them&#xa0;for cars that aren\u2019t even moving. The average vehicle is used only 4% of&#xa0;the time and parked the other 96%.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Zimmer has a dog in this fight \u2013 he\u2019s co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/\" title=\"\">Lyft</a>, a ride-sharing outfit that competes with Uber, so the usual caveats apply. Nevertheless, his essay is a thoughtful reflection on how the automobile transformed \u2013 and destroyed \u2013 our cities and towns. He invites us to imagine \u201cwhat our world could look like if we found a way to take most of these cars off the road. It would be a world with less traffic and less pollution. A world where we need less parking \u2013 where streets can be narrowed and sidewalks widened. It\u2019s a world where we can construct new housing and small businesses on parking lots across the country \u2013 or turn them into green spaces and parks. That\u2019s a world built around people, not cars.\u201d</p> <p>Zimmer thinks that fleets of self-driving cars will be commonplace in the relatively near future and that their availability will give us most of the advantages of private car ownership without the financial and environmental drawbacks. Although some people will always want the status and other satisfactions of owning a car, what most people want is affordable <em>mobility</em> without having to purchase, tax, insure, park and fuel a four-wheeled millstone. In the well-planned cities of continental Europe, that kind of mobility is provided by efficient and affordable public transport. But in more benighted places (like most British towns and cities), autonomous vehicles are an obvious alternative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/us-government-regulators-self-driving-car-proposal\">Self-driving car design needs to involve regulators more, US government argues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For readers of the <em>Daily Mail</em> this will seem crazy.

  "<p>Speculation is rife in Brussels that the European commission is strapping on its boxing gloves in preparation for another battle over corporate tax avoidance.</p> <p>In the red corner is Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry, which has spent the last year under investigation for allegedly setting up sweetheart deals for <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6221_en.htm\" title=\"\">allowed McDonald\u2019s to receive \u20ac1bn from its European operations tax-free</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-taxavoidance-ireland-idUSKCN1180WR\" title=\"\">Ireland is preparing to defend its treatment of Apple</a> after being pummelled by a commission report that accused the US mobile phone maker of avoiding \u20ac13bn in corporate taxes.

She has landed a few punches as part of a Brussels mission to stop corporate taxes going into the dustbin of history.</p> <p>If her officials have pieced together a watertight case against McDonald\u2019s, it will send a strong message to the legions of US companies based in Ireland or the Grand Duchy that tax is not optional. McDonald\u2019s, it should be said, denies any wrongdoing, while Luxembourg said the fast food group had not received preferential treatment.</p> <p>Without a crackdown on the biggest avoiders, the current system of taxing corporations risks becoming a bad joke.</p> <p>Only last week, the rich nations\u2019 thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/corporation-tax-downward-trend-oecd-gdp-growth\" title=\"\">eight of the top industrialised nations had cut corporation tax rates</a> last year or said cuts were imminent.

In a bid to shore up their depleted exchequers, the OECD suggested cuts in corporation tax were being partially offset by rises in other taxes such as VAT, fuel and car tax.</p> <p>But as tax justice and inequality campaigners have shown, higher taxes on personal incomes and essential items hits poorer individuals hardest.</p> <p>The Tax Justice Network summed up the problem when it said this remedy for lost corporate taxes \u201credistributes wealth upwards\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cGovernments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax \u2018competition\u2019 boosts inequality and deprivation.\u201d</p> <p>Strangely, the US government is one of the few to stand out against the trend and maintain its high corporation tax rate. <a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/tax-rates-online/corporate-tax-rates-table.html\" title=\"\">At 35% for major corporations and 40% once local taxes are taken into account</a>, its main rate is double the UK\u2019s 20%.

The lower-for-longer interest rate environment is not helpful for a bank that has racked up losses of more than \u00a350bn since its bailout and is on course for at least two more years in the mire.</p> <p>Osborne had signalled his determination to return the bank to private hands by taking a \u00a31bn loss on the first sell-down of the government\u2019s stake last summer. Those shares were sold at 300p \u2013 below the 502p break-even point for taxpayers, but way above the 180p to which they have now sunk.</p> <p>For now, at least, McEwan can tell Hammond that he is not to blame for problems he faces: the footdragging of the US authorities over a fine \u2013 which could amount to \u00a39bn \u2013 for the way it sold mortgage bonds before the crisis, and the delays at UK regulators over an investigation into the way it treated, or mistreated, small business customers.</p> <p>McEwan will also argue that the delay selling the 300 branches that the EU demanded as a penalty for its bailout cannot be helped. The post-referendum rate cut ended all hope that Williams &amp; Glyn could be reborn as a standalone bank.</p> <p>The New Zealander made sure his strategy got the approval of Osborne.

In 1978 he screened films about Indigenous Australia at the Cannes film festival and the next year he established the Aboriginal Information Centre in London. </p> <p>Significantly, Foley senior was at the centre of a controversy in 2004 involving the seizure by the Dja Dja Wurrung people of central Victoria of bark artefacts that were on loan from the British Museum to the Melbourne Museum (now Museum Victoria) where he was then working. He supported the seizure of the bark artefacts under the federal Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/feb/14/it-taunts-us-spiritually-the-fight-for-indigenous-relics-spirited-off-to-the-uk\">Dja Dja Wurrung elder and fellow activist, Gary Murray</a>. </p> <p>After a protracted court case, the barks were returned to the British Museum. Several of the barks \u2013 together with the Gweagal shield \u2013 came back to Australia briefly for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/10/battle-for-bark-art-indigenous-leaders-hail-breakthrough-in-talks-with-british-museum\">National Museum of Australia exhibition, Encounters</a>. </p> <p>Murray and Foley have been in discussions with the British Museum over their insistence the barks return permanently to the Dja Dja Wurring. They have dealt extensively with Gaye Sculthorpe, an Indigenous Tasmanian who has, since 2013, been curator of the museum\u2019s Oceania and Australia collection.</p> <p>Kelly and the Gweagal are now corresponding with and talking to Sculthorpe regarding their claim on the shield.</p> <p>It was on 28 March, during the final hour of the Encounters exhibition, that Rodney Kelly made a statement of claim on behalf of the Gweagal for the return of the shield and the spears.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a matter of fact the shield held in the collection of the British Museum and currently on display at the National Museum of Australia ... was in fact stolen from our ancestor, the warrior Cooman of the tribe Gweagal upon first encounter with James Cook and the crew of the Endeavour in 1770 at Kamay Bay which is the original name for land now known as Botany Bay,\u201d Kelly said in a statement of claim, which he <a href=\"http://www.begadistrictnews.com.au/story/3916943/shielded-from-the-truth/\">read at the museum to the applause of some museum staff</a>. </p> <p>\u201cIt is our will and the will of the clan that all Gweagal artefacts are kept on Gweagal Country and do not leave the shores of Australia under any circumstances whatsoever without express permission from the elders of the Gweagal Tribe.

As Gaye mentioned, the Museum often lends objects around the world and is open to the possibility of lending the shield to Australia again.</p> <p>\u201cAll decisions regarding the loan of objects for the collections are made by our trustees taking into account normal considerations of security, environment and so on.
