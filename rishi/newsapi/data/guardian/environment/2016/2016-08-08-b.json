  "<p>As one of the world\u2019s largest consumers of diesel per capita, Australia could soon benefit from the onshore production of a cleaner-burning alternative.</p> <p>Dimethyl ether (DME) is a colourless gas used as an aerosol propellant for things such as hairspray, but engine manufacturers and other companies have been exploring its potential as an alternative transport fuel. </p> <p>This is because DME is compatible with compression ignition engines, requiring only minor modifications. It mirrors the performance of diesel and, under the right conditions, has a much cleaner emissions profile, producing virtually no particulate matter or soot.</p> <p>Michael van Baarle, the managing director of Australian DME Fuels, which was established in 2015, says: \u201cAny replacement of diesel oil by DME, particularly in heavy-duty vehicles, will result in a significant improvement in air quality.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/04/mining-town-coober-pedy-shows-the-rest-of-australiahow-to-turn-to-renewables\">Mining town Coober Pedy shows the rest of Australia how to turn to renewables</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Brisbane-based company has plans to build Australia\u2019s first commercial-scale production plant by 2020, generating a diesel-replacement fuel for use in trucks, heavy machinery, and remote off-grid power stations. The DME can also be blended with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for use in passenger vehicles. </p> <p>\u201cIf you make the methanol feedstock for DME renewably, then you essentially have an almost zero-emission fuel from a greenhouse gas perspective,\u201d says van Baarle.</p> <p>There are other upsides: DME has similar storage and handling properties to LPG. This means it can be stored safely in gas bottles and distributed using existing LPG infrastructure. It also has a longer shelf-life than diesel, and poses no environmental contamination risks from spillage.</p> <p>Van Baarle hopes the onshore production of DME will help Australia end its reliance on diesel, particularly for transportation and off-grid power generation.</p> <p>In 2014/2015, Australia used more than 23.5bn litres of diesel, or just shy of 1,000 litres per person, according to <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=alltypes&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=2014&amp;eyid=2013&amp;unit=TBPD\" rel=\"nofollow\">information</a> from the US Energy Information Administration. </p> <p>This places Australia among the world\u2019s largest consumers of diesel per capita, he says.</p> <p>While compression ignition engines are efficient, burnt diesel produces greenhouse gases, noxious emissions, and particulate matter. These hazardous pollutants reduce air quality and can trigger respiratory problems.</p> <p>Even with sophisticated emissions control systems, many diesel engines are still emitting noxious pollutants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions \" rel=\"nofollow\">above legal limits</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/18/ban-diesel-cars-in-london-thinktank-urges\">some cities</a> are considering banning diesel vehicles altogether.</p> <p>Australian DME Fuels wants to produce DME from renewably generated methanol, which is considerably more expensive than using fossil fuel feedstocks.</p> <p>This means they need access to waste CO2 from industrial processes, and an ability to make hydrogen from the electrolysis of water \u2013 a power-intensive process that would require them to purchase wind or solar energy. </p> <p>This specific process for generating methanol has been demonstrated on a relatively small scale. A facility in Iceland has generated about 4,000 tonnes a year, says van Baarle. </p> <p>Australian DME Fuels plans to produce 12 times that amount. \u201cWe believe that the next scale-up of this technology to commercial quantities of 50,000 tonnes per annum can be achieved in Australia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This translates to about 48.5m litres of DME, which is roughly equivalent to 26m litres of diesel from an energy output standpoint.</p> <p>With on-site hydrogen production capabilities, he estimates the plant will cost between $200m and $300m to build. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/22/cheap-and-clean-australian-company-creates-hydrogen-with-near-zero-emissions\">Cheap and clean: Australian company creates hydrogen with near-zero emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The company is exploring funding strategies, including support from bodiessuch as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.</p> <p>Van Baarle says the company is also developing a \u201cnetwork of strategic partners\u201d including engine manufacturers, LPG distributors, methanol producers, and renewable power generators.</p> <p>\u201cWe have some of those people already in place,\u201d he says. </p> <p> But cost is still a red flag. Renewable DME could be upwards of three times more expensive per gigajoule than diesel (currently $15/gigajoule), or DME produced with non-renewable methanol ($17/gigajoule). </p> <p>Van Baarle says his company could offset that cost by selling bulk, renewably produced methanol. He\u2019s also hopeful that downward trends in the cost of solar power will make it more affordable.</p> <p>One of the key challenges to establishing a domestic market for DME is co-ordinating the deployment of modified compression ignition, or diesel engines.<br></p> <p>Jim Patel is a research scientist at the CSIRO who has been leading an Australia-India Strategic Research Fund project investigating the small scale production of DME. \u201cDME is often referred to as a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere is little incentive to develop applications for DME when it isn\u2019t widely available and while there are no applications, there is little incentive to supply,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Patel says the main challenge for producing renewable DME from CO2 will be the economics of buying renewable power to make hydrogen and sourcing enough CO2 feedstock. </p> <p>He suggests it might be more affordable to initially produce a proportion of DME from renewable sources and gradually increase this. </p> <p>Patel says there are positive signs DME could be gaining traction internationally. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=143286\" rel=\"nofollow\">Volvo</a> has begun developing DME-powered engines for heavy trucks in North America and its subsidiary, Mack, is running a <a href=\"http://www.vehicleservicepros.com/article/12235287/mack-trucks-dsny-exploring-the-viability-of-dme\" rel=\"nofollow\">demonstration</a> with municipal sanitation trucks in New York City. </p> <p>Last year <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2015/09/11/ford-leads-project-to-develop-near-zero-particulate-emission-die.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Motor Company</a> began working with the German government to develop and test the world\u2019s first production passenger car to run on DME. </p> <p>\u201cDue to its potential for reduced particulate emissions, DME should be amongst the alternative fuels under consideration for use in Australia,\u201d says Patel. </p>",
  "<p>Warm weather and heavy discounts have helped drive a rebound in retail sales, potentially tempering fears of the UK economy grinding to a halt following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), published on Tuesday, showed that the value of online and high street sales rose at the fastest pace for six months in the four weeks to 30 July. The statistics chime with other signs that shoppers shrugged off the EU referendum result and continued spending in the weeks that followed. </p> <p>But economists have warned against reading too much into early indicators, while the Bank of England has predicted that growth will slow sharply over coming months, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">cutting interest rates to a record low</a>.</p> <p>July sales were up by 1.1% on a year earlier in like-for-like terms, according to the BRC\u2019s monthly sales monitor, compiled with consultants KPMG. This marked a recovery from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/consumer-spending-slows-recession-eu-referendum-retail-sales-bad-weather\">0.5% fall witnessed in June</a> and was the strongest performance since January. In total terms, not adjusting for the effect of new store openings, sales rose by 1.9% in July, also the strongest growth since January.</p> <p>The figures support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uk-consumers-keep-spending-despite-brexit-vote-shock\">consumer spending data from Visa</a> and Barclaycard, which suggested that shopping, day trips and nights out were little affected in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU. However, they contrast with a survey from the CBI showing that <a href=\"http://news.cbi.org.uk/news/high-street-sales-see-summer-fall/\">retail sales volumes declined in July</a> and a poll from market researchers GfK, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\">found that consumer confidence had tumbled</a>. Surveys of businesses are also gloomier, signalling a decrease in activity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/03/uk-services-sector-contraction-adds-to-recession-fears-pmi\">across services, manufacturing and construction</a> since the referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>The BRC said the Brexit vote would pose a challenge for retailers in the months ahead, but for now, shoppers appeared to be taking a \u201clife goes on\u201d approach.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis month\u2019s solid sales figures may come as a shock to some, given the slew of early indicators suggesting that consumer activity was slowing in the wake of the referendum result,\u201d said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, little has materially changed for most UK households [since] 23 June, so it is not surprising to us that sales are simply responding to their normal underlying drivers.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting the pattern of low inflation throughout 2016, the BRC said retailers were continuing to rely on promotions to keep people shopping. Intense price competition has made it hard for retailers to grow their takings and the BRC\u2019s measure of sales growth on a 12-month average basis held at 1.2% in July, the weakest since May 2009, when the UK was mired in recession.</p> <p>Dickinson said the big question for retailers was whether the stronger performance in July could be carried forward into full price sales. </p> <p>A mini heatwave last month helped raise food and drink sales for barbecues and picnics, and also lifted fashion sales, the BRC said. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-08T14:34:42/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Value of pound against dollar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-08T14:34:42/embed.html\">Value of pound against dollar</a> </figure>  <p>There was also evidence of a boost to retailers and tourism from the weaker pound, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">fallen sharply since the referendum</a>. Holidays, as a result, are more expensive for Britons going abroad, but coming to the UK is cheaper for foreign tourists.</p> <p>The BRC report noted a pickup in sales of jewellery and watches as some tourists were drawn to the UK for shopping splurges.</p> <p>Separate figures suggested that flight bookings to the UK jumped after the referendum, driven by demand from customers in the US and Asia Pacific. In the 28 days before the vote, flight reservations had been down 2.8% year on year. However, in the month after the referendum, they were up by 4.3%, according to travel research company ForwardKeys.</p> <p>Spending was also helped last month by people finding money to go out with friends and family, despite feeling more nervous about the economic outlook, according to figures from Barclaycard.</p> <p>It reported that consumer spending grew by 2.6% in July on a year earlier, but this was down from growth of 3.6% in May and June.<br></p> <p>Spending in pubs was up by 12.2%, restaurants enjoyed a 12.8% rise and cinema spending increased by 10.1%, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/03/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-jennifer-saunders-joanna-lumley\">Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie</a> and Ghostbusters helped draw in customers, following a lull in June.</p> <p>Barclaycard also polled 1,680 people to gauge consumer confidence, of whom 63% said they had carried on spending as they did before the Brexit vote. But half of those polled said they were not confident in their ability to spend more on nonessential items, the highest proportion since February. </p> <p>Paul Lockstone, the managing director of corporate affairs at Barclaycard, said: \u201cThese are the first full month\u2019s figures since the EU referendum, so it\u2019s too early to say if this is the start of a long-term trend, but it seems likely consumers will be watching the external environment carefully ahead of any major spending decisions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the clock ticked down, ever so slowly, on Brazil\u2019s first gold medal of the Olympics, the crowd in the tiny Carioca Arena 2 seemed about to explode. Rafaela Silva, the country\u2019s beloved judo star, stood poised to win the 57kg women\u2019s final against Mongolia\u2019s Dorjsurengiin Sumiya, ahead 10-0 and yet time kept stopping for officials calls. Everybody in the stands stood, many waved Brazilian flags. They sang, They chanted. Nearly three days was a long time to wait for a gold when the Olympics is on your soil.</p> <p>Finally the clock started to run down again: three \u2026 two \u2026 one. Then came the gong ending the match and a great roar filled the arena. Fans jumped up and down, Brazil flags flapped and for a moment, Silva did not seem to know what to do. Should she jump? Should she run around? Should she cry? Eventually she did the traditional bow to her vanquished opponent and ran into the embrace of her coach before bursting into tears.</p> <p>\u201cRaaa-faaeee-lllllllla,\u201d sang the crowd as the fans surged to the railings of the two-tiered stadium to get a better look. Olympic volunteers tasked with the job of keeping the aisles clear seemed helpless to stop the fans. In many cases the volunteers stood and watched themselves.</p> <p>Silva is from Rio\u2019s famous Cidade de Deus (City of God), a long neglected Rio favela. As a black woman from such a disadvantaged community, her victory was a powerfully symbolic moment for the country.

Heatwaves cause problems too: by drying up puddles and ponds, and reducing the water levels in larger lakes and reservoirs. This can cause algal blooms, making it tricky for waterbirds such as ducks, geese and swans to find food. Many birds \u2013 both large and small \u2013 feed their young on insects; and prolonged drought can mean those insects themselves are struggling to reproduce.</p> <p>Even if they can find enough food, adult and baby birds can suffer from hot weather. Unlike mammals such as us, birds do not possess sweat glands, and thick plumage can lead to overheating. During those endless summer days, it was a common sight to see birds sheltering in little patches of shade, and panting to lose heat.</p> <p></p>",

About <a href=\"http://www.worldbackupday.com/en/\">3 in 10 people never back up</a> their data, while others do it sporadically.

  "<p>The aftermath of the Brexit referendum has taken me back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiplarkin\">Philip Larkin, DH Lawrence, Thomas Hardy</a> and the culture of the so-called leave regions of England. Well before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community\">European Economic Community</a> came into existence in 1957, Larkin was espousing the virtues of \u201cleaving\u201d and of separateness. His extraordinary and strikingly small body of verse must now be seen as a significant, undeniable and vivid component in the cultural history of the leave camp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/07/north-poor-brexit-myths\">Think the north and the poor caused Brexit? Think again | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems like Larkin had long been preparing his English readership for Brexit. He found his characteristic voice \u2013 urbane, colloquial, morose, lyrical, dismissive of lyricism, at once essentially rooted and maladjusted \u2013 by his second book, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Less_Deceived\">The Less Deceived</a>. What was evident too by then was how much the poetry owed to his particular vision of an England that was non-metropolitan but not necessarily \u201cnatural\u201d (unlike the wild terrain his contemporary Ted Hughes was invested in); an England that was suburban and dull, the remnants of which, two months ago, voted largely to exit Europe.</p> <p>Larkin was not known as a propagator of happiness. Nor did he seem to believe that the English were equipped to be happy. When asked by an interviewer for the Observer whether he thought \u201cpeople go around feeling they haven\u2019t got out of life what life has to offer\u2019, he replied, \u2018I should think quite a lot of people do\u2019, adding, of his own predilections, \u201cdeprivation is for me what daffodils were to Wordsworth\u201d. At the beginning of the interview, he\u2019d clarified: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to write about being happy. Very easy to write about being miserable.\u201d</p> <p>In lieu of happiness, he desired a sense of being settled immovably in the familiar, which for him meant being situated \u201con the way to nowhere\u201d \u2013 the very zone from which many of the leavers have now spoken. This, for him, was Hull (where, as it happens, <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-vote-to-leave-eu-is-cry-of-rage/story-29439178-detail/story.html\">more than 75,000</a> people voted to leave: nearly twice the number of those who wanted to remain), through which Larkin expressed his acute need to keep the world at bay: \u201cI like it because it\u2019s so far away from everywhere else.\u201d \u201cWould you like to visit, say, China?\u201d an interviewer from the Paris Review this time asked him. Larkin said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind seeing China if I could come back the same day. I hate being abroad.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/may/31/eu-referendum-brexit-for-non-brits-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4jqfb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2519111\"            data-video-name=\"EU referendum: Brexit for non-Brits \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574c6127e4b062390d4eec1b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/30/160530Brexit4nonbrits2_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/may/31/eu-referendum-brexit-for-non-brits-video-explainer\">EU referendum: Brexit for non-Brits</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Larkin may have thrilled to life\u2019s deprivations, but it was the England that came up between the fall of empire and the advent of Margaret Thatcher (whom he admired) and the discovery of North Sea oil that quickened him strangely. No one else could have been nostalgic for the dullness of housing estates in quite the same way as he was.</p> <p>For him, the peripheral constituencies far from London were a perpetual discovery. In an early poem, Coming, he notes how \u201cA thrush sings, / Laurel-surrounded / In the deep bare garden, / Its fresh-peeled voice / Astonishing the brickwork\u201d. The thrush and the \u201cdeep bare garden\u201d come to Larkin from his mentor Thomas Hardy, but the contemporaneity of \u201castonishing the brickwork\u201d is Larkin\u2019s, and embodies an England at once secret and in danger of vanishing the moment it\u2019s appeared.</p> <p>This is the Britain of manufacturing, whose days were numbered, and which, in <a href=\"http://www.allinfo.org.uk/levelup/dockery.htm\">Dockery and Son</a>, the narrator glimpses from a train window after returning from a visit to his old college: \u201cI fell asleep, waking at the fumes / And furnace-glares of Sheffield\u201d. At the college, \u201cthe Dean\u201d has reminded him that his classmate Dockery is dead, and revealed that he had a son who\u2019s now at the same college. Like Larkin, the narrator is single, and reflects, in the train, that \u201cTo have no son, no wife, / No house or land still seemed quite natural\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-second-referendum-brexit\">Jeremy Corbyn rules out second referendum on Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A key theme is being broached here, related to Larkin\u2019s own stubborn bachelorhood: that to be English is not to be happy, necessarily \u2013 the opposite might be true \u2013 but it is at least to be alone and undisturbed. Indeed, this could well be the \u201cnatural\u201d condition of being English. Although Larkin wrote tenderly of English wedding rituals (\u201c<a href=\"http://we-english.co.uk/blog/2009/05/31/philip-larkin-the-whitsun-weddings/\">A dozen marriages got under way</a>\u201d), marriage and its outcome \u2013 children \u2013 perplex the narrator: \u201chow / Convinced he [Dockery] was he should be added to!/ Why did he think adding meant increase?/ To me it was dilution\u201d.</p> <p>This is fundamental both to the romance of Brexit and to the hysteria over immigration: the belief that separateness is England\u2019s, and thus Britain\u2019s, destiny, and that \u201cadding\u201d entails dilution of a culture rather than a form of increase. Multiculturalism itself is a complex marriage of societies with long-term consequences, and it\u2019s a kind of marriage that the Larkinesque bachelor would always have been resistant to.</p> <p>Post-referendum wisdom has reiterated that the leave campaign was unexpectedly successful because of all the people who live in towns \u201con the way to nowhere\u201d: their vote was a rebuttal of the London elite. But is it true that this elite comprises the only British people (besides the Scots) who feel European, that the underprivileged or marginal are necessarily inward-looking and provincial and seized by a Larkinesque disdain of \u201cabroad\u201d?</p> <p>That would be to underestimate the sense of entitlement in upper middle-class nostalgia for a particular England and a particular Europe, and to ignore the robust engagement with European \u2013 and world \u2013 culture in the history of the English working class. It would be to forget Lawrence, with his transformative vision of the Etruscan tombs in Italy and the rural marketplace in Mexico. Lawrence was a man whose radical cosmopolitanism could never have been formed in Eton and Oxford but only in Nottingham (a city which voted for Brexit by only a slender margin).</p> <p>It\u2019s also to forget the Beatles, who emerged from Liverpool but served their apprenticeship in Hamburg. John Lennon, born to working-class parents who had separated, was a brilliant curator of local English culture in songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LCclVtFR6o\">Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite</a>, in a way that makes him a precursor to present-day curators of peripheral English communities like the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeremy-deller\">Jeremy Deller</a>. But Lennon\u2019s ironical perspective on Englishness in such songs came surely not from closing ranks but from his constant access and openness to other cultures. It\u2019s an openness that prompted him to instruct George Martin to play a faux-Bach piano interlude in In My Life, and led to his important intellectual partnership with Yoko Ono</p> <p>Then there\u2019s David Hockney, born in Bradford to, in his own words, a \u201cradical working-class family\u201d, and plunged in childhood into the European masters.</p> <p>Modern Britain\u2019s cultural relationship with Europe would be attenuated without the working-class suburbs of industrial towns. If it has forgotten this fact in the last 30 years and handed proprietorship of that relationship to a tiny set in London, it must ask itself why.</p>",
  "<p>The theme of Lord Kinnock\u2019s lecture to the PLP, Owen Smith\u2019s argument in the Labour leadership hustings in Cardiff on Thursday (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/04/labour-leadership-debate-jeremy-corbyn-and-owen-smith-in-cardiff-live\">Report</a>, 5 August), and Jonathan Freedland\u2019s article on Saturday (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/corbyn-cant-dismiss-mps-brexit-centre-stage\">Corbyn can\u2019t dismiss the importance of MPs</a>, 6 August) is the primacy of elections in \u201cwinning power\u201d.</p> <p>Forgive me, I am a teacher. I now read that the government wants to reintroduce grammar schools. We already know that it wants to cut funding for schools in cities, with consultation on exactly how much due next term. The thousands of parents and teachers who will be outraged by these decisions do not have the luxury of waiting for the possible election of a Labour government in 2020. We have to resist now. Support from Labour, in parliament and out, will help us win and help Labour win in 2020. With the current leadership we can be sure of that support.<br><strong>Paul Atkin</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the run-up to the 1993 local elections the ruling Conservative group in \u201cselective\u201d Lincolnshire hoped to curry favour in what was then all \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Lincoln by turning the one secondary school it controlled into a grammar. The reaction from the remaining grant-maintained schools was to enter candidates in all Lincoln county division elections under the slogan \u201cSay NO to secondary moderns\u201d. The result was that most seats in Greater Lincoln turned Labour or Lib Dem and, for the first and only time since the council was formed in 1974, the Tories were consigned to the opposition benches.</p> <p>If you introduce grammar schools you convert all the rest into secondary moderns, which is, in effect, what you have today in the rest of the county, where selection at 11-plus still occurs. The last thing that secondary education in England needs, imperfect as it undoubtedly is, is a return to a system that was manifestly wrong 60 years ago and is equally wrong today.<br><strong>John Marriott</strong><br><em>Lincoln</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Smith is wrong to say that the move towards grammar schools is a \u201csign of the weakness of Labour as an opposition\u201d in that the Tories \u201cthink they can get away with it\u201d. What it actually signifies is that Theresa May\u2019s talk about reducing inequality is yet more Tory rhetoric; her determination to display compassionate Conservatism is simply political posturing.</p> <p>To return state education to the days of selection, when it means that up to 80% of 11-year-olds, mostly from poor backgrounds, are denied access to an education designed to suit the needs of a privileged few, is doing the exact opposite of creating \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d. May might well believe in the grammar school mythology, but there are thousands of us, who experienced first-hand the divisiveness of the system and its appalling unfairness and inefficiency, willing to testify otherwise. It\u2019s a myth that needs debunking once and for all.<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 As our current education system is already geared towards those who are going to pass exams, instead of more grammar schools we need more technical education, not just for the non-academic but for all children if we are to catch up with our major competitors in a global economy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/technical-education-has-always-been-a-poor-relation\">Letters</a>, 8 August).</p> <p>Comprehensives were originally intended to provide this but the resources were never really put in, just as we had a dearth of technical schools under the 11-plus system.<br><strong>Margaret Phelps</strong><br><em>Penarth, Glamorgan</em></p> <p>\u2022 Is it too simplistic to suggest that the majority of grammar school places should go to those children who have attended local state primary schools? In my limited experience of the system, all too often children have been \u201chothoused\u201d in the private sector and many of them are not local to the area. To grant significantly more places to able children from the local state system would, in one step, be a pointer in the right direction to social mobility.<br><strong>Elisabeth Smith</strong><br><em>Cheltenham</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the heyday of grammar schools only 2% of pupils from a skilled manual background and 1% from an unskilled background went to university. <a href=\"http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/robbins1963.html\">The Robbins report</a> of 1964 stated that although 26% of children were from unskilled backgrounds, just 0.3% of those got two or more A-levels at grammar schools.</p> <p>In 2015 only 2.6% of grammar pupils were entitled to free school meals, compared with 14.9% in all schools; 40% of their pupils came from the least deprived quartile against 25% in all schools, and 8% were from the most deprived quartile compared with 20% in all schools. 91% of grammar pupils had achieved above Level 4 at the end of primary school, compared with 33% in comprehensive schools.</p> <p>Selection led to social segregation being so unpopular by the 1960s that both major political parties were happy to abolish it. Middle-class parents who believed grammar schools were theirs were incensed that their children were not selected. Theresa May hides her belief that middle-class parents have a right to grammar schools by claiming that they promote social mobility, and includes a few places for the disadvantaged to give the illusion that she is making education work for the many and not just the few.<br><strong>John Gaskin</strong><br><em>Drifield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The first time I ever remember being under real pressure was in my last year of primary school. I must have been 10. At assembly my headmaster told us we were to face the most important day of our lives: the 11-plus, an exam that would effectively mean the smartest kids in the school would go onto receive an incredibly good and free education. Failure was not an option.</p> <p>I went on to pass that exam and got accepted into Rochester Grammar School for Girls \u2013 now one of the top performing state schools in the country. My older brother, who failed the exam, went on to attend one of the worst schools in the region. I sailed through school by having access to some quite brilliant teachers. It was world-class education which saw me accepted into the University of Birmingham to study economics. My brother left school at 16 with handful of exams and the offer of a job at the local council.</p> <p>The Conservatives would argue this is as it should be. But what about the kids like my brother who failed the exam? Despite his terrible education, my brother worked his way up through the local authority, passed his accountancy exams and went onto study an MBA.</p> <p>But he\u2019s probably about five years behind where other university-educated peers are in their careers because he ended up at a terrible school which didn\u2019t offer the classics or spot his potential.</p> <p>A grammar school system is fundamentally unfair. A great education should be available for British every child, not just one who happens to pass an exam when they are 10 years old.<br><strong>Julia Timms</strong><br><em>Senior media advisor, The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

No more driver led operations.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said that the months of disruption preceding the strike were because a \u201cbasket case\u201d company was unable to run a functioning train service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat is not related to the dispute.

It\u2019s also important that each employee knows who they should report to if they do experience disruption, she adds.</p> <p>There\u2019s not much employers who are left out of pocket by industrial action can do to recoup the costs, says Limbin-Glassey: instead, their focus should be on making arrangements so that there\u2019s as little disruption to the business as possible. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a89dcce4b0f5d06484180b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T15:01:33.383Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The TUC leader has tweeted her support for the industrial action:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/762637076835799040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Southern?src=hash\">#Southern</a> is an utter mess.

I have personally experienced week after week of cancellations and delays for getting on for eight months now.</p> <p>The strikes are being used as a smoke screen for a poorly managed company that seems to be in bed with the DfT. Management seem to forget or wilfully ignore that their passengers are human beings having to deal with their utter incompetence.</p> <p>I fully support the strike action that the RMT are taking, despite the impact to my day to day life. I have seriously considered moving away from the area so that I don\u2019t have to deal with this on a daily basis, and my journey in is only supposed to take twenty minutes a day.</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u201cIt\u2019s not the RMT\u2019s place to say what is safe and what isn\u2019t\u201d</h2> <p>Richard travels between Crawley and London, and his usual 40 minute journey took one hour and fifty minutes. He has mixed feelings about the service, but doesn\u2019t believe that Southern Rail should be immediately removed. Instead he saves his anger for the RMT:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nightmare etting into work today, however the strike service that southern rail are running is able to get people to work, albeit a bit late. Well done Southern Rail.</p> <p>I will leave work early today, as during the last strike action I was left stranded in London.</p> <p>People need to stop calling on Southern Rail to be removed. They are trying to modernise their service, the RMT seem to want to keep things exactly as they are, they are not interested in innovation or the enhancement of services through technology. They are the ones causing a nightmare for commuters. Why don\u2019t we let Southern go ahead with their plans and if the service is still poor, then look at removing them.</p> <p>It is not the RMT\u2019s place to say what they think is safe and what isn\u2019t. We have rail regulators for that. Southern Rail have been given permission to make these staff contract changes, and should be allowed to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T14:08:38.808Z\">at 3.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a88c6ae4b03b51a99e1135\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alice-ross\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T13:51:12.999Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It appears that Labour and the Lib Dems are lining up behind the RMT in their responses to the Southern rail strike, according to comments obtained from the parties by my colleague <strong>Alice Ross</strong>. </p> <p>Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week Govia Thameslink Railway GTR rejected the RMT\u2019s offer to settle a dispute over conductors\u2019 roles on the same basis that a similar dispute was settled earlier in the week at ScotRail.

Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and promised investment looks further away than ever, yet Chris Grayling and his officials seem more interested in pursuing an ideological dust-up with rail unions than improving abysmal passenger services.</p> <p>We have a train operating company unable to make their trains run on time and a Government prioritising a battle with trade unions over fixing a failing franchise, and it is the tens of thousands of passengers having to endure miserable services who are paying the price.</p> </blockquote> <p>The comments mentioned by McDonald appear to be from a <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/\">Private Eye</a> story quoting a senior Department for Transport official, Peter Wilkinson. That story, like much of Private Eye\u2019s content, doesn\u2019t appear to be online, but <a href=\"https://insidecroydon.com/2016/06/15/southern-failways-civil-servant-wants-to-break-rail-unions/\">the Inside Croydon blog has written about it</a>. Wilkinson, who is the DfT\u2019s managing director of passenger services, is quoted as saying of the strike: \u201cI\u2019m furious about it and it has got to change \u2013 we have got to break them.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jenny Randerson, Liberal Democrat Transport spokesperson, has said accused the government of turning a blind eye to customers\u2019 ordeals. She said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation with Southern is a total mess. People are being left completely stranded. Some even lost jobs before the strikes because of the poor service, whilst home life is being ruined.</p> <p>As a member of the Cabinet, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has constituents being directly affected in Hastings and can only criticise the unions; the Government has to take control of this situation.

This didn\u2019t seem to tally with the number that I\u2019d seen scrolling by as I scanned the hashtag, so I asked Visibrain why they had registered so few. Georgina Parsons, head of UK communications at Visibrain, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We obtained this statistic by filtering on all tweets containing the words \u201csolidarity\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d, \u201csupporting\u201d, \u201cstand with\u201d, or \u201cbehind\u201d.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Southern say they have reduced trains in an amended timetable to 80% service, on my line the number of trains in commuting periods was reduced by 50%. When they say the strike will cut 40% of services, on my line 100% of trains are cancelled.</p> <p>My local MP took weeks to respond to me on the issue, ignored several follow up emails, and declines to meet me in Westminster where I work. I\u2019d like to see the Tory MPs whose constituents are affected by this issue acting together to cut through the intransigence, and to address the background fact that the DfT is driving the dispute.</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u201cPeople were stood on the toilets just to have space to stand\u201d</h2> <p>A commuter from Lewes, who asked to remain anonymous, reports months of delays and cancellations. He is worried about the impact this is having on his job: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to get into the office today for some important meetings, and having started my job relatively recently not wanting to have the strike disrupt the progress I\u2019ve made. For all employers can be sympathetic there is a responsibility for employees to ensure they can get to work too. In my 14 weeks in this job this is the third extended strike, which on top of the regular cancellations and delays could easily be giving people the impression I\u2019m unreliable.</p> <p>The only way for me to get to work on time was to catch a bus at my own expense to Brighton, and catch an over-crowded train from there, changing twice. What is normally a journey of an hour taking me twice as long. Already I\u2019ve had to cancel a meeting later this week because changes to the bus service mean I can\u2019t get to Brighton at a time where I can get a train getting me to London before 8.30. Relying on public transport has become impossible.</p> <p>This is all on top of months of delays, cancellations and short formed trains. One day last week we had a 12 coach train reduced to 4 coaches. People were stood on the toilets with others crammed into the cubicle around them just to have space to stand. This is without the air conditioning working properly too.

David Leam \u2013 infrastructure director at London First, a lobby group for the capital\u2019s businesses \u2013 has used <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/08/the-rmts-southern-rail-strike-is-ludicrous-shameless-and-wrong/\">an article in the Telegraph</a> to describe the conductors\u2019 withdrawal of their labour as \u201cludicrous, shameless and wrong\u201d. He writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying issue here is the prevalence of outdated working practices, which contribute to the high-cost culture of Britain\u2019s railways. While Britain\u2019s railways have been tremendously successful in attracting new passengers they have been much less so at improving their efficiency. Government studies have identified a 40% efficiency gap when comparing our railway against other European countries, requiring passengers and taxpayers to pick up the bill.</p> <p>Reviewing the various assurances and commitments made to the workforce by the train operator and government dispels any notion that the employer is being too hot-headed. Rather it raises the question whether government is, in fact, being too timid. Is it really sustainable to go so far in addressing the concerns of a party that appears dead set against a reasonable negotiated outcome?</p> <p>Workers in all walks of life need to adapt and change as new technologies emerge. Modern trains no more need a guard to close doors than they need a fireman to shovel coal or be preceded by a man with a red flag to alert fearful passersby. The RMT should stop pretending that the railway is somehow different and put an end to this damaging and ludicrous dispute. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T12:42:26.463Z\">at 1.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a87140e4b033cb0795e09b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T11:50:16.348Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A scan of the most popular Southern rail strike-related hashtags shows plenty of tweets backing the RMT\u2019s industrial action, or at least condemning Southern Rail for the service it provides to travellers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/garrie_coleman/status/762611958638120960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cheeky git Govia Thameslink CEO says only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RMT?src=hash\">#RMT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernstrike?src=hash\">#southernstrike</a> making trains unsafe this week when they&#39;re  already overcrowded &amp; stressful</p>&mdash; Garrie Coleman (@garrie_coleman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garrie_coleman/status/762611958638120960\">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sophiabotha74/status/762554291370557440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernrail?src=hash\">#southernrail</a> are a frigging disgrace &amp; thus I fully support <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RMTunion\">@RMTunion</a> in strike action <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernstrike?src=hash\">#southernstrike</a></p>&mdash; Sophia C Botha (@sophiabotha74) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiabotha74/status/762554291370557440\">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReadieQB9/status/762604460816338945\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Happy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SouthernRailUK\">@SouthernRailUK</a> is finally being exposed for all of it&#39;s absolutely tragic.

Wake up early and see that it is not running. Go back to bed for a bit wake up to feed baby and then head for the 07:11 from Redhill to Victoria. Wait for 07:11 with friend from Earlswood as there are no trains from this station all week.</p> <p>07:11 is absolutely packed, have one free hand to write. A couple travelling in together are split as one gets on but the other can\u2019t fit on. Thirty-eight minutes is going to feel a very, very long time before I get off. Worse than a normal strike day (been three so far) as people can\u2019t work from home as five days of it. A lot more busy than usual. Rumours that last train home is 18:35 so best check throughout the day.<br></p> <p><strong>Kate Hayes, 55, from Nutfield</strong></p> <p>As the Tonbridge line is shut completely during the strike this week, I rely on my husband to get me to Redhill. </p> <p>0648 from Redhill to Victoria disappeared off the app overnight so husband got an extra 30 mins in bed. Drove me to Redhill where I caught the 0720 (pretty well on time), busy but not overly crowded. No seat though - but am lucky enough to get one at East Croydon.</p> <p>0752: I am being held at Clapham Junction - stuck behind a train in front which has an \u201c\u2019issue\u201d. People getting off if they can use Waterloo or \u201cif they are in a hurry\u201d! The train in front is apparently broken down, so now all of us are told to get off - and now stay on...!

  "<p>See, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it? With a jolt of Lancastrian common sense, Sir Philip Craven (by name but not by nature) cut through all the bluster and obfuscation, and showed up the International Olympic Committee\u2019s stance over for what it was.</p> <p>As the IOC pathetically twisted in the wind last week in response to Professor Richard McLaren\u2019s devastating report into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/18/wada-report-russia-sochi-winter-olympics\">state sponsored doping</a> in Russia and his damning conclusions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/richard-mclaren-ioc-wada-russia-rio-2016-\">delivered on the basis of hard evidence</a>, the president of the International Paralympic Committee was doing what his Olympic counterpart, Thomas Bach, should have been.</p> <p>Namely, speaking to McLaren to see if he had any further evidence and calmly considering the situation away from the rhetoric, grandstanding and political posturing before coming to a logical, reasoned conclusion.</p> <p>\u201cTragically, this situation is not about athletes cheating a system but about a state-run system that is cheating the athletes,\u201d said Craven. \u201cThe doping culture that is polluting Russian sport stems from the Russian government and has now been uncovered in not one but two independent reports commissioned by the Wada.\u201d</p> <p>Craven is, of course, right to apportion blame where it is due \u2013 with the Russian state. Yet the IOC instead attacked the World Anti-Doping Agency, which is not blameless but at least commissioned McLaren\u2019s report. The IOC did not even bother to contact McLaren before coming to its decision \u2013 a muddled, muddied, confusing mess that has ended with 278 Russian athletes in Rio and its track and field team sitting at home nursing a grievance after being singled out for the tougher treatment that should have been applied to the whole team.</p> <p>As feared, the presence of Russian athletes in Rio is now being played out as pantomime \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/us-swimmer-lilly-king-wags-finger-yuliya-efimova\">Yuliya Efimova getting booed in the pool</a>, American athletes and journalists casting themselves as being on the side of the light even as <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/06/coach-banned-for-doping-goes-on-defensive-facebook-rant/\">Trevor Graham\u2019s Facebook rant</a> reminded us that the west is far from immune to highly organised doping scandals.</p> <p>I spent some time at Russia House over the weekend, where the national flag flies defiantly from the fort at the end of Copacabana. A stage has been set up to welcome medallists and fans can pick up supporter\u2019s packs containing Russian flags and peruse memorabilia donated by famous Russian athletes. Most countries do something similar to try to wring maximum benefit from the modern arms race in elite sport. Team GB have taken over a grand old building in the shadow of Christ the Redeemer to host a series of events and parties. But the Russian presence in Fort Copacabana, surrounded by huge hoardings featuring their medal hopes and next to a cannon facing out to sea, like an act of defiance.</p> <p>The IOC keeps saying that it is wrong to punish an entire nation for the actions of individuals. But what about when it bans a country\u2019s athletes for so-called \u201cpolitical interference\u201d by government? That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/27/ioc-kuwait-ban-olympic-government-interference\">has happened to Kuwait</a> and India, to name but two, in recent years. You didn\u2019t hear so much about the rights of individual athletes then. More obviously, South Africa under apartheid was banned for years from the Olympics \u2013 a move that sacrificed the rights of individual athletes for a stand that was rightly considered more important.</p> <p>It is said that Bach\u2019s lily-livered reluctance to push for a ban stems not only from his own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/25/rio-olympics-russia-drugs-vladimir-putin-ioc\">close relationship with Vladimir Putin</a> \u2013 those pictures of them clinking champagne glasses like newlyweds or whooping it up with other authoritarian leaders at opening ceremonies in Sochi and Baku threaten to define him \u2013 but from his own experiences as an athlete.</p> <p>He won a fencing gold medal in Munich in 1976 but couldn\u2019t defend his title due to the West German boycott of Moscow four years later. Maybe that\u2019s a factor. But, more likely, he is simply so compromised by a lifetime negotiating the compromises and quid pro quos of the \u201cOlympic family\u201d to reach the top job that his only way out was the mess he delivered.</p> <p>An IOC spokesman again did his best to defend the indefensible on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s very important not to go for a blanket ban. It was important for everyone to have chance to prove their innocence and not ban everyone. It was hard to do that within 12 days.\u201d</p> <p>Right. Which is why the IOC spent the whole of last week attacking the messenger and overseeing a box-ticking exercise that let every athlete proposed by a federation compete. We could be discussing the ways in which those federations are themselves compromised way past the closing ceremony but recent allegations aimed at swimming should give a clue.</p> <p>The IOC claims the IPC decision is somehow different, that it is more akin to an international federation in terms of its charter and constitution. Without sinking into legalistic argument, the suggestion is patently ridiculous \u2013 both are bodies overseeing major international sporting events.</p> <p>But this should not be about patting the IPC on the back or stoking the flames of some sort of pseudo Cold War played out through sport. It is enough to say the Paralympic movement has taken the obvious decision the IOC should have taken for the good of sport. Now attention should move to how to reconstitute entirely and fund the global anti-doping effort and the rotten sporting governance structures that oversee it.</p>",

Catching five birds to put satellite tags on them was a heroic endeavour because these notoriously shy animals are crepuscular feeders, running across fields at dusk, huge eyes angled downwards in search of beetles to eat. But Hawkes managed it, and his satellite data is revealing. It shows that birds travel farther from their nest sites than previously realised, and in the Brecks one location is particularly attractive: pig farms.</p> <p>The rise in outdoor pig farming in this area helps the birds find plenty of beetles in pig muck. It\u2019s obvious that most conservation in a heavily farmed country depends on farmers.

Farmers are compensated if they sacrifice a hectare of arable field for a stone curlew nest plot. But the RSPB says it is struggling to persuade more farmers to create such spaces because it is not clear whether they will be funded after Brexit. Farmers need to plan ahead, which is why the government must establish how it will support post-Brexit farming sooner rather than later.</p> <h2><strong>Not so dirty rat</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e138f4cb1c0bff2ef42ae705768be615df13cfa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e138f4cb1c0bff2ef42ae705768be615df13cfa2/0_174_5320_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atlantic puffin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pest control to protect puffins is putting the endangered black rat at risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plummeting numbers of a grass-devouring pest, the rabbit, are also causing problems for the stone curlew in Breckland because the bird\u2019s traditional heathland habitat is becoming too overgrown.

The question is whether there are other benefits, such as the relationship with the French and Chinese and the industrial development you get from that, as well as economic benefits to the south-west.\u201d</p> <p>Critics of Hinkley have argued that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-bad-business-theresa-may-david-cameron\">not good value for money</a> because the government is offering EDF \u2013 which is 85%-owned by the French state \u2013 a price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour to provide up to 7% of the UK\u2019s energy needs.</p> <p>Atherton said: \u201cThe political will in the UK may have diminished now that George Osborne isn\u2019t involved. The issue is whether the whole thing is being called into question.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver Salvesen, equity analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said there was still enough support for Hinkley within EDF for the project to go ahead, assuming the UK government chooses to support it.</p> <p>\u201cIt is surprising that the company can\u2019t marry these two factions together. It\u2019s a function of the fact that EDF has been very financially stressed because of poor market conditions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe unions are very powerful and they\u2019ll want to know that the company isn\u2019t taking on unnecessary risk with an investment that could impact the French business and of course, the workforce. But this is a long-term project that they want to be involved with and will give very decent returns.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government is conducting a review of the Hinkley Pointcontract, but it has not made public its scope of the review. </p> <p>May is thought to have been keen to examine more closely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future\">role of Chinese companies</a> in the project amid concerns about the impact on national security and despite her predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/oct/21/david-cameron-confirms-hinkley-nuclear-power-station-deal-china-video\">David Cameron\u2019s strong support for Hinkley</a>.</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>Give the grown-ups back control of the Labour party. Wasn\u2019t that supposed to be the idea?

When this failed, they sought to exclude him from the leadership ballot, in a disingenuous attempt to circumvent rules that were perfectly clear on his right to stand. When this was unsuccessful, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/labour-leadership-courts-millionaire-donor\" title=\"\">millionaire party donor</a> tried to challenge the decision in the high court, which also failed. Today, in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\" title=\"\">second legal defeat</a>, a high court judge has struck down an attempt by the party\u2019s national executive to stop 130,000 of Labour\u2019s newest members, thought to be mostly Corbyn supporters, from voting in the coming leadership election.</p> <p>Meanwhile, apparently having no plan for what to do if Corbyn simply pointed to his mandate and refused to resign, MPs dithered for over a fortnight before producing an alternative party leader. They then found themselves with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36828082\" title=\"\">two rival \u201cunity candidates\u201d</a> \u2013 Angela Eagle and Owen Smith \u2013 before Eagle dropped out just eight days after a cringe-inducing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbpPaFZmQic\" title=\"\">car crash of a campaign launch</a>. We are now into the seventh week of a spectacle which, altogether, has not exactly been a showcase of managerial competence from the self-styled party \u201cmoderates\u201d.</p> <p>Nor have the last few weeks been a great advert for the Labour establishment\u2019s election-winning skills. A basic principle of electability, whether the battleground is the party selectorate or the national electorate, is that one should avoid antagonising the very people whose votes you need to win. Yet the party executive now plans to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/762616778912571392\" title=\"\">waste members\u2019 money</a> appealing against today\u2019s court decision, in the hope of disenfranchising tens of thousands of those same members. This will hardly endear the membership to MPs and party bosses who owe their lucrative careers to the donations and voluntary labour of the party rank-and-file. And it will clearly rebound to damaging effect on the party establishment\u2019s candidate, Smith.</p> <p>The mantra of Corbyn\u2019s opponents is that the party needs to provide effective opposition to the government, yet here again their incompetence is glaring. The Brexit vote, especially its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29a7964c-3953-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7\" title=\"\">calamitous economic effects</a>, provided a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do lasting damage to the Conservative brand, and raise the chances of a future Labour victory under whichever leadership. The immediate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/brexit-crash-pound-living-standards-george-soros\" title=\"\">crash in the value of the pound</a> and the longer-term damage to the British economy is arguably worse than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\">1992\u2019s Black Wednesday</a>, and should have been hung around the necks of the Tories from the moment the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/24/global-markets-ftse-pound-uk-leave-eu-brexit-live-updates\" title=\"\">markets tumbled after the result came in</a>.</p> <p>Voters should be reminded constantly that the pound in their pocket is now worth considerably less thanks to ministers who either campaigned for a leave vote, failed to plan for it, or both. Conservative responsibility for every ounce of economic pain to be felt in the coming years must be seared into the public consciousness. This one-off opportunity has been squandered so far, simply because the geniuses of New Labour didn\u2019t have the strategic sense to sequence their moves, and wait for the next opportunity to depose Corbyn.</p> <p>Of course, Labour\u2019s civil war is rooted not in questions of competence but in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/labour-battle-blairites-corbynistas-conservatives-progressives\" title=\"\">fundamental political differences</a> between the two opposite wings of the party \u2013 differences which are probably irreconcilable. Corbyn is the clear odds-on favourite to win, not because his leadership operation is a shining example of professionalism, but because \u2013 for now at least \u2013 he is the only available champion for the basic political principles shared by most party members.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s pitch, of Corbynite policies plus effective leadership, was a smart one in this context, but it is likely to fail for two reasons. First, no one seriously believes that Smith came into politics to overturn the neoliberal consensus. Second, it is clear that a Smith victory would return the party to the ownership of its previous managerial class. The shenanigans in the courts this week are a symbol of why, for most Labour members, a return to the status quo ante is now simply unthinkable.</p>",

O\u2019Rourke described him as a \u201ctoddler\u201d but Rovere, who is writing a book on Trump, said his approach to nuclear weapons was \u201centirely mainstream and entirely consistent\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/pj-orourke-says-blame-the-elites-for-trump-and-brexit-and-vote-for-clinton\">PJ O'Rourke says blame the elites for Trump and Brexit \u2013 and vote for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe says he hates nuclear weapons.

That\u2019s exactly the same as most presidents.\u201d</p> <p>Carr said Trump\u2019s suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/06/should-more-countries-have-nuclear-weapons-donald-trump-thinks-so/\">it would not be a bad thing if Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia had nuclear weapons</a> was \u201cvery worrying\u201d.</p> <p>This was \u201cunravelling\u201d the security arrangements in the Asia Pacific which Australia was part of through the Australia, New Zealand, and US (Anzus) treaty, a collective security agreement in place since 1951.</p> <p>\u201cWe would be in the peculiar position of watching a President Trump unravel arrangements that have been considered vital to avoiding nuclear exchanges in the region in which we live and \u2026 it would really challenge us,\u201d said Carr.</p> <p>Carr noted the potential fallout should the US go through with ideas raised by Trump, suggesting it would threaten the strength of the treaty, but did not say Australia should walk back from it if Trump wins.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m suggesting first of all, the alliance works both ways, it is a running argument,\u201d said Carr.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we would be obliged to seek every opportunity to tell the Americans that inaugurating a trade war with China by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/17/china-finance-minister-trump-trade-proposal-irrational\">putting a 45% tax on American imports</a> from China would be disastrous, and telling them, as I believe, as a respected ally of the United States, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/donald-trump-north-korea-war-nuclear-weapons\">withdrawing nuclear protection from Japan and South Korea</a> would compel those countries to acquire their own nuclear weapons.

Maybe because I spent so much of my time looking at other regions of the world where this is very easy to open up, and democracy is a fragile thing, open society is a fragile thing \u2026 no international security person in the United States has come out in favour of him. They\u2019re saying he is a threat.\u201d</p> <p>It followed her earlier comments that Trump lacked an articulated position on anything, which she said made him a dangerous presidential candidate.</p> <p>\u201cWin or lose he\u2019s already set us back on the international and security front,\u201d said Khalil.</p> <p>O\u2019Rourke warned that perhaps Trump was not the real threat, but that his candidacy seemed to spark \u201can impulse to like a demagogue.\u201d</p> <p>Carr agreed Trump could be \u201cthe harbinger of something to come. It may not be this Trump, but it could be the Trump in four years time, as America becomes a society shaped by global forces that Washington can\u2019t control.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to a question about rising popular discontent with the Australian, US and UK establishments and support for Brexit, Trump, and newly reelected senator Pauline Hanson, Carr said there was a \u201cself-correcting process\u201d and Trump as president would result in \u201can enormous rethinking\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe sense of betrayal will be very rapid. How does somebody implement the promises that he has made? I think we\u2019ve seen a self-correcting process in the rise of the Green party in Australia. Its support hasn\u2019t continued to rise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look at Clive Palmer, who was seen as a bit of a demagogue, I guess. The public looked at him, the public was entertained for a period and then the public dropped him. There is no alternative here but to trust in the good sense of the voters.\u201d</p> <p>Tirado said Australians were looking at their version of the rise of the Tea party, and it would be problematic when Turnbull has to negotiate with the One Nation senators over important issues like the economy and royal commissions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we don\u2019t have the choices of pushing it one way or the other, that leads to a lot more people feeling disenfranchised\u201d.</p> <p>Khalil said the political elite had \u201cignored the losers of globalisation\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe see it here in Australia with Pauline Hanson. But you have a prime minister here who talks about innovation and how wonderful it is to be an Australian. But for many Australians, innovation is scary and no one is addressing these concerns of voters. There is a crisis with the middle class in the States \u2013 there\u2019s opiate addictions, high mortality rates and no-one outside of it are addressing those concerns. They have a voice in Trump \u2013 a narcissistic, crazy one, but they have a voice in Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hinkley Point C, the multibillion pound nuclear deal, years in the making, is on the cusp of unravelling. At the last minute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">the government has hit the pause button</a> in order to take a hard look at what Hinkley is offering in return for \u00a337bn of energy consumers\u2019 money.</p> <p>The voices of opposition are growing. Even newspapers which have supported the nuclear industry are raising doubts. <br></p> <p>Its supporters chant the same mantra: there is no alternative, Britain needs Hinkley to keep the lights on. That was the warning from the then business secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/edf.britishenergygroup\">John Hutton, in 2008</a> yet the lights are still on and Lord Hutton is now the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association.</p> <p>But the world - and the electricity landscape - has changed radically since 2008.</p> <p>Then, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf\">just 5.5%</a> of the UK\u2019s electricity came from renewables. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/24/renewable-energy-outstrips-coal-for-first-time-in-uk-electricity-mix\">It\u2019s now 25%</a>.

The cost for wind and solar is coming down too. <br></p> <p>The way we increasingly get our energy is changing. The former chief executive of the National Grid, Steve Holliday, said that the idea that we need nuclear power stations to provide baseload electricity <a href=\"http://www.energypost.eu/interview-steve-holliday-ceo-national-grid-idea-large-power-stations-baseload-power-outdated/\">is \u201coutdated\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>Baseload is the trump card of Hinkley\u2019s supporters: how do we keep the lights on when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing? But the National Grid predicts<a href=\"http://www.powerresponsive.com/viewpoints/internet-of-things-meeting-the-uk-s-grid-balancing-needs/\"> that in some scenarios by 2020, small-scale </a>and distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. The future is more local and in our control. It will also provide more jobs and greater energy security at increasingly lower cost.</p> <p>Intermittent supply is already being tackled with interconnectors - basically, huge cables connecting the UK with European countries like Norway to manage variations in supply coming from renewables. They could be hugely expanded. But renewables and interconnectors are only part of the answer.</p> <p>Electricity demand is not constant. At peak times, there can be up to <a href=\"http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/09/21/4-ways-the-uk-can-get-almost-all-its-power-from-renewables/\">50% more demand</a> compared to the average \u2013 typically when people get home from work in the early evening and prepare their evening meal, especially in winter.</p> <p>This demand needs to be met with power generation which can be switched on, sometimes at very short notice. Hydropower does this \u2013 with reservoirs in places like Scotland, Wales and Sweden being filled up at a time of low demand, so water can be released through turbines when demand is high.</p> <p>Existing gas-fired plants can also be fired up at short notice, but this comes with a carbon cost. The point is to use it only when back up is required and only until alternatives become mainstream.</p> <p>The real leap forward will come with improved storage. </p> <p>You can also look at energy demand another way.<br></p> <p>Rather than building lots of extra capacity to meet intermittent peaks, could those peaks be lower by shutting down demand where and when it\u2019s not needed?</p> <p>Google and Tesla are already experimenting with smart energy \u2013 managing how gadgets are switched on and off. </p> <p>Energy systems and the thinking behind them are changing fast. What happened in just a few years with telephones - where we moved from centralised exchanges and fixed landlines to mobile phones - is about to happen with energy systems. Hinkley is a roadblock in this transition.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the Cinderella of them all - energy efficiency. The less we use, the easier the problem is to solve. If all street lights were switched to LED bulbs we could take half a GW of demand off the grid with ease.</p> <p>If all homes did the same, we\u2019d save 2.7GW of power at peak use - that\u2019s nearly the equivalent of Hinkley by just changing the lightbulbs. </p> <p>The UK has come a long way since 2008 \u2013 the year parliament passed the Climate Change Act, which committed the UK to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. We are already halfway there with emissions down 40%.</p> <p>A low-carbon future is essential. So is energy security and affordable energy. If we are to deliver on all three, there is a huge investment opportunity across renewable energy, interconnectors, energy storage, smart grids and energy efficiency. We mustn\u2019t squander that money and opportunity on Hinkley Point C.</p> <p>\u2022 We would like to publish your ideas about how to power Britain.

Perhaps it was the unapologetic manner in which she asserted her sexual autonomy, or her <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/1127984/qandeel-baloch-met-mufti-qavi-guideline-not-learn-islam/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mockery of Pakistan\u2019s clergy</a>.

For me, as a man, the sense of culpability was overpowering. Qandeel\u2019s murder was engendered by a deeply unequal patriarchal order participated in by Pakistani men across class, religion and ethnicity, in wilful ignorance of the unending physical, emotional and ideological violence it inflicts on women every day. </p> <p>From birth, we men find ourselves afforded advantages in all spheres of life, from the prioritisation of our education, to unregulated access to public space, to lopsided inheritance rights, to a culturally sanctioned lifelong freedom from the responsibility of household work. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Honour' is the currency of a patriarchal order, structured to sustain men\u2019s preeminence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Few men acknowledge or renounce these privileges, and the consequence is huge gender disparities in all walks of life.

In our national discourse, \u201chonour\u201d killings are labelled as a cultural aberration committed in backward rural communities. </p> <p>But honour crimes are not simply a consequence of religious dogma. Honour is the currency of a patriarchal order, structured by society and state to sustain men\u2019s preeminence while ensuring that hierarchical clan, caste and class identities are maintained at the expense of women\u2019s autonomy and selfhood. It was the intersection of Qandeel\u2019s gender with her working class and ethnic minority background (the identity she was accused by her brother of betraying) that made her transgressions particularly dangerous.</p> <p>A patriarchal system legitimises itself by hiding the reality of its systemic injustices.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theredshed.org.uk/\">The Red Shed</a> is Wakefield\u2019s Labour club. Mark Thomas has been going there since he was a student at nearby Bretton Hall. It\u2019s an unassuming wooden building across the road from the imposing Tory club. The latter has long since closed down. This year the Red Shed celebrates its 50th anniversary and is thriving. Inside, there are banners and badges that recall the struggles it has supported, the victories and defeats it has seen. This show is Thomas\u2019s love letter to the Shed and to half a century of Labour activism, embracing the legacies of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/guardianwitness-blog/2015/mar/05/miners-strike-30-years-on-i-fought-not-just-for-my-pit-but-for-the-community\">miners\u2019 strike</a> and the dangers of mis-remembering \u2013 or not remembering at all.</p> <p> Asked by a journalist in 1989 about his politics, Thomas recalled walking alongside the miners in a Yorkshire village as the men marched back to their colliery after the strike ended in defeat. What he remembered distinctly was the children in a primary school looking through the Victorian railings of the playground as their fathers, brothers and uncles went by, and singing to them in the face of defeat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e4777bd8627b3f0d128ce84988335bf2b3350c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4777bd8627b3f0d128ce84988335bf2b3350c2/0_354_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plenty to get your teeth into \u2026 The Red Shed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plenty to get your teeth into \u2026 The Red Shed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Did that moment really happen or did Thomas imagine it?

  "<p>For a few weeks a year, when my body craves cooling food, lunches and dinners are built around interesting salads, raw vegetables and simple plates of fruit. It\u2019s not how I eat all year \u2013 in fact, if you tried to persuade me to eat a raw vegetable for dinner in the dead of winter you\u2019d have quite a battle on your hands. But, come summer, I try and make use of vegetables that we are more familiar with eating when cooked, putting them to work in new ways. They don\u2019t require a hob to be lit, but will satisfy my cravings for flavour and refreshing, colourful food. Cooking in this way means almost instant gratification and uses simple and cheap favourites; here, cauliflower, carrots and late summer fruits.</p> <p>The key with eating veg raw is how it is prepared. Cutting wispy, cool, paper-thin fronds of fennel or delicately grating carrot will have an impact on how the vegetable tastes \u2013 these little pieces will have a more subtle flavour and texture, and better ability to absorb a dressing. If your knife skills aren\u2019t up to wafers of veg, then a mandolin or a speed peeler will come in handy.</p> <p>Eating raw food has been well documented, has a devoted following and some pretty convincing benefits, but, for me, it\u2019s only really this time of year to which it feels suited. I cook this way based on the mood of the day rather than the need to eat a certain way, though, I have to confess, it does leave me feeling great. You don\u2019t have to be too strict though, some toasted seeds and nuts, chickpeas or a flatbread taste great with these salads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/01/peppery-green-salad-apricots-and-curd-cheese-recipe-ideas-anna-jones-the-modern-cook\">Anna Jones\u2019 recipes for simple salads with complex flavours | The modern cook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve also included a quick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jul/15/how-to-grow-sprouting-seeds-mung-beans-alfalfa-seeds\">guide on how to sprout seeds and pulses</a>. Soaking and sprouting replicates germination, which activates and multiplies nutrients, making sprouts one of the most alive foods there is. If sprouting is a bridge too far for you, then you can buy them in good greengrocers, and some supermarkets too.</p> <h2><strong>Carrot and mustard seed salad</strong></h2> <p>I ate this simple salad almost every day in southern India. The sprouted mung beans add a refreshing crunch. There is a quick guide on sprouting your own seeds and pulses at home below.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>50g (a small handful) unsweetened desiccated coconut<br>2 tbsp olive or coconut oil<br>1 tsp black mustard seeds<br>10 curry leaves<br>200g carrots<br>4 big handfuls of spinach<br>50g sprouted mung beans<br>A small thumb of grated ginger<br>The juice of \u00bd a lemon<br>A handful of cashew nuts, roughly chopped<br>Salt and black pepper<br>A small bunch of coriander, roughly chopped</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Soak the coconut in about 100ml of boiling water.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Meanwhile, make your dressing. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the mustard seeds and let them crackle and pop. Lower the heat, add the curry leaves and stir for a few seconds, then take off the heat and pour the mixture into a small bowl to cool.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Peel, wash and grate the carrots into ribbons with a speed peeler, then put into a big serving bowl. Wash and dry the spinach, then add this too, along with the mung beans. Drain the coconut well and add this, too.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Grate the ginger into the cooled oil and mustard seeds, squeeze in the lemon juice and season well with salt and pepper. Drizzle the mix over the carrots and spinach, then finish with the chopped coriander and cashews.</p> <h2><strong>Raw cauliflower salad</strong></h2> <p>Raw cauliflower has a pleasingly creamy crunch, here it has been offset by bright radishes and anise notes from dill or tarragon. I often make this with coconut yoghurt, which works well too.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>1 cucumber, seeded, cut into small pieces<br>1 medium head of cauliflower, trimmed and chopped into tiny florets or finely sliced<br>1 bunch radishes, trimmed, thinly sliced<br>2 green chillies, deseeded, thinly sliced<br>100g skin-on almonds<br>A small bunch of dill or tarragon, roughly chopped<br>A small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</p> <p><strong>For the dressing</strong><br>200g Greek yoghurt<br>5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br>The juice of \u00bd a lemon<br>1 tbsp red wine vinegar<br>1 tbsp honey<br>Salt and black pepper</p> <p><strong>1</strong> First, make the yoghurt dressing by whisking all the ingredients together.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Mix all the remaining ingredients together with the dressing and let it all stand for 15 minutes, so the flavours can mingle together and the cauliflower softens slightly.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Transfer the salad to a serving platter and top with the almonds.</p> <h2><strong>Late-summer fruits with lime leaves</strong></h2> <p>The lime leaves, lemongrass and citrus make a dressing for the fruit salad here as you might any other salad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cfac0a19bd5882edc1e8f7b4809801bb9483b2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfac0a19bd5882edc1e8f7b4809801bb9483b2e4/0_0_4822_6276/768.jpg\" alt=\"Late-summer fruits with lime leaves\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salad days: Now\u2019s the time for white peaches, nectarines, yellow plums and blackberries, says Anna, but \u2018use whatever ripe and delicious fruit you have to hand.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Issy Crocker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>A stalk of lemongrass<br>4 lime leaves<br>A pinch of sea salt<br>The juice of a lemon<br>The juice and zest of a lime<br>2 tbsp honey<br>Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br>20 mint leaves, very finely chopped<br>Fruit (I used a mixture of white peaches, nectarines, yellow plums and blackberries)</p> <p><strong>1</strong> First, remove the hard outer leaves of the lemongrass to expose the tender inner bit. Discard the outer leaves, then chop the inner portion very finely. Chop the lime leaves finely, too. Use a pestle and mortar to pound the chopped lemongrass and the lime leaves with the salt \u2013 bash well until everything is fine.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Whisk together the citrus juice and zest with the honey, vanilla seeds and the lime-lemongrass mixture. Set aside.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Cut the fruit into pretty, bite-sized pieces and lay it all in a large bowl or on a platter. Drizzle with about half of the dressing. Give it a taste and keep adding until it tastes just right. You could serve this with a little creme fraiche, coconut yoghurt or thick Greek yoghurt, if you like. For a bit of crunch, some chopped toasted nuts or coconut would make a nice addition.</p> <h2>Easy sprouting at home</h2> <p><strong>Soak </strong>Put 2-4 tbsp dried pulses, grains or seeds (see the list below) in a large, wide-mouthed jar. Cover the top with a bit of muslin or a thin tea towel and secure with rubber band. Fill with cold water, then swirl around to wash and drain well. Cover with room temperature water and soak for at least 4 hours or overnight. Never fill the jar more then 1/3 with the dry seeds as they grow as they soak and sprout.</p> <p><strong>Drain</strong> Drain the water from your sprouts by inverting the jar at an angle in the sink or on a plate. Transfer to a cool place and leave to do their thing.</p> <p><strong>Rinse </strong>Rinse your sprouts twice a day with cold water then drain well as above.</p> <p><strong>Ready? </strong>When the little shoots that have grown from your sprouts are about 1-2cm long they are ready to eat. This will take 1-3 days, depending on the seed or pulse you choose and the weather.</p> <p><strong>Store </strong>Rinse once more in cold water, then pop the lid on the jar and put in the fridge, they will last for 4-5 days.</p> <p><strong>What can I sprout? </strong>Dried Lentils, dried chickpeas, dried mung beans, alfalfa seeds, mustard seeds, radish seeds, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, wild rice.

This is n0t the case under current legislation, which works on a priority basis and obliges local authorities to rehouse only those with a certain level of need.

This has to change.<br></p> <p>Compounding this lack of investment is the uncertainty caused by plans to cap the help social housing tenants receive with housing costs at the local housing allowance rates paid to private tenants \u2013 which currently includes those in supported living schemes. We already know that supported housing plays a significant role in preventing homelessness, with 19,500 people helped through this route in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/533099/Statutory_Homelessness_and_Prevention_and_Relief_Statistical_Release_January_to_March_2016.pdf\">2015/16 alone</a> (pdf).

  "<p>Would you work on a remote British farm, putting in long days picking fruit and digging up potatoes in the countryside? It is easy to see such work in a romantic light, like something out of the Darling Buds of May. But it is mostly the opposite. Long hours, low pay, dirty conditions and physically demanding work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/03/brexit-could-herald-end-to-british-fruit-and-veg-sales-producers-warn\">Brexit could herald end to British fruit and veg sales, producers warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is why British producers of fruit and vegetables are so worried. Most of us would answer no to the above question without a second thought. In a recent report, the chairman of a large produce firm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/03/brexit-could-herald-end-to-british-fruit-and-veg-sales-producers-warn\">said</a> that \u201cno British person wants a seasonal job working in the fields. They want permanent jobs or jobs that are not quite as taxing physically.\u201d</p> <p>So companies like this rely on up to 70,000 foreign workers to pick, sort and pack fruit and vegetables. They are more willing to get their hands dirty for low pay. The same is the case in many other British industries. Not many of us want to be employed cleaning up a slaughter house, for example, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/22/will-europeans-be-free-to-stay-in-the-uk-after-brexit\">eastern European workers</a> are vital.</p> <p>But this arrangement is now seriously at risk following the Brexit vote. <a href=\"http://britishgrowers.org/\">The British Growers Association</a> has warned that if these seasonal workers are not given special permits to enter the country, the whole industry will be in dire straits. Labour shortages would probably force producers to close or relocate overseas.</p> <p>This might seem like just another economic problem. But it holds implications for national security according to Erica Consterdine from the University of Sussex\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/migration/\">Centre for Migration Research</a>. For her, the failure to consider the importance of these foreign seasonal workers in a post-Brexit world means that \u201cit\u2019s looking pretty bad in terms of the security of the food supply chain. It would be disastrous.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, embracing the spirit of Brexit to the full would immediately hurt this and other industries. The issue is one facing a number of countries that rely on cheap labour. For example, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/16/donald-trump-says-illegal-immigrants-have-to-go-in-nbc-interview\">Donald Trump got his way</a> and deported illegal immigrants from the US, the Californian economy would probably collapse overnight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the pay was more reasonable in this lucrative industry, there would be no labour shortage, regardless of Brexit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the question of cheap foreign labour raises a number of thorny issues. For example, one popular response is to point the finger at the unemployed. Why are we so reliant on foreigners when thousands of people are sitting around doing nothing? Put them to work in the fields, and if they don\u2019t want to get their hands dirty, tough!</p> <p>The argument is ridiculous not simply because it plumbs the worst depths of populist idiocy. It misses the point that many unemployed people are elderly or ill, rendering them useless for jobs that require hard labour. But even able-bodied people can\u2019t be forced to do work they don\u2019t want to do. That type of thing only happens in countries that have given up on basic human rights.</p> <p>It\u2019s here that we enter into tricky territory. We\u2019re against British people being forced to do low-paid work, but completely fine if a desperate Polish mother-of-three ends up doing it instead. Something of a double standard?</p> <p>Insipid nationalism is a great way to displace the problems of \u201cextreme capitalism\u201d on to a particular ethnicity or minority group. Wasn\u2019t this really what Brexit was about at the end of the day? So, instead of fixating on the worker as such (who they are, where they come from, whether they are taking employment from a British person), we ought to look at the work itself. Especially the pay and conditions. The real travesty in this story are the low wages that have become normal in a lucrative industry.

But the actual process of recycling massive amounts of material \u2013 Californians recycled more than 18bn beverage containers in 2015 \u2013 is reliant on global commodities prices, the energy market, and government subsidies.</p> <p>Recycling centers, which are privately run, buy beverage containers from individuals for the state-guaranteed redemption value, then sell the materials to processors. (Companies that pick up curbside recycling also sell the materials to processors, and pocket the redemption value themselves.)<br></p> <p>\u201cThe nickel or dime [redemption value] is basically a wash. No one is making money on that,\u201d explained Mark Oldfield of CalRecycle, the state agency that oversees the program. \u201cThe money is made on the scrap value of those materials.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is, he said, the market for those materials has just gone \u201cdown, down, down\u201d, plummeting around 40-50% over the past three years. </p> <p>Recycled materials compete for buyers with \u201cvirgin\u201d materials, and when those \u201cvirgin\u201d materials are cheap, the bottom drops out of the market.<br></p> <p>\u201cEnergy is so cheap right now that it\u2019s much easier for manufacturers of anything \u2013aluminum cans or plastic bottles \u2013 to be using virgin material instead of recycled material,\u201d said Mark Murray of Californians Against Waste.</p> <p>The scrap value of glass and plastic has never made up for the operating costs of collecting it, so the state has provided subsidies (in the form of processing payments) in exchange for requiring the centers to accept those materials alongside the more lucrative aluminum cans. </p> <p>But plastic bottles are overtaking aluminum cans as the dominant beverage container, according to Murray. </p> <p>\u201cInstead of being dependent for their revenue on the market scrap price of aluminum, they\u2019re increasingly dependent on payment from state,\u201d Murray said, and the state subsidies are not keeping up with the cost of operating. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible news for the environment,\u201d Murray said. </p> <p>The state\u2019s overall recycling rate <a href=\"http://www.cawrecycles.org/recycling-news/gmhs9lxlmfa59k9ybmlajkn8gcrkzy\">fell below 50%</a> in 2015 for the first time since 2010, a setback that Californians Against Waste links in part to the loss of recycling centers.<br></p> <p>Another pressure facing urban recycling centers is the distaste of neighbors for the people who rely on them. </p> <p>Our Planet Recycling is located on Bayshore Boulevard in the south-east corner of the city, a stretch of divided highway where San Francisco keeps the kind of businesses it likes to pretend it doesn\u2019t need: fast food restaurants, big box retailers, auto repair shops. </p> <p>In 1990, San Francisco had 35 recycling centers scattered through its many neighborhoods.

It includes this expression of compassionate concern over the plight of low-lying island nations that are being engulfed by rising seas:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Some of the biggest supporters of the Paris accord are small oceanic nations seeking </em><em>welfare through handouts to save them from baseless predictions of rising sea levels, </em><em>even though actual changes in sea levels are tiny and not unusual.</em></p> <p><em>The fact is that sea level rise in Tuvalu has been effectively zero since accurate </em><em>measurements commenced in 1993, on tide gauges set up by the Australian </em><em>government</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This purported fact <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Tuvalu-sea-level-rise.htm\">is actually a fiction</a>: <a href=\"http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.data/1839.rlrdata\">the tide gauge data</a> show the rate of sea level rise in Tuvalu since 1993 is 4.3 mm per year, which is faster than <a href=\"http://sealevel.colorado.edu/\">the global average of 3.4 mm per year</a>. And Tuvalu is only one among <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/islands-threatened-by-climate-change-2012-10\">the many small island nations facing the loss of their homelands</a> at the hands of global warming-caused sea level rise.</p> <p>However, when it comes to energy use, Clexit\u2019s compassion for developing countries becomes even clearer yet:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>For developing countries, the Paris Treaty would deny them the benefits of reliable low-cost hydrocarbon energy, compelling them to rely on biomass heating and costly weather-dependent and unreliable power supplies, thus prolonging and increasing their dependency on international handouts. They will soon resent being told to remain forever in an energy-deprived wind/solar/wood/bicycle economy. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>The problem with energy from burning fossil fuels is that it\u2019s only \u201clow-cost\u201d if we ignore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/04/climate-change-will-blow-a-25tn-hole-in-global-financial-assets-study-warns\">the tremendous costs of the damages its carbon pollution causes</a> via climate change. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/27/global-warming-could-be-more-devastating-for-the-economy-than-we-thought\">Poorer countries are particularly vulnerable to those costs</a>, both because they lack the wealth and resources to adapt to them, and because they tend to be located in already-hot geographic regions near the equator. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s a reason why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">95% of expert economists agree that we should cut carbon pollution</a>. Of course, the Clexiters deny that carbon dioxide is a pollutant:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Carbon dioxide is NOT a dangerous pollutant \u2013 it is a natural, non-toxic and beneficial </em><em>gas which feeds all life on earth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>However, this was long ago decided in the courts. In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the State of Massachusetts had legal standing to sue the EPA for its refusal to regulate greenhouse gases, specifically because Massachusetts showed that it was being harmed by global warming via sea level rise encroaching on its shores. In that case, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-pollutant-advanced.htm\">the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant</a>.</p> <p>In response to the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued an endangerment finding concluding that, based on the available scientific evidence, <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-pollutant-advanced.htm\">carbon dioxide endangers public health and welfare, and must therefore be regulated as a pollutant</a>.</p> <p>The Clexiters deny that vast body of scientific evidence. In addition to sea level rise, their summary statement denies <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/lindzen-illusion-6-importance-of-ghgs.html\">the major role of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period-intermediate.htm\">current global temperatures are hotter than they\u2019ve been in over 2,000 years</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-intermediate.htm\">dangers of ongoing climate change</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s-intermediate.htm\">most climate scientists were predicting global warming in the 1970s</a>, and so on.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that the Clexit group denies basic climate science, since the only climate scientist on their committee is <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/richardson-2013-man-made-carbon.html\">Ole Humlum, who has done some very shoddy research on fossil fuels and carbon pollution</a>.

  "<p>With <em>The Fate of Gender</em>, US science reporter and author Frank Browning (<em>The Culture of Desire</em>, <em>A Queer Geography</em>) has written a very complicated book because\u2026 it\u2019s a very complicated subject. There\u2019s a lot more to gender than just endless snits about \u201cblue toys for boys and pink toys for girls\u201d, and Browning not only acknowledges the myriad different strands (and micro-strands), he does a near-heroic job of weaving them together to produce a compelling&#xa0;narrative.</p> <p>Split into sections and then chapters, <em>The Fate of Gender</em> examines subjects as diverse as gender as a construct and a performance, as opposed to a biological reality, the neuroscience of \u201cmale\u201d/\u201cfemale\u201d brains, the notion of masculinity and femininity being fluid rather than set, and distinctions between genders not so much vanishing as splintering and restructuring into new forms. As Browning says, Lady Gaga\u2019s supportive message in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw\" title=\"\">Born This Way</a> may actually be far too rigid for the lifelong fluctuations some people experience with their gender identity. According to some of his interviewees, some people are born one way, then end up being quite another way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Browning does an admirable job of distilling highly complex, dense information into an intriguing, accessible form</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, taking in everything from gender-free nurseries in Scandinavia and pregnancy surrogates&#xa0;for gay parents in Los Angeles, to female masturbation clinics in China (not quite as saucy as it sounds) and frazzled female trailblazers in Silicon Valley, Browning investigates the effects on families and children as gay parenting becomes part of the norm, how unbridled female sexuality has historically threatened male-dominated culture, and how women are redefining established power structures in the workplace and everywhere else (and, says Browning,&#xa0;starting to get the \u201cmale\u201d ulcers to go with it).</p> <p>Browning also looks into how some sectors of previously dominant male culture are prone to reacting to all these huge changes. Clue: often rather badly. Browning quotes <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/essays/21649050-badly-educated-men-rich-countries-have-not-adapted-well-trade-technology-or-feminism\" title=\"\">from the <em>Economist</em></a>: \u201cBadly educated men in rich countries have not adapted well to trade, technology or feminism.\u201d As evidenced, perhaps, by the polarised US election race (touched upon by Browning in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/11/donald-trump-fate-of-gender-frank-browning-book-us-election\" title=\"\">a separate media interview</a>), where all too often the appeal of \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d Donald Trump is played off against the \u201cshrill\u201d, \u201cshrewish\u201d \u201cball-breaker\u201d Hillary Clinton, seemingly with no more nuance required. While this is a simplistic assessment (lots of women like Trump and lots of men dislike him), there seems little doubt that, here, the gender factor is being played out on a global political stage.</p> <p>All this before even getting on to the topic of transgender/transsexual people and their increasing visibility, politicisation, acceptance, and power, across the spectrum, which, as Browning points out, would have been unthinkable even just a decade ago. Again it isn\u2019t as simple as Caitlyn (previously Bruce) Jenner making it on to the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em>. It\u2019s a highly complex subject: transvestite is not the same as transgender, is not the same as transsexual, is not the same as hermaphrodite, and so on\u2026 Browning attempts to simplify and demystify the subject, talking in depth to transgender and transsexual individuals, bringing in trans children and their issues, and also intersex children (where surgical interventions, which used to happen as babies, are now postponed).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/jul/29/token-podcast-coming-soon\">Token podcast: coming soon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are points in <em>The Fate of Gender</em> where Browning seems to expound too heavily on some aspects (for instance, the practical details of surrogacy), while failing to give similar length and depth to others (such as feminist objections to surrogacy \u2013 viewed by some as a rent-a-womb abuse of women). Moreover, some feminists reject the idea of trans women (as women). I would have liked to hear more about this from Browning, not only concerning the intricate arguments, but also on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/27/germaine-greer-transphobia-cardiff-feminism-inclusive\" title=\"\">toxic, counterproductive stifling of debate</a>, which in this country, led to the likes of Germaine Greer and Julie Bindel being banned from certain public speaking forums because of their dissenting views.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Browning does an admirable job of distilling highly complex, dense information into an intriguing, accessible form that avoids straying into pop science. <em>The Fate of Gender</em> doesn\u2019t pronounce gender dead or make any other pronouncements (\u201cDoes that suggest that what we are now witnessing in the gender arena is the first wave of massive transexualisation of humanity?\u201d asks Browning. \u201cHardly.\u201d)</p> <p>Instead, the book signposts a new reality \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t discount maleness (Browning highlights the comparative fragility of men, from cradle to grave, and observes that emerging studies on maleness are as exciting as the ones on femaleness), but eschews blind attachment to any inflexible notions of gender models, echoing the Denis Diderot mindset, that little in nature is fixed. <em>The Fate of Gender</em> emerges as a fascinating (and yes, complicated) book, in which the vast majority of readers could be assured of learning something.</p> <p><em>The Fate of Gender is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/fate-of-gender.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a><em> </em></p>",

At some point in these Rio Games the US will win their 1,000th gold medal in a summer Olympics. Presumably this will not be celebrated with cannons of confetti and a banner with a number 1,000 the size of a small SUV. But gold medals are important to the US so you never know.</p> <p>So far that pursuit has not been as fast as everyone might have hoped. Two days into the Olympics, American athletes have only one gold medal to go with five silvers and a bronze. It is not the haul of a powerhouse. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-medal-table-and-results-in-full\">The Guardian\u2019s handy interactive medal traker</a> has the US in sixth place behind Australia, Italy, China, Korea and Hungary. Obviously it is just two days into the Olympics and things can change quickly. We are only starting to get into the big swimming and gymnastics events where the US dominates and still have track and field lingering next week. America\u2019s medal count will explode.</p> <p>Still, it is weird to see the US languishing in fifth place on an Olympics medal chart. And there have been some disappointments already. Their narrow loss to Australia in the women\u2019s 4x100m freestyle relay wasn\u2019t a surprise \u2013 Australia won gold in the event in 2012 \u2013 but the closeness of the race made the defeat sting. Venus Williams\u2019s illness this weekend that led to to her losing her singles match to 67<sup>th</sup>-ranked Kirsten Flipkens and the Williams sisters\u2019 doubles defeat on Sunday was a signifiant blow.</p> <p>In a few days this will probably all be forgotten. By then America\u2019s swimmers and gymnasts will have delivered their predicted wins and all those gold medallions will gleam in the lights for NBC. Everyone will talk excitedly about American dominance at the Olympics. No one will remember those first few days when Australia ruled Rio. By then, attention will have turned to a bigger question.</p> <p>Who will get that 1,000th summer gold for the US? Only 22 more medals to go. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a7c59ee4b03b51a99e0e38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-07T23:36:37.658Z\">12.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Simone Biles will be one of the most famous people on the planet by the time the Olympics up (well, she\u2019ll be in the top 12,000 anyway) and she kicked off her Olympic campaign today.

  "<p>As the Chinese economy began to lose steam this year and there were continuing concerns about the health of global banking, Laura and Simon Delow focused on their investments for the future. Seeking security in case their other pension plans went south, the pair sank \u00a340,000 into gold \u2013 an investment popular in times of crisis \u2013 which turned out to be a shrewd move before the Brexit referendum at the end of June.</p> <p>\u201cWe see the price rising considerably due to global economic instability, particular in the banking sector,\u201d says Laura, 59, a semi-retired financial consultant. \u201cWe may now buy more due to Brexit uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>In investment terms, gold has had a very successful decade, mostly fuelled by a spike of more than 25% this year. In the past 12 months its rise has exceeded UK house prices, the FTSE 100 and Bank of England one-year fixed-rate bonds.</p> <p>The Delows\u2019 investment in gold sovereigns, held in a vault by the Pure Gold Company, was to hedge risk elsewhere in their retirement savings, as the precious metal tends to rise in troubled times when other assets are falling.</p> <p>Laura says she would not be too worried if the price fell in future. \u201cIn fact, I would be delighted, as this would suggest the global economy is more stable, which means our other investments should rise,\u201d she added.</p> <p>In the immediate panic after the Brexit result, its price soared at the fastest-ever rate against the pound. Last week, it traded at $1,367 an ounce, almost 29% higher than its price at the start of this year.</p> <p><strong>Not always Midas</strong></p> <p>So should gold be bought as an investment? While some experts have tipped it to rise even further, investing has many perils with prices which can fall sharply. During the eurozone crisis of August 2011, it flew to more than $1,900 amid speculation it could top $3,000. Instead, it fell steadily to just above the $1,000 mark, before this year\u2019s sparkling recovery.</p> <p>Demand surged in the run-up to the EU referendum, with the Royal Mint\u2019s online trading platform reporting a 32% increase in people snapping up coins and bars in June, even before the result was announced.</p> <p>\u201cThe speed of investment is unprecedented and the types and range of investor are more diverse than we have experienced, including teachers, doctors, property developers and solicitors,\u201d says Josh Saul, chief executive of The Pure Gold Company. \u201cRetirees are also buying because their pensions have been hit by market volatility.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that its UK clients are primarily buying gold sovereigns and Britannia coins, which are exempt from capital gains tax.</p> <p>There are good reasons why investors are lusting for gold: Brexit, the Italian banking crisis, Chinese uncertainty, spiralling global debt and Donald Trump. The danger, as ever, is that private investors end up buying at the top of the market, only to see the price collapse as sentiment swings.</p> <p><strong>Just for the wealthy?</strong></p> <p>Darius McDermott, managing director of fund platform Chelsea Financial Services, says gold divides investors. \u201cSome love it, some hate it. Gold does not pay interest, unlike dividend stocks, bonds and cash, so you do not benefit from compound growth over time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On the other hand, gold offers \u201cnegative correlation\u201d with stock markets and other assets: \u201cIf they fall in value, gold tends to rise, which can be used to offset losses elsewhere in a portfolio. Unlike pounds, dollars, euros or yen, the supply of gold is ultimately finite. Many find that attractive amid today\u2019s global currency wars and rampant money printing.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to be super-wealthy to get exposure to gold. In fact, you don\u2019t even have to buy physical gold.</p> <p>Retired couple Paul Gosling, 68, and wife Jill, 67, who live in Hereford, sought the security of gold in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, when the pound and gilt yields tumbled. Their advisers, Chelsea Financial Services, suggested switching some of their retirement savings into a fund which invests in gold mining stocks.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought it seemed a good idea to invest a few thousand pounds in precious metals to offset today\u2019s volatility,\u201d Paul says.</p> <p>The fund has risen 158% over the last year, according to figures from Trustnet Direct, but there is no guarantee it will rise so rapidly in future (in fact, over five years it is down 10%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97c90731e7d977a57e6039a61a00660b6a24d92d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97c90731e7d977a57e6039a61a00660b6a24d92d/117_56_1927_1156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura and Simon Dellow: \u2018We see the price rising considerably due to global economic instability.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura and Simon Dellow: \u2018We see the price rising considerably due to global economic instability.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Buying physical gold is not all about 1kg bars. A 1g bar can be bought for as little as \u00a340 or gold coins from a few hundred pounds, though investing in such small amounts may be more pleasurable than profitable.</p> <p>\u201cDealing costs, handling charges and delivery fees can quickly eat up any profit you make from the rising gold price,\u201d says Adrian Ash, head of research at Bullion Vault. \u201cIf you hold more than a few thousand pounds [at home] you are likely to invalidate your household insurance, or will have to pay an extra premium and install security measures.\u201d</p> <p>Bullion Vault\u2019s 60,000 customers own the gold they buy, but it is held in vaults in London, Z\u00fcrich, New York, Toronto or Singapore. Maximum trading costs are 0.5% and there are also storage costs. On average, customers hold \u00a330,000 of gold, though most hold smaller sums.</p> <p>\u201cWe processed trades worth \u00a330m on the Friday after the Brexit referendum, our record day. Not everybody was buying, some were taking profits,\u201d says Ash.</p> <p><strong>Beware the gains</strong></p> <p>In the last year, the LBMA Gold Bullion index has risen 35% against 5.35% for UK house prices, a total return of 2.51% from the FTSE 100 and 1.10% on Bank of England one-year fixed-rate bonds.</p> <p>It has glistered over 10 years, rising 177% against 69% on the FTSE 100, 41% for house prices and 32% for bonds. Over 20 years it is also first, up 301% against a total return of 251% on the FTSE 100 and 121% on bonds.</p> <p>But John Blowers of Trustnet Direct sounds a warning: \u201cGold has performed well lately but investors must understand there is plenty of volatility along the way, and recent successes could be reversed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Getting into gold</strong><br></h2> <p>\u25a0 Although physical gold can be bought from the Royal Mint in volumes as small as one gram, the tiny amount can be expensive to process.</p> <p>\u201cIt currently charges around \u00a358.61 for a 1g minted gold bar, well above today\u2019s market price of around \u00a332,\u201d says John Blowers, head of Trustnet Direct. \u201cYou can buy a 100g bar for \u00a33,388, which works out as \u00a333.88 a gram, much closer to today\u2019s market price. It therefore makes sense to buy larger bars as you get more gold for your money, though you will then have to consider how to store it safely.\u201d</p> <p>Prices vary. For example, Sharps Pixley sells a 1g Degussa gold bar for \u00a340.60, or a 100g ingot for \u00a33,290. Chard sells a 1kg bar for \u00a332,975. You can also buy a part-stake in a bar, gaining legal title to the gold without taking delivery, Blowers says. \u201cIt is stored in a safe location and you pay a small administration fee every year, typically around 1% of the average value of the bullion, plus VAT.\u201d</p> <p>Another option is coins, which can be things of great beauty. The Royal Mint sells the Sovereign 2016 Gold Bullion Coin for \u00a3268.10 with the price falling the more that is bought, so 50 coins will cost \u00a3254.90 each. Prices vary depending on the coin - London bullion dealer ATS Bullion currently charges \u00a31,048.40 for a Britannia 1oz 2014 gold coin, and \u00a31,033 for a Krugerrand 1oz coin.</p> <p>Lawrence Chard, founder of Blackpool-based bullion dealer Chard, says 1oz gold Krugerrands and Britannias are particularly popular. \u201cThey carry the lowest premiums, particularly when buying in bulk, and attract the highest buy-back prices. They are also free of capital gains tax,\u201d he says, adding that sovereigns are also sought after. \u201cThese were used until 1932 and are still one of the most popular and collectible gold coins today.\u201d</p> <p>\u25a0 Rather than buy physical gold you can get exposure to price movements by investing in a low-cost exchange traded fund (ETF), sold by most online fund platforms, independent financial advisers and stockbrokers.</p> <p>\u201cThe Physical Gold ETF is a simple, cost-efficient way to access the gold market by providing a return equivalent to the movements in the gold spot price, with an annual management fee of just 0.39%, plus and dealing charges,\u201d says Blowers.</p> <p>You could buy into an investment fund that targets gold and other commodity stocks, notably as BlackRock Gold &amp; General. This fund is up an impressive 120% over the last year, but a mark of its potential volatility is that it is 27% lower than five years ago.</p> <p>\u25a0 You can buy gold mining stocks such as UK-listed Fresnillo and Randgold Resources from an online broker. Their share prices have soared - Randgold is up 124% over the last year - but you are exposed to the company\u2019s individual fortunes as well as the gold price; recent strong growth could make it a risky time to buy.</p>",

It\u2019s impossible. Art school\u2019s like being plunged into a sheep dip that inoculates you against cliches. It gives you a sensibility you need to get into the art world. I didn\u2019t go to a posh London art school, though. I went to Portsmouth Polytechnic. Then I applied to Chelsea for a masters \u2013 and got turned down for being \u201ctoo much of an artist\u201d. It was one of the greatest things that could have happened to me. I was forced to go out there and get on with it, not bugger about trying to get another qualification that nobody would ever have asked about.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I took a bit of acid at the time of my degree show but it didn't help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At art school, I started out making things that were very much in the spirit of what I\u2019m looking at here, wandering round the Chelsea degree show: rough and ready and lashed up out of whatever I could find in a skip. By the time of my degree show, however, I was interested in highly crafted art. Someone had told me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/may/12/are-computers-killing-off-craft-not-a-chance\">craft was dead</a> \u2013 which immediately made me love craft. And all the artists being hailed at the time, people like Anselm Keifer and Georg Baselitz, were a bit bish-bash-bosh. I think I reacted against that and that\u2019s what gave me my aesthetic: being a bit pernickety and suburban.</p> <p>My showpiece was a big table made out of old railway sleepers I found in the bushes. They were all rotting and nicely weathered and I used them as a plinth for sculptures of things like a bronze Bible and a helmet, all a bit gothic. I\u2019d taken a bit of acid round that time \u2013 but, to be honest, it didn\u2019t help. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"365d5fc18df8d29a34407bac82da28bec47e21c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/365d5fc18df8d29a34407bac82da28bec47e21c9/11_742_6530_3918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Smisko immerses Grayson Perry in her work, Assimilation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Smisko immerses Grayson Perry in her work, Assimilation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It used to be that each generation had a \u201cthing\u201d that was trendy to do, but I\u2019m struck by how Chelsea students seem to do a bit of everything. No one seems able to commit to one single form. I guess, because of the internet and their economic situation, it\u2019s about contingency, but it means there\u2019s a non-committal quality to the show. It might be fear, or maybe just be the nature of contemporary culture, where everything\u2019s going on at once, and it does make me wonder about the future. Fifty years down the line, instead of dashing off watercolours in the village art club, little old ladies will be sitting around doing conceptual art. </p> <p>Another thing that strikes me is the fact that nobody really talks about being original. None of the students seems remotely concerned about it, which is quite healthy I think. It\u2019s an illusive dream to pursue originality as an art student. It\u2019s not like learning to play the violin, where you can be demonstrably talented at a young age. With art, you really need to find your own voice and that takes a while. Actually, it\u2019s a marathon \u2013 and if you are eventually original, you\u2019re lucky.</p> <p>Talking to the students is a lot of fun. I\u2019m quite self-serving so, while going round a degree show, what I really want to find out is what\u2019s going on in the world today, particularly as technology has widened the chasm between generations. I\u2019ve long given up the hope of stumbling across someone at a degree show and going: \u201cWow! This person is the genius of the future!\u201d I can remember being a young artist myself: there\u2019s an inherited arrogance you have, but the work\u2019s all fairly derivative. Students are on a low budget and they haven\u2019t got much room. </p> <p>Chelsea\u2019s lot seem a lot less na\u00efve and probably more middle class than we were at Portsmouth Poly \u2013 and a lot more people will come to their show. My degree show was quite different: it was attended a sad set of seven bewildered parents and a couple of local art lovers. And back then we could hitchhike up to London, get into a squat and live in the centre of the city with no money for several years. There wasn\u2019t a vast amount of competition in the art world because of the tiny number of art students and the tiny number of galleries. Now everything is inflated \u2013 and it\u2019s people like me, artists as the stormtroopers of gentrification, who are responsible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"023112d2fc7463aee0e7452a16126aa1b19dc13a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023112d2fc7463aee0e7452a16126aa1b19dc13a/0_111_7271_4363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Smith\u2019s I Kissed the Blood on Those Soles of Yours\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtyard takeover \u2026 Sarah Smith\u2019s I Kissed the Blood on Those Soles of Yours</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Perry\u2019s students \u2026 Sarah Smith: \u2018My family don\u2019t have a clue what I do\u2019 <br></strong>Dominating the entire courtyard, Sarah Smith\u2019s degree show work comprises five words written across five banners and suspended from various balconies. \u201cKNEEL BEFORE ME AND BEG,\u201d it reads.

It\u2019s only the second time I\u2019ve been back since graduating. I was even a bit nervous on the bus here. But walking around now, it all seems normal \u2013 only the degree show venue has changed. When I was a student, this building was still a swimming pool and we exhibited in the gym. One student I\u2019ve been talking to even has the same tutor I had, back in the late 1980s. </p> <p>I worked as a secretary before I went to Goldsmiths. I was 24 when I enrolled. It felt like the most mature of all the art schools: the average age was 28. You had people in their 40s and someone in their 50s. It helped make it a really serious course. You don\u2019t waste time if you come to things a bit later. I\u2019d given up a job that was quite nicely paid so couldn\u2019t waste a day.<br></p> <p>By the time I got there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/01/art\">the Freeze group</a> \u2013 people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/damienhirst\">Damien Hirst</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/michael-landy\">Michael Landy</a> [Wearing\u2019s husband] \u2013 had already worked stuff out. My year was quite envious: what they were doing just seemed so organised. They painted the walls, they got the private views organised, they sent the cards out. All that takes time and effort. It got misinterpreted as an overly commercialised thing. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone I meet is doing what we were doing: trying to understand art</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The big difference today is space: it\u2019s shrinking. We had 300 square foot each, which is massive. At one art school I know of, people only get desks \u2013 they actually have to request studio time. Everyone I meet here is doing the same thing we were doing: trying to understand art. It takes a few years to work out all the history and how to use different mediums. At Goldsmiths, you could do anything. I did sculpture, painting, performance \u2013 for one project, we covered up all the books in the library so people couldn\u2019t get their hands on them \u2013 and then filmed people trying. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WUgFMDY-M\">Originality comes later</a>, but you do want to be unique.

It happened almost instantly after graduation. I borrowed a friend\u2019s camera and started doing vox-pops on the street. There was no YouTube then, or anywhere to put work online, but I was aware that technology was changing, that people were getting camcorders and filming themselves in private. I thought: \u201cI\u2019m going to go outside and turn all this into a public performance.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of the degree show work I see at Goldsmiths references <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media\">social media</a>. I don\u2019t use it \u2013 I don\u2019t need to. But a lot of young artists probably do. It\u2019s an important way for people to see their work. At the same time, I am interested in how people create their identities through it. What I saw even early on with MySpace was young women using Photoshop on their faces: that craze of chasing your idealised self. It can result in something that\u2019s not unique at all, but a very particular kind of archetype, moulded by the media around you.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had my first solo show in an old betting shop. My heart was beating so fast I couldn't talk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my generation, we had to go out and find disused office spaces to show our work. There were more empty shops in those days, too. The first solo show I had was at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jan/28/1\">City Racing</a>, a gallery run by a group of friends in a former betting shop. On opening night, I couldn\u2019t talk. Someone asked me to explain my work and my heart was beating so fast. I just didn\u2019t know how to act with so many people milling around. I\u2019ve got better at it since.</p> <p>I considered film school after Goldsmiths. But I realised it would take away all that openness I\u2019d found. At art school, you have to think on your feet and find a language \u2013 nobody is going to tell you what to do. My course wasn\u2019t structured: it was all about talking to like-minded people, having space, interacting \u2013 and also those moments of not being able to do anything. If you sat at home doing nothing, you\u2019d feel it wasn\u2019t right. Some people struggled with that, even at college. There was depression, anxiety, arguments. There used to be shouting and screaming and people running out the door crying.</p> <p>When we emerged from Goldsmiths, there was a recession on. But things are even tougher for these artists today. Your degree show is both an end and a beginning, a mix of optimism and melancholy. It\u2019s hard to make three years of experience coherent. I knew it wasn\u2019t the ultimate place to exhibit, just a stepping stone. In our first year at Goldsmiths, we were given a talk: they told us most people who go to art school won\u2019t end up as practising artists. I still feel very fortunate to have been able to carry on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ea6c61f3d16d1d98ed689aa3ada62cf2be96733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ea6c61f3d16d1d98ed689aa3ada62cf2be96733/0_338_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Williamson\u2019s She Thrives in Poor Soils.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Up close and personal \u2026 Andrea Williamson\u2019s She Thrives in Poor Soils.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Wearing\u2019s students \u2026 Andrea Williamson: \u2018I really can do this\u2019 <br></strong>Light bounces off the oval mirrors and cascades on to a pair of frilly knickers draped over a bathtub. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see people spending time with your work,\u201d says Andrea Williamson as visitors get up close and personal with her installation, She Thrives in Poor Soils. \u201cIt makes you think, \u2018I really can do this.\u2019\u201d Next up for her is an exhibition in Berlin organised by students from Goldsmiths\u2019 curating course, which didn\u2019t exist in Gillian Wearing\u2019s day.

  "<p>Less than a year ago, George Osborne boasted of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/19/george-osborne-embrace-china-dont-fear-its-rise\">\u201cgolden decade\u201d</a> in ties with China. It was grand rhetoric for a cobbled together package of red carpet visits, a problematic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report\">nuclear energy project</a> and deals like the \u00a345m agreement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/pig-semen-export-deal-china\">export the UK\u2019s finest pig semen</a>. But even the cynics didn\u2019t expect the shine to come off quite so quickly. Britain has just blindsided Beijing twice: through its shock announcement that the centrepiece nuclear project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed\">is on hold</a>, pending a fresh review, and by voting to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">swift reversal on Hinkley Point C</a> epitomises the dilemma posed by China\u2019s ascendance. Other countries dutifully talk about partnership and win-win pacts, and there has been real progress on areas such as climate change. But for the most part, they have found themselves torn between the lure of the world\u2019s second largest economy and their alarm at its might \u2013 its increasing influence and assertiveness, its authoritarian leadership, nationalism and hefty military investments, and its desire to reset the rules, as rising powers usually do. Tony Abbott <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/fear-and-greed-drive-australias-china-policy-tony-abbott-tells-angela-merkel-20150416-1mmdty.html\">said privately</a> while he was Australia\u2019s prime minister that his country\u2019s China policy was driven by \u201cfear and greed\u201d. He could have spoken for many of his counterparts.</p> <p>When Osborne took charge of China policy, ushering through the deal for investment in the French-built nuclear plant, greed took the lead. Some of the steps were sensible and even admirable \u2013 seeking cooperation on a space programme; leading support for Beijing\u2019s new development bank in the face of churlish US opposition. But Britain\u2019s hushed response in a string of cases showed that despite the lip service to human rights they were \u201cnot one of our top priorities \u2026 the prosperity agenda is further up the list\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/guardian-view-on-human-rights-and-foreign-policy-philip-hammond-foreign-office\">a top official conceded</a> of foreign policy in general.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/friends-may-hinkley-point-delays\">Just as we need friends, May is busy ruffling feathers over Hinkley Point | Deborah Orr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though Theresa May\u2019s spokesman says the UK will still seek a strong relationship \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future\">China National Nuclear Corporation</a> was yesterday revealed to be on a government list of those deemed eligible to develop small modular reactors \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s instincts appear fearful.

There is a more obvious reason to ditch the plant: its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-c-wrong-project-wrong-price\">questionable technology and excessive price tag</a>. Analysts suggest that should relations deteriorate to a point where China might contemplate turning the lights out, we would probably have bigger problems to deal with anyway.</p> <p>Still, the US, for example, has been much more cautious, mindful perhaps that China has a variable safety record and a culture of cover-up. On Hinkley Point, says <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/persons/nigel-s-inkster\">Nigel Inkster</a> of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and formerly of MI6, the risks \u201care ultimately manageable if you are prepared to acknowledge they exist\u201d.</p> <p>Though Beijing\u2019s response so far has been muted, it will not have appreciated the embarrassingly last-minute nature of the Hinkley rethink, and the airing of suspicions about Chinese intentions. If the nuclear project is ditched for good, it is likely to be much more vocal.</p> <p>Four years ago, it punished us in retaliation for David Cameron\u2019s meeting with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/china-cancels-uk-visit-dalai-lama\">Dalai Lama</a>. High-level visits halted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/29/slapdowns-2013-insults-jibes\">state media trolled the UK</a> as \u201cmerely a country of old Europe suitable only for tourism and overseas students, with a few decent football teams\u201d. But trade still went up and Beijing still approached London to initiate projects. It knew we had our uses. Osborne understood the importance of China\u2019s power better than most. But he wasted our own, albeit waning, influence.</p> <p>Britain is still boosted by the legacy of our empire, such as our permanent seat on the security council. Until recently, we offered China a gateway to Europe and a voice inside it, lobbying against anti-dumping rules, for example.</p> <p>China\u2019s own economic woes mean that entrepreneurs are looking outwards, and Beijing wants to diversify its foreign holdings away from dollars. Britain still looks like a fairly safe bet if you want a decent return on investment; that\u2019s why Chinese companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/03/china-buys-weetabix-majority-stake\">own Weetabix</a>, a slice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/china-current-future-investments-18bn-trade-rail-nuclear\">Thames Water</a> and, as of Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/west-brom-takeover-chinese-investment-group\">West Bromwich Albion FC</a>. More may come in search of post-Brexit bargains. Our soft power is born not just of Jane Austen, James Watt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but also our political, legal and economic culture, for all its flaws.</p> <p>China has tried and failed to buy its way to soft power. The Hinkley Point project was in large part about borrowing our reputation \u2013 showing that we trusted the China General Nuclear Power Corporation not only to cooperate on the EDF plant, but more importantly to design and build its own reactors at Bradwell in Essex, with a view to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed\">further overseas deals</a>.</p> <p>For the leadership, the Hinkley delay and the manner of its announcement will reinforce the conviction that democracy is not only a threat to their power, but also a bad, unpredictable, even irresponsible way of running a country. It is perhaps even more dismayed by Brexit. We have lost a large part of our value to it; and at the same time lost the strength in numbers we enjoyed in dealing with it.</p> <p>The prospect of a bilateral <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36877573\">trade agreement</a> compensating for Brexit-induced economic woes seems slim, even putting aside the years it would take to thrash out a deal, with experienced negotiators in short supply. We need China more than ever, and have less to offer them; especially since other advantages \u2013 the City of London, world-class universities \u2013 have to deal with the impact of Brexit too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/22/i-want-you-to-understand-the-sense-of-fear-that-chinese-people-feel-every-day\">I want you to understand the sense of fear that Chinese people feel every day | Nanfu Wang</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The price for Osborne\u2019s unabashed embrace of China has been our credibility, at a time when we need it most. The relegation of human rights told Beijing that we would cave if pressed hard enough on an issue. It undermined Chinese activists and lawyers, made it tougher for other countries to tackle the issueand bolstered the argument that western concerns for rights are selective (which is often true) and another way of attacking it (which is not).</p> <p>That is a practical issue for the UK as well as a moral one. While Hinkley Point was dominating front pages, news from China garnered less attention: the trials of human rights lawyers, part of a sweeping crackdown on civil society and dissenting voices. Zhou Shifeng, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/chinese-lawyer-who-exposed-baby-milk-scandal-jailed-for-subversion\">jailed for seven years</a> for subversion, had represented families hit by the scandal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/02/china\">melamine-tainted milk powder</a> which killed six infants and sickened 300,000, partly because of a cover-up by the firm and local officials, and self-censorship by journalists who feared retaliation.</p> <p>It is Zhou, and people like him, who have sought to promote the rule of law and accountability: things we should also wish to see prioritised there. Osborne and co pleased China\u2019s leadership when they rowed back on human rights, but they sold its citizens short \u2013 and Britain too.</p> <p>They pursued their strategy without sufficient thought, adequate consideration of the repercussions or a deep enough understanding of our potential partners \u2013 at a time when Beijing has displayed increasing hostility to western ideas and a tougher approach to western businesses. The prime minister should learn from Osborne\u2019s focus on China, without adopting his unalloyed enthusiasm, but her job has been made much harder by his compromises.</p>",

  "<p>Visual snow is a poetic name for a strange visual anomaly. Those affected find their vision is busied by a kind of snow, or television-like static, which is often accompanied by small, moving lights or afterimages that linger like a visual hangover. It can be something they have always experienced, or it can happen suddenly, and it is not something from which you can experience relief. Indeed, it can become more pronounced when you close your eyes. There is no cure, and very little is understood about its cause; current research shows the eyes themselves are normal, and it is not known which part of the brain is involved.</p> <p>Even Googling the phrase returns few results. There is no NHS page dedicated to the condition (and there are NHS pages dedicated to dandruff and grazes).</p> <p>\u201cThere is not an NHS page for visual snow because visual snow doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Professor Peter Goadsby, one of the few experts on the condition working in the UK. An expert in migraine and a director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/16/what-is-the-wellcome-trust\" title=\"\">the Wellcome Trust</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nihr.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute for Health Research</a> at King\u2019s College London, Goadsby became interested in the condition due to an overlap in the perception of visual snow as a form of migraine aura. He recognised what he calls a \u201chomogenous disturbance\u201d. \u201cIt&#xa0;currently isn\u2019t recognised within medicine. When I first proposed it as a condition worth researching, colleagues thought I was completely, barking crazy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>People who experience visual snow commonly describe their field of vision as like an old, out-of-tune television. Others describe images persisting after the visual stimulus has left, dragging or remaining in the field of vision as a kind of negative space (a disturbance known as palinopsia). Squiggly lines and flashes of light are also consistently reported. Impaired night vision, photosensitivity and tinnitus are more&#xa0;rare effects.</p> <p>Some people have experienced it for&#xa0;as long as they can remember, but it is difficult to know how many people have always lived with it, since&#xa0;they may not realise it is a peculiarity. \u201cWe tend to use ourselves as a standard of normality,\u201d Goadsby says. Indeed, he was working on a visual snow study with a doctor who, on hearing descriptions of the condition, recognised the experiences as his own.&#xa0;\u201cThis is a person who has been through medical school, who knows how the brain works,\u201d says Goadsby. \u201cBut he thought that was how everyone saw. He didn\u2019t realise he&#xa0;was&#xa0;different.\u201d</p> <p>So, working out how many people are afflicted with visual snow is a \u201cbroadly impossible question\u201d. Also, it is a condition that can strike regardless of age. Amanda Wright, a master\u2019s student in Copenhagen, says she has \u201chad this strange way of seeing my whole life, and no one really listened or understood me when I tried to explain\u201d. Her visual snow manifests as static, dragging trails of light, and, unusually, as detailed motifs, such as military scenes and a \u201cGuatemalan marketplace\u201d. \u201cI think about what it might be like to see without static or lights. It must be very calm,\u201d she says.</p> <p>At least, Wright suggests, you are never bored. \u201cYou can look up to the ceiling and see a symphony of lights.\u201d And there is relief in the fact that, \u201cwhile you always have visual snow, you don\u2019t always experience it: when absorbed in a task, you won\u2019t have conscious awareness of it\u201d.</p> <p>There is only one charity funding research into the condition. The <a href=\"http://www.eyeonvision.org/\" title=\"\">Eye on Vision Foundation</a> was set up by Jennifer Ambrose, who has seen static upon closing her eyes, or in the dark, for as long as she can remember. On waking up one morning to floating clouds and spots heavily obscuring her vision, she booked an appointment with an eye doctor, discovering only that she had no retinal tears and no visible damage. Her situation didn\u2019t improve; in fact, it got steadily worse. \u201cI was having ghosting images, halos, glare.\u201d She founded Eye on Vision to raise awareness and fund research.</p> <p>\u201cThe medical community are more supportive now than they were 10 years ago. The response is still: \u2018There is nothing we can do for you,\u2019 but it is a fair response, because there needs to be more research.\u201d In terms of practical advice, guidance on managing the condition varies, but includes avoiding fluorescent lighting, wearing polarised sunglasses and taking regular breaks when using a computer.</p> <p>As with many health conditions for which little therapeutic support is available, there is an active online community. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VISUAL-SNOW-SUPPORT-GROUP-139132782777570/\" title=\"\">Visual Snow Support Group on Facebook</a> has more than 5,000 members, and topics of conversation range from updates on neurology appointments to exchanging dietary tips. John Kramer, 39, from Michigan in the US, administers the group. \u201cThe Facebook group is ... a place where people can come to learn about the condition, but also get support for the&#xa0;times when&#xa0;the condition causes us to reach&#xa0;our breaking point,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Little is known about the causes of visual snow. There are theories of links to legal and illegal drug use, auto-immune disease, Lyme disease and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, but nothing has been proved. Goadsby\u2019s aim, meanwhile, is simply to get the condition validated by the wider medical community. \u201cThere is so little done for these people. While many are getting on with their lives, some are completely disabled by the condition. We need to understand exactly what we\u2019re working with. We need to clarify what is happening with people\u2019s brains. We know it eventually stabilises. We know that you won\u2019t lose your vision. We\u2019ve done some brain imaging and have seen some unusual activity in the visual cortex at the back of the brain.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI\u2019m&#xa0;going to make it exist.\u201d</p>",

Its confidence seems to have put most people off looking into the details: that and the way the commission scattered, across hundreds of pages in several different publications, its explanation of how it had achieved what seemed impossible.</p> <p>Analysis that I co-authored might help explain why the commission appeared so reluctant to spell out its workings. In fact, it\u2019s hard to imagine a less popular way of winning public support for a new runway than its suggestion for how expansion could avoid breaking our climate limits.</p> <p>The essence of the commission\u2019s suggestion is simple, even if the details are difficult to pin down. It proposed that the government could allow a new runway to be built without busting the emissions cap, by hiking the cost of tickets so fewer people can afford to fly. Its idea is to build a new runway in London then increase prices so that demand for flights falls, particularly at airports in poorer parts of the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-05T15:55:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Impact of a Heathrow third runway on passenger demand at regional airports\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-05T15:55:56/embed.html\">Impact of a Heathrow third runway on passenger demand at regional airports</a> </figure>  <p>No one can say precisely how big the price increase would need to be to keep the country within its limits, because it depends on how quickly flight technology improves, but today\u2019s report estimates how much more tickets might have to cost.</p> <p>If technology to make planes more fuel-efficient progresses as quickly as the commission optimistically suggests, a return ticket to New York \u2013 from any UK airport, not just the one with the new runway \u2013 would become about \u00a3270 more expensive after a new runway is built. But if technology moves more slowly, as many analysts think it will, the flight could cost \u00a3850 more. Price increases like these would spell the end of budget flying; long-haul trips would be affordable only to the rich.</p> <p>People worried about climate change shouldn\u2019t kid themselves that this is a realistic solution to the emissions problems a new runway brings. It\u2019s near-impossible to imagine the government putting such a high price on flying purely to protect the environment: after all, it couldn\u2019t bring itself to increase fuel duty for drivers this year despite two years of <a href=\"http://www.racfoundation.org/data/uk-pump-prices-over-time\">falling prices</a>. It\u2019s far more likely that a new runway \u2013 and the rest of the UK\u2019s airport capacity \u2013 will be used, busting our climate limits.</p> <p>If the runway really is built, the best hope of keeping flights affordable without breaking our climate targets may be for the government to tax frequent fliers at a higher rate than those going on holiday just once or twice a year, so more people can still travel. This approach was outlined last year by <a href=\"http://afreeride.org/\">A Free Ride</a> and could be the cleanest and fairest answer, but would depend on a level of serious political engagement with this challenge that has so far been absent. </p> <p>Sometime soon the government will finally make a decision about a new runway. To many, it seems the question of how the runway can avoid breaking our climate change law has been resolved, but in fact, all we\u2019ve had is a series of possibilities. We should understand where the path leads before taking a step into the dark.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland\u2019s environment agency has warned the country\u2019s industries and farmers that their waste and inefficiency is now the biggest threat to the environment, overtaking pollution.</p> <p>In a marked shift in strategy, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Terry A\u2019Hearn, will urge businesses, farmers and manufacturers to adopt a \u201cone planet prosperity\u201d policy designed to cut their energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, waste and resource use. </p> <p>\u201cThe major threat to the environment now is that humanity is overusing the planet as a resource base,\u201d he told the Guardian. </p> <p>A\u2019Hearn argues that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has largely won the battle against so-called gross pollution from onshore sources. Air, water and soil pollution is now far below the levels seen decades ago. <br></p> <p>Those were 20<sup>th-</sup>century problems, he said. But developed economies such as the UK\u2019s are now consuming resources at a rate close to three times the planet\u2019s actual capacity. \u201cI\u2019ve been extremely clear that if we have only one planet, we have to be really, really smart about how we use it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sepa, which is sister agency to the Environment Agency in England, has been given greater regulatory power and independence under legislation passed by the Scottish parliament in 2014, including greater freedom to fine polluters. </p> <p>It is now able to levy fines as high as \u00a340,000 without going through state prosecutors, imposing fixed penalties similar to those issued by police for driving offences, and has discretionary powers to penalize repeat offenders far more heavily for repeated breaches. </p> <p>But Sepa\u2019s data shows that 87% of Scottish businesses now have a good or excellent regulatory record, with only 7% rated as poor or very poor. </p> <p>A\u2019Hearn, an Australian who took over as Sepa chief executive last year after running Northern Ireland\u2019s environment agency, said there were still sectors with \u201csignificant challenges\u201d, particularly the fish farming industry.<br> </p> <p>Scottish salmon farms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/scottish-fish-farmers-parasite-pesticide\">are repeatedly </a>criticised by environment campaigners and other marine industries for heavy use of toxic chemicals to combat sea lice and disease, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/10/marine-harvest-salmon-farm-scottish-loch\">seabed pollution caused by fish excrement</a>. \u201cThere are still compliance issues here; we need to get on top of those,\u201d A\u2019Hearn said.</p> <p>With an overall budget of \u00a378m, Sepa has seen its government funding cut by about 25% in real terms over the last decade and is absorbing a 6% budget cut this year, down to \u00a337m. Half its funds come from regulatory fees and other sources, helping cushion the impact of those cuts.<br></p> <p>A\u2019Hearn said its inspection regime would remain robust but in an article being posted on <a href=\"http://www.sepaview.com/\">Sepa\u2019s website</a> later on Monday, he asserts that sustainable growth is now the core objective of its regulatory strategy.</p> <p>\u201cOur statutory purpose, to deliver environmental protection and improvement in ways which also create health and wellbeing benefits and sustainable economic growth, means that Sepa must undertake a very different role if we are to help create prosperity within our planet\u2019s capacity to support it,\u201d he states. </p> <p>The aquaculture sector would be among the first to be approached by A\u2019Hearn to establish new \u201csustainable growth agreements\u201d which he said will be central to his new one planet strategy. </p> <p>Based partly on a similar scheme he rolled out in Northern Ireland, voluntary but formal agreements would be struck with the most successful or progressive companies, or possibly on an industry-wide basis. </p> <p>Companies which became sector champions would set targets or goals to increase efficiency and cut down waste; it would allow them to publicise that role in their marketing. Some highly integrated sectors such as the whisky industry, which has lately adopted more ambitious environmental policies, could sign industry-wide sustainability deals.</p> <p>A\u2019Hearn cited a deal signed by the aggregates and cement giant Lafarge on his second-last day as boss of the Northern Ireland agency. Lafarge agreed to pilot a scheme to take chicken manure from a major poultry farm and waste tyres as lower carbon fuel sources to generate the vast amounts of power needed for its cement factory at Cookstown. </p> <p>Environmentalists fear that crowning some firms and industries as sustainability champions could lead to conflicts of interest and tensions for Sepa, if it had to crack down on pollution offences by that company or had to help adjudicate if a sector champion, say a fishfarm, wanted to open a new site or expand in a sensitive area.</p> <p>A\u2019Hearn said Sepa \u201cwon\u2019t hesitate\u201d in telling a firm that wants to expand that it can\u2019t do so if it fails to protect the environment. \u201cI don\u2019t see any tension at all if we do it properly,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The opening passage of any sustainable growth agreement would ensure the business agrees to meet all compliance standards at all times. \u201cIf it becomes clear that they\u2019re not willing to sign up to those, it\u2019s clear then that they\u2019re not best performers. I will be eyeballing CEO\u2019s to test that,\u201d he insisted.</p> <ul> <li>A reference to the Welsh environment agency was removed from this story on 9 August 2016.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>The United Nations is now 70 years old. And the world of 70 years ago was a vastly different place to the world of today. Global geo-politics is in the middle of its third great transformation since the last global war: from 40 years of cold war, to what now seems to have been the 20 year temporary peace that followed the fall of the Soviet Union, to the current period of growing geo-political instability between the US and Russia, the US and China and the now the deepening strategic engagement between China and Russia.</p> <p>Geo-economics has also radically changed from a post-war global economy dominated by the US, to one where global economic power is split between the US, China and Europe, and where China\u2019s economic century has barely begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/kevin-rudd-outlines-10-point-plan-to-reform-un-in-response-to-globalisation\">Kevin Rudd outlines 10-point plan to reform UN in response to globalisation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And against all this fundamental change in the deep underpinnings of the order itself, the need for global collaboration is at an all-time high as we strive to respond to the \u201cglobalisation\u201d of everything, from global financial instability, to the rise of global terrorism, the explosion in global people movements and the planetary imperatives from climate change. The common refrain from foreign ministries around the world is that at a time when the demand for effective global governance is on the rise, the supply of such governance appears to be in decline. Instead, we are beginning to see a fragmentation of the order itself.</p> <p>The question arises, therefore, whether this post-war institution called the UN remains \u201cfit for purpose\u201d to meet the needs of the international community for the century unfolding before us. And if not, what can be done in practical terms to bring its mission, structure and resourcing up to date to meet the formidable challenges ahead.</p> <p>The bottom line is that despite its many detractors, the UN matters. In fact, because it is such an embedded part of the post-war order, it matters a lot. So much so that if it was to fail, falter or just fade away, it would further erode the stability of an already fragile global order.</p> <p>But because the UN has become such a \u201cfactored in\u201d component of the international order after 70 years, we are barely conscious of the continuing stabilising role it plays in setting the broad parameters for the conduct of international relations. We tend to take the UN for granted. We see it as a comfortable part of the international furniture. A given.</p> <p>But as history reminds us, nothing is forever, least of all the durability of global institutions whose history is recent and where the precedents are fraught. If the UN one day disappears, or more likely just slides into neglect, it is only then that we would become fully aware of the gaping hole this would leave in what remained of the post-war order. Without the UN, we would be left with increasingly brittle \u201cstate-on-state\u201d relationships, with little remaining to mediate, negotiate or resolve inter-state crises when they arise. By which time it would simply be too late to lament the UN\u2019s demise.</p> <p>The UN has many core strengths. It has unmatched international legal legitimacy under the terms of the UN Charter and the sovereign equality of states. It is capable therefore of speaking with a universal voice, unmatched by any other institution. It sets global norms through a vast array of international treaty law. It possesses a unique global convening power to deal with the challenges of the day. It can take global initiatives in its own name and demonstrate global leadership. It has a unique power to initiate lawful collective security action to preserve international peace and security. It is also empowered to deliver economic and social programs to enhance social justice and environmental sustainability. These powers are impossible to replicate, and they stand separate to the many successes and failures the UN has been associated with over the decades.</p> <p>Those of us who are proud to be life-long friends of the UN today will defend the institution to the hilt. But The uncomfortable truth is that while the UN today is not broken, it is in trouble. The danger is that it is starting to drift into irrelevance as states increasingly \u201cwalk around\u201d the UN on the most important questions facing the international community, seeking substantive solutions elsewhere, increasingly seeing the UN as a pleasant diplomatic afterthought. </p> <p>We see this, for example on the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, terrorism, cyber security, global pandemics, and refugees. There is a reason for this. The UN, like many old institutions both national and international, is being overwhelmed by the major systemic changes and challenges now buffeting the international community at large. But this is compounded by the fact that UN has a 20th century institutional structure and culture, struggling to adapt to new 21st century realities. And the common concern for those who care about the institution\u2019s future is that if it fails to adapt, the UN is likely to slowly slide into the shadowlands.</p> <p>This need not be the case. The UN is capable of re-inventing itself. All 21st century institutions must do this in order to survive the pace and complexity of change around them. There is no point dreaming utopian dreams that the UN could be rebuilt from the ground up. But we can make what we already have work much better.</p> <ol> <li>We need a UN which structurally integrates its peace and security, sustainable development, humanitarian and human rights agendas as a strategic continuum, rather than leaving them as the self-contained, institutional silos of the past. This reflects the \u201cjoined-up\u201d realities which the UN now has to deal with on the ground. This integrated approach to UN missions must occur both at the centre of UN operations, and in the field.<br></li> <li>We need a UN with a robust policy planning capability looking into the future several years out, not just at the crises of the day;</li> <li>We need a UN which embraces a comprehensive doctrine of prevention, rather than just reaction, which is directly reflected in the organisation\u2019s leadership structure, culture and resources. The guiding principles of the future must be anticipation, planning and prevention, rather than a culture of simple reaction, \u201cband aid\u201d solutions, and fingers crossed.</li> <li>We need equally a UN with a comprehensive ready-reaction capability, both as an effective provider of security stabilisation and emergency humanitarian support, to deal with crises which erupt without warning.</li> <li>We need a UN which attaches first priority of field operations over head office. The UN of the future will be judged on its performance in the field in saving lives and transforming life opportunities for the world. The UN\u2019s performance will not be judged by the number of reports that are written. In fact, the UN writes too many.</li> <li>We need a \u201cTeam UN\u201d which finally resolves the problem of its rigid institutional silos by moving increasingly to integrated, multi-disciplinary teams to deal with specific challenges on the ground, and driven by fully-empowered directors of local UN operations in each country;</li> <li>We need a UN driven by the measurement of real results on the ground, rather the elegance of our processes in the conference hall;</li> <li>We need a UN which attaches a new priority to the principle of \u201cWe the People\u201d by developing, at scale, global partnerships and compacts with civil society and the private sector. The UN has embarked on an approach of gradually developing these. It must now proceed at pace. Otherwise we will fail in the delivery of the sustainable development goals under Agenda 2030, which cannot be delivered in the absence of unleashing large-scale private finance. Global public finance is but a drop in the ocean of what is needed. This new partnership philosophy must also be integrated at the highest levels of UN management and, once again, across the traditional silos. And this can be done while maintaining the centrality of the UN member-states, and their policy priorities, in the process.</li> <li>We need a UN where women are at the centre of the totality of its agenda, not just parts of it, so that their full human potential can be realised as a matter of social justice, and because to fail to do so will further undermine peace, security, development and human rights. We also need a UN where the youth of the world have their voices heard at the centre of the UN\u2019s councils, not simply as some sort of paternalistic afterthought, so that youth can help shape a future of genuine hope for the billions of people today aged under 25.</li> <li>And we need a UN that can operate efficiently, effectively, and flexibly, within the inevitable fiscal limitations of the future, rather than one that assumes that constrained national budgets are likely to loosen up any time soon.</li> </ol> <p>These 10 basic principles are not exactly rocket science. Nor do they address every institutional and policy challenge faced by the UN system today. They do, however, provide some guide for the continuing reform of the <em>management</em> of the UN system in the future. Many fine reform programs have been launched in the past, including by the current secretary general. But it is the responsibility of each generation to think afresh on the mega-changes and challenges of our own time. And this responsibility will fall principally on the shoulders of the next UN secretary general, whoever she or he may be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/05/kevin-rudd-says-malcolm-turnbulls-rejection-of-un-bid-a-monstrous-intrusion\">Kevin Rudd says Malcolm Turnbull's rejection of UN bid a 'monstrous intrusion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is also the task I have sought to address over the last two years as the chair of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism, established by the International Peace Institute in September 2014.

But I offer these reflections, and more substantively the report I will soon release, to the next SG, her or his staff, the UN secretariat, and most importantly the UN member states, for their consideration. </p> <p>The slow, but steady decline of the UN, and the wider multilateral system which has the UN as its foundation, would be catastrophic for an increasingly unstable world. The peoples of the world, in one way or another, are increasingly asking the question: \u201cIs anybody in control anymore?\u201d when they see growing disagreement among the great powers, the re-emergence of old inter-state conflicts, terrorists on their streets, chaos in their markets, and jobs disappearing with nothing to replace them. People are questioning whether we are beginning to see the beginning of a deeper crisis in the foundations of the overall post-war order itself.</p> <p>I remain a life-long UN supporter, advocate and optimist. But the time for deep UN reform is now. Otherwise, the UN will, in the decades ahead, not die, but quietly fade away, the facade of a once grand building but where, on closer inspection, little of substance actually happens anymore. And that would an avoidable tragedy for us all, large states and in particular small, signalling the end of what remains a core pillar of our post-world order. </p>",
  "<p>The revelation that some building materials imported to Australia are contaminated with asbestos shows the fight to eradicate this deadly mineral is not only far from over, it cannot be limited by national boundaries, particularly when we live in a global economy.</p> <p>Australian authorities have put a hold on Yuanda China building materials after <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-14/asbestos-found-in-perth-childrens-hospital-roof-panels/7628108\">asbestos was discovered</a> in some of its supplies to two major construction projects, including \u2013 of all places \u2013 at the Perth Children\u2019s Hospital.</p> <p>As someone who has spent my entire career seeking justice for those afflicted by the awful diseases associated with asbestos and witnessing first-hand its devastating effect on families, it\u2019s hard to quantify how deeply frustrating and concerning it is to read that these contaminated products are slipping through our borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/05/peter-dutton-denounced-for-suggesting-import-of-asbestos-is-cfmeus-fault\">Peter Dutton denounced for suggesting import of asbestos is CFMEU's fault</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But despite that deep disappointment, I must admit these revelations haven\u2019t come as a complete surprise. After all, China and India are among the top five producers of asbestos in the world.</p> <p>For many of our neighbours, asbestos remains an accessible and cheap building material \u2013 two particularly attractive features when a country is in the grip of rapid development and industrialisation. India, China, Indonesia and Thailand are all importing asbestos at a phenomenal rate with devastating consequences for its workers and people.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation estimates a staggering 125 million people around the world are exposed to asbestos in the workplace each year. And as dreadful as that figure is, in reality it\u2019s probably much greater since asbestos has such an insidious reach.</p> <p>The Australian experience has shown exposure can occur through washing contaminated clothing, home renovation and demolition or even when children play in poorly disposed building products. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/-sp-mr-fluffy-cancerous-legacy-canberra\">\u201cMr Fluffy\u201d saga </a>was another reminder that we treat asbestos casually at our peril.</p> <p>So when we superimpose this picture of so-called \u201cbystander\u201c exposure on to the World Health Organisation\u2019s statistics we\u2019re looking at a phenomenon of catastrophic proportions for decades to come.</p> <p>While Australia stopped using asbestos in building materials in the 1980s, it was only 13 years ago that we banned it entirely. It took years of campaigning and the repeated airing of the tragic individual stories of disease and death before we reached that goal.</p> <p>Clearly, the recent revelation about contaminated imports raises questions about the resourcing of our relevant agencies. An independent review of Australia\u2019s asbestos border controls is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/no-time-to-stop-imports-of-asbestos-border-guards/news-story/e3e4cf6843655dfd9e79f6c699ca6475\">calling for prosecutions to be pursued more vigorously</a> and more information to be given to the suppliers. It also found that Australian Border Force did not have the \u201ctime and resources\u201d to stop asbestos slipping through our borders.</p> <p>But once we strengthen procedures for testing imports and reiterate the Australian asbestos ban to overseas exporters, what next? Surely it\u2019s time to turn our attention to helping the campaign to bring a world-wide end to the mining and the use of asbestos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/04/asbestos-deregulation-australia\">Asbestos: who is accountable when things go wrong?  | Dominic Kelly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, there have been a number of efforts to bring about such change from global organisations, including the World Health Organisation. But these campaigns are still nascent and will no doubt need the persuasive power that comes with direct diplomatic and trade relations between governments. It\u2019s time for all our domestic stakeholders from government and business through to the union movement and medical and legal experts to help local campaigners in their fight.</p> <p>The key will be not only convincing our neighbouring governments that it is both cruel and uneconomical in the long term to allow asbestos use to continue, but that there are safer substitutes. This will require the efforts of many more than Australia, but we owe it to our citizens and our neighbours in the South East Asian region to push for this change.</p> <p>Sadly, it is not yet time to rest easy when it comes to asbestos. The use of asbestos is far from a legacy issue \u2013 tragically, it will remain a critical public health issue in our region for many years to come and that means it\u2019s an issue Australia can\u2019t afford to ignore</p>"
