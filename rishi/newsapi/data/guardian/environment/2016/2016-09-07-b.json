  "<p><br>In the wake of the spectacular Democratic convention it seems unreasonable even to hint at the possibility that Donald Trump might win. Such speeches! Such enthusiasm! Such ideals! Such drama and emotion! Such a pseudo-event!</p> <p>But a woman nominee \u2013 such a moment. And one to make Trumpland look ridiculous. Even that old lizard Bill Clinton was poignant in his way.<br></p> <p> But Bill Clinton is the author of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the president who ended Glass\u2013Steagall, the 1933 act that prohibited banks from engaging in the investment business. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton is going to the fight with Trump on a promise to at least look again at Nafta and reintroduce an equivalent to Glass\u2013Steagall to keep the banks in line. Thanks to Bernie Sanders, that\u2019s in the platform. So is a resolution to break up the banks that Congress bailed out \u2013 and didn\u2019t punish for their sins. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/emotion-watching-hillary-clinton-woman-candidate-for-president\">Hillary Clinton's speech was a powerful, primal first \u2013 and it blew me away | Xeni Jardin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hillary is also now committed to scuttling the Trans Pacific Partnership, which her new pal President Obama badly wants because it\u2019s a big part of his geopolitics. Hillary Clinton has a platform that really isn\u2019t hers. The Democrats are proceeding as one party, but in truth there are now two \u2013 one subscribes to neoliberalism and the other foreshadows its demise \u2013 and she has to represent both of them. Philadelphia was a beautiful and moving thing, and Democrats can only hope that all those tears of joy and love were enough to wash away the contradictions.</p> <p> This might be unfair. Whether she was driven there by Bernie Sanders or has chosen to renew her old Methodist vows to the poor and meek, Clinton is running on a progressive ticket now, and she might decide to make that the colour of her presidency. She promises to invest heavily in the cities to lift people out of poverty; to invest in infrastructure, create jobs, revive manufacturing and raise the minimum wage. The platform promises comprehensive immigration reform, an end to student debt, paid family leave and much else. It <em>is</em><em> </em>very likely what Sanders said it was \u2013 the most progressive platform in the party\u2019s history.</p> <p> Listening to her now, you might think that after years as a member of the supply-side economics church, Hillary Clinton\u2019s joined the revived and steadily expanding demand-side one. Could she in eight years reverse the engines of inequality and corruption, bridge the divides and enliven the democracy? Could she desegregate the cities? </p> <p>Could she get her country leading the world by example to save the planet from global warming? Could she do something about the lobbyists, the power of money in Washington that is destroying American democracy from within? Take on Wall Street? Make the effort on behalf of public decency and ordinary justice that was not made after the financial collapse? Could she get the public interest represented in Washington again? </p> <p>Could she do something about guns? In Chicago on the Memorial Day weekend, sixty-nine people were shot. Six died. As of 1 August, 401 people had been murdered in that one city in 2016, 90% of them with guns.</p> <p> Are <em>any</em><em> </em>of these things open to remedy? Probably not: the problems run too deep, but the effort would be uplifting and a more productive way to prove her country is exceptional than anything she might have in mind for bloodying foreign noses.</p> <p> Could she get American troops out of Afghanistan, the fifteen-year war she mentioned not once in her acceptance speech in Philadelphia? That might be the most unlikely of all.</p> <p> Nothing she says, old or new, will much impress voters who don\u2019t trust the Clintons, or think they reek of entitlement, lies and money. The hole she\u2019s punched in the glass ceiling won\u2019t impress them. But the prospect of Hillary and Bill back in the White House might lift their loathing into realms of mania. It will feel like the ultimate corruption, the ultimate insult, the ultimate proof that the system stinks.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to share this point of view to understand it. At the very least, her supporters could ask themselves what <em>they</em><em> </em>would be making of the $153m in speaking fees or the $1.8m she collected from speeches to the banks, if they were pinned to Donald Trump \u2013 or to Mitt Romney or John McCain. Ditto the emails. The reasonable fear is that Hillary Clinton will be tempted to pacify the haters by the military expression of exceptionalism.</p> <p> Clinton just <em>has</em><em> </em>to win. If she loses, not only does the world get Donald Trump (and the US Supreme Court his appointments): the Democrats will have to live forever with their decision to make their nominee the most qualified presidential candidate in history, but also the person most disliked by the American public and possibly the only one that Trump could beat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson\">This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p> We can hope that from her example great numbers of American women will draw inspiration, and believe that both wisdom and opportunity will deepen with their influence on public life. It should have been a moment of pure celebration, seeing Elizabeth Warren on the hustings with Clinton early in June. But you could feel the hackles rising on every neck in every bar in every swing state across the country. Warren mocking Trump, trading insults \u2013 and the guys in the bar think she\u2019s mocking <em>them</em><em> </em>and make a little resolution and write it inside their hats \u2013 \u201cVote this time.\u201d The triumph of one identity is the violation of another.</p> <p> Trump says, Hand your fear over to me. Hand your loathing over too. I will deal with your enemies as I have dealt with mine. I will give you back your freedom, and your country. Your old lives will be yours to live again. I will halt the terminal decline. American exceptionalism, in which you all hold shares, will be underwritten by an exceptional American.</p> <p> The Democrats scoff at Trump for wanting to take the country back to the past. But for many of the people whose votes will count in November, Trump\u2019s imaginary past is a more concrete thing to contemplate than the Democrats\u2019 imaginary present. Trump\u2019s also contains more hope, and it serves as a more believable American tomorrow. If, as seems likely, Clinton wins, it will not be out of love, or even hope, but rather out of fear. She can win by simply letting her deplorable opponent lose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f0255fd56edd51768f47b90182ee42e4ed20442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f0255fd56edd51768f47b90182ee42e4ed20442/0_0_1972_2764/713.jpg\" alt=\"Quarterly Essay Enemy Within by Don Watson\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quarterly Essay Enemy Within by Don Watson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quarterly Essay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, she\u2019s nothing if not adaptable, and she could yet see in these very favourable circumstances (the Republicans falling apart, negligible interest rates, a public appetite for radical reform) the chance to lead the nation\u2019s social and economic regeneration through, for a start, massive investment in education, renewable energy and infrastructure, and an equally massive legislative attack on inequality and political corruption. </p> <p>Call it a New Great Awakening or a New New Deal; it would owe something to both, and to Bernie Sanders as well, but also to her need to be more than the first woman president.

  "<p> Almost one in three clergy and lay members of the Church of England\u2019s ruling body have signed a letter to bishops urging them to unequivocally welcome lesbian and gay Christians into the church.</p> <p>Bishops are meeting on Monday to discuss what the church should do following two years of internal debate about sexuality, an issue that has caused deep divisions and threats of splits.<br></p> <p>The College of Bishops\u2019 meeting comes days after Nicholas Chamberlain became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/nicholas-chamberlain-bishop-of-grantham-c-of-e-gay-relationship\">first bishop to publicly declare he was gay</a> and in a relationship. Meanwhile, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/03/conservative-anglicans-appointment-of-gay-bishop-a-major-error\">increasing number of clergy are marrying same-sex partners</a> in defiance of church rules.<br></p> <p>Conservatives within the C of E fear a de facto change of attitude by the church to people in same-sex relationships, in what they see as an unacceptable dilution of traditional teaching.<br></p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://anglicanmainstream.org/open-letter-from-72-members-of-general-synod-to-the-college-and-house-of-bishops/\">72 conservatives signed a letter</a> to bishops warning against any proposals that could leave the church \u201cadrift from her apostolic inheritance\u201d and lead to an \u201cunwanted fracture\u201d within the C of E and global Anglican church.</p> <p> This week\u2019s pro-LGBTI open letter, which gathered 131 signatures, is cautiously worded but urges bishops to \u201chelp lead us forward\u201d with a \u201csense of urgency and sensitivity\u201d.</p> <p>It calls on the College of Bishops to be \u201cunequivocal in its acknowledgement that all, including those who identify as LGBTI, are essential to the health and future of our church and mission to the wider world\u201d.<br></p> <p>The signatories are among 430 clergy and lay members of the C of E synod (there are also 52 bishops represented on the ruling body). The letter\u2019s supporters come from 38 out 42 dioceses, include three deans and eight archdeacons and \u2013 according to the organisers \u2013 represent all traditions within the church.<br></p> <p>Another seven synod members said they supported the letter but did not add their names because they had not taken part in the closed-door discussions on sexuality at the July meeting.<br></p> <p>Jayne Ozanne, a lay synod member from Oxford who helped organise the letter, said the response had been overwhelming. \u201cIt definitely seems that the tide is now finally turning. From conversations I have had it would appear that many synod members were deeply challenged and moved by the [internal] discussions in July, and it seems that there is a growing consensus for the church to take active steps towards ensuring it is welcoming and inclusive of all.\u201d</p> <p>David Ison, the dean of St Paul\u2019s, who was also involved in gathering signatures for the letter, said the status quo was not an option. \u201cI believe that there\u2019s a growing consciousness across the church that our response to lay and ordained LGBTI Christians cannot stay as it is. We need far greater honesty and transparency with one another, and to ensure that all LGBTI people are welcomed and affirmed by a church called to share the redeeming love of Christ with all.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the letter, Nicholas Holtam, the bishop of Salisbury, said: \u201cIt is not surprising that the bishops are receiving letters from all sides in advance of our meeting next week. We are in a long process, seeking the way forward together. This letter is encouraging of that process, both in content and the number of signatories. It is a very welcome and supportive contribution.\u201d<br></p> <p>Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said he was glad to receive the letter. \u201cIt was especially good to recognise the signatures of synod colleagues from many of the different traditions that make up our richly diverse church,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/senior-bishop-change-church-of-england-attitudes-gay-people\">Bayes called for far-reaching change</a> in the church\u2019s attitudes to lesbians and gay people, saying his views had been \u201cprofoundly changed\u201d by his encounters with same-sex couples, including within his own family.<br></p> <p>A C of E spokesperson said no final decisions were expected to be made by bishops next week. Through the process of internal discussions \u2013 known as shared conversations \u2013 which involved more than 1,300 people, \u201cdeep convictions have been shared and profound differences better understood. That process will inform discussions at the meeting of the college of bishops and further meetings in the months ahead\u201d.<br></p>",

  "<p>Just over 50 years ago this month birdwatchers along the east coast of Britain witnessed one of the most extraordinary ornithological events ever recorded. Early in September 1965 tens of thousands of migrating songbirds were swept across the North Seaand landed all along the Suffolk coast. The event, called the <a href=\"https://www.britishbirds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Davis-1966.pdf\">Great Fall</a>, was down to unexpected and extreme weather.</p> <p>Every autumn songbirds such as warblers, flycatchers and chats migrate south in their millions from Scandinavia, along the coasts of Germany and the Low Countries, and head to Africa. </p> <p>The birds in that autumn of 1965 had left their breeding grounds in perfect conditions. There were clear skies and there was a light following wind. But as they flew south across the North Sea things started to go wrong. They flew straight into a deep depression with south-easterly winds, thick cloud and driving rain. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/13/songbird-migration\">Songbird migration tracked for the first time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of these birds would have been undertaking their very first migratory journey, having only hatched a couple of months before. For them, inexperience was their downfall: they fell exhausted into the sea and perished. The tougher, more experienced, birds managed to press on, and eventually they made landfall, exhausted too, on Britain\u2019s coasts. </p> <p>One observer counted an astonishing 30,000 birds along a stretch of Suffolk coast less than three miles long.

  "<p>Today is Equal Pay Day. It marks the amount of extra time since the end of the financial year it has taken women to earn the same amount as men, based on Australia\u2019s gender pay gap of 16.2%. This year it took women an extra 69 days to catch up. </p> <p>As a society we haven\u2019t made much headway in closing the gender pay gap which has hovered between 15% and 19% for decades. It\u2019s been over 30 years since the Sex Discrimination Act 1984<em> </em>made it illegal to pay a woman less than her male counterparts for the same work. </p> <p>Since then, we\u2019ve seen the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of apartheid and Australia\u2019s first female prime minister. Yet the gender pay gap persists. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/datablog/2016/aug/27/jennifer-lawrence-and-melissa-mccarthy-make-big-money-but-men-still-make-more\">Jennifer Lawrence and Melissa McCarthy make big money \u2013 but men still make more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gender pay gap is <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/what-gender-pay-gap\">currently 16.2%</a> as calculated by the ABS. That number is based on a comparison of the full time-equivalent earnings of men and women, taking part time work into account. A few factors help to explain it, including a lack of women in senior positions, differences in education and experience and old fashioned discrimination. </p> <p>Geography plays a role: pay is more equal in the ACT, where the pay gap is 10.7%, than in Western Australia, where it\u2019s 23.9%. The pay gap differs between industries as well. For instance, it\u2019s much worse in finance (30%) than in retail (11.5%). </p> <p>A more complex obstacle is the fact that some industries and occupations are simply paid more. Historically, female-dominated industries such as teaching or social assistance have been paid less than male dominated ones like mining or banking. </p> <p>Australia has some of the world\u2019s best data on pay equity, collected by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). That data has already shown that when bonuses, superannuation and other perks are taken into account, the pay gap rises to 24.7%. </p> <p>There is currently little reliable data in Australia about the pay gap for women of colour or women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Overseas, evidence suggests the pay gap for those women is much worse. We do know that for Indigenous women, <a href=\"https://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/hilda/Bibliography/Working_Discussion_Research_Papers/2015/Howlett_etal_Unpacking_the_income_Indigenous_non-Indigenous_WorkingPaper99__Gray_Hunter.pdf\">data from 2011</a> shows that the pay gap is around 33%. </p> <p>The University of Queensland Women\u2019s Collective illustrated this earlier this year with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/06/the-feminist-cupcake-sale-that-led-us-into-the-darkest-depths-of-gender-inequality\">Feminist Week \u201cgender pay gap\u201d bake sale</a> which charged students differently based on their (statistically) likely future earnings. </p> <p>These issues may seem intractable, but the Greens have a simple proposal to make a start: abolish pay gag clauses. Last week, I reintroduced a bill to make sure workers can\u2019t be punished for talking to each other about their pay. </p> <p>We know that one of the best ways to end inequality is to throw light on it. Our <a href=\"http://larissa-waters.greensmps.org.au/content/blog/fixing-gender-pay-gap-ending-pay-gag-clauses\">bill will ban pay gag clauses</a> and make existing gag clauses unenforceable. </p> <p>It would make sure that workers are allowed to tell their colleagues what they are paid if they wish to, without fear of retaliation from their boss. The proposed new law would not force anyone to discuss their pay but it would make sure that bosses could not pressure their employees to stay quiet.</p> <p>I experienced this first hand in my very first job at a commercial law firm where the guy sitting next to me was earning $5,000 more than I was. We were doing exactly the same job and we had equal experience since we were both fresh out of university \u2013 where I had got better marks than him! I never would have guessed there was any difference in our pay unless he\u2019d let his salary slip in a casual conversation.</p> <p>Evidence has shown that pay secrecy can help hide discrimination, unconscious bias and bad decision making, such as where two people are paid differently for doing the same job. Pay transparency makes sure employers have to justify pay decisions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/07/why-does-womens-rights-movement-marginalise-women-with-disabilities-nidhi-goyal\">Why does the women's rights movement marginalise women with disabilities? | Nidhi Goyal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When pay is set in secret by individual negotiation, women are at a disadvantage.

  "<p>The fight for democracy in Africa is, these days, centred on the tiny, oil-rich country of&#xa0;Gabon. It is not a new fight, by any means. In 2009, after the death of longtime leader Omar Bongo \u2013 who had ruled the former French colony for more than 40 years \u2013 riots broke out in several cities when it was announced that his son, Ali Bongo, was slated to become the next president. Opposition leaders called foul after presidential election results were announced, and they attempted to organise a nationwide strike. Now, seven years on, Ali Bongo has run up against a new, wider wave of protests, after he claimed he had won re-election, on 27 August, with a lead of just over 5,000 votes in a nation of 1.8&#xa0;million. Street clashes with police led to several deaths. Opposition supporters set fire to the parliament building. Yet Mr Bongo remains defiant. He has accused his critics of attempting a coup and he has rejected calls for a recount of votes and even for election results to be published in detail. At one point he had his main opponent, Jean Ping, who says the election is being stolen, placed under house arrest. There were also government efforts to impose a media blackout, including by cutting off the internet. The situation on the streets has since eased, but tensions still run high in this central African country.</p> <p>Gabon\u2019s crisis is watched closely by France and neighbouring African states. France has a key military base as well as important economic interests in the region and has called for a recount, but it wants to be careful not to appear to meddle directly for fear of being accused of neocolonial reflexes. Whether outside mediation can help resolve a situation where two men, Mr Bongo and Mr Ping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/both-sides-in-gabon-presidential-election-claim-victory-ahead-of-count\" title=\"\">both claim to be the legally elected president</a> will now be put to the test: the African Union announced this week that it would send a delegation to Gabon.</p> <p>None of this is made easier by the complex web of family ties that have long stood at the heart of Gabonese politics. Mr Ping, 73 years old, a former president of the African Union commission, was one of Omar Bongo\u2019s closest and longest-serving ministers and married one of his daughters. He now describes Gabon as \u201ca dictatorship pure and simple, run by a clan\u201d \u2013 a \u201cdynastic regime\u201d that must be ended. But there is hardly any doubt that he has solid reasons to complain about vote manipulation. A mission of European Union observers <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gabon-election-election-idUSKCN11C112?il=0\" title=\"\">said there were \u201cobvious anomalies\u201d</a>. Mr Ping hopes international pressure will bear down on Mr Bongo, who clearly believes time is on his side because no external player is ready to consider anything like outright intervention.</p> <p>Many of Gabon\u2019s citizens certainly want its political course to change. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/16/gabon-yawning-poverty-gap-end-dependency-oil\" title=\"\">population is poor</a> and the economy has slumped with the fall of global oil prices. Families struggle for food day to day. Mr Bongo\u2019s rule has been tainted by many allegations of corruption, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/06/france-africa-autocrats-corruption-inquiry\" title=\"\">not least the ownership of luxury cars and apartments in Paris</a>. Gabon has only had three presidents since its independence in 1960. Mr Bongo, 57, may have tried to project the image of a younger leader, but his repressive methods are fast placing him in the same category as other strongmen who hang on to power as if mandates were for life. The unrest that has broken out reflects deep-seated popular anger. Gabon\u2019s civil society, like those elsewhere in Africa, wants its voice to be heard, and democratic procedures to be respected. The votes should be recounted.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Colin Green (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/pope-should-know-that-resisting-birth-control-is-bad-for-the-environment\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 7 September) makes a classic first-world myopic error in believing that the rise in human population is mainly responsible for the impending ecological crisis. It is not numbers of people per se damaging the planet, but frenetic consumption in the wealthy world that lies behind anthropogenic climate change. You can curb family sizes in poor countries all you like \u2013 if you have the moral stomach for such gross colonialism and denial of essential human freedoms \u2013 but the ecological crisis will remain as long as we live the way we do in the rich world.</p> <p>As Pope Francis puts it in his ecological teaching document, Laudato Si\u2019: \u201cTo&#xa0;blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalised, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.\u201d</p> <p>He does not, however, deny population is a factor in the environment, noting that \u201cattention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations\u201d. But the general point is clear: you do not heal the damage to the planet by eliminating the poor. As Francis says: \u201ca true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.\u201d<br><strong>Dr Austen Ivereigh</strong><br><em>Coordinator, Catholic Voices</em></p> <p>\u2022 While I am enthused by Pope Francis\u2019s recent calls for environmental destruction to be classified as a sin (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/pope-francis-calls-on-christians-to-embrace-green-agenda\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 1 September), I do wonder if a more nuanced perspective is required. Is it right to classify certain behaviours that cause ecological harm as sin, if there is a lack of knowledge, capacity and choice to take alternative, more environmentally friendly courses of action?</p> <p>For example, is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to&#xa0;drive my gas-guzzling car in the city because of an absence of safe and coordinated cycle infrastructure? Is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to deal with the vast amounts of waste forced upon me by retailers? Or if I depend on oil because alternatives are not provided, or are too expensive? Perhaps the sin lies not with the individual, but instead with the failure by government and policymakers to adequately inform on the issues, and provide structures and incentives for pro-environmental behaviour.<br><strong>Catherine Devitt</strong><br><em>Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, Dublin </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

These small fibers aren\u2019t easily filtered out at local wastewater treatment plants. The study, funded by outdoor clothing company Patagonia, found that up to 40% of these small fibers land up in oceans, rivers and lakes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/31/fish-plastic-pollution-ocean-environment-seafood\">threatening wildlife and ultimately our food chain.</a></p> <p>Synthetic fibers such as acrylic, polyester and nylon pose the most danger because they don\u2019t disintegrate and disappear over time. Instead, they break down into smaller, increasingly toxic pieces, allowing them to be consumed by fish and other animals. These tiny fibers have the potential to build up and lead to a potentially poisonous accumulation of chemicals in larger species. <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b04026?journalCode=esthag&amp;\">A study from the University of Exeter</a> found that crabs contaminated with microfibers ate less food and that the polypropylene plastic broke into smaller pieces when ingested, leading to a greater spread in the body \u2013 and consequently a greater threat to human health.</p> <p>Clothing companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/27/toxic-plastic-synthetic-microscopic-oceans-microbeads-microfibers-food-chain\">have been slow to lend their support to the issue</a>, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\">that\u2019s starting to change</a>.

According to PSF, nearly 40 fashion brands have agreed to collaborate as part of the partnership with Parley. The brands involved will be announced during a Call to Action event early next year.</p> <p>PSF and Parley will work with other organizations to launch a competition next year to encourage scientists, inventors and clothing makers to come up with ways to stop the release of microfibers in the wash. The winners will be announced in 2018, and will receive a cash prize to implement their ideas.</p> <p>According to PSF and Parley, possible solutions to the issue include a mechanical filter in washing machines to catch tiny fibers, synthetic yarns and fabrics that don\u2019t release fibers in the wash and environmentally safe coatings that prevent microfibers from releasing when rinsed.</p>",
  "<p>In 1797 Patrick Colquhoun was worried about pawnbrokers. Colquhoun, a Glaswegian merchant and magistrate, had co-founded a soup kitchen in London that aimed to \u201calleviate distress\u201d among working families. Colquhoun believed that the provision of nutritious and healthy soups would not simply assuage immediate hunger. He hoped it would also lessen the dependence of working people on pawnbrokers. Unemployment, sickness or the death of breadwinners often obliged the poor to borrow money from shady lenders. Sometimes they pawned the very tools they needed to work. Colquhoun was shocked by the extortionate interest rates charged by pawnbrokers. This was particularly the case with short-term loans, which he believed were very common among working people. He calculated that a loan of 3&#xa0;pence could accrue an interest rate of 850% if it was renewed weekly.</p> <p>Colquhoun would be horrified to learn that in 2014 the payday lender Wonga offered loans at a rate of nearly 6,000%. Despite efforts to limit interest rates and ban advertising, the difficult economic circumstances faced by many Britons continue to provide a fertile environment for parasitic lending practices. Wonga\u2019s own website describes an <a href=\"https://www.wonga.com/how-it-works\" title=\"\">interest rate of 1,509% as \u201crepresentative\u201d</a>. This week the financial ombudsman reported a surge in complaints about payday loans (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/06/financial-ombudsman-still-receiving-thousands-of-ppi-complaints\" title=\"\">Report</a>, theguardian.com, 6 September). Wonga\u2019s parent company was the subject of 821. Interest rates for the very poor have gone from 850% in 1797 to 1,509% today.

And secondly the fact the firm rejected Chairman Dr Keith Hellawell\u2019s resignation. Shareholders have long felt that the firm is held too tightly under Mike Ashley\u2019s grip and Chairman Hellawell has been unable to wield the sufficient power needed to make the radical changes required.

  "<p>It has been a bad few months for Islamic State (Isis). For the first time since the terror group laid claim to much of Iraq and Syria, it no longer has a direct path to Europe. Black flags are no longer flying over towns and villages near the Turkish border and the militants of the so-called caliphate are on the run. If the decay continues, Isis will soon lose much of its remaining foothold in Syria. Its last bastion will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/life-under-isis-raqqa-mosul-giant-prison-syria-iraq\">Raqqa</a> and the north-eastern deserts, where it all began for the group\u2019s latest incarnation in April 2013, and from where much of its subsequent rampage was plotted.</p> <p>Since mid-July, Isis has been methodically pushed from towns and villages it controlled near the Turkish frontier by the most concerted ground advance of the past two years. The jihadist group now looks to be far less of a threat to the regional order than when its leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, proclaimed his rule over a swath of eastern Syria and western Iraq in mid-2014.</p> <p>But little about what comes next is clear. The group\u2019s loss of territory has shifted geopolitical ground in ways that could not easily have been predicted. And, in the eyes of many European governments, its danger has metastasised into a global threat that a loss of land won\u2019t mitigate.

From this arc of influence, it created a bulwark against threats from the outside, and a self-sustaining society built on oil revenues, taxes and loot seized from vanquished Iraqi and Syrian forces.</p> <p>Within months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/10/iraq-sunni-insurgents-islamic-militants-seize-control-mosul\">seizing Iraq\u2019s second biggest city, Mosul</a>, in June 2014, Isis had splintered the authority of embattled leaders on both sides of the now-irrelevant border between Iraq and Syria and created a terrifying new form of governance, rooted in an uncompromising reading of Islamic tenets and unchecked savagery. Isis leaders lorded over their gateways such as Manbij and Jarabulus, along the Turkish frontier. Foreign fighters, including some who have since returned to Europe, used the towns as waypoints when they entered the \u201ccaliphate\u201d and when they travelled back to Turkey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47db374434a44f943d75f24b48a8ba9c14d9598d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47db374434a44f943d75f24b48a8ba9c14d9598d/469_0_1291_1291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkish tanks on the road to Jarabulus in August\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkish tanks and armoured vehicles on the road to Jarabulus in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isis lost both in recent weeks.

Jarabulus, however, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/syrian-rebels-reclaim-key-border-town-jarablus-from-islamic-state\">taken in less than 24 hours by the Turkish military</a>, which had made its first full-scale incursion into Syria since the start of the uprising against Bashar al-Assad five years ago.

A bit player for much of the campaign, it now has a lead stake on how the rest of the military offensive is fought and, more essentially, who does the fighting.</p> <p>Arab rebel groups made up of reconfigured units of the anti-Assad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/29/syria-moderate-opposition-president-assad-islamic-state-regime-isis\">Free Syria Army</a> rode in on Turkish tanks to take 680 sq km (420 sq m) of Syria, and are now aiming to consolidate a buffer zone 60km south of the border. Al-Bab, where Isis extremists planned much of the carnage they have wreaked in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul, is now squarely in the invaders\u2019 sights. The US-backed Kurds, meanwhile, have stopped advancing, their ranks thinned by the defection of dozens of Arab fighters who had reluctantly allied with them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/isis_syria_g2_web2/giv-22601vJJCDtzZdmki/\" data-alt=\"How Isis has lost territory in Syria over the past year\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/isis_syria_g2_web2/giv-22601vJJCDtzZdmki/\">How Isis has lost territory in Syria over the past year</a> <figcaption>How Isis has lost territory in Syria over the past year</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The march of the new alliance through Jarabulus has laid bare more of the workings of Isis, a group that has been exposed by a string of defeats, and an estimated 35,000-50,000 battle deaths. \u201cThey created institutions to brainwash the minds of the children, and they have been widely successful,\u201d says Mohammed Hamdan, a local councillor from Jarabulus. \u201cAll the elements of economic life are gone. They forced people to work with them.\u201d</p> <p>In Manbij, as soon as the jihadists fled, local women stripped off full-face coverings and black gowns that had been mandatory under Isis. Schools that had been shuttered were soon being swept out and reopened. People started to smoke again. Men cut off their beards. To do so while the jihadists were there would have led to a flogging \u2013 or worse. In Jarabulus, the ubiquitous black banner that had been painted over government buildings was whitewashed. Markets opened and people again mingled.</p> <p>\u201cIsis used Jarabulus as a starting point for its operations in Turkey,\u201d says Hamdan. \u201cThey used the mosques to advocate brutal killings, which became the dominant theme in recent months. They used mosques to tell people that they were still under control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03944aead58c4d8645a049d329b9304dd40dddab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03944aead58c4d8645a049d329b9304dd40dddab/0_153_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Manbij man having his beard cut off, August 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man celebrates his liberation from the hands of Isis in Manbij by having his beard cut off, August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodi Said/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut tension and worry was obvious. It spread after Isis realised it was going to lose a significant part of strategic territory. Most of the people, whether pro-Isis or not, withdrew from the city towards Maskanah and al-Tabqa and then to Raqqa.\u201d</p> <p>These areas amount to the last redoubt of Isis in Syria and will be the targets of a push later this year. Who gets to do the fighting is, as yet, unclear. The link to the Iraqi strongholds of al-Bukamal, Ba\u2019ej, Tal Afar and Mosul remains viable for now, but in Iraq, as in Syria, the self-styled caliphate is rapidly contracting.</p> <p>In Iraq, an assault on Mosul, which has previously been deemed too difficult, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/kurdish-peshmerga-forces-fresh-push-recapture-mosul-isis-iraq\">now being seen as a reality</a> for early next year. Iraqi forces that fled as the jihadists advanced have been reconfigured and galvanised. \u201cConfidence has emerged from battlefield gains,\u201d says a Baghdad-based US diplomat. \u201cAnd while the Iraqis are feeling better about themselves, Isis is feeling worse. Everywhere they have tried to make a stand in recent times, they have been hosed out. They know it\u2019s near the end.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"27ca930374cc1fb34b7237eb4640d42a31a75d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27ca930374cc1fb34b7237eb4640d42a31a75d47/897_3_3532_3533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of Free Syrian Army stand in front of an Isis mural in Jarabulus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Free Syrian Army stand in front of an Isis mural in Jarabulus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cem \u00d6zdel/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all its blind dogma, the Isis leadership has shown a pragmatism. Control of territory, so vital in the heady early days, is no longer as important to Baghdadi and his senior leaders as controlling populations beyond the caliphate\u2019s fast-shrinking boundaries. \u201cThey have highly intelligent leaders calling the shots, being prepared to sacrifice thousands of lessers who are far less disciplined about how they get around and communicate,\u201d says one western diplomat.</p> <p>Another Isis observer, a security official, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that they have sent people to Europe. We know that they expect some to be caught and they accept that. They have others on the way, or already in place.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris and Brussels plotters returned to Europe after being trained between al-Bab and Raqqa by an Isis cell that had been tasked with causing chaos in the west. Both cells were sent across the border into Turkey and then on a painstaking journey through the continent, tailored to avoid detection.</p> <p>Another Isis figure, a petty criminal from the south-west London suburb of Hammersmith, was also sent on his way to Europe around the same time. His name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/londoner-alexanda-kotey-identified-member-isis-group-jihadi-john\">Aine Lesley Davis</a>, and he was one of a trio of British nationals who brutalised western hostages in Syria in 2013 and 2014.

This week, a Turkish prosecutor released an indictment on Davis, which accused him of crossing the border near Jarabulus and linking with two senior Turkish members of Isis. \u201cTo cross into Turkey, he communicated with \u0130lhami Bal\u0131 (code name Abu Baker) and Necip S\u00fcleyman (Abu Sham Al Ansari), Isis Turkey border \u2018emirs\u2019,\u201d the indictment read. \u201cBal\u0131\u2019s name is linked to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/turkey-suicide-bomb-killed-in-ankara\">Ankara attack in October 2015</a>, which killed more than 100 people.\u201d</p> <p>Emwazi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/us-officials-reasonably-certain-that-raqqa-strike-killed-mohammed-emwazi\">killed by a CIA drone strike</a> in Raqqa five days after Davis was arrested in Istanbul. Kotey\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. And while security officials in Europe believe that much of Isis\u2019s original foreign fighter corps has been killed \u2013 they were seen as dispensable by their leaders \u2013 several hundred have returned to Europe, where they are awaiting instructions from inside Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cThat, in a sense, is the reason why it doesn\u2019t really matter if they lose this land right now,\u201d says the western diplomat. \u201cThey are an even more potent threat than they were a year ago.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6873218747cc60e0e4476e45a1f685f92c0febc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6873218747cc60e0e4476e45a1f685f92c0febc/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed police in Paris during terrorist attack\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could the west be a renewed target after a refocus on terrorist atrocities by Isis?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malte Christians/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The calculation by Isis leaders is that acolytes, fired by some sense of divine purpose, will launch their own attacks, without direct instruction or organisation. Such strikes are increasingly valuable, and damaging to the caliphate\u2019s foes. They are relatively easy to commit, and very difficult to detect.</p> <p>Though fast losing ground, and with morale low in many of their embattled communities, Isis leaders continue to believe that the organisation which first rose out of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 derives considerable potency from Sunni Muslim resentment. The Isis narrative is that Sunnis, the majority Islamic sect, have been stripped of power and influence by western powers who have handed the reins to the minority Shias. They anchor their very contemporary political gripes in an ancient creed, which says that much of this was preordained.</p> <p>An essential sell for Isis leaders to would-be jihadists such as Davis, Kotey and Emwazi is that their generation has the privilege to not only correct recent indignities, but to restore the lost glories of Islam. The withering caliphate is becoming the latest <em>casus belli</em> \u2013 a divine mission to replace the \u201cfalsehood\u201d of the nation state with Islamic rule being stripped away by yet more western aggression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df6302a61ba2160e936615f06a6842dce0bfca3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6302a61ba2160e936615f06a6842dce0bfca3e/0_10_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turkish workers with some of the modular blocks that will form the wall along the Syrian border\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkish workers with some of the modular blocks that will form the wall along the Syrian border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How that aggression takes shape in the coming months will be pivotal to the direction of the war against the jihadists \u2013 and the overall course of the Syrian war. The campaign against Isis had been fought mostly as a subset of the broader war, but has been increasingly drawn into the main conflict.</p> <p>For now, Turkey\u2019s role will continue to be instrumental, its aim \u2013 to keep two Kurdish cantons separated by a 140km (90-mile) gap, in which Arab groups call the shots \u2013 now within reach. Accused of being too slow to react to the threat from Isis, whose ranks were reinforced largely through the then-porous Turkish border, Ankara is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/turkey-syria-border-reinforced-suruc-suicide-attack\">building a wall</a> along much of it.</p> <p>In Iraq, Isis now has just as much trouble securing supply lines outside its strongholds. The border with Syria remains a free-for-all, but offers little to increasingly desperate fighters seeking refuge or escape. The desert frontiers of Saudi Arabia and Jordan are better policed and even more foreboding.</p> <p>\u201cMorale is desperate,\u201d one Isis official tells the Guardian. \u201cEven in Raqqa. But they are very smart. They have made plans for all of this. They are investing a lot in sending their people to Europe, and it won\u2019t be over soon. You\u2019ve seen them throughout their history. Whenever they are being beaten, they lay low. They will come back later.

  "<p>Whatever people think of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters, it\u2019s probably fair to say there is an assumption that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/young-put-jeremy-corbyn-in-now-should-push-him-out\" title=\"\">they are young</a>. That has been the frame since he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\" title=\"\">elected leader of the Labour party</a> a year ago \u2013 the idea that millennials previously turned off by politics were now thronging to the party.</p> <p>Explaining the rise of old white male socialists in politics \u2013 Corbyn in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/jeremy-corbyn-bernie-sanders-young-voters-left\" title=\"\">Bernie Sanders in the US</a> \u2013 the millennial focus makes some sense. Both politicians speak squarely to this young demographic, with policies such as the abolition of university tuition fees, universal healthcare or affordable housing (as Corbyn raised in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/07/pmqs-verdict-theresa-may-new-gag-writer\" title=\"\">today\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions</a>). Both understand that this generation is hobbled by neoliberal policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/my-plea-labour-members-stop-chaos-fight-tories\">My plea to all Labour members and MPs: let\u2019s unite to fight the Tories | Emily Thornberry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But last week\u2019s YouGov <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live\" title=\"\">Labour leadership poll</a> shows that, within the party at least, this isn\u2019t the whole picture. Corbyn has a 61% approval rating among 18- to 24-year-olds, 64% among 25- to 39-year-olds and 63% among 40- to 59-year-olds. Meanwhile, of those who have now joined the Labour campaign group Momentum, only a third of those disclosing their age are millennials. And the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jan/13/the-corbyn-effect-thousands-have-flocked-to-the-labour-party-since-may-but-who-are-they\" title=\"\">Guardian\u2019s own research</a>, speaking with 100 Labour officials across Britain in January, showed that those signing up to the party in their thousands were in fact a mix of young and old, first-time members and returnees.</p> <p>So it seems white-haired democratic socialists also attract supporters from Generation X, those aged 35-50: me, that is. Actor Mark Ruffalo also falls into that demographic. Earlier this year, he interviewed \u201cBernie from Brooklyn\u201d, exploring how the politician\u2019s upbringing in this New York borough shaped his policies. One part of this video interview jumps out: \u201cYou know what you make me feel?\u201d the 48-year-old Ruffalo asks Sanders. \u201cThat all of my ideals as a young person can actually grow up with me.\u201d</p> <p>This, in so many ways, encapsulates the appeal of older leftwing politicians to the over-35s. But we, just like the millennials, are dismissed as naive and unrealistic, and derided by political pundits who insist socialism is dead and that only swing-voter-friendly, centrist politics can win elections, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21695887-centre-left-sharp-decline-across-europe-rose-thou-art-sick\" title=\"\">even while the centre-left as a political force has collapsed across western Europe, from Spain to Greece to the Netherlands</a>.</p> <p>Overusing words such as sensible and pragmatic, the commentariat insists that only a sort of middle England-friendly, marginal seat-focused compromise can walk into No 10. But Generation X felt the ravaging effects of such centrist compromises during New Labour\u2019s 13 years in office, when stealth-privatisation, via PFI, in the NHS and schools, the embrace of a deregulated free market, the failure to support the manufacturing sector and the perpetuation of Tory-style welfare reforms all sucked the life out of public services, while draining the wealth out of the economy.</p> <p>For my generation, the politics proposed by Corbyn are a long-awaited challenge to the assumption of third-way pragmatism as the natural order of things (even as this natural order leads to financial catastrophe and rampant inequality). Corbyn\u2019s approach also punctures the dominance of marketing and spin \u2013 over policies and substance \u2013 that seem to go hand in hand with these supposedly \u201cpragmatic\u201d politics.</p> <p>Meanwhile, older socialist politicians are living rebuttals to the idea that we \u201cgrow out of\u201d leftwing politics. In reality, there is no truth to this: researchers have been unable to show conclusively that we become more conservative as we age. One workable theory is that older, more conservative cohorts polled on political views today came of age during a period of political conservatism: they are simply holding on to a position, not shifting it.</p> <p>If the patronising complaint hurled at millennials is that they are too young to remember the bad days of the old left, my generation does remember. First, we remember that \u201cleft\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cbad\u201d and that left politics do have popular support (just check the figures in support of renationalisation of utilities, for example, or fairer taxation). Meanwhile, we also recall Corbyn speaking out against apartheid at a time when the current party of government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/06/conservative-party-uncomfortable-nelson-mandela\" title=\"\">calling Nelson Mandela a terrorist</a> and doing business with an internationally boycotted South Africa. Like Sanders, Corbyn was opposed to the Iraq war at the time, foreseeing its devastating consequences for the Iraqi people. And it is striking how often this war comes up when speaking with Corbyn supporters. This isn\u2019t purely about remembering the invasion. It\u2019s about wanting politicians to take a different, more credible approach across the Middle East. In this context, the significance of Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/david-cameron-uk-must-never-repeat-iraq-war-mistakes\" title=\"\">apology for the war</a> on publication of the Chilcot report was vastly overlooked by the British media.</p> <p>It is easy to accuse Corbyn of being stuck in the past, but such throwaway putdowns miss the merits of having consistently held values that \u201cgrow up with you\u201d. At a time when trust in Westminster is so eroded, a politician who has repeatedly, Google-verifiably kept to the same principles is going to appeal across generations.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://home.cern/\">CERN </a>is home to some of the largest and most complex scientific equipment on the planet. Yet back in March, scientists gathered there for a <a href=\"http://www.makery.info/en/2016/03/14/gosh-reunit-le-mouvement-open-science-hardware-au-cern/\">conference about DIY laboratory tools</a>. Scientists in poorly funded labs, particularly in the global south, have <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5082651/The_making_of_an_indigenous_Scanning_Tunneling_Microscope_and_Technological_Jugaad_as_a_culture_of_innovation_in_India\">used DIY tools for many years</a>. But well-resourced institutes are increasingly interested in the collaborative possibilities of open labware. Citizen scientists are also using it to build instruments for tasks like <a href=\"https://publiclab.org/\">environmental monitoring</a>, which can then be used to support community demands for justice from polluters.</p> <p>It is not only scientists \u2013 citizen or professional \u2013 who are going DIY. An open hardware movement of hobbyists, activists, geeks, designers, engineers, students and social entrepreneurs is creating ingenious versions of all sorts of technologies, and freely sharing the know-how through social media. Open hardware is also encroaching upon centres of manufacturing. In August, for instance, the <a href=\"http://fab12.fabevent.org/\">global gathering of FabLabs met in Shenzhen</a> (already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/apr/24/making-in-china-maker-faire-shenzhen-global-politics-maker-movement\">host</a> to Maker Faires) to review how their network can help to decentralise design and manufacture.</p> <p>The free software movement is cited as both an inspiration and a model for open hardware. Free software practices have transformed our culture by making it easier for people to become involved in producing things from magazines to music, movies to games, communities to services. With advances in digital fabrication making it easier to manipulate materials, some now anticipate an analogous opening up of manufacturing to mass participation.</p> <p>One online community has been developing <a href=\"http://www.diybookscanner.org/\">DIY book scanners</a>. These enable you to build a machine for automatically photographing book pages; and then download free software to process the images into a file. Having digitized your books, you might go further by sharing the files online (taking care to post anonymously to a site relaxed about copyright law).</p> <p>The list of open hardware available to people continues to grow. The <a href=\"http://opensourceecology.org\">Open Source Ecology</a> group is even developing a Global Village Construction Kit of tools for self-sufficiency, from machine tools to housing to tractors and beyond. A \u2018global commons\u2019 of accessible tools is emerging.</p> <p>Open hardware can be serious business too. Take <a href=\"http://reprap.org\">RepRap</a>: a 3D printer community whose open source practices enabled its rapid growth. Its evolution took a controversial turn when members of the Resistor hackerspace in New York decided to commercialize their version of the RepRap, and protected aspects of its design through intellectual property. Their <a href=\"http://www.makerbot.com\">Makerbot</a> business was subsequently bought for $400 million by 3D printer manufacturer Stratosys; a move which provoked fierce <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/makerbot-responds-to-critics-who-claim-it-is-stealing-community-ip/\">criticism</a> from open hardware advocates.</p> <p>Hobbyists have always tinkered with technologies for their own purposes (in early personal computing, for example). And social activists have long advocated the power of giving tools to people. The <a href=\"http://www.wholeearth.com/index.php\">Whole Earth Catalogue</a> was an early proponent of the liberating potential of digital technology. Then there were the dog-eared Appropriate Technology manuals that a generation of aid workers carried into the developing world in the 1970s and 1980s. Other antecedents include Victor Papanek\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.rootsimple.com/2014/02/nomadic-furniture/\">Nomadic Furniture</a> and Walter Segal\u2019s self-build <a href=\"http://www.architecturefoundation.org.uk/programme/2015/walter%E2%80%99s-way-the-anarchist-housing-estate\">housing</a>. We can compare these with their digital heirs at <a href=\"https://www.opendesk.cc\">Open Desk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wikihouse.cc\">WikiHouse</a>. Open, community-based technology <a href=\"http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-5-shared-machine-shops/peer-reviewed-articles/technology-networks-for-socially-useful-production/\">workshops</a> are not so new either.</p> <p>So is this just old wine in new bottles? We think not. Open hardware lowers the barriers to participation in rapid prototyping in ways that earlier activists would find astonishing. And with community-workshops popping up in many towns, and online sharing platforms proliferating, the possibilities for doing technology differently are genuinely exciting.</p> <p>Nevertheless, older experiences hold important lessons for the new. Our <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Grassroots-Innovation-Movements/Smith-Fressoli-Abrol-Arond-Ely/p/book/9781138901223\">research</a> into grassroots innovation movements, old and new, brings insights that activists today would be wise to consider.</p> <p>The immediacy and connectedness of open hardware does not nullify the need for real skills in technology development. There remains a craft element to even the fleetest of digitally enabled tools. Experienced designers, engineers and machinists know the importance in understanding not just the tools themselves, but also the materials they work with. Practices that respect materials across their whole life cycle become imperative. <a href=\"https://oscedays.org\">Sustainable</a> open hardware shifts the focus to making sufficiently, design for repair and repurposing, upcycling objects, and valuing the craft therein. Just because we can make almost anything, doesn\u2019t mean we should.</p> <p>And the materials involved are not simply physical. They are social too. If open hardware is to be genuinely inclusive, then its practices must actively empower people to become involved. Notionally accessible tools need to become actually available, and people need to feel confident using them. This requires <a href=\"http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/MC-report_final.pdf\">social skills</a> in community participation, as well as technology skills.</p> <p><a href=\"http://fablabsuk.co.uk/\">FabLabs</a> are fantastic at combining face-to-face developments with online networks. These hybrid spaces contribute important infrastructure for open hardware. But maintaining infrastructure needs investment. Existing institutions, such as schools, museums, local governments, universities, and corporations are helping fund open workshops. </p> <p>These institutional links bring the political dilemmas of open hardware to the surface. Is it really transforming technology development, or simply a refreshing input for business as usual? Education institutions see cool ways to induct people into conventional science, technology and manufacturing jobs. Local governments get excited about the entrepreneurial possibilities. Corporations see a reservoir of design prototypes offered up by the free labour of enthusiasts.</p> <p>It is important to keep sharp open hardware\u2019s more transformational edges, on agendas such as dismantling intellectual property and releasing investment for alternative business models. Only through a mix of craft, politics, and the support of social movements, will open hardware fully realise its potential to democratise technology.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/smithadrianpaul?lang=en-gb\">Adrian Smith</a> is professor of technology and society at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) and a member of the ESRC STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) at the University of Sussex. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@mfressoli\">Dr Mariano Fressoli</a> is a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET, Argentina) and STEPS Latin America.

To achieve this we will accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and drive the expansion of the green industries and jobs of the future.\u201d</p> <p>The manifesto includes a commitment to create over 300,000 renewable energy jobs and to set a target of 65% of UK electricity from renewable sources by 2030. </p> <p>In addition, Labour would invest heavily in energy saving, making building insulation a national infrastructure priority. </p> <p>\u201cWe will launch a publicly funded National Home Insulation programme that would see at least 4m homes insulated. This would create tens of thousands of jobs across every community, reducing the need for expensive new energy generation, and helping millions of people to save money on their bills,\u201d Corbyn said.</p> <p>But Smith, who is challenging Corbyn, was critical of the manifesto. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Jeremy Corbyn to speak with credibility on environmental policy. He\u2019s called for the reintroduction of deeply damaging opencast coal mining, only had one meeting with his shadow environment team in nine months as leader, and didn\u2019t utter a word of protest when Theresa May scrapped the Department for Energy and Climate Change,\u201d said a spokesperson for Smith.</p> <p>\u201cCorbyn does not even mention Hinkley point and nuclear power, despite the fact that nuclear stations currently provide almost a quarter of UK electricity and there are contentious plans for new nuclear stations.\u201d</p> <p>Friends of the Earth welcomed his commitment to ban fracking. Liz Hutchins, senior political strategist, said: \u201cHe is right to commit to ban fracking and Smith should make the same clear commitment. The Liberal Democrats and the Green party have called for a ban because of threats to health and the environment. It is now banned or halted in Scotland, Wales, France, Germany and New York state.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn responded to growing calls for government to commit to matching all existing EU environmental directives if Britain leaves the EU. He said he would safeguard all existing protection laws including the birds and habitats directives, and air pollution standards, and added that he would refuse to agree to any Brexit deal that reduced nature protection of nature. </p> <p>Environmental lawyers ClientEarth welcomed this but called on the Labour leader to go further. The group\u2019s CEO, James Thornton, said: \u201cWe need to keep the EU protections we have now. They have served our country well. Once they are secure, we can start strengthening protections for wildlife and the environment.</p> <p>\u201cBut if Corbyn is fully signed up to protecting the environment and tackling the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis then we also would urge him to back our calls for a new Clean Air Act.</p> <p>Other initiatives pledged include reinstating the energy and climate change department, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/decc-abolition-major-setback-for-uk-climate-change-efforts\">which was abolished in July</a>, and supporting a proposal to mobilise schools and communities to help plant 64 million trees in 10 years to help to tackle the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis.<br></p> <p>In addition to promoting the growth of over 200 \u201clocal energy companies\u201d and making public, not-for-profit companies and co-ops the centrepiece of a new energy economics, the Labour manifesto intends to support the development of 1,000 community energy co-operatives, with rights to sell energy directly to the localities they serve.</p>",

Flight paths are <a href=\"http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/uk-airports/london-city-airport/london-city-airport-news/\" title=\"\">becoming more concentrated</a> and the result is <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/why-its-time-to-close-london-city-airport\" title=\"\">more noise, more air pollution, more blight and more public anger</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-lie-in-chains-on-london-city-airport-runway-aerial-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xp54\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2695252\"            data-video-name=\"Black Lives Matter protesters lie in chains on London City airport runway \u2013 aerial video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ce92e0e4b01f3b278919e4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-lie-in-chains-on-london-city-airport-runway-aerial-video\">Black Lives Matter protesters lie in chains on London City airport runway \u2013 aerial video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet City airport\u2019s expansion has been shovelled through local and national planning with minimum consultation and without much public debate, even as air pollution in London is known by the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/nearly-9500-people-die-each-year-in-london-because-of-air-pollution-study\" title=\"\">to be killing 9,500 people a year and breaking the law</a>.</p> <p>But there are other reasons why the nine crossed the pond. East London, with some of the most deprived, blighted and polluted communities in Europe, is targeted by the road-building lobby and Transport for London for not just one more Thames four-lane road bridge or tunnel, <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/new-river-crossings-for-london\" title=\"\">but three</a>.</p> <p>If these are built, Newham and Tower Hamlets boroughs, in the north, and Greenwich and Bexley, south of the river, will each get massive new roads and tens of thousands of extra cars ploughing through them every day. Transport for London claims that the new crossings will bring relief from congestion. The reality, say the experts, is that they will bring extra traffic and pollution.</p> <p>Air pollution in Silvertown, where one tunnel is proposed, is already <a href=\"http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/environment/air_pollution_expert_brands_silvertown_tunnel_plans_criminal_and_unjust_1_1831084\" title=\"\">more than one-and-a-half times</a> the European legal limit. In parts of Tower Hamlets, where another crossing is planned, it is worse. According to the government, 98 people in Newham alone died from air pollution in 2010.</p> <p>Residents in these boroughs have long been dumped on by governments. They get the sewage works, the concrete works and the pollution, and now they can expect more heart and lung diseases, more pressure on the National health, more costs and more personal heartache. Unsuprisingly, many are pretty furious.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the climate. As Asad Rehman of Friends of the Earth says, when it comes to climate change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/31/climate-change-poor-suffer-most-un-report\" title=\"\">those who have done the least to create the climate crisis are the worst affected</a>. Devastating floods, droughts and famine, mainly affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions of poor and black communities in developing countries, is the stark reality of climate change already. This is going to get much worse if rich countries such as the UK don\u2019t do more to cut their emissions faster and deeper, and sign up to the Paris agreement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Average emissions of business people flying from City are probably way more than the average person living in Newham</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the same in London. Average emissions of business people flying from City airport are almost certainly way more than those of the average person living in Newham or Tower Hamlet boroughs.</p> <p>Moreover, there is plenty of evidence that black people and ethnic minorities are much more likely to be affected by bad air. Research first <a href=\"http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf\" title=\"\">by the UK government</a>, and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_26-1-2015-12-17-52\" title=\"\">recently</a> by Imperial College London and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands have shown that the average person identifying as black or black-British African in the UK is exposed to much higher levels of pollutants than the average urban white person.</p> <p>Children, older people, those with asthma and cyclists are all more likely to be affected by poor air quality, as are poorer communities and minority ethnic ones. The study concluded that the most deprived 10% of areas in England are subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average. The biggest differences in air pollution levels according to socioeconomic status were in London.</p> <p>Agendas and groupings have merged. We know that to reduce climate emissions we need to tackle air pollution as well. It little matters who takes the lead in challenging power or under which banner people choose to act. There is no longer ownership of police atrocities, or pollution or injustice. The only certain things these days in the environment is that racism thrives and that pollution follows the poor.</p>",
  "<p>As the athletes prepare take to the starting line in the Rio Paralympics, they aren\u2019t just facing a physical test but a mental one. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fitnessforlife.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/01_J3644%20JCSP%205_3_Martin_2011.pdf\">Sports psychologists</a> (pdf) have identified five traits and skills that help Paralympic champions to flourish. But can these be taught? And, if so, could they help our pupils to perform better at school? Here\u2019s what students can learn from the competition:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/31/great-expectations-how-to-help-your-students-fulfil-their-potential\">Great expectations: how to help your students fulfil their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Self-regulation</h2> <p>Are Paralympic champions less anxious by nature, or are they better at handling their nerves? Probably a bit of both. Stress and anxiety can hinder concentration, so it takes a lot of self-composure to deliver your best performance when it matters the most.</p> <p>There are lots of strategies for managing emotions, many of which can be adopted by students facing stressful challenges at school. Improving self-talk \u2013 making pupils\u2019 inner monologues more positive \u2013 can be used to boost productivity, and changing their mindsets to see big events as opportunities rather than threats can also help. </p> <p>These skills are known as self-regulation, and experts say they can have a dramatic impact on student performance. <a href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit/meta-cognition-and-self-regulation/\">The Education Endowment Foundation</a> reports that these kinds of interventions are among the most effective for helping students improve, adding on average eight months of additional progress. </p> <h2>Mental toughness</h2> <p>This means having high levels of motivation, being able to cope with setbacks, and being focused on goals. These skills are vital to Paralympians \u2013 the ability to stay motivated and confident over a long period of time is critical when training for an event that only takes place every four years.</p> <p>The educational equivalent is often known as \u201cgrit\u201d; a concept defined by psychologist Angela Duckworth as a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance\">combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals</a>. It won\u2019t necessarily have a huge impact on grades \u2013 a <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/47157228/Rimfeld_et_al_True_Grit_paper.pdf\">recent review</a> found that grit only accounted for 0.5% difference in student\u2019s GCSE results \u2013 but <a href=\"http://thepsychologypodcast.com/angela-duckworth-on-grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perseverance/\">Duckworth says</a> it can help to prevent at-risk students from dropping out of school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/24/four-neuromyths-still-prevalent-in-schools-debunked\">Four neuromyths that are still prevalent in schools \u2013 debunked</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Vigour</h2> <p>Vigour means having high levels of energy, effort and drive. Yet this is hard \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to teach. What teachers can do, however, is build an environment and motivational climate where those with high vigour can flourish, and hopefully inspire others. </p> <p>Teachers can help to nurture students\u2019 internal motivation by creating a clear sense of purpose in the classroom. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://sdtheory.s3.amazonaws.com/SDT/documents/2002_ReeveJangetal_MOEM.pdf\">In one study</a> (pdf), students were divided into four groups and taught a new foreign language. Each group was given different incentives and motivation. Group one wasn\u2019t given any reason why they were learning the language; group two was told they would be tested at the end of the course; group three was told it was what was expected of them; and group four were told it would help them achieve their future career goals. The results were clear \u2013 the fourth group rated the foreign language lessons as more important and put the most effort into their studies.</p> <p>Creating a sense of purpose needn\u2019t be complicated. Teachers can do this by informing students how doing well in the current task will help them to develop important skills, improve performance in their other subjects and make progress towards future plans. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Optimism</h2> <p>Paralympians and Olympians have been found to be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fitnessforlife.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/01_J3644%20JCSP%205_3_Martin_2011.pdf\">more optimistic than the average person</a>. In psychology, optimism is measured by how someone perceives their successes or failures. They can be temporary or permanent (\u201cToday was a bad day\u201d v \u201cThings will always be bad\u201d), and specific or general (\u201cI am not good at this\u201d v \u201cI am not good at anything\u201d).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/mar/08/children-mobile-phone-distraction-study-school\">Fomo, stress and sleeplessness: are smartphones bad for students?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03054980902934563\">Optimism</a> has been studied extensively in relation to schools. It has been <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2009.00508.x/full\">associated</a> with reducing the likelihood of dropping out, better motivation and coping more effectively with academic transitions. Conversely, a pessimistic outlook is seen as a strong predictor of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000207\">high levels of hostility and fear in high school students</a>. </p> <h2>Control</h2> <p>Our brains can struggle with uncertainty \u2013 not knowing what will happen often leads to nervousness or stress. This is why many athletes talk about being \u201cprocess-focused\u201d; they concentrate on what they can control, which usually means their strategies, routines and performance.</p> <p>Students can take a similar approach by focusing their efforts on \u201ccontrolling the controllables\u201d. This can be done by developing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/10/six-ways-students-can-prepare-for-success-on-the-day-of-an-exam\">pre-exam routine</a> or creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jun/08/seven-scientific-ways-beat-panic-exam\">strategies that reduce confusion and doubt</a>. By focusing on what they need to do and not on the potential consequences, they can build confidence while reducing fear of failure.</p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

It is measure of how poorly run the former Big Cup champions Nottingham Forest seem to be that the sale of teenage Scottish sensation Oliver Burke to RB Leipzig for a paltry \u00a313m with no sell-on clause is no longer the most insane bit of business they\u2019ve conducted in the past 10 days.</p> <p>On Wednesday the club announced they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/nottingham-forest-sign-nicklas-bendtner-on-two-year-contract\">snapped up Nick on a free transfer</a>, a fee which would ordinarily represent good value for money but could prove ridiculously expensive in this case, if history is anything to go by. Bendtner has previous experience of playing in the Championship, when as a callow youth of 18 with a long and distinguished career of underachievement ahead of him, he was shipped out on loan from Arsenal to Birmingham City where he scored 11 goals in 42 matches. That was a decade ago and he has since failed to score more than 10 goals a season for either Sunderland or Juventus or Wolfsburg. </p> <p>Despite this, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fawaz_alhasawi1/status/773467493889368068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">a tweet</a> from Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi imploring fans to welcome Nick to the City Ground was greeted with cautious optimism, with one fan capturing the tone when he said \u201cthis will either be a masterstroke or a disaster, let\u2019s hope you\u2019ve got this one right Mr Chairman\u201d.

Theresa May sounded confident, but her pre-scripted anti-Corbyn jibes (in response to questions two and three) came over as unprovoked, gratuitous and consequently rather cheap. It was reminiscent of David Cameron\u2019s Bullingdon aggro, but Cameron found a way of at least making his attacks sound relevant. Corbyn ignored the obvious topics (grammar schools, or Brexit) and he asked solid, serious questions about one of the most pressing social questions of our time. But, as ever, he did not really use follow-up questions to drive home his points and so he did not really succeed in discomforting May at all. The PM was relatively weak on detail, but she did try to turn the argument into a wider one about values, and about home ownership, and on these points Corbyn\u2019s responses were thin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-pokes-fun-at-jeremy-corbyn-during-pmqs-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/522mv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2698623\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May pokes fun at Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d00586e4b042bbfb32432d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160807PMQsjokes_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-pokes-fun-at-jeremy-corbyn-during-pmqs-video\">Theresa May pokes fun at Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T13:27:21.874Z\">at 2.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cff659e4b042bbfb3242da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:18:18.445Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says only a year ago May voted against a Labour amendment to the housing bill saying all homes in the rented sector should be fit for habitation. The Treasury is losing \u00a3500m a year from unpaid tax from landlords in the housing sector. Unpaid tax, poor quality homes - doesn\u2019t this require government intervention.</p> <p>May says the government has intervened. Thousands of landlords face further action. Corbyn may have a model of society where he does not want to see private landlords. But that is not what she wants. She wants people to have opportunities.</p> <p>Corbyn says he recognises the case for a mixed housing economy, but he does not want to see people pay excessive rent. Women\u2019s Aid has raised concern about the cuts to housing benefit. Does May accept that very vulnerable women could be affected by the closure of these refuges. Will May ensure the cap on housing benefit does not apply to refuges.</p> <p>May says the government is working on exempting women\u2019s refuges from the housing benefit cap. But the government has a very good record on domestic violence, she says. </p> <p>It is 50 days since she and Corbyn last met at the despatch box. It is good to see him sitting there. The Conservative government has been working tirelessly, she says. She mentions the public sector audit, and work on new trade deals. What a contrast with the party opposite, divided amongst themselves, and incapable of uniting the country.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGP078eWFWI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gGP078eWFWI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:53:26.202Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57cff590e4b0b2ee83375e5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T11:13:24.542Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says there is a housing crisis in Britain.

Corbyn may have an ideological objection to the private rented sector. Everything Corbyn tells us everything we need to know about Labour. The train has left the station, the leader is on the floor, even on rolling stock, they are a laughing stock.</p> <p>Corbyn says David Cameron said every penny spent on housing subsidies was money that could not be spent on new housing. He quotes someone saying landlords should be fined for renting homes in poor condition. Does the PM think this is satisfactory?</p> <p>May says, if housing benefit is such a bad thing, why did Labour oppose cuts to housing benefit. The rules for landlords have been changed, she says.

But the government wants to do more, she says.</p> <p>Corbyn says house building is 45,000 a year less than under the last Labour government. He quotes from a note from Jenny. She and her partner work in a supermarket. They have been told they can borrow \u00a373,000. So there is not much hope for them. George Osborne said there would be one to one replacement for homes sold under right to buy. But only one home gets build for every five homes sold. When will one to one replacement come in?</p> <p>May says Corbyn is wrong. The government has delivered on one to one replacement. Corbyn has asked his followers on Twitter for questions. May says she looked at them. He got on from Lewis saying don\u2019t know scored higher than Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister.

As shadow education secretary in 2007 he gave a speech saying bringing back grammar schools would be bad for social mobility.

They want the UK to stay within the single market. But the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union says this is \u201cimprobable\u201d. Does the PM agree with the Japanese Government or her own Secretary of State?</p> <p>President Obama said at the G20 that the USA\u2019s priority would be to pursue trade deals with the EU and with Pacific countries \u2013 not to do a deal with the UK. Does the PM plan to persuade the United States to change its diplomatic priorities, and if so how?</p> <p>Over the last few months a points-based immigration system has been proposed by the Foreign Secretary, the International Trade Secretary, the International Development Secretary, the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary. Can the PM confirm that she disagrees with all of them?</p> <p>A points-based immigration system was one of the Leave campaign\u2019s key promises.

I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th [at this point the Tories still thought members would be voting in a lengthy leadership election[ to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months.</p> <p>So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p>But that timetable has timetable has now been consigned to the bin. <strong>Steven Ciobo,</strong> the Australian trade secretary, has come to London for talks with Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and in an interview with the BBC he said that it would take at least two and a half years to agree a UK-Australian trade deal, and possibly longer. That was because the two countries could not strike a deal until the UK left the EU, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My formal advice is that, and this is from the UK side, the UK is unable to negotiate or sign an agreement prior to the formal exit from the EU. We can certainly have preliminary discussions and that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m doing here this week. Preliminary discussions around what a post-Brexit Australia-UK trade deal might look like. </p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if that meant a deal was some years off, Ciobo replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Based upon what we\u2019ve been told, if article 50 is present in Q1 or Q2 next year [the first or second quarter of the year] and then the two year year window in relation to that, so you would expect it is at least two and a half years off. </p> </blockquote> <p>Ciobo was then asked if, with the UK and Australia only free to sign a deal in two and a half years\u2019 time, there would then be months or years of \u201ctough negotiations\u201d. Ciobo conceded that at that point further talks might be necessary, but he also said that with \u201cour strong historical bonds we should be able to make a meal of it quite quickly\u201d.</p> <p>And remember - Australia is supposed to be one of the countries with whom negotiating a trade deal should be easiest.</p> <p>I will post more from the interview shortly.</p> <p>And we\u2019ve got more Brexit later, because Theresa May is making a statement in the Commons about the G20 summit which is almost certain to turn into a mini debate about the government\u2019s Brexit policy.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.45am: </em>Liz Truss, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee.</p> <p><em>12pm: </em>Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12.30pm: </em>May gives a statement to MPs.

  "<p>More than 800 small investors may have lost up to \u00a38m after the failure of two controversial \u2018mini-bonds\u2019 that promised interest of up to 8.25%. </p> <p>Providence Bonds were marketed as an investment in a \u201cfast-growing, global commercial and financial services group\u201d that had offices across the world. Savers enjoyed multiple levels of security, according to the promoter, London-based Independent Portfolio Managers. </p> <p>But last month it emerged that Providence Financial Investments, part of the Providence Group, was under investigation in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator. It was accused of offering \u201congoing fraudulent and unregistered\u201d securities, and ordered to stop trading.<br></p> <p>Soon after, the Guernsey-based Providence Global, the holding company for Providence\u2019s non-US interests, was <a href=\"http://www.gfsc.gg/The-Commission/News/Pages/Providence-Global-Limited-.aspx\">compulsorily wound up</a>, and now Deloitte has stepped in as <a href=\"http://www.deloitte-insolvencies.co.uk/providencebonds\">administrator to the bonds</a>. It is unclear what, if any, cash is left in the bonds. </p> <p>The UK bonds were approved and promoted by IPM, a Financial Conduct Authority-regulated company. But mini-bonds are outside of the official compensation scheme, so investors are at risk of losing all their money. </p> <p>It is not the first time that IPM has been at the centre of a collapsed bond. The firm acted as a security trustee for Secured Energy Bonds (SEB), another issue that failed and left investors with losses of more than \u00a37m. </p> <p>In September 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/sep/05/independent-portfolio-managers-ipm-mini-bond-losses\">Guardian\u2019s Money pages warned about the Providence issue</a>, advising readers to bin the offer documents. </p> <p>Investors in the failed SEB bonds were targeted by IPM to also invest in Providence Bonds. Many are highly critical of both the role of IPM and the financial regulators. One, Paul Donovan, said: \u201cI complained to IPM and the ombudsman about the former using the SEB database to promote the Providence Bond. Now, guess what, the Providence Bond has gone into administration. IPM playing a similar role, while the so-called regulators sit on their hands and let more people go to the wall. This really is getting beyond a joke.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian tried calling and emailing Providence Bonds. Calls went unanswered, while emails are returned with a note saying that the company has gone into administration and that all enquiries should be directed to Deloitte at <a href=\"mailto:providencebonds@deloitte.co.uk\">providencebonds@deloitte.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Investors had their first inkling of problems at Providence when a quarterly interest payment came late. One investor said: \u201cThe June 30 payment was paid late on 8 July \u2013 we were advised it would be late \u2026due to their moving offshore to Guernsey \u2013 never a good sign! Next payment is due 30 September \u2013 but obviously it will not be paid as they are in administration.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian put questions to IPM but it had not responded by the time we published. </p> <p>Providence Bonds and Providence Financial Investment are not connected to Provident Financial plc, a British financial services group based in Bradford, West Yorkshire which specialises in credit cards, personal loans, and consumer car finance.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23567.htm\">a filing by the SEC</a>, Providence Financial and Providence Fund raised $64m (\u00a348m) from 400 US investors, \u201cthrough the unregistered sale of promissory notes that pay annual returns generally ranging from 12% to 13%\u201d. It told investors the money would be used to fund the \u201cfactoring\u201d of accounts receivable in Brazil. </p> <p>\u201cContrary to these representations, the complaint alleges that Providence Financial and Providence Fund spent, at best, less than 68% of their investors\u2019 money to finance Brazil factoring transactions, and both companies have been unable to account for how they spent the remaining investor proceed,\u201d said the SEC. </p>",

As an older raver I didn\u2019t want to spend the whole night there so would set my alarm and cycle down to the club to arrive about 2am, perfectly timed to get in, go to the cloakroom and get a good spot before he started his set around 3am. I\u2019d hide some malt loaf in a bush near to where I\u2019d parked my bike to give me some energy for the slow ride home afterwards. <br></p> <p>Clubs are having a very rough time at the moment. It\u2019s going to make it more difficult for anyone thinking of opening a venue. Why invest all that time, effort and money into something that may get closed down at any time by a draconian council? <br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I got into the club at 10pm and didn\u2019t leave until 12pm the next day\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ross Greaves, 32, from Guildford</strong></p> <p>I use to go to Fabric most Saturday nights and had the most amazing times with great music. I have been to Space and Amnesia but this is the best club in the world with the best soundsystem. It is very sad not just for London but for all fans of dance music everywhere. My best memory was of Fabric\u2019s birthday party. I got into the club at 10pm and didn\u2019t leave until 12pm the following day. London nightlife will never be the same again.</p> <h2>\u2018My first time at Fabric was an amazing experience\u2019 <br></h2> <p><strong>Irene, 37, works in communication in London</strong><br></p> <p>The first time I went to Fabric I was put off by the long queue outside and felt nervous, thinking about what might happen inside. I also thought it was quite expensive (\u00a315 entry, which was a lot to me at the time). I was relatively new to clubbing at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f8966c15aa12c437a30667e565eeac4c5b642c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8966c15aa12c437a30667e565eeac4c5b642c0/0_170_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fabric\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What I remember most about that night was how amazing the music was. I also loved the fact that different music played in different rooms, with a very different energy depending on where you went. I had such a good time and felt so totally free. I also met various people and had different conversations. It was an amazing, unforgettable experience. </p> <p>Where in London can people go now to let off steam, listen to top DJs and feel alive? London is meant to be a 24-hour world-class city, but it is increasingly becoming a sterile metropolis for the ultra-rich. At this point in my life I don\u2019t find the idea of clubbing that appealing, but I would hate for younger generations to not have a place to go and have fun.</p> <h2>\u2018It made me realise the sense of community a good nightclub could provide\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Tim Burton, 35, from London</strong></p> <p>I first went when I was 19. I grew up in Woking, Surrey, where the entire nightlife consists of every single chain pub brand in the UK aligned on one violent, vomit-strewn street. Going to Fabric, as a kid who had only recently stopped wearing oversized lumberjack shirts and cream-coloured jeans, seemed an incredibly sophisticated thing to do. Everything, from the train journey to the queue, was thrilling. Everyone inside was laid-back. I spent a large part of the night listening to DJ Hype, or whichever drum\u2019n\u2019bass hero we had come for. Clubs and nightlife to me had been about looking hard, fights, inebriation, pulling birds and kebabs until I went to Fabric. I hadn\u2019t realised what a caring community good dance music and a good nightclub could provide. Smiling at women just because the song was good and we were both dancing to it \u2013 that was a radical idea for 19-year-old me, but it was a good lesson to learn.

It can seem a bit cringeworthy to describe clubs in these terms, but Fabric introduced me to music, to culture, to diversity, to adulthood, in a way that I have only ever seen as overwhelmingly positive. </p> <p>The first time I heard dubstep was on their Room one soundsystem. I was with school friends, and it was one of our first outings in London. Everyone around you was totally confused and shocked by this new sound. No one knew how to dance to it. I remember feeling part of something. </p> <p>Clubs like Fabric don\u2019t come around often: it\u2019s a forward-thinking place, where the staff and crowd care about the music. I also feel it\u2019s a venue that encourages artists to push boundaries. London will always have places to dance, but Fabric was more than that. <br></p> <h2>\u2018The first time I went clubbing I went to Fabric\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Mandy, 28, from Brighton</strong><br>My first time clubbing was at Fabric when I was 18. As someone who had been mostly into rock and metal until that point, I remember dancing to Cut Chemist and DJ Format and realising how amazing this culture was. While I haven\u2019t been to Fabric for about 10 years (my preferred genre is psytrance, which tends to be played at smaller venues) I still credit it with what got me into electronic and dance music, a culture I still enjoy many years on. </p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s unthinkable to imagine another club in the UK getting that lineup\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Hank, 31, from London, works in television</strong></p> <p>I first visited in 2007, during the \u201cBloghaus\u201d era. Having grown up in a home counties town with a godawful Liquid nightclub I had really never seen anything like it before. Finally, a place that played tunes I wanted to hear and in such a welcoming environment. It felt so impressive and hi-tech; I think it was the first place I saw a Dyson Airblade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e632d9487238528ee79990363c10f0014bf4e56d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e632d9487238528ee79990363c10f0014bf4e56d/0_194_5668_3401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"clubbers dancing at Fabric\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The lineup and the night itself was amazing: Chemical Brothers, LCD Soundsystem, Justice, Busy P, The Teenagers, Santogold and future cult stars Late of the Pier and Crystal Castles (playing their first UK gig). It\u2019s unthinkable to imagine another club in the UK getting that lineup. There are a number of great venues still knocking around in London, such as XOYO and Oval Space, but nothing really compares to Fabric. It\u2019s the only place in the UK that really can match up to the likes of Berghain, Amnesia and Space. The places that can book big acts will either get logjammed, or there simply won\u2019t be the space to accommodate them. <br></p> <ul> <li><em>Some names have been changed.</em><br></li> </ul>",

The USDA\u2019s most frugal estimates (the \u201cthrifty\u201d plan) are less expensive still, just $887 for four months for a single man, or 28% of the most generous campus dining plan. </p> <p>For further comparison, a student on food stamps would receive roughly <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility\">$784 in benefits</a> over the same period of time. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0bf77aabda21cf17dfd476aa8a88c636d1c4e77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0bf77aabda21cf17dfd476aa8a88c636d1c4e77/0_60_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curried shrimp for dinner, anyone?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curried shrimp for dinner, anyone?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All that is factored into UMass Amherst\u2019s total out-of-state cost of <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=amherst&amp;s=all&amp;id=166629\">$44,407</a> per year, the price for about 6,100 of the school\u2019s roughly 22,000 undergraduate students.

UMass Amherst serves \u201conly sustainable seafood, and also serving fair trade coffee only, and then we also have free trade chicken\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven the beef we use \u2013 we want to serve as much grass-fed beef as possible,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e57e11668a02c65d6a916f0859b8ea1ba29de1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e57e11668a02c65d6a916f0859b8ea1ba29de1/0_51_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sushi, freshly prepared.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sushi, freshly prepared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Clare Cady of the <a href=\"http://www.cufba.org/\">College and University Food Bank Alliance</a> (there is not a location at UMass Amherst), high-cost meal plans may spell problems for low-income students. </p> <p>\u201cThere are students out there that have dining plans that are food insecure,\u201d said Cady. \u201cThat is because a lot of schools, they require students to have a food plan if they live on campus, but they will offer these very low price points\u201d with smaller quantities of meals, she said. </p> <p>\u201cIt is possible that it is a barrier to access for low-income students.\u201d </p> <p>Not all food plans are as expensive as Amherst\u2019s. At the University of Vermont, another New England university, unlimited meal plans are <a href=\"https://uvmdining.sodexomyway.com/dining-plans/plans_first_year.html\">$2,204 a semester</a>, $877 less expensive than Amherst\u2019s most generous plan. Similarly, at New York University\u2019s Washington Square campus, an \u201call access\u201d plan is <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/housing-and-dining/on-campus-living/residence-halls/dining/nyu-meal-plan/washington-square-meal-plans.html\">$2,800</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, Toong argues that students demand high-quality food. In a recent campus survey, 70% said they felt campus dining was important to their decision to attend the school. </p> <p>And, at least in Massachusetts, the trend toward high-end cuisine does not appear to be abating. In 2015, the UMass campus at Lowell planned borrowed <a href=\"https://www.umassp.edu/sites/umassp.edu/files/content/publications/budget-office/FY16%20Operating%20Budget%206-9-15.pdf\">$100m</a> for a dining hall renovation. </p>",

  "<p>Is the Irish government too cowed to do anything about the country\u2019s largest media tycoon enlarging his empire?</p> <p>Denis O\u2019Brien, reputedly Ireland\u2019s richest man, is the largest shareholder in the country\u2019s largest newspaper publisher, Independent News &amp; Media (INM).</p> <p>That company has now agreed a deal to add seven more newspaper titles to its stable <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/media/inm-group-agrees-deal-to-buy-irishowned-regional-newspapers-35017815.html\">by acquiring the Celtic Media Group (CMG)</a>.</p> <p>They include the Anglo-Celt in Cavan, the Meath Chronicle and the Connaught Telegraph in Mayo. In all, it extends INM\u2019s footprint to five more counties.</p> <p>INM is already the major player at national level. It publishes Ireland\u2019s two largest-selling titles, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-independent\">Irish Independent</a> and Sunday Independent, plus the Sunday World and the Dublin Herald. It also has 50% of the Irish Daily Star.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien\u2019s other media company, Communicorp, owns Ireland\u2019s two leading commercial radio talk stations: Newstalk and Today FM. In addition, it owns Dublin\u2019s 98FM, SPIN 1038, TXFM and SPIN South West. </p> <p>And he has plenty of non-media holdings too, including a Dublin hospital, a prestigious Galway hotel and Siteserv, which provides services to the Irish state including the (controversial) installation of water meters. And he has many business interests elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>In such circumstances, it is fair to ask whether the Irish government should simply nod through a further expansion of O\u2019Brien\u2019s media assets. Diversity and plurality are surely threatened.</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/apr/08/nuj-calls-for-commission-to-investigate-media-ownership-in-ireland\">called in April this year for a commission to investigate media ownership in Ireland</a>, has rightly registered its alarm at INM\u2019s Celtic Media deal.</p> <p>In its first statement on the matter, the NUJ said it was <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/new-threat-to-media-diversity-ireland/\">\u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the acquisition</a>. In a follow-up statement, the union <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/nuj-seeks-naughten-pledge-on-sale-of-regional-newspapers/\">called for a full investigation into the impact on employment, competition and media diversity</a>.</p> <p>It urged Ireland\u2019s communications minister, Denis Naughten, to use his powers in order to examine the deal, which is subject to approval by his department and by the competition commission. </p> <p>As the NUJ pointed out, the announcement of the deal, for an undisclosed sum, coincided with a decision by INM to outsource editorial functions to the UK, with a loss of up to 27 permanent and contract jobs. </p> <p>Celtic Media staff \u2013 numbering around 100 \u2013 will doubtless be concerned about the potential for future staff cutbacks at their papers too. </p> <p>The publisher is owned and managed by a team that acquired the group in 2012 through a management buyout for a reported \u20ac5.5m. It is headed by a former Irish Independent business editor, Frank Mulrennan, and it is understood that he will rejoin INM.</p> <p>Robert Pitt, INM\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are very pleased that Celtic Media Group\u2019s publishing titles are becoming part of INM\u2019s portfolio of regional and digital titles. </p> <p>\u201cThere are clear synergies arising from this transaction, which fit well with INM\u2019s strategy to remain as a key player in the delivery of printed news content on a national and regional basis.\u201d </p> <p>He has previously said consolidation was needed in the national print sector in order to secure the viability of newspapers that face falling print circulation and a challenging advertising environment.</p> <p>But the question for Minister Naughten is whether it is appropriate for INM, already the largest newspaper publisher on the island of Ireland (it has the Belfast Telegraph in the north), to grow larger still. </p>",

Her work has helped many species, but in her heart there has always been one above all others.</p> <p>\u201cWhy elephants? I think they are among the most important species because they are a lot like us and easy to relate to. Their conservation naturally requires land and space, and therefore it helps all other species,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\" data-alt=\"Range of African elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Range of African elephants</a> </figure>  <p>This year has been particularly successful. After three years of planning and lobbying, Wildlife Direct \u2013 in partnership with other organisations \u2013 got the Kenyan government to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/29/kenya-to-burn-biggest-ever-stockpile-of-ivory\">burn all its ivory stockpiles</a> in April, with the aim of distorting black market ivory prices.</p> <p>\u201cThat will have a trickledown effect that will lead to the securing of the global elephant population,\u201d she says. \u201cIvory prices are already coming down as a result of that \u2026 and countries have banned the trade of ivory and ivory products within their borders. The direct impact of this will be felt later when jumbo populations around the continent recover.\u201d</p> <p>The path towards this recovery has perhaps never been more controversial. At the meeting of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cites.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) later this month, proposals and counter-proposals aim to either create a blanket global ban on almost any ivory trade or open up controlled sales from some southern African countries. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) will debate a total domestic ban at its conference this week.</p> <p>Kahumbu says elephants deserve the highest level of protection and that the possibility of future trade is a major threat to their survival because it attracts ivory speculators.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been lobbying for domestic bans in ivory trade worldwide for several years. We support it and regret that IUCN and Cites have taken so long to recognise the need for this. It couldn\u2019t come soon enough,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the debate on a total ban on ivory trade goes on, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are pushing for one-off sales of their stockpiles. \u201cThis is outrageous given the plight of elephants, which was triggered by these same countries selling ivory in 2008 to China and Japan. They too should join the rest of the world sooner rather than later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is shocking that three southern African nations will not acknowledge this.\u201d</p> <p>Kahumbu\u2019s love for elephants has been the consuming passion of her life. She has worked for six straight weeks without a break. But she doesn\u2019t mind.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my life. And you can\u2019t really take a break from life, can you?\u201d she asks. As she finishes off her late lunch, she reflects on the paradox that is conservation.</p> <p>\u201cIt is immensely fulfilling, but can be thankless too. The results of many of the wars we fight and win in conservation are not instant. They will be felt by generations to come,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>For the next year the Guardian will be running a year-long focus on the plight of elephants; get in touch with your stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/23/share-your-encounters-with-elephants\">here</a>, and read more of our coverage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/elephant-conservation\">here</a>. </em><br></p>",

I find this global coverage interesting. The tale of apes is immensely sad, of course, but apes represent only a handful of creatures on a critically endangered list that now numbers more than 5,100 species.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Where was coverage of the nubian flapshell turtle?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Where was coverage of the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/6004/0\" title=\"\">nubian flapshell turtle</a>, a funky looking reptile which has declined by 80% in just two generations courtesy of reckless fishing and collection for the pet trade?

All of these creatures have been updated to critically endangered status this year, yet I suspect this is the first time you will have heard of them. It certainly was for me, writing this article.</p> <p>These are animals worthy of having a look at, surely, so I am delighted to be able to share them with you. Might I encourage you (anyone?) to check out the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/14870997/0\" title=\"\">epirus dancing grasshopper</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/21215168/0\" title=\"\">variable cuckoo bumblebee</a>?

Many of you won\u2019t care about organisms such as these, and that\u2019s OK. Hell, these are organisms so uninspiring (to some) that they have been given interesting names like \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_tortoise\" title=\"\">the geometric tortoise</a>\u201d to gee up the international interest. Yet they are all critically endangered, as of this year.</p> <p>These are animals about which we rarely speak when it comes to conservation. They lack the appeal, somehow. They are less interesting. Less worthy of our concern, maybe. They\u2019re just not mammals.</p> <p>There is a word for what we\u2019re talking about here. It is speciesism. Speciesism like this is by no means a new phenomenon, particularly when it comes to the conservation of invertebrates. In Britain, for instance, we spend far <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/blog/matt-shardlow-ceo/it-%E2%80%98cos-i-small\" title=\"\">less money on conserving such creatures compared to bony animals</a> and, globally, we spend far less time researching their conservation. It\u2019s no wonder they barely get a look in during coverage of the IUCN\u2019s annual red list updates.</p> <p>So are we human beings committing a form of animal racism when it comes to global conservation? Undeniably, I think the answer is yes. But a different question might be: does a bit of speciesism really matter, when it comes to conservation?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/04/eastern-gorilla-critically-endangered-illegal-hunting-iucn-red-list\">Eastern gorilla now critically endangered while giant panda situation improves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The common argument for speciesism is that saving bamboo forests for pandas or saving rainforests for orangutans benefits a whole host of invertebrate species and helps conserve hundreds of overlooked geckos and snakes on the side. (Essentially, the argument goes, saving the A-listers also saves the production staff and the catering crew). This might be true. But the problem with accepting this worldview is that it does little to change attitudes, and this is something that frustrates me immensely as someone with an interest in such creatures.</p> <p>You can roll your eyes at this, of course, but accepting speciesism is short-sighted and damaging in the long-term. It is like marketing a library as a place to read airport novels; it downplays and cheapens the wealth of material there to study and marvel at. Invertebrates and newts and tortoises and fungi offer us new perspectives on the human experience and keep open the windows of potential to learn new things that one day might be good for us, even if they don\u2019t seem much use right now. Biodiversity is about more than just biology. It\u2019s really a story of diversity. Of shared ancestors. Of shared branches.</p> <p>So let\u2019s celebrate, if we can, the conservation of all species and focus our minds further across the tree of life. Fungi, newts, dancing grasshoppers and mountain crayfish \u2013 the unspoken nature of their downward spiral probably says more about what it is to be human than we care to consider. But that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be ready to change.</p>",
  "<p>What was once a ubiquitous, highly profitable genre for the movie industry \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/26/fatal-attraction-theatre-review\">the tawdry erotic thriller</a> \u2013 has faded from the mainstream consciousness in the past 20 years and is almost solely the purview of the so-called \u201curban\u201d market. Hollywood simply doesn\u2019t make many of these mid-budget potboilers, where an exposed nipple qualifies as a major plot point and women are treated like insatiable nymphomaniacs that gullible men simply can\u2019t resist unless they star black people. The erotic thriller that was once all about white suburban angst now taps into the upper middle class black nightmare of infidelity \u2013 side-chick-splotation, thot (that hoe over there) horror or black erotic thriller (BET), whatever you want to call it.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The erotic thriller that was once about white suburban angst now taps into the middle class black nightmare: infidelity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Invariably, a happy black couple in a posh neighborhood with generic white-collar jobs typically reserved for white sitcom characters (architect, publicist, financial analyst) drink wine from the Olivia Pope collection, but their world is turned upside-down when a disturbed individual attempts to break up their marriage. When said lunatic is rebuffed, they turn violent. Unlike Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct, the woman tends to be the main protagonist and the man is shunted to the side or killed for his trouble. I love these movies in spite of themselves. They\u2019re totally unaware they\u2019re bad, are practically identical and make excellent use of my favorite actor, Morris Chestnut. So, in honor of the release of When the Bough Breaks (a dull retread of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle), I\u2019ve revisited the major works of the genre and after this thorough examination, I am confident I will never cheat on my wife \u2013 and if I do, I know I will probably be cracked in the skull with a shovel by Taraji P Henson.</p> <h2>Obsessed (2009)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVC4PntzXTA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVC4PntzXTA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The one that started it all. Produced by black movie mogul Will Packer and written by David Loughery, who also wrote Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Obsessed sets the template for the genre with a story about a successful black couple (Beyonc\u00e9 and Idris Elba) who are terrorized by insane white lady Ali Larter, who wants nothing more than to have sex with Idris Elba, which is pretty relatable for most viewers, I\u2019d imagine. She\u2019s a temp at the office where Elba\u2019s character works and falls in love with him instantly. That love leads her to drugging and raping him, because it\u2019s that kind of movie and you just have to go with it. The end of the film features Beyonc\u00e9 kicking the crap out of Ali Larter, which is a perfect starter course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">before listening to Lemonade</a>.</p> <p>One of the major tenets of the genre that Obsessed establishes is that the husband or boyfriend character is usually a total doofus. Either he allows himself to be seduced or has neglected his lover so much that she has to step outside the boundaries of their relationship to be sexually satisfied.</p> <h2>No Good Deed (2014)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5VeowxERwM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G5VeowxERwM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Idris Elba\u2019s back, making him the current king of the thot horror film. This time he\u2019s the maniac, terrorizing Taraji P Henson. He\u2019s a convicted felon with a crashed car. She\u2019s a bored housewife titillated by the idea of a strange man in her home. When she foolishly lets him come in from the rain to call a tow truck, he takes her hostage for reasons she won\u2019t understand until the third act twist: Henson\u2019s husband has been cheating with Elba\u2019s former fiancee and when he comes to Henson\u2019s house, it\u2019s for revenge. The moral of the story here is that if you are an upwardly mobile black couple, you either want to cheat on your spouse or you already have. Regardless, you are going to have to pay for your crime, possibly through a gruesome death at the hands of a very attractive person.</p> <h2>Addicted (2014)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LErjzY_wKI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4LErjzY_wKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Based on the romance novel by Zane (not Billy Zane or Zane Lowe or Zayn Malik \u2013 just Zane), Addicted is another slight variation on the typical tropes of the genre. This time, the sexually obsessed maniac is the protagonist. Sharon Leal plays Zoe, a successful business owner with a husband and two children. She\u2019s got the perfect life ... or does she? You see, she loves sex. In fact, she loves it so much that after two acrobatic romps with her also very successful husband (Boris Kodjoe) in the first scene of the film, she wants to go again, but, as you might expect, he\u2019d prefer to go to sleep. Her insatiable desire leads her to a series of affairs which turn messy when the two secret lovers become aware of each other.</p> <p>While the appeal of this genre is usually based in titillation and sexual wish fulfillment, Addicted subverts that, while also reveling in it. Zoe is a sex addict because she was molested as a child, so as much fun as the viewer might have watching attractive people engaging in softcore sex scenes, Addicted becomes a message movie about a very real problem in the third act. An exploitation film that pivots to actual pain at the end is like eating ice cream and finding the percentage of the global homeless population written on the bottom of the bowl.</p> <h2>The Perfect Guy (2015)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CikoxQ4ytI4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CikoxQ4ytI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Surprisingly, this is the first appearance of African American cinema\u2019s hardest working actor, the legendary Morris Chestnut. If there\u2019s a movie about black folks, chances are strong that Morris Chestnut will show up: The Best Man, The Inkwell, Boyz in the Hood, Think Like a Man, Not Easily Broken, Like Mike. He\u2019s truly black America\u2019s Josh Duhamel or James Marsden. Sure, he\u2019s not on the level of Idris Elba or Denzel Washington (who would never submit to starring in one of these movies, by the way) but name me one film that isn\u2019t better from going Full Chestnut? That\u2019s right, you can\u2019t. How is it that there are numerous black superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and yet none of them are played by Morris Chestnut? Why is Morris Chestnut not in the Fast and Furious series? Can I get #JusticeForMorrisChestnut trending on Twitter?</p> <p>Anyway, in The Perfect Guy, Chestnut is the ineffectual boyfriend of Sanaa Lathan. He doesn\u2019t want to commit, so she dumps him and shacks up with an edgy guy she meets at work, played by Michael Ealy. He ends up being an insane stalker, she tries to dump him and go back to her ex, but the dude\u2019s a stalker and doesn\u2019t take the hint. Ealy\u2019s character kills Chestnut, and none of this would have happened if he\u2019d just agreed to start a family, a lesson he learns in our next film.</p> <h2>When the Bough Breaks (2016)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws74Ie4fMc8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ws74Ie4fMc8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Let\u2019s all pretend for a moment that When the Bough Breaks stars Morris Chestnut\u2019s character from The Perfect Guy, reincarnated as pretty such the same dude, but with a chance to do it right this time. The new, improved Morris Chestnut has finally grown up, because now he wants a baby with his wife, Regina Hall. But they physically can\u2019t have a kid, so they have to get a surrogate. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, but the surrogate is a sex-crazed monster played by Jaz Sinclair from the movie Paper Towns. When the Bough Breaks cements the thot horror genre as about on the level with the Lifetime Original Movie, but instead of taking place in an east coast suburb full of white people, it features rich black people in the city. </p> <p>So what does the future hold for the thot horror genre hold? The cast of Empire needs something to do between seasons. I don\u2019t mean Taraji P Henson or Terrence Howard. I mean the kid who plays Hakeem. Why isn\u2019t he in one of these? He\u2019d be great at terrorizing a couple yuppies and threatening to steal their baby. Where is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2014/may/14/shonda-rhimes-scandal-tv-diversity-showrunner-davis\">Shonda Rhimes</a> in all of this? She should be cranking out evil side pieces once or twice a year. It\u2019s time that African Americans get their very own Basic Instinct \u2013 a completely unhinged erotic thriller that breaks through into the mainstream. The Oscars might still be so white, but HBO at 3am should be full of Morris Chestnut rebuking the advances of his nanny until the end of time.</p>",

As a former US colony, the Philippines is unlikely to dilute US influence quickly, and Duterte\u2019s overt anti-colonial tone is, thus far, mere words. Words that are only causing the country embarrassment and not redressing the unbalanced US-Filipino relationship.

  "<p>On 15 August 1975, the Indian government hosted a lavish party. It had good reason to celebrate: not only was it marking 28 years of independence from British rule, but the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1984/nov/01/india.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Indira Gandhi</a>, had declared the date \u201cIndependence from Smallpox Day\u201d. For decades, India was considered the endemic home of the disease, accounting for some 60% of globally reported cases. Yet in the space of just one year, infections had fallen from 188,000 to zero, thanks to a combination of disease surveillance, vaccination and publicity.</p> <p>Yet as <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/12/08-041208/en/\" title=\"\">Donald Henderson</a>, head of the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) global smallpox eradication programme, who has died aged 87, left the celebrations in order to catch a flight to Bangladesh, he received word that the borders were closed. The Bangladeshi military had staged a coup; the president and his family were dead.</p> <p>It was a pivotal moment in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, a disease that had until recently killed some 2 million people each year. To get this far, Henderson and his team had overcome political resistance, ineffective vaccine stocks, floods, famine and civil war. They had stopped cars in the streets of the former Yugoslavia to vaccinate people, and gone house to house in remote regions of India to nip outbreaks in the bud. Now, eight years into the campaign, Bangladesh was the final refuge for <em>Variola major</em>, the most infectious form of the virus, and the country was threatening to fall apart.</p> <p>Fearing that a tide of refugees might trigger fresh outbreaks, or even reimport the disease to India, Henderson deployed large numbers of health workers to the border to step up surveillance, and vaccinate as required. Fortunately, the predicted influx never arrived. A few weeks later, the borders reopened and WHO\u2019s teams went back to work. In November 1975, Bangladesh reported its final case of smallpox and, two years later, the world\u2019s last case was identified in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/07/31/206947581/last-person-to-get-smallpox-dedicated-his-life-to-ending-polio\" title=\"\">Ali Maow Maalin</a> \u2013 a Somali cook from the port city of Merca. The world was finally declared smallpox-free in 1979.</p> <p>Despite our best efforts, smallpox remains the only human disease to have been completely eradicated from the planet. \u201cIf the Nobel prize in medicine was not so focused on basic science, Henderson and the smallpox team would surely have shared it,\u201d said Chris Beyrer, Desmond Tutu professor of public health and human rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \u201cThe eradication of that ancient, disfiguring and often fatal viral scourge is surely one of the single greatest triumphs of public health in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Known as \u201cDA\u201d to many, Donald Ainslie Henderson was born in Lakewood, Ohio, the son of David, an engineer, and Eleanor (nee McMillan), a nurse. He graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio in 1950, which is where he met his future wife, Nana Bragg, whom he married the following year. After obtaining a medical degree from the University of Rochester in 1954, Henderson started a residency at a hospital in Cooperstown, New York, but was then required to do two years of military service. Fearing that as a newly qualified physician he would spend his time conducting relatively mundane assessments of new recruits, he instead opted to join the US Epidemic Intelligence Service \u2013 a boots-on-the-ground disease detective unit at the then Center for Communicable Diseases (CDC), responsible for identifying the source of outbreaks and clearing them up.</p> <p>In 1961, Henderson became chief of the surveillance section at the CDC, and established a smallpox surveillance unit in 1962. It was the beginning of a relationship with smallpox that would come to dominate his life.</p> <p>In 1966, the World Health Assembly narrowly voted in favour of undertaking a global eradication campaign for smallpox. When Henderson was approached about leading it, he was initially reluctant: he had only recently been given the green light for a smallpox eradication and measles control programme in west and central Africa which he would lead, and the $2.7m allocated for global eradication was not even enough to buy the required vaccine. The prospects of success seemed doubtful, and many \u2013 including the director general of the World Health Assembly \u2013 expected it to fail.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Henderson accepted the challenge, and moved his family to Geneva to work at WHO headquarters. Having already worked on plans to eradicate smallpox from parts of Africa, Henderson believed that trying to vaccinate everyone against the disease was futile; there wasn\u2019t enough funding nor, as he soon discovered, enough effective vaccine \u2013 quality control tests revealed that just 10% of available vaccine actually protected against smallpox.</p> <p>Instead Henderson focused on surveillance and containment. Understanding that smallpox spreads like wildfire, he asked every health centre and hospital to produce a weekly report; as soon as a case of smallpox was identified, a team was dispatched to identify and vaccinate everyone that that person had been in contact with, and their contacts. He also insisted that everyone regularly rotated through the field, regardless of their seniority. \u201cNo one was allowed to dictate policy from Geneva or Washington who was not out regularly in the field and engaged in the actual work of the effort,\u201d Beyrer recalled.</p> <p>Henderson himself regularly visited smallpox-affected countries and filed detailed progress reports, although he primarily viewed his role as a catalyst: it was the countries themselves that defeated smallpox.</p> <p>Even then, as Henderson often pointed out, they barely succeeded \u2013 and he was sceptical about the potential for ridding the world of other diseases. Three months after the world was declared smallpox-free, Henderson was asked to address a meeting convened to decide which disease should be eradicated next. He said he didn\u2019t think there was any candidate disease. Smallpox was unique in that it was always transmitted person-to-person; you could easily identify who had the disease and who had been successfully vaccinated against it; and there was an effective, heat-stable vaccine that worked even after someone had been exposed to the disease.</p> <p>With smallpox all but gone, Henderson accepted a position as dean of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (now Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) in 1977, although his relationship with the virus continued; he later worked to contain stocks of smallpox in laboratories worldwide, and served as director of the US Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which involved guarding against the possibility of smallpox being used as a biological weapon.</p> <p>However, he considered his greatest achievement to be establishing the base and impetus for the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/benefits_of_immunization/en/\" title=\"\">expanded programme on immunisation</a>, the goal of which is to provide universal access to all relevant vaccines for all at risk. \u201cI believe that the important, longer-term contribution of smallpox eradication ... was its demonstration of how much could be accomplished with how little in the control of infectious diseases through community-wide vaccination programmes,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, Smallpox \u2013 the Death of a Disease (2009).</p> <p>Henderson is survived by Nana, their daughter, Leigh, and two sons, David and Douglas.</p> <p>\u2022 Donald Ainslie Henderson, epidemiologist, born 7 September 1928; died 19 August 2016</p>",

Too often, the post-conflict phase spirals down into a situation of lawlessness, lack of governance and corruption. There is a tendency for violence, including sexual violence, to become endemic, leaving a large number of citizens still at risk. </p> <p>Peace and security mean different things to different parts of the population.

  "<h2>The crisis in America\u2019s public defender system</h2> <p>Ed Monahan, Kentucky\u2019s public advocate and chief defender, describes public defenders as \u201cthe pack mules of the system\u201d. Current statistics are hard to come by, but a 2008 study by the American Bar Association estimated that just 2.5% of the roughly $200bn spent on criminal justice by states and local government every year went on public defenders. Up to 90% of criminal defendants in the US qualify as indigent, and some public defenders are working 150 cases with a budget of just $350 for each. No wonder, then, if the scales of justice tilt against poor peopel. \u201cPack mules can carry a lot. But you put one more box on an overburdened mule, and it won\u2019t be able to function,\u201d says Monahan. In the first of a three-part series, the Guardian and the Marshall Project examine how a cornerstone principle of the justice system has been eroded to breaking point.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/public-defender-us-criminal-justice-system\">The human toll of America\u2019s public defender crisis</a></p> <h2>Brock Turner protesters</h2> <p>Brock Turner, the Stanford student who was released from jail last after serving three months for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/brock-turner-stanford-sexual-assault-case-ohio-armed-protest\">returned home </a>to Ohio to a threatening reception that included activists with assault rifles gathered to protest his relatively light punishment. \u201cWith an extremely lenient sentence, he can think \u2018I can get away with this,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Hardin, armed with an assault rifle. \u201cThe message we want to send is \u2026 \u2018If you try this again, we will shoot you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/brock-turner-stanford-sexual-assault-case-ohio-armed-protest\">Armed anarchists rally at Brock Turner\u2019s home: \u2018Try this again, we\u2019ll shoot you\u2019</a></p> <h2>Trump blasts Clinton\u2019s \u2018disqualifying conduct\u2019; Clinton attacks Trump on tax returns</h2> <p>Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump kicked off the final two months of the campaign with new efforts to drive each other\u2019s poll numbers down.

  "<p>In recent weeks, a list of 26 celebrated London nightclubs that have closed their doors has circulated the internet and social media, to much wailing and gnashing of teeth. \u201cCompletely unacceptable,\u201d thundered Metro. </p> <p>The list is actually slightly misleading. Some of the clubs on it closed decades ago \u2013 evidence not of a vast conspiracy to denude London of its edgy nightlife for the benefit of chain restaurants and luxury-flat developers, but of the fact that the natural, healthy state for dance music and club culture is constant forward motion: like the music and its audience, venues shift and change over time. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a28e6ae8172a9aac67aa7430978ee4d2eacfbd56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a28e6ae8172a9aac67aa7430978ee4d2eacfbd56/99_633_4466_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DJ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Indeed, perhaps the most striking thing about the list is that none of clubs on it attracted as much attention for their closure as Fabric has. The celebrated Clerkenwell venue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/what-happened-to-the-great-london-nightclubs\">Turnmills</a> certainly went out with a suitably hedonistic bang when the lease on the building that housed it expired in 2008 \u2013 the final night of legendary Saturday gay club Trade went on until 6pm on Sunday evening \u2013 but there were no global campaigns to halt its closure, no angry articles in broadsheet newspapers; the London mayor was untroubled by pressing questions regarding his thoughts on the matter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/london-nightclub-fabric-close-permanently-licence-revoked-drugs\">Fabric\u2019s closure</a> has occasioned all these things and more, up to and including a website live-blogging the Islington Council review of its licence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/london-nightclub-fabric-close-permanently-licence-revoked-drugs\">Fabric: London nightclub to close permanently after licence is revoked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s partly down to the sense that London\u2019s club scene is in peril. If the list circulating on social media slightly overstates the case, then there\u2019s still something hugely depressing about the photos you can find online of the former sites of so many celebrated clubs with something vastly less interesting in their place: derelict buildings, offices, a branch of Superdrug. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really about drugs or door searches, [it\u2019s] another step towards a city full of extortionate empty properties and privatised space,\u201d as DJ, producer and boss of dance label Night Slugs Bok Bok put it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ed44fb1b4653482991ea3134880e4d4a2e3f998\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed44fb1b4653482991ea3134880e4d4a2e3f998/0_0_5654_3393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transvestites at DTPM at Fabric, London, UK, 2001.

The sense of disbelief among DJs and clubbers that its licence has been revoked might have something to do with the fact that Fabric was a nightclub that thrived against the odds. It was a 2,500-capacity venue \u2013 with three areas, a state-of-the-art soundsystem and dancefloors equipped with \u201ctactile transducers\u201d that caused them to vibrate in time to the music \u2013 that opened in 1999, just before the clubbing bubble of the 1990s burst. While all around it, \u201csuperclubs\u201d were being forced to scale down operations, Fabric built itself into a globally recognised brand, with two long-running series of mix CDs \u2013 the house/techno based Fabric and the more eclectic FabricLive \u2013 and a separate artist-led label, Houndstooth. </p> <p>\u201cAs an American in Kentucky, the Fabric [mix albums] were my window to the world,\u201d tweeted US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/04/the-black-madonna-favourite-tracks\">DJ The Black Madonna</a> last night. It had faced closure before \u2013 in 2010, it went into administration after its owners got into financial difficulties with another venue, Matter, housed inside the O2 \u2013 but survived. Given the public outcry, the support of London\u2019s mayor and the club\u2019s offers to voluntarily trial sniffer dogs at the doors and even lower the BPM of music played on a Friday night, surely it would survive again? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9f328736032caf2fc825e21162658d26ff76696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9f328736032caf2fc825e21162658d26ff76696/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soulwax.

Fabric\u2019s ethos frequently looked like a deliberate reaction to the depressing excesses of 90s superclubs. It succeeded because it put music first, rather than giving the impression that music was getting in the way of the more pressing business of flogging people branded clothing, exercise DVDs and hi-fi equipment. Its nights were never about attracting custom by way of the most glamorous superstar DJ names, but about booking DJs who were interesting, groundbreaking, ahead of the curve. That may be precisely the kind of policy that\u2019s prevailed in umpteen smaller clubs, but Fabric proved it could work on a much larger scale: if 90s superclubs had showed a marked tendency to treat clubbers as if they were a boggle-eyed bovine mass, Fabric behaved as though they were discerning and knowledgeable. It was a smart move: playing there developed a prestige of its own, as did contributing to its mix CD series. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39bed51595042251ff65e08bd336dd5ff9299f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39bed51595042251ff65e08bd336dd5ff9299f1a/0_0_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DJ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The latter recordings were not attempts to cram in as many big tunes as possible, but to allow respected DJs to do exactly what they wanted, with frequently spectacular results. Some treated them less like compilations than solo albums: most famously, minimal techno pioneer Ricardo Villalobos filled his 2007 Fabric mix with entirely unreleased productions of his own; last year, Mumdance \u2013 another DJ who took to Twitter to express his dismay at the club\u2019s closure <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mumdance/status/773312881978970112\">in forthright terms</a> \u2013 specially commissioned most of the contents of his FabricLive mix, painting a fascinating portrait of UK bass music.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/what-happened-to-the-great-london-nightclubs\">What happened to the great London nightclubs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You could tell how much impact and importance Fabric has had across the spectrum of dance music just from the array of artists and DJs lining up to pay tribute to the club \u2013 everyone from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatyB/status/773244504891686912\">Katy B</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRealBenjiB/status/773322803651219456\">Carl Craig</a>, Holly Herndon to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HudMo/status/773425016310468609\">Hudson Mohawke</a>.

This was the lowest figure since December 2014, and has fallen markedly since peaking at 3% in February.</p> <p>Activity in the housing market has dropped off since the early months of the year, when investors brought forward purchases to beat new stamp duty rates for second homes introduced on 1 April. </p> <p>Since the Brexit vote in June, there have also been signs that buyers and sellers are holding off from entering the market, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/14/housing-sales-forecast-to-fall-sharply-this-summer-after-brexit-vote\">with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) forecasting a sharp fall in sales as a result</a>. </p> <p>Halifax said pointed to falls in both instructions to sell and mortgage approvals.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s housing economist, Martin Ellis, said: \u201cHouse price growth continued the trend of the past few months in August with a further moderation in both the annual and quarterly rates of increase. There are also signs of a softening in sales activity.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe slowdown in the rate of house price growth is consistent with the forecast that we made at the end of 2015. Increasing difficulties in purchasing a home as house prices continued to increase more quickly than earnings were expected to constrain demand, curbing house price growth.\u201d </p> <p>Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, which helps wealthy clients buy homes in the South-east, said a year ago many would have regarded such a slowdown in house price rises as cause for concern.</p> <p>\u201cBut in today\u2019s environment they are curiously reassuring \u2013 as they are further evidence that the post-Brexit property market is making a soft landing rather than slumping,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWith both supply and demand falling, the result is a benign stalemate \u2013 with average prices creeping up as the number of sales falls.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Halifax\u2019s latest figures \u201cdemonstrates that the Brexit vote has scarred demand more than supply\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cLooking ahead, the forthcoming stagnation of households\u2019 real incomes, as inflation picks up and firms moderate hiring plans, will subdue consumer confidence and constrain prices. </p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s decision to cut bank rate to 0.25% last month, and likely further reduction to near-zero by the end of the year, will do little to revive the market, because lenders are widening spreads to account for the greater risks of lending during a slowdown.\u201d</p> <p>Tombs said he expected house prices to \u201cedge down\u201d over the next six months, and to bottom out at around 3% below their pre-referendum peak.</p>",
  "<p>War-torn Syria\u2019s water supplies are deteriorating fast, triggering migration and disease and stoking a pollution crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, hydrologists and humanitarian groups have warned.<br></p> <p>\u201cWater security continues to deteriorate for many civilians [in Syria].

But the amount of renewable water available in the country has dropped from more than 1,000 cubic metres a year per person \u2013 considered the threshold of water poverty \u2013 to around 700m3 per person since the refugees arrived, Farajalla said.</p> <p>The extra pressure put on Lebanon\u2019s water supplies and sanitation is the equivalent of a sudden 30% increase in population and is now critical, he said. \u201cThis influx of people has had a severely negative impact ... with increasing demand on water, higher generation of sewage that goes untreated and an increase in solid waste that is often disposed of in dumps. All of this has put water resources in Lebanon under severe pressure \u2013 high demand coupled with increasing pollution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople just don\u2019t realise how critical Lebanon\u2019s water resources is. Refugees arriving when there was already a drought really killed us. The human tragedy is worsening, threatening the lives and the livelihoods of both refugees and their host communities through a resource that is supposed to be the source of life.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe [water] situation is getting worse throughout the Middle East region,\u201d said Ashok Swain, director of the International Centre for Water Cooperation, who has co-authored a new book on emerging security threats in the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThe Middle East as a whole has the lowest per capita water availability in the world. At the same time it has also one of the highest rates of population growth. Governments have largely focused on water supply management, through desalination. Current co-operation over water resources is minimal. That needs to change,\u201d he said at a water conference in Stockholm.</p> <p>Co-author Dr Anders J\u00e4gerskog, water adviser to the Swedish government in Amman, Jordan, said water was an indirect security threat throughout the Middle East. \u201cMore attention needs to be paid to water, population, food and energy supplies. These are not direct security threats, like the Islamic State, but rather are growing behind the headlines and may contribute to more immediate threats in the years to come. Food availability, water scarcity and large population migration are all challenges that are set to increase in importance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"277bd67c299963a601fdbb4e9aa35eab674af995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277bd67c299963a601fdbb4e9aa35eab674af995/0_0_3771_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian women till the fields in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian women till the fields in the drought-hit region of Hasaka in northeastern Syria, June 2010.

To take just one example: Turkey seems like a useful ally in wresting territory from Islamic State \u2013 but it insists on also raining fire on the very Kurdish groups, backed by the US, who have been most effective in confronting Isis. So Kurdish fighters help free a Syrian city like Manbij from rule by the so-called Islamic State \u2013 prompting last month\u2019s stirring scenes of civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/isis-kidnaps-human-shields-manbij-syria\" title=\"\">celebrating their liberation from tyranny</a> \u2013 only for those same fighters then to face attack from Turkey.</p> <p>So it is maddeningly complex.

  "<p>It\u2019s been over two years since a leaked report by India\u2019s Intelligence Bureau (IB) sent a chill across Indian civil society. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Foreign-funded-NGOs-stalling-development-IB-report/articleshow/36411169.cms\">NGOs were accused by the IB of reducing India\u2019s GDP</a> by a staggering 2-3% per annum, by campaigning against projects that the Indian government argued to be integral for economic growth. </p> <p>The fallout was profound. NGOs, including Greenpeace, Amnesty and Cordaid, were accused of \u201cserving as tools for foreign policy interests of western governments\u201d by sponsoring campaigns to protect the environment or support human rights. \u201cAnti-development\u201d activities included campaigns against climate change, workers\u2019 rights, or even the disposal of e-waste by India\u2019s massive IT sector. The Ford Foundation was also among those named. For a period of time, all the foundation\u2019s funds coming into India were scrutinised by the Indian home ministry. </p> <p>Accusing development NGOs of being anti-development is somewhat of a paradox \u2013 but it\u2019s a growing global trend. \u201cParticularly for those activists who dare to challenge economic and political elites, the environment in which civil society operates has continued to deteriorate,\u201d reported Civicus, the global civil society alliance, in their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org/index.php/en/socs2016\">2016 State of Civil Society review</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In India, prior to the IB report, there were already constraints and increased scrutiny of NGOs. The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) was introduced in 2010, requiring all NGOs to apply for a license to receive foreign funding. The act was initially targeted at international political funding, but NGOs were included in its remit. </p> <p>Before the leaked IB report, some hailed the increased scrutiny as potentially positive: \u201cThis is good for India; it will force Indians to be more conscious of the role of NGOs and to take ownership for our issues\u201d said G Ananthapadmanabhan at the time, who had been the CEO of both Amnesty International and Greenpeace in India.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/17/youth-in-development-were-tired-of-being-the-topic-of-the-discussion-not-the-leaders-of-it\">Youth in development: 'We're tired of being the topic, not the leaders'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a compelling argument: for civil society to thrive it needs local support. And in India, that support is lukewarm, at best. \u201cThe civil society sector, especially those that receive foreign funding, doesn\u2019t enjoy societal credibility,\u201d says Biraj Patnaik, a human rights activist. \u201cIndian society is fundamentally xenophobic, and faces a post-colonial hangover.\u201d Patnaik explains that the role of the CIA in regime changes around the world during the 1970s, as well as the perception then that it was meddling in internal affairs in India, has left scars that still hurt forty years after the end of the cold war. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But the attack on foreign funding of civil society hasn\u2019t resulted in the sudden rise of domestic donations and supporters, and the optimism of those in the NGO world has faded. Instead, the clampdown has seen many organisations simply fold. It\u2019s estimated that at least 10,000 FCRA licenses, needed to receive foreign funds, have been revoked. Some of this is purely administrative \u2013 organisations failing to submit the proper paperwork. But it was also tactical on the part of the government: requiring short turnaround times, or digital returns for small organisations presents a huge barrier to organisations lacking capacity.</p> <p>The environment for constructive engagement with the government has, as a consequence, been severely constrained. Suman Sahai, founder of the Indian Gene Campaign says: \u201cIf you want to do campaigning [in India], you need to engage with the government. But the current climate is one of total disengagement. The government has shut the door on the NGO sector.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Patnaik agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the current regime is against all NGOs. But their actions clearly show that they are opposed to all NGOs working on human rights. There is little space for dialogue or negotiation on rights issues with the present government.\u201d Human rights organisations have seen their operations constrained and Sahai worries about the culture of fear that has manifested since the IB report. \u201cMost people are staying below the radar,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t even get people to sit on our boards. They\u2019re resigning, fearing harassment from the government.\u201d</p> <p>All NGOs receiving foreign funds now have to re-register for their FCRA license. Organisations with permanent FCRA licenses now have to get these renewed every five years. Most are doing their utmost to comply: \u201cWe\u2019re now trying to change tactics. They want reporting? We\u2019ll kill them with transparency,\u201d says one activist.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/02/the-exhibition-giving-a-voice-to-mumbais-invisible-homeless-population\">The exhibition giving a voice to Mumbai's 'invisible' homeless population</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In India and other countries where civil society is threatened, NGOs need to find new ways to call for change. Some don\u2019t see campaigning approaches, such as Greenpeace\u2019s opposition to coal-fired power stations, or Action Aid\u2019s activism against the mining company Vedanta, as being part of the answer. At the time of the IB report, Greenpeace India faced the brunt of public accusations: shortly after the report was leaked, a Greenpeace staff member was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/12/greenpeace-india-campaigner-prevented-from-travelling-to-the-uk\">removed from a flight</a> on her way to a meeting in the UK. Two years on, the organisation continues to fight government attempts to shut them down: six court judgments against their ban have ruled the government\u2019s actions as unlawful.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe need to think of ways of speaking where we can\u2019t be targeted and closed down,\u201d says Jayati Ghosh, from Jawaharlal Nehru University. \u201cWe need to persuade people about the validity of what we\u2019re saying, that environment doesn\u2019t have to be a trade-off for development.\u201d<br></p> <p>This is a tall order in a country where poverty is so overwhelming. For the vast majority of Indians, thinking long-term about whether climate change can be solved by organic farming and clean energy seems irrelevant when you simply want a roof over your head and some food on the table, or for your children to go to school. <br></p> <p>But it\u2019s unlikely that the trend will reverse, in India or elsewhere. Civil society everywhere is under threat, including in the UK, where charities receiving government funding are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/06/charities-barred-from-using-government-grants-to-lobby-ministers\">being prevented from using those funds to campaign against government policies</a>, a move which appears to silence the government\u2019s critics. It may not be on the scale of the Indian clampdown, but it\u2019s certainly on the spectrum. <br></p> <p>Protecting the voices of NGOs and activists seems to be one of the biggest challenges facing the development community. Retreating from hard-edged campaigning and failing to challenge government is clearly not the answer. But if challenging governments in developing countries isn\u2019t done while building support from the local community, it risks failing altogether.<br></p>",

He went on to claim that Abe had been fooled by industry experts who claim that nuclear is the safest, cleanest and cheapest form of energy for resource-poor Japan.</p> <p>\u201cHe believes what he\u2019s being told by nuclear experts,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cI believed them, too, when I was prime minister. I think Abe understands the arguments on both sides of the debate, but he has chosen to believe the pro-nuclear lobby.\u201d</p> <p>After the Fukushima crisis, Koizumi said he had \u201cstudied the process, reality and history of the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower\">nuclear power</a>, and became ashamed of myself for believing such lies\u201d.</p> <p>Abe has pushed for the restart of Japan\u2019s nuclear reactors, while the government says it wants nuclear to account for a fifth of Japan\u2019s total energy mix by 2030.

But it also alludes to a real-life journey in a private jet the pair took together when they were thought to be barely on speaking terms, returning from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/08/uk.northernireland\">negotiations at St Andrews</a> in Fife, that appeared to trigger the thaw in their relations.<br></p> <p>Little is known about what, if anything, was said in their conversation during the trip, but the idea was enough to plant a seed in the mind of Nick Hamm, the Belfast-born director of The Hole and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/03/killing-bono-neil-mccormick-review\">Killing Bono</a>. Hamm says: \u201cPaisley and McGuinness not only had a friendship but also a semi-political relationship of need. There\u2019s no doubt that these two individuals were implacably opposed to each other, but what fascinated us was how these two people \u2013 so different in age, morality and politics \u2013 ended up having a friendship. And it was a friendship that to a certain extent underpinned the peace agreements after 2006. If they hadn\u2019t had that relationship, it\u2019s my understanding that the back-channelling that went on after that would not have been so successful.<br></p> <p>\u201cHow do you dramatise that? We knew for a long time that Northern Irish politicians often travelled together, to avoid getting shot or blown up, basically. They had an underlying agreement, even though they never admitted it. That for us was the starting point.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f6b4039c430ad071523622250ddd4c7ab516996\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f6b4039c430ad071523622250ddd4c7ab516996/0_133_1861_2571/724.jpg\" alt=\"Writer Colin Bateman.\" width=\"724\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Writer Colin Bateman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Crispin Rodwell/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The script for The Journey was written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/colin-bateman\">Colin Bateman</a>, the prolific Northern Irish novelist, who says that the lack of concrete information made his job a little easier, and allowed for some manipulation of detail to improve the film\u2019s dramatic potential. Bateman says: \u201cIt would be difficult to set a film on a small jet so we made the decision to put the film in a car; that allowed us to stop, have them get out, and things like that.<br></p> <p>\u201cAfter the script was written, we went and met with both the Paisley and the McGuinness camps, and they each told us completely different versions of what happened on the plane. The Paisley side said: \u2018Oh they got on fine, they were joking and laughing right from the start.\u2019 The McGuinness side said: \u2018Nothing happened, they just said hello.\u2019 That freed me up. At the end of the day, all films based on historical events are fiction anyway \u2013 even documentaries. If you weren\u2019t there, you\u2019re just putting things together afterwards. This is drama: we\u2019re not pretending it\u2019s 100% fact; it\u2019s a story that explores how things might have got to where they are today.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Journey takes place in 2006, during negotiations for what became known as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/17/northernireland.devolution1\">St Andrews agreement</a>: these were talks aimed at restarting the Northern Ireland Assembly, which had been in effective suspension since a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormontgate\">police raid on the Stormont offices of Sinn F\u00e9in in 2002</a>. In the intervening period, Paisley\u2019s Democratic Unionist party, which had opposed the 1998 Good Friday agreement, had overtaken the Ulster Unionists as Northern Ireland\u2019s largest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-185487,00.html\">unionist</a> party. The uncompromising Paisley therefore became the central figure in the St Andrews negotiations, and the presumptive nominee for first minister should agreement be possible.<br></p> <p>McGuinness\u2019s position was equally critical: he was chief negotiator for Sinn F\u00e9in, who by 2003 had become the largest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/08/nationalists-northern-ireland-elections-good-friday-agreement\">nationalist</a> party in the Northern Ireland assembly. However, Bateman says, at the start of the St Andrews talks \u201cthey had literally never spoken to the unionists\u201d, and, according to Hamm, refused to cooperate with the UK government in security matters, and were not part of the unspoken travel agreement. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have any of that,\u201d says Hamm. \u201cThe Northern Ireland office used to rent private jets, and we knew the one that McGuinness and Paisley shared had been rented from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/05/chris-de-burgh-family-values\">Chris de Burgh</a>.

We wanted to be respectful of both parties\u2019 ideologies. You can watch this film as a nationalist and feel equally uncomfortable and celebratory as anyone from the unionist side. Otherwise we are wasting our time.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ultimately, however, The Journey\u2019s success is likely to be judged by how it fares outside the UK and Ireland, where Paisley and McGuinness are far less well-known figures, and where their individual political stances will be less resonant. Hamm is confident that it will translate. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about two people who are relatively unlikable, and represent relatively reprehensible views, culturally speaking, to most people as we understand it. Neither was that popular, in global terms, but we are trying to say something about the nature of politics: in the end, you have to talk.

While stopping short of calling for a blanket ban, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/rspb-calls-for-grouse-shooting-estates-to-be-licensed\">now says shooting estates should be licensed so that authorities have power to ban them if needed</a>.<br></p> <p>Avery said a ban would be a test of whether Theresa May delivered on her promise to work for more than just a privileged few. \u2018I\u2019m delighted that over 120,000 people have supported this petition and that it will be discussed in parliament. Grouse shooting is underpinned by wildlife crime.

I don\u2019t think a Conservative government will turn round and ban grouse shooting, which is, after all, the Tory party at play, but the government will look hypocritical if it doesn\u2019t take proper measures to enforce the law.

The streets are clean, without discarded needles, and homes well kept. There are no clusters of people milling about on corners.</p> <p>The impact is clear, though, above the city, on a mountaintop that once was mined for coal but is now home to a rehab center, run by Mountain Comprehensive Care, one of the town\u2019s largest employers. The center is the temporary home to dozens of men and women drawn from all across eastern Kentucky; all are intent on ridding drugs from their lives, or following a mandate that they do so.</p> <p>One of them is Jerri Baird, 27, raised in a small home four miles from the closest town. Her dad was a nurse, and her grandfather mined coal. She started using drugs at 14. Her stresses came from many directions, including growing up gay in a Pentecostal church. \u201cI was bad in school. Didn\u2019t ever feel I fit in. Grandfather smacked me in the face when he found out I liked women. Strong coalminer slap. Right across the face.\u201d</p> <p>Like many others, she notes the drugs offered relief from the boredom. \u201cThere was nobody doing nothing where I come from. Nobody working. Nothing.\u201d When I asked her what she planned to do when back in town, she looked quizzical. \u201cLike for work? I mean, there are no good jobs around. I done a few things. Clerked at restaurants, gas stations. Those sort of things. But that isn\u2019t much of work to brag about.\u201d</p> <p>The loss of coal and the increase in drug use is felt in the heart of the community, in churches similar to the House of Worship.

  "<p>A Gabonese hospital founded more than a century ago by a Nobel peace prize-winning doctor to atone for colonial crimes is in the grip of a funding crisis that could force it to close.</p> <p>The Albert Schweitzer hospital in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, a town of 25,000 45 miles south of the equator, cannot pay its bills because funding from the government, which is struggling to cope with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/17/oil-price-slump-true-cost-uk-economy\">global slump in oil prices</a>, has not arrived.<br></p> <p>At the same time, more than a century after its French-German founder arrived in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, the hospital has been embroiled in a row about racism and corruption, with several former high-ranking hospital officials believing it would be better if it closed down.<br></p> <p>Albert Schweitzer, a doctor, philosopher, missionary, musician and ecologist, travelled up the Ogoou\u00e9 river in 1913 to \u201cmake atonement for all the terrible crimes\u201d committed by Europeans in Africa by building a hospital in what was then French Equatorial Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb088a133d14de79c8218e77d97a6f5a419cf75e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb088a133d14de79c8218e77d97a6f5a419cf75e/0_0_3258_3953/824.jpg\" alt=\"Schweitzer outside the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 hospital in December 1964.\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schweitzer outside the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 hospital in December 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Schweitzer, awarded the peace prize in 1952 for his ethical theory of reverence for life, was renowned for founding the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 hospital, which treated patients whether or not they could pay. Winston Churchill called him a \u201cgenius of humanity\u201d; Time magazine, the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-greatest-man-in-the-world-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-albert-schweitzers-death-46962\">\u201cgreatest man in the world\u201d</a>.</p> <p>However, his hospital may soon admit its last patient. \u201cIt\u2019s quite common that the money comes late,\u201d said, Daniel Stoffel, president of the board. \u201cBut now it\u2019s half a year. Until now, we\u2019ve been able to pay salaries, but not more. It\u2019s getting more and more difficult.\u201d<br></p> <p>Among locals, the hospital still has the same reputation as it did in Schweitzer\u2019s time. Whoever you are, come and you will be treated. Payment is calculated according to what each patient can afford.<br></p> <p>Elderly women who have been using the hospital all their lives plod up the hill, loudly thanking God that they can get free treatment. In the maternity ward, the families of new mothers spread out across the beds and floor, chatting. Children play football in the road outside the art therapy room, and the few cars go at a snail\u2019s pace to avoid interrupting their game. There is a decidedly village feel.<br></p> <p>But at its higher levels, the hospital has been in the grips of a struggle for control between the Gabonese authorities and its European supporters.<br></p> <p>The Europeans say some senior Gabonese staff in the hospital, now departed, were stealing money from it, though the allegations have been denied. Gabonese staff have in turn accused the Europeans of racism and colonial views. In one incident, staff protested in the hospital grounds holding a coffin bearing the name of a director they accused of racially oppressing them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/gabon/giv-226011p85EzUv8QPm/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/gabon/giv-226011p85EzUv8QPm/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>The only Gabonese director in the history of the hospital, who claims he was pushed out, said he would not be surprised if it closed, blaming the manner in which it had been run. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad, and it\u2019s contradictory,\u201d said Dr Antoine Nziengui. \u201cThere is neocolonialism at the Albert Schweitzer hospital. And the hospital runs the risk of closing. If in the 21st century, you don\u2019t run things well, you\u2019ll close.\u201d</p> <p>The current director, a French national, reportedly spent a week in prison because he alleged links between Gabonese staff at the hospital and officials in the justice system. Another former director, who was also arrested and held for several days, says he fears for his life and that he will not return to Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9.<br></p> <p>Still roamed by descendants of the pelicans that Schweitzer loved, the grounds of the hospital are now a mix between old and new. A large donation in the 1970s allowed the institution to construct new buildings \u2013 the original whitewashed buildings and their treasures stay locked up, disturbed only when a curious visitor makes the four-hour journey from Libreville.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb4bf51297601f59a559f9e4b61cb41a501d3649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4bf51297601f59a559f9e4b61cb41a501d3649/0_115_3696_2217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Albert Schweitzer hospital is located in the heart of the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 rainforest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Albert Schweitzer hospital is located in the heart of the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 rainforest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The staff has also changed since Schweitzer\u2019s day. One of the criticisms levelled at him was that he did not train enough local doctors and nurses. The hospital keeps its tradition of accepting volunteers from Europe for long or short stints but most of the staff are Gabonese \u2013 except the new French director.</p> <p>Nziengui said he was pushed out because the board, which is half Gabonese and half European, did not want a Gabonese person in charge.<br></p> <p>\u201cI can only think that from Schweitzer\u2019s time until 2011, the hospital was run by westerners, and that the board wanted another westerner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same little group from the same countries that have always run the hospital. Everyone resists change.\u201d<br></p> <p>Damien Mougin, another former director who lovingly restored the old buildings into a museum, and who was running the hospital for a stint over the summer, greeted everyone warmly as he wandered its paths and showed off the best views of the river.<br></p> <p>Schweitzer raised money in Europe to pay for the hospital by giving concerts and his piano, in a sealed zinc box, was floated by canoe up to his simple wooden house, where it still stands today, along with his shoes, apron and helmet, his glasses still on the small desk where he worked long hours writing hundreds of letters back home to raise money.

In Britain today, seven million households struggle to pay their bills because of spiralling costs, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/07/jeremy-corbyn-energy-policy-300000-jobs-renewables-ban-fracking-climate-change\">big six energy companies</a> have seen their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/27/bix-six-energy-companies-profits-rise-despite-household-price-cuts\">profits rise</a> by more than tenfold since 2007.

When energy is driven by the needs of people, it will be greener \u2013 because saving the planet is in the interests of everyone.</p> <p>That is why I am today announcing a bold new set of policies which will pioneer a democratic, community-led system of energy supply. Over the course of the next parliament, we will use public investment and legislation to promote the creation of over 200 local energy companies, giving towns, cities and localities the powers they need to drive a clean, locally accountable energy system with public, not-for-profit companies.</p> <p>At the heart of this policy will be a new generation of community energy co-operatives. We will create 1,000 of these co-operatives with the support of a network of regional development banks, and legislate to give them the right to sell energy directly to the communities they serve. </p> <p>At the same time as building a new publicly run, locally accountable energy system, we will invest in the high quality homes and insulation needed to make Britain environmentally sustainable. We will create a National Home Insulation programme to insulate at least 4m homes to energy efficiency standard B or C. In the private rented sector, we will set compulsory standards at the same level and end the misery of cold rented accommodation. This would save millions of people money on their bills as well as saving energy that is currently wasted on poorly insulated homes.</p> <p>In order to have any hope of keeping the rise in temperature to 2C \u2013 let alone meeting our Paris agreement target of 1.5C \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says\">we need to keep 80% of fossil fuels in the ground</a>. This can and must be done. Scotland is already on course to generate 100% of its electricity from renewables, and Britain has an ample supply of wind and water. In government, I will commit to generating 65% of Britain\u2019s electricity from these sources by 2030.</p> <p>All of these measures will create secure, skilled employment for hundreds of thousands of people. As part of our transition to a low-carbon economy, we estimate that we will create 316,000 jobs in wind, solar and wave power. We will use a \u00a3500bn national investment programme, with a National Investment Bank and a network of regional development banks, to ensure that these jobs and opportunities are created in places where they are most needed \u2013 in coastal towns and areas with high unemployment.</p> <p>Too often, environmental catastrophe is explained in the same terms as an asteroid hitting the earth. But the problems and the solutions are political \u2013 they are about the prioritisation of profit over the needs of people and, at the heart of it all, a lack of democracy in how decisions are made. By democratising our energy supply, and giving people power over their own destinies, we can rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind.</p>",
  "<p>While growing up in Pakistan, Julie struggled with a sense of identity. Something was always gnawing away at her, never fully apparent.

Here\u2019s what some of our readers said:<br></p> <h2>\u2018I wanted to meet him on my terms, to shift the power balance\u2019</h2> <p>I was abducted and sexually assaulted when I was eight. He was a serial rapist and has been in jail serving his sentence since 1986. <br></p> <p>I have been in a very long relationship with this man that I don\u2019t know. It is strange to be so impacted by and connected to someone you don\u2019t know. I wanted to meet him on my terms, to shift the power balance, but also to humanise him rather than demonise him, as our society would see us do.</p> <p>It is a powerful connection \u2013 a horrible one, but a powerful one. I wanted to give him some things I had been carrying and wanted to let go of, and to take back some things he took from me. I also wanted to show compassion, and to create a connection. After living almost 30 years with feeling such an intense range of emotions \u2013 hatred, anger, guilt, shame, vengeance, depression, etc. \u2013 I needed to shift my experience and live from a lighter place. <br></p> <p>Truthfully, too, I was curious \u2013 what is this man like? Is he as unstable as has been suggested by his behaviour and reports at the parole hearings? The only way to know some things is to go to the source. And he is the source of so very, very much for me and mine. <br></p> <p> Everyone should have the right to restorative justice. Not everyone will want to do it, and people may feel differently about it at different points of their journey. I look forward to a day when it is seamlessly integrated into the system.<br></p> <p><em>Anonymous, Vancouver</em></p> <h2>\u2018I needed my voice to be heard\u2019<br></h2> <p>My 15-year-old died after taking ecstasy. I went through restorative justice with the drug dealer. We wrote to one another for 18 months. It was an incredibly healing experience. <br></p> <p>I needed my voice to be heard. I wanted to find a positive way through what had happened and for questions to be answered by the person who caused the harm. Through our letters, I got to see that the impact of what had happened lay as heavily on him as it did on me. It helped me hear the voice of the boy behind the headlines, and to have a direct dialogue was important as I needed to lay a few things to rest. <br></p> <p>The world would be a better place if everyone had the opportunity to take part in restorative justice. <br></p> <p><em>Anonymous, Oxfordshire</em></p> <h2>\u2018I overthought his answers and questioned his sincerity\u2019</h2> <p>Someone broke into our home and threw a pair of garden shears at my husband.

I didn\u2019t know what to do, I felt ignored and lost. When we were given this opportunity, I wanted to do it as I needed him to become a human being. To me he was a mystical figure, he was a horrible monster with no compassion. <br></p> <p>I didn\u2019t find it helpful though. The meeting itself was good and afterwards I felt very positive. About two hours after the meeting I fell into a pit of despair. I overthought his answers, I berated myself for forgetting to say things and I questioned his sincerity.<br></p> <p>Absolutely people should have access to restorative justice. It didn\u2019t work for me but I can see how it could for other people. I can imagine it being incredibly powerful. It should be an option for people to explore, but it needs to be looked at carefully as I think in some cases it could make things worse. Scenarios of domestic violence in particular are not appropriate for restorative justice, as the victim may feel obliged to accede to an offender\u2019s point of view without speaking up for themselves. <br></p> <p> Access to restorative justice should not be limited to region and should be made available as part of a global strategy to empower victims and rehabilitate offenders. </p> <p><em>Anonymous, South Wales</em> <br></p> <h2>\u2018I began to remember the raw beauty of life\u2019s paradox of love, of loss and of hope\u2019</h2> <p>My father was murdered in Toronto.

This little sketch, we learn, takes place at the house of Alan Hill, Clough\u2019s assistant, in June 1991. Saunders describes the scene, with \u201cthe best garden you have ever seen\u201d, waiting in the lounge to discuss a potential \u00a32.9m move. Then, finally, the knock at the door. \u201cGreen sweatshirt, white shorts, white socks, blotchy cheeks,\u201d Saunders recounted. It\u2019s classic Cloughie colour already. \u201cBlotchy cheeks!\u201d one of the presenters echoes, with a hoot of laughter.</p> <p>Everything starts to get a bit weird. \u201cWe sit down,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cand he walks to the opposite end of the house and sits on the chair with his nose about an inch from the wall, looking at the wall. He doesn\u2019t say anything for about a minute \u2013 just staring at the wall.\u201d Eventually, Clough slides off his chair, down to the floor and on to his knees. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018What the \u2026 \u2019\u201d Saunders went on. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on. A British record transfer, this is supposed to be \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Clough, he said, starts crawling on his hands and knees to where his prospective new signing is sitting. \u201cAt this point\u201d \u2013 and Saunders makes this next remark in the manner of someone knowingly rolling his eyes \u2013 \u201cI started to work out he <em>might</em> be drunk.\u201d (Both presenters laugh.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/07/dean-saunders-recounts-version-meeting-brian-clough-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/522ax\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2698300\"            data-video-name=\"Dean Saunders gives his version of a meeting with Brian Clough \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Talksport\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cfe272e4b0b2ee83375dee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160907clough_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160907clough.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160907clough_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/07/dean-saunders-recounts-version-meeting-brian-clough-video\">Dean Saunders gives his version of a meeting with Brian Clough</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It turns out, perhaps for the benefit of his after-dinner audiences (Saunders gets \u00a31,000\u2013\u00a32,000 a pop, according to his online promoters at www.comedians.co.uk), Saunders is not just a fine raconteur but a budding impressionist.</p> <p>\u201cHe is crawling on the floor,\u201d he says. \u201cHe stops, looks at the carpet and goes: [Clough impersonation]: \u2018Hilly, I like your carpet, son, where did you get that from?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Carpetright.\u2019</p> <p>[Clough impersonation]: \u2018How much?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018\u00a312.99 a square yard.\u2019</p> <p>[Clough impersonation]: \u2018My Barbara would love that carpet \u2013 good choice, Hilly, son.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Already, you get the idea that this is no ordinary anecdote. Yet we are only really warming up. \u201cIt goes on ages, this story,\u201d Saunders told us. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Clough calls the agent \u201cfatso\u201d. He goes into the garden and, according to Saunders, takes one of the flower pots \u2013 \u201cthe best pot you\u2019ve ever seen with flowers spilling out\u201d \u2013 and rips out the entire lot to present to his prospective new signing. Then, one thing leading to another, Clough starts using the flowers as a pretend microphone, persuading Saunders to join him singing Chicago by Frank Sinatra.</p> <p>It is left to Archie Gemmill, according to Saunders, to make Forest\u2019s financial offer, hampered by regular Clough interruptions (strange in itself when Gemmill is only the first-team coach), and when the player finally gets home, head spinning, we get the killer line. Saunders finds his wife inside the door, with her finger to her lips, making a shush gesture. \u201cHe\u2019s only sat in my lounge,\u201d he says, \u201cwith the pot from the garden, and his arm around my mother-in-law. Honest to God \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Everyone in football, especially that era, seems to have a Clough story, but nothing perhaps quite as bonkers as this one \u2013 and I say that as someone who has written a couple of books about the man\u2019s work. It is also, I\u2019m pretty sure, the first time I can remember anyone telling an anecdote this way when it openly references, as a point of humour, the drinking and alcoholism that finished Clough \u2013 an illness some people (among them, TalkSport regular Ray Wilkins, presumably) call it. Sorry to be a dreadful spoilsport \u2013 I\u2019m fully aware I will be told to get a sense of humour, that it\u2019s banter and LOL \u2013 but I\u2019ve started to wonder whether Saunders might be a bit of a pillock.</p> <p>I do have my own drunk-Cloughie story. A year or so after Saunders left Derby (he eventually went to Liverpool), I was in my first job, at the Newark Advertiser, and Clough was invited to plant a tree to mark the opening of a local arts centre.</p> <p>This time, for the record, he was in a suit, not the green sweatshirt. Blotchy cheeks, though. Pissed again. Not exactly Clough in his pomp, with those piercing eyes, the immaculately coiffured hair, the healthy skin and all that precious, peculiar magic from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/10/brian-clough-miracle-nottingham-forest-european-champions-film-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">the days winning league titles and European Cups</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/10/brian-clough-miracle-nottingham-forest-european-champions-film-jose-mourinho\">Brian Clough and the miracle of Nottingham Forest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyway, the tree. Most people would pop it in the ground, sprinkle a bit of mud on the roots and pat it down with a spade. Not Clough. He was down on his knees, flattening the soil with his bare hands, ruining a good suit. Nobody was laughing, though, and more fool me, perhaps, for not putting on a Clough accent over the years and trying to get some mileage out of it. It\u2019s just there are a thousand stories about this man that don\u2019t refer to him being plastered.</p> <p>He was the guy, remember, who once told a colleague: \u201cSinatra met me, you know,\u201d \u2013 and call me a spoilsport, humourless, whatever you will, those are the stories that make me laugh. Not ones about his blotchy cheeks or making an oaf of himself when he was sliding into alcoholism or maybe already there. Not stories I suspect that might have more topspin than a Roger Federer serve.</p> <p>I\u2019m in the minority, though. It\u2019s clearly fair game to go on the radio and tell jokey anecdotes about someone\u2019s drink problem. All the same I hope the Clough family \u2013 Nigel, Simon and Elizabeth, and their own children \u2013 weren\u2019t tuning in. I know what some of the players from Clough\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/19/nottingham-forest-european-cup-hall-fame-brian-clough\" title=\"\">European Cup-winning teams</a> think about it and I put in a call to Hill this week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good after-dinner speech but unfortunately most of it isn\u2019t true,\u201d he told me. \u201cBrian wasn\u2019t drunk, he wasn\u2019t crawling on his hands and knees, he didn\u2019t sit facing a wall, he didn\u2019t mention the carpet once and there was no flowerpot \u2026 it just feels like he [Saunders] has put this story through a very imaginative scriptwriter and this is what they\u2019ve come up with.\u201d</p> <p>All rather awkward, I\u2019m sure you will agree. \u201cBrian liked a drink and we all know he had a situation towards the end but he wasn\u2019t drunk that day at all,\u201d Hill continued. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do the things that have been said and I\u2019ve no idea why he [Saunders] would say them.</p> <p>\u201cBrian arrived with Archie Gemmill. \u2018Hello, Mr Clough,\u2019 Saunders said. \u2018Son, call me Brian,\u2019 he replied. It was all perfectly normal. He didn\u2019t really want to speak to an agent, that\u2019s correct, and we were told it was going to be difficult because Saunders had already agreed a deal with Everton. \u2018It won\u2019t be difficult,\u2019 Brian told him, \u2018we\u2019ll just offer you more money than they have.\u2019 Then off he went up the garden to smell the lavender.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he\u2019d gone, Saunders told me Everton had offered him \u00a38,000. \u2018A month?\u2019 I asked. \u2018No, a week.\u2019 Crikey. I told Brian and his reaction was: \u2018Bloody hell, that\u2019s more than me, our Nigel and Pearcey get together.\u2019 First of all, though, he wanted me to do something. \u2018Smell this flower,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s beautiful.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAfter half an hour Saunders said he would talk it through with his wife and went home. Then at 9pm he rang to say Liverpool had matched our offer and he would rather go there because his father used to play for them. So that\u2019s it. Brian wasn\u2019t drunk, and it\u2019s not fair. There are all sorts of different Brian Clough stories \u2013 I tell some myself, but not derogatory ones, not ones like this.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the damage is done. That eight\u2011minute clip \u2013 \u201cthe funniest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in football\u201d, Saunders concludes \u2013 has gone viral. It is an internet sensation and the Liverpool Echo\u2019s headline on Monday was: \u201cHow a drunken Brian Clough tried to persuade Dean Saunders to turn down Howard Kendall.\u201d Even the Birmingham Evening Mail was running it. \u201cThe following anecdote has nothing to do with our clubs on this patch,\u201d the newspaper explained. \u201cHowever, it is quite possibly one of the best football stories we have heard in the past quarter of a century.\u201d Or, depending who you believe, one of the more ludicrous.</p> <p>Clough had taken his side to the FA Cup final that year, one of six Wembley visits in four seasons. He obviously rated Saunders \u2013 who has been informed that his story is disputed and chosen not to comment \u2013 but, for the most part, he did not need to break transfer records to improve his team. The year before, Clough found Roy Keane playing for Cobh Ramblers and signed him for \u00a347,000.</p> <p>As far as I\u2019m aware, Keane has never told a story, or embellished one, about Clough, with his drink-ravaged face, in that difficult period, 1991 to 1993, when the deterioration set in. Maybe it\u2019s true, as Keane once said, the game is full of bluffers.</p>",

After Lehmans collapsed, more than \u00a365bn of taxpayer funds were pumped in to Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group and a rescue package put in place for Bradford &amp; Bingley.

The official report into what went wrong at RBS, published in 2011, concluded that \u201cmultiple poor decisions\u201d were at the root of its collapse. None of those \u201cmultiple poor decisions\u201d were crimes. At the time of the publication of the report, Lord Turner, then the chairman of the now defunct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-services-authority-fsa\">Financial Services Authority</a>, said: \u201cThe fact that no individual has been found legally responsible for the failure begs the question: if action cannot be taken under existing rules, should not the rules be changed for the future?\u201d</p> <p>He was not necessarily talking about criminal prosecution but more about the City regulatory regime under which individuals are authorised to work in certain financial roles and can be banned from holding particular positions or fined.</p> <p>Eventually prosecutors examined RBS, and in May this year \u2013 eight years after the bank was bailed out \u2013 concluded that there was insufficient evidence of criminal behaviour to bring charges against the bank or former employees.</p> <p>In situations where there have been attempts to launch criminal proceedings against banks, there is evidence that politicians have become anxious about the possible impact on financial markets. In July, a US congressional report revealed that George Osborne, when he was chancellor, warned the US government that criminal charges against HSBC could lead to global financial disaster. His intervention, on which he has not commented, took place four years ago when HSBC \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest bank \u2013 was being investigated by the US authorities for allowing terrorists and drug dealers to launder millions of dollars.</p> <p>Some countries have jailed bankers for cases arising out of the crisis. In Ireland \u2013 which pumped \u20ac64bn into its banks and later had to be bailed out itself \u2013 three bankers were sentenced in July: former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive Denis Casey; Willie McAteer, former finance director at the failed Anglo Irish Bank; and John Bowe, former head of capital markets at Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>In the wake of the crisis, Iceland appointed a special prosecutor, \u00d3lafur Hauksson, to examine the collapsed Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir banks. He has been bringing charges of market manipulation, fraud, embezzlement and fraudulent loans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the banking crisis, the main focus of the policymakers appears to have been keeping the banks afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robert Jenkins, a former Bank of England policymaker who is now a senior fellow at <a href=\"https://bettermarkets.com/\">Better Markets</a> said: \u201cDuring the crisis, [there was] a misplaced judgment on the part of authorities that prosecution would undermine further confidence in the banking system.\u201d</p> <p>The UK did not set up a special commission or appoint an Icelandic-style prosecutor after the 2008 crisis. But in 2012, following the outrage caused by the Libor rigging scandal, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie chaired the parliamentary commission on banking standards. The MPs and peers who sat on the commission were charged with looking at the culture of the UK banking sector and seeing if lessons could be learned about corporate governance.</p> <p>Peasnell argues that public outrage is not enough to send bankers to jail. \u201cA crime has to have been committed. Making a reckless or stupid investment decision does not in itself qualify,\u201d Peasnell said.</p> <p>Tyrie\u2019s parliamentary commission on banking standards led to the prospect of a seven-year jail term for reckless misconduct.

Clinton\u2019s strength appears to be driven by female voters with college degrees, who favor the Democrat in the Post\u2019s 50-state average by 23 points.</p> <p>The rare decision by the Post to poll every state has produced catnip for analysts curious about states that are infrequently polled because of a significant majority enjoyed by one party. The results are occasionally eyebrow-raising.</p> <p>The Post poll, for example, finds a neck-and-neck race in Texas, the evangelically infused home state of the presidents Bush and global energy interests, where Republicans have reliably won since Richard Nixon (not counting the post-Watergate Jimmy Carter hiccup). The poll has Trump up by only two points in Mississippi, which might be seen as friendly territory for him, and which if it was going to vote for a Democrat might have voted for fellow southerner Bill Clinton, which it <a href=\"http://www.270towin.com/states/Mississippi\">did not</a>. </p> <p>In the northern battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, meanwhile, the Post poll reinforces the notion advanced by a number of parallel polls that Clinton may face an unexpected challenge. Both states have voted for a Democrat for president in each of the <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/battleground-states-map/\">past six cycles</a>. </p> <p>But both states have a high majority of white voters combined with pockets of economic stagnation and a Republican party apparatus, especially in Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin, that could conceivably produce a Trump surprise.</p> <p>The Post poll has Clinton up by only two points in each case, compared with average Clinton leads of four to five points in Wisconsin and seven points in Michigan. The poll found Clinton ahead by only four points in Pennsylvania, where in August she averaged a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">nine-point lead</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=MI\" data-alt=\"Michigan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=MI\">Michigan</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=WI\" data-alt=\"Wisconsin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=WI\">Wisconsin</a> </figure>  <p>The Post poll indicates, as other polls have, that Trump may fail to make good on his vow to win his home state of New York.

More than at any time this cycle, the numbers we are seeing can be considered predictive of the election result. But they aren\u2019t all saying the same thing.</p>",

  "<p>A classroom that\u2019s alive with debate is one of the most enjoyable places to learn. It\u2019s also the perfect environment for promoting students\u2019 understanding: children are much better equipped to write their ideas down once they have discussed them. Talking helps students to gather their thoughts, process information and remember it.</p> <p>But there\u2019s an art to holding a successful student discussion. Unless you want your classroom to descend into mayhem, you\u2019ll need to think carefully about how to structure your debate, pose effective questions and keep students on track. Here are some ideas for getting started. </p> <h2><strong>Kick off with a question</strong></h2> <p>At the beginning of the lesson, ask a question that provokes discussion but isn\u2019t heading towards a single, correct answer. For example, what is the one thing you\u2019d most like to change about the world? How would you describe an elephant? Who is the most important scientist in the world?</p> <p>Try posing an either/or question, such as: would you rather travel to the past or the future?

It offers a useful way of making students confident, independent writers and bringing together previous knowledge and understanding. </p> <h2><strong>Ask students to talk each other</strong></h2> <p>Getting pupils to address each other (rather than you) opens up the debate and can help prevent big characters dominating the discussion. When students have contributed, ask for feedback and the class to explain whether or not they agree with what was said. </p> <h2><strong>Try dividing the class into two groups</strong></h2> <p>Get the class to physically divide into two or three groups: those in favour, opposed or those who are undecided. For example: do you agree that the second world war could have been prevented if Hitler had been stopped earlier? Once you have discussed the issue, ask if anyone has changed their minds and get them to reflect on why.<br></p> <h2><strong>Give students time to think</strong></h2> <p>When you pose a question, give pupils up to 15 seconds to consider their responses.

Their capability is questioned \u2013 can she cook? can she raise children? \u2013 along with their sexuality and entitlement to equity or rights. If they fail to meet idealised expectations about how a woman\u2019s body should look, they are deemed incapable of providing care. </p> <p>Sadly, this view of women with disabilities being \u201cbroken\u201d or of less value has been adopted by the women\u2019s rights movement, which has been slow to make space for them \u2013 if not actively resistant.</p> <p>This is hard to understand. Women with disabilities could be the fulcrum of the women\u2019s rights movement. The challenges they face surrounding identity, beauty and duty of care are all issues firmly on the women\u2019s rights agenda. </p> <p>A female friend said recently over lunch: \u201cThank God for the technology which screens disabled foetuses \u2013 it is so easy to get rid of them.\u201d When I objected, I was told it is a woman\u2019s choice whether she \u201cwants a disabled kid\u201d. It is interesting how the discourse of choice and agency is perceived when it intertwines with disability.</p> <p>In countries that allow abortion, disability is often deemed justification for the process. This has put women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements at loggerheads with disability rights groups. The former claim women have the right to make a choice. The latter say such abortions are an exercise in eugenics, reasserting the myths and perpetuating stigma surrounding people with disabilities.</p> <p>Instead of working to create structural and systemic support, such as access to education, employment and public spaces, and reducing barriers for disabled people and their families, the approach is to prevent the birth of children with disabilities in the first place. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If an able-bodied woman were subject to forced abortion or sterilisation, the women\u2019s rights movement would contest it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Consequently, health and women\u2019s rights activists find it extremely difficult when a virus like Zika surfaces, because we are bombarded with messages about the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact of foetal abnormalities, instead of talking about better support. It is a shame foetuses with disabilities are used by the pro-choice groups to open up discussion about abortion rights, while also being used by pro-life groups to push their agenda of expanding abortion bans \u2013 a political game in which disability rights lose.</p> <p>Unfortunately, women with disabilities are often unable to exercise their bodily, reproductive and childcare rights. In a famous case in India, a woman with a learning disability was raped, became pregnant and wanted to have the baby. But the <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/High-court-rules-in-favour-of-abortion/articleshow/4791169.cms\">legal system</a> opposed her right to make that choice. Only disability rights activists fought for her.</p> <p>In Colombia, the <a href=\"http://www.womenenabled.org/pdfs/Columbia%20Press%20Release%20Sterilization%20%20of%20People%20with%20Disabilities%20Eng%20March%2018%202014.docx\">constitutional courts</a> (pdf) ruled that girls with disabilities could be forcibly sterilised, arguing they lacked the mental capacity to make reproductive decisions or protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy arising from sexual abuse.

Over 20,000 Russians, the demographic Goa recently relied on, have cancelled trips. The collapsing rouble and problems in the eurozone are external factors that partly explain the disappearing foreign tourist, but Goa doesn\u2019t help itself. In an IndyaWire.com social media survey, <a href=\"http://indyawire.com/42-per-cent-former-russian-tourists-to-goa-do-not-want-to-come-back-again-says-indyawire-com-russia-survey/\">42% of Russians who had visited in the last four years said they wouldn\u2019t be coming back</a>: Goa was too expensive, too dirty, the taxi mafia too aggressive, women didn\u2019t feel safe, the police were unco-operative.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence supports claims of increased harassment of women. A chef friend from Chandigarh, who worked late in a restaurant, had to switch from a scooter to a car because she was being stalked on her way home. An Italian woman here for 10 days stopped travelling alone after a man tried to force her off her bike at night. And a Californian friend who has lived in India for more than 30 years told me about a new bag snatching gang targeting single females travelling alone in the evenings. Little by little, the foreigners who have settled here, the ones who made the parties and the markets come alive, are going elsewhere.</p> <p>But hey \u2026 good riddance? We don\u2019t need you? Domestic tourism will pick up the shortfall \u2013 after all, it rose 35% between 2013 and 2014. Here\u2019s the rub, though: aside from dramatically altering a place that, in the words of one friend, \u201chas been geared toward foreigners for 40 years\u201d, the bulk of this incoming demographic doesn\u2019t bring much money to the local economy. They generally arrive by the jeep- or coach-load, stay in budget hotels or in their own vehicles, cook their own food if they can or eat all-inclusive, generate huge amounts of garbage and leave.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a rush toward low-quality, pack-em-in resorts, at great environmental cost.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Revenues are falling.

We had school children in, and group of people with learning disabilities came in to do horticulture which they found very therapeutic to the point that 12 out of the 36 came unaccompanied which to them was like climbing Everest,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very proud of that but then the funding was pulled.\u201d</p> <p>In the introduction to the report, Ros Kerslake, chief executive of HLF, said the downward trend predicted in 2014 \u201clooks set to continue and there is a danger that many parks and green spaces may fall back to a state of decline and neglect\u201d.</p> <p>Half of local authorities have sold parks and green spaces or transferred ownership or management to community groups or trusts.</p> <p>And, having exhausted opportunities to make savings and efficiencies, councils are having to raise income in other ways, such as through charges on local development, National Lottery grants for regeneration and charging for services.</p> <p>More than \u00a3850m of National Lottery money has been invested in hundreds of parks across the country</p> <p>Kerslake said: \u201cThese are financially tough times and, if we are to successfully halt the onset of decline in our parks and avoid wasting this investment, we need to come together now to find innovative and sustainable models of funding and maintaining these highly valued community spaces.\u201d</p> <p>A poll of 2,130 people aged 16 and over for the report revealed that only a fifth backed more charges for using park facilities such as car parking or tennis courts.</p> <p>Almost six out of 10 (59%) backed more commercial use of parks such as ticketed music events and fairs.</p> <p>But more fundraising by local communities, more cash levied from local development, further sponsorship by businesses and greater funding from the National Lottery were all more popular options. </p> <p>Mark Camley, chairman of the Parks Alliance, said: \u201cHLF\u2019s findings that the recent renaissance in parks over last 20 years is now coming to an end is of great concern and should be a wake-up call for us.</p> <p>\u201cLocal authorities, voluntary groups and contractors have done an excellent job of offsetting significant budget reductions by working inventively and collaboratively to find new solutions and this is disguising the depth of the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>But he warned parks were at a \u201ctipping point\u201d and called on the government and local authorities to recognise the benefits of parks and fund them appropriately.</p> <p>A select committee inquiry is examining the impact of reduced local authority budgets on these open spaces and considering concerns that their existence is under threat.</p> <p>Communities and Local Government Committee Chair, Clive Betts MP, said:<br>\u201cWhether it is kicking the ball about with friends, joining a parkrun, walking the dog or just relaxing with a paperback, people value their local parks.</p> <p>But with councils under enormous financial pressures and with no legal obligation to fund and maintain public parks, these precious community resources may be at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, chairwoman of ukactive, said: \u201cOur parks are an integral part of our lives, places where we relax, play, and exercise. Such assets need to be protected and prioritised, not threatened with decay and closure.\u201d<br></p> <p>Dr Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, said: \u201cNature conservation and the parks movement share deep roots. Well managed public parks that give nature a home, are an ideal place to have fun and learn about the natural environment.\u201d</p>",

After all, patients, especially in the public health system, don\u2019t always see the same doctor and it\u2019s important to cover or recap important details. </p> <p>I used to greet patients at the door, ensure they were comfortably seated with phone turned off, hearing aid tuned in and notebook ready. I\u2019d exchange a few pleasantries to humanise the interaction. But frankly, I am surprised it has taken me so long to appreciate that no oncology consultation goes far without first relaying the news of \u201cthe test\u201d. \u201cThe test\u201d is an umbrella term encompassing all manner of bloods and x-rays \u2013 haemoglobin, biochemistry, liver function, tumour markers, CT scans, PET scans and the rest. From the moment of their cancer diagnosis, patients are wedded to \u201cthe test\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s different for brand new patients who are resigned to repeating their story multiple times to multiple doctors but when long-term patients return for their regular check-up they have one thing on their mind. So I have learnt to get to the point fast.</p> <p>If the news is good, I tell the patient as soon as we\u2019re out of earshot: \u201cYour tests were fine, come and sit down.\u201d Grips loosen, shoulders relax and some days you can feel the hiss of dissipating tension. When the news is bad, I escort the patient to a chair, make eye contact, and say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the scans found a problem \u2013 we\u2019ll have plenty of time to discuss this.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone does it differently but over time, I have decided this is kinder than, \u201cHow are you? Let\u2019s go over any symptoms before we get to your results.\u201d</p> <p>Every patient has a story about spending sleepless nights and nail-biting days, fearing the worst but praying for a reprieve. When someone cries with relief at a scan that I\u2019d always expected to be normal, I can\u2019t help reflecting on how automatically scribbled test slips have the power to govern people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u201cYour bone scan was normal again. There was no sign of cancer in your spine, only arthritis,\u201d I recently reassured an elderly man with prostate cancer. He suffered from chronic back pain but the moment he mentioned it to a new provider, he scored himself another test. This time, a chiropractor had encouraged him to ask his GP for a scan. </p> <p>Tests crowded his life \u2013 he rued that there wasn\u2019t an event in recent times that hadn\u2019t been disrupted by an appointment or a test, from his nephew\u2019s wedding to his sister\u2019s funeral. Knowing that I\u2019d played a part in his misery, I suggested, giving him a break from tests. \u201cThey don\u2019t really help nearly as much as talking to you and seeing how you are doing,\u201d I said. But his wife was quick to squash his glee, \u201cOh no, I\u2019d go mad not knowing! You must do a blood test at least.\u201d</p> <p>As cancer patients are living longer, they are seeing their oncologists more and many visits are accompanied by some sort of test. In the case of breast cancer, but also others such as prostate and colon cancer, blood tumour markers are used to track tumour activity, with changing markers often triggering costly scans. Patients regard painful and inconvenient tests as the cross to bear if they are to stay alive. After all, without tests how will their oncologist know what\u2019s going on inside their body? For oncologists, writing test slips is as routine as breathing.</p> <p>But the evidence suggests that cancer patients who are not receiving chemotherapy and are not enrolled in clinical trials do not need frequent testing. Depending on the disease, professional guidelines have long recommended against so-called \u201croutine\u201d testing in cancer surveillance but patients continue to receive them. Not all tests are ordered by oncologists \u2013 in a fragmented environment, patients see multiple providers. They order a test hoping it will reveal something that a good history won\u2019t but this is seldom the case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tumour marker measurements in a range of advanced cancers altered management in a mere 2% of patients.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pathology and radiology tests have grown by around 10% each year. <a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/806-costly-care.pdf\">The Grattan Institute estimates the overall cost of wasteful healthcare spending</a> to be as much as a billion dollars.</p> <p>It might seem intuitive that early detection of disease progression through tests might be helpful in instituting or switching therapies, avoiding unnecessary toxicity and guiding therapeutic choices but there is no evidence that a particular test done at a particular interval alone determines a change in course. </p> <p>On the other hand, there is evidence that more tests cause more anxiety. Up to 65% of patients with advanced cancer are said to suffer some form of psychological distress. Undergoing frequent tests, not clearly understanding why and waiting weeks, even months, for results traps them in an unenviable situation. Patients who are preoccupied by test results have been shown to have a worse quality of life. </p> <p>A recent study of more than 2,000 American women with metastatic breast cancer published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that more than a third of their providers were \u201cextreme users\u201d of blood tests and scans. (Here, extreme use was defined as more than 12 tumour marker tests and more than four scans per year.) Patients who were cared for by these providers had a 60% higher cost of care, more hospital-based care and later use of palliative care. A previous study found that tumour marker measurements in a range of advanced cancers altered management in a mere 2% of patients.</p> <p>The overuse of pathology and radiology tests is by no means a problem specific to oncology but cancer patients are among the most heavily investigated, with the direct cost of cancer care in Australia reaching over $4.5bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/hpv-infection-rates-plummet-after-vaccine-with-china-the-next-frontier\">HPV infection rates plummet after vaccine with China the next frontier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Entrenched physician practice is hard to change through guidelines alone. In one study, over 90% of oncologists reported that repeat tests were ordered by someone simply copying the previous order. Without being constrained by rigid rules, doctors must be accountable for the tests they order. Making doctors aware, individually where possible, of the cost of tests, has been shown to influence practice, at least in the short-term. Awareness of the myriad costs of over-investigation must begin early in a doctor\u2019s career. Good clinical practice means asking with every test ordered, \u201cHow will the results change my management?\u201d</p> <p>Patient expectations play a role in the prescribing habits of doctors. Comparisons in cancer are rife. \u201cMy neighbour with the same cancer gets a test every time, why don\u2019t I?\u201d is a common question posed to oncologists. The answer is not to order the test, rather to educate the patient. Patient surveys show a willingness to understand and avoid the harmful effects of indiscriminate testing. A key motivation for enduring tests is a feeling of security but patients need to understand that a good doctor-patient relationship, where concerns are promptly heeded, is no match for a battery of tests.</p> <p>When I tell patients I\u2019d rather not order tests that don\u2019t provide meaningful results in their clinical context, they often ask what else they can do to look after themselves, as if submitting to tests were a proxy for self-care. I tell them that there is growing evidence that they should maintain a healthy weight, eat everything but in moderation, get some form of regular exercise, stop smoking and nurture good relationships. </p> <p>Frequent testing improves neither quality nor quantity of life but these other recommendations nod to the foremost tenet of medicine, first do no harm.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/02/world-cup-japan-uae-shock-loss-reaction\">conquerors of Japan in Saitama last Thursday</a> \u2013 and home to more talented players per head of population than any other Asian nation and third-placed at the 2015 Asian Cup \u2013 seemed to fit the bill. All that was needed to forge a beautiful friendship was a hard-fought match, a show of skill from the Whites\u2019 golden generation and no quarter asked or given. It did not quite happen \u2013 and the Socceroos had much to do with that.</p> <p>The hosts had done their bit before the game. Abu Dhabi can be a sleepy football venue but the city pulled out the stops. It opened the gates, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/free-tickets-offered-for-socceroos-world-cup-qualifier-against-uae\">giving fans free entry into the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium</a>. In they streamed to be told to scream at the warming-up visiting goalkeepers. Prior to kick-off, an impressive tifo spelled out \u201cThe Dream of a Nation\u201d. Three points really would give the team great confidence of returning to the World Cup for the first time since 1990.</p> <p>Australia were not about to oblige even if the early signs were good for the UAE. Mark Milligan seemed to lose his head after suffering an early nutmeg, giving the ball away and scything down Omar Abdulrahman. The bushy-haired playmaker was constantly looking for the ball behind a high defence and sleepy right-back Ryan McGowan offered some early opportunities with Mat Ryan having to come to his rescue. Trent Sainsbury and Matthew Spiranovic also chipped in with vital interceptions and blocks.</p> <p>Yet Australia are Asian champions for a reason. The early passing would not have pleased coach Ange Postecoglou, his white shirt drenched in sweat long before the drinks break that the players enjoyed on the half-hour, yet after 17 minutes Robbie Kruse had the best chance. The Bayer Leverkusen man forced a good save from Khalid Eisa just moments after the goalkeeper had tipped a Spiranovic header over the bar.</p> <p>That\u2019s the way World Cup qualifiers often go, especially in the sweltering Middle East. The coach wants fast and attacking football yet conditions say otherwise. The Socceroos did however improve as the first half progressed and ended fairly comfortable.</p> <p>Abdulrahman tried to do something about that but even talented strikers such as Ahmed Khalil and Ali Mabkhout \u2013 far from their best in this game \u2013 are not always on his wavelength. Still, Abdulrahman\u2019s passing game in the final third is as smooth as ever, even if he is rather more reticent when it comes to work at the other end of the pitch.</p> <p>Despite Abdulrahman\u2019s dislike for defending, UAE stayed compact in a 4-4-2 and didn\u2019t give their guests much space in the middle. The playmaker was active again early in the second half but Australia only looked more and more in control and almost took the lead when Aaron Mooy shook the bar with a shot from the edge of the area. Seconds later, Mabkhout was shooting over from just outside the six-yard box as UAE crafted their best chance.<br></p> <p>There was always a hint of danger from the hosts but never any sense of pressure being built by UAE. Australia, in contrast, increasingly looked like getting the goal that would provide a win that was becoming increasingly deserved. It was almost a clich\u00e9 to say that the game was set up for Tim Cahill to come off the bench and find half a yard and a goal. But it was and so he did with his first touch of the game, getting on the end of a delicious Brad Smith cross. The display was already impressive but combined with the result, it is one of Australia\u2019s best World Cup qualification performances since joining Asia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/socceroos-off-to-winning-start-with-victory-over-iraq-in-world-cup-qualifier\">Socceroos off to winning start with victory over Iraq in World Cup qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UAE then do share an Australian experience with Japan then \u2013 falling prey to a winning Cahill cameo from the bench with the mercury high and the punches to the corner flag low. On Tuesday night at least, the west Asians did not seem ready to knock the impressive Asian champions off their perch and be a major barrier to Australia\u2019s fourth successive World Cup appearance. For all their undoubted talent, Mahdi Ali\u2019s men just were not able to put the cool visitors under enough pressure on a sweltering evening.</p> <p>Perhaps Saudi Arabia can stop the Socceroos, especially as Al Hilal fans will never forget the Asian Champions League final loss at the hands of Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014. The Green Falcons came back from a goal down against Iraq to win 2-1 with two late penalties to move level top of the group with Australia. The Saudis have not been impressive so far but they have been a little lucky. The October game in Jeddah will be fascinating.</p> <p>But when it comes to Asian rivals, maybe the Socceroos will be stuck with Japan. The Samurai Blue recovered from their shock home defeat last week to win 2-0 in Thailand, a victory that was more comfortable than the scoreline suggests.

Asia is the birthplace of nearly half (43%) of all the migrants in the world, with nearly 60% of these migrants moving within the region. Most of Asia\u2019s child migrants are hosted in Saudi Arabia, which also receives the highest number of labour migrants \u2013 the report\u2019s authors say more research is needed to understand the connection between the two. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Globally, Turkey has the largest share of refugees \u2013 including adults \u2013 under protection by the UNHCR, and is believed to host the most child refugees as well. </p> <p>In Africa, nearly one in three migrants is a child \u2013 nearly twice the global average \u2013 and three in five refugees are children. African migrants move both within and beyond the continent\u2019s borders in nearly equal numbers; South Africa and Ivory Coast are the top two host countries for immigrants. But on-going conflict in many countries, in addition to linguistic difficulties between peoples and extremely limited resources to deal with migrant and refugee populations, mean that \u201cthe economic and social pressures of hosting threaten to uproot refugees once more\u201d, the report warns. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/14/thousands-of-migrant-refugee-children-travelling-alone-from-africa-to-europe-says-unicef\">Thousands of children travelling alone from Africa to Europe, says Unicef</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Understanding how and why children move within or beyond their birth countries is hugely important but usually hidden from view, says Dale Rutstein of Unicef\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.unicef-irc.org/\">Office of Research \u2013 Innocenti</a>, which is investigating the multiple drivers that push children to start new lives, and the problems that they face as a result.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe systems we have in place for people fleeing or seeking asylum are focused on adults, and in no way are articulated for children,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are usually based on border control and law enforcement, yet we know that detention for a child is the worst thing that can happen and can create significant problems [for] a child\u2019s development.

There was no degree course when Osborn McCutcheon felt drawn to architecture \u2013 one designed one\u2019s own. His family was not rich but comfortable, part of the tight circle of respectable Methodist Melbourne \u2013 he would later marry his first cousin. He worked in practices in San Francisco and London, and the immaculate line drawings of cathedrals and cottages, wells and windows, were the fruits of a year\u2019s wandering in Europe in 1925. For his first few years at the firm Bates &amp; Peebles, where he had earlier been articled, McCutcheon had a negative income, subsisting on borrowings.</p> <p>That may partly explain the eventual panache of ICI House, its pent-up fullness with ideas. What with Depression and War, there were more bad years than good in McCutcheon\u2019s first two decades\u2019 practice. He designed a number of celebrated Melbourne buildings, including the striped classical <a href=\"http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/736/former-amp-building\">AMP Society headquarters</a> (1932), the vivacious Jazz-Moderne <a href=\"https://urban.melbourne/forum/former-buckley-nunn%E2%80%99s-men%E2%80%99s-store\">Buckley &amp; Nunn men\u2019s store</a> (1933), and the Moderne\u2013classical <a href=\"http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/2382/second-church-of-christ-scientist\">Second Church of Christ, Scientist</a>, in Camberwell (1937). But much of his work was domestic \u2013 commissions for houses from Melbourne\u2019s well-to-do. More formative were probably two and a half hectic years spent with the American military.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The building swayed slightly. In the fish tank on the executive floor \u2026 the water lapped gently from side to side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the US Army Corps of Engineers (Southwest Pacific Area) was established in February 1942, McCutcheon was recruited to head an architectural section which churned out hundreds of designs for military buildings \u2013 huts and warehouses, hangars and hospitals. Major McCutcheon, as he was, nearly came unstuck in New Guinea, bringing home malaria that turned him a vivid yellow, but also a strong faith in dry construction and prefabrication, which he would loudly defend to a sceptical profession (\u201cI have no time for the view that such an approach to architecture inevitably lowers our standards.\u201d).

But he signified his embrace of modernism mainly by living in it, completing an ingenious \u201cpassive solar house\u201d for his family in Mt Eliza, a rural enclave 30 miles from the city, at Christmas 1950.</p> <p>\u2018Kackeraboite\u2019, named after the local creek, was a long slim rectangle the width of a single room, north wall sheathed in glass, with huge sliding doors and banks of operable glass louvres split by a breezeway, sitting on an asphalted concrete slab that acted as a heat bank. Sun that penetrated to the back wall in winter did not hit the slab in summer, regulating internal temperatures. When McCutcheon\u2019s contemporaries Robin Boyd, Frederick Romberg and Roy Grounds hosted Walter Gropius in May 1954, Kackeraboite was the venue of the reception \u2013 the Bauhaus sage wandered fascinated in the surrounding bushland, looking for koalas.</p> <p>By that stage, McCutcheon had been drawn into one of Australia\u2019s most rancorous aesthetic controversies, architecture\u2019s counterpart of William Dobell\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/1943/15672/\">Mr Joshua Smith</a> winning the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-william-dobell-portrait-that-broke-a-friendship-and-divided-a-nation-20141016-10r84z.html\">Archibald Prize</a>. In January 1952, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18256075\">fire had gutted</a> the great Gothic Revival pile of Wilson Hall at Melbourne University. Opinion was starkly divided about how to replace it.</p> <p>The university council initially agreed to an exact rebuilding. But when it baulked at the expense, McCutcheon proposed a far cheaper modern alternative: a <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/vic-notable-buildings/wilson-hall-university-of-melbourne.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">concrete-encased, steel-framed rectangular box</a> with glass curtain walls and brick in-fill, and an interior of Swedish birch incorporating an intricate stained-glass screen designed by Douglas Annand and a chancellor\u2019s throne fashioned by Grant Featherston. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"48c318eab8ac1934da5e7c1b9dab74d53b8378d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48c318eab8ac1934da5e7c1b9dab74d53b8378d2/0_0_1753_2325/754.jpg\" alt=\"Architect\u2019s drawing ICI House.\" width=\"754\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An architect\u2019s drawing for ICI House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Bates Smart McCutcheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The professoriat rebelled. But for a young colleague, Robert Dunster, it evinced McCutcheon\u2019s leadership and urbanity. \u201cWilson Hall was the first building in Melbourne for decades that wasn\u2019t simple or mundane, a house or a factory. And McCutcheon wanted perfection. He wanted a building to stand for a couple of hundred years. And he was able to inspire colleagues, the university and building workers with that idea.\u201d<br></p> <p>McCutcheon scorned flamboyance, but there was a flair to his purpose. The hour\u2019s morning commute from Kackeraboite to BSM\u2019s St Kilda Road studio was spent planning: by the time he arrived, trailing butter paper and cigarette smoke, he had laid out his daily objectives. Dunster recalls an afternoon standing at his boss\u2019s desk awaiting attention. At length, McCutcheon looked up and said: \u201cThree and a half minutes.\u201d Then he resumed his activities for exactly that time before engaging again.</p> <p>When not filling notebook after notebook with emphatic scrawlings, he would be rotating his pencil in his mouth. The tell-tale mark of pencil lead between his two front teeth was a firm in-joke. He abstained from alcohol \u2013 the sherry decanter on the sideboard at Kackeraboite was for the pleasure of visitors. But he was a peerless networker, especially over luncheon tables at Melbourne\u2019s elite Savage Club, connected among politicians and planners, councillors and builders alike. In the 1930s, for example, he had designed the Ivanhoe mansions of the brothers <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/watts-ernest-alfred-11983\">Ernie and Frank Watts</a>, who ran the city\u2019s biggest construction company. In some respects, their partnership in ICI House was foreordained.</p> <h2>Sweet and lowdown</h2> <p>That, but maybe not much else. A walk round Melbourne\u2019s central business district 60 years ago would have revealed a riot of bluestone, sandstone, brick and stucco, with the occasional flash of marble and granite \u2013 and, compared with today, very much more light. That was because Melbourne, like every Australian city bar Perth, and the vast majority of the world\u2019s bigger metropolises, <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/199510132/The-Limited-City-Building-Height-Regulations-in-the-City-of-Melbourne-1890-1955-by-Peter-Mills-1997\">observed a height limit</a>.</p> <p>Melbourne\u2019s, set in 1916, was 132 feet; Sydney allowed 150 feet. These horizontal slashes across Australian skies irked local architects, who argued that their various rationales, about fire safety and urban congestion, were outdated. But by some standards, the allowances were quite generous: London had only just begun tinkering with its 100-foot limit, while Paris (despite the Eiffel Tower) had ruled itself off at 65 feet. Nor did ICI Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ), the antipodean arm of Britain\u2019s sprawling Imperial Chemical Industries, seem a prime candidate to scour the sky.</p> <p>ICIANZ straggled over eight sites in Melbourne, including a termite-ridden archive in an old chemical plant in Yarraville presided over by an aged ex-serviceman with a wooden leg; it had only just retired a logo featuring Britannia staring wistfully out to sea. Its parent, meanwhile, was a waddling, paternalistic bureaucracy, whose own London headquarters was a neoclassical low-rise faced in Portland stone and festooned with sculptures: Millbank was known among chafing middle managers as \u2018Millstone\u2019. ICI\u2019s chairman, <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_LogT24DDJ0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=lord+fleck+venerable+bede&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DjY61r1ts_&amp;sig=eOr7LNrvJxVWXsjlJV6GHlBdCrY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKw8nfn-_OAhWGkZQKHVYMA8cQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20fleck%20venerable%20bede&amp;f=false\">Sir Alexander Fleck</a>, was a childless widower whose passions were hill climbing, tree felling and the Venerable Bede.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"679a4e7e1c207d18cc0484bc3414d52bc103545f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679a4e7e1c207d18cc0484bc3414d52bc103545f/0_83_1080_743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ICI House pictured in 1958.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ICI House pictured in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Sievers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Something at ICIANZ, however, had recently shifted. A generational change in management had placed two younger men at the top: 50-year-old <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/begg-kenneth-gowan-9472\">Ken Begg</a> as chairman and 40-year-old <a href=\"http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/glenn-sir-joseph-robert-archibald-archie-14886\">Archibald Glenn</a> as managing director, who wished to signify their ambitions with a new headquarters. In March 1952, the company had acquired a 2,340-square metre site at one of Melbourne\u2019s highest points, Eastern Hill, where Lonsdale Street protrudes beyond the Hoddle Grid. Aligned with Parliament House and the Treasury Building, it seemed to cry out for a bold, proud building. And McCutcheon was eager to provide it.</p> <p>McCutcheon\u2019s first innovation was a cunning way to meet the spirit of the height limit while defying its letter, proposing a rectangular \u2018tower-type building\u2019 of 203 feet that would occupy only 41% of the block at ground level; the rest of the block would be allotted to a courtyard garden featuring public artwork of the kind with which he had enriched Wilson Hall. McCutcheon soothed the anxieties of the State Building Regulations Committee by persuading them that approval for ICI House need not prelude rampant development: section 214 of the Uniform Planning Regulations entitled the committee to modify rules without amending them. But nobody missed the implications when The Herald<em> </em>foreshadowed the plans in May 1955: \u2018New Skyline for City?\u2019 read the headline.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Fire Brigade was anxious. Not only was the height limit calibrated by the reach of their ladders and water jets, but the 360-degree view of Melbourne they enjoyed from their watchtower, only 200 yards from the site of ICI House, would be disrupted. To placate them, McCutcheon incorporated into his building elaborate fire protection measures, including a pioneering sprinkler system above the fifth floor. Others were also discomfited. The Eastern Hill block was not only home to the Salvation Army, but also several brothels. Not so much could be done in design terms here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"99cff13fb827d0056c1c8577ecb3c01196cfcc69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99cff13fb827d0056c1c8577ecb3c01196cfcc69/0_104_2085_2605/800.jpg\" alt=\"ICI House cafe in 1958.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Office cafe, 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Sievers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortunately, the atmosphere was one of excitement. Melbourne was about to sample something hitherto confined to the get-ahead United States. <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/boyd-robin-gerard-penleigh-9560\">Robin Boyd</a>, not only an adventurous architect but a popular arbiter of architectural taste, used his bully pulpit in The Herald to welcome the slashing of \u201cthe red tape which restricted Melbourne\u201d. In the lineage from the Tower of Babel to the Eiffel Tower, here was a skyscraper worth the name: \u201cThis is a clean, precipitous tower in the best tradition. Elbow room is the first essential for effective skyscraping, and the ICI has that.\u201d ICI had actually obtained even more elbow room than bargained for: having applied for permission to erect to 203 feet, it was approved to build to 230 feet thanks to the transposition of the \u20183\u2019 and the \u20180\u2019 by a Melbourne City Council typist.</p> <p>Yet height was only the most obvious feature of McCutcheon\u2019s design. Externally and internally, it was absolutely <em>au courant.</em> Without, McCutcheon clad ICI House in gleaming glass curtain walls to north and south that would flood the interior with natural light \u2013 a homage to New York\u2019s UN Building and Lever House. Within, he offered vistas of uninterrupted space, a pioneering open plan, by quarantining the building\u2019s services, such as lifts, plumbing and air conditioning, in a discrete 275-foot service tower, initially behind the core tower, then at right angles \u2013 a solution adopted in Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.embarch.com/chicago-inland-steel-building/\">Inland Steel headquarters</a> (1957) and San Francisco\u2019s <a href=\"http://untappedcities.com/2011/12/09/architecture-spotlight-one-bush-plaza-a-place-of-international-style/\">Crown Zellerbach Building</a> (1959), classic glass curtain wall skyscrapers whose construction was concurrent with ICI House.</p> <p>Perhaps the cleverest feature, meanwhile, was something the public never saw. Drawing on his experiences with the US Army, McCutcheon made extensive use of prefabrication and dry construction: floor units, beam encasements, concrete spandrels, panels of the west and east walls and the synthetic granite panels enclosing the service tower were all fabricated off site.</p> <p>This, then, was a bold experiment. To be on the safe side, McCutcheon trialled several features, including the curtain wall detailing, service tower and reliance on prefabrication, in another smaller building in William Street, a headquarters for brickmaker Humes, whose construction was proceeding just in advance of ICI House. But it would be an underestimate to see Australia\u2019s first skyscraper as a triumph of technology. It was a testament to McCutcheon\u2019s personality, his calm authority, that Begg and Glenn bought into his vision so comprehensively. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ICI telling McCutcheon it wanted a glass box for its headquarters,\u201d observes heritage architect <a href=\"http://www.lovellchen.com.au/ICIhouse.aspx\">Peter Lovell</a>. \u201cIt was the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>The activity, moreover, formed part of a general building boom, unmatched in Australia since the 1880s. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t simply about modernism,\u201d says Philip Goad, deputy dean of architecture at Melbourne University and author of the history <a href=\"https://www.batessmart.com/bates-smart/studio/recognition/publications/150-years-of-australian-architecture/\">Bates Smart</a> (2004). \u201cIt was about modernisation, a sense that the country now had to get its act together.\u201d After two fallow decades, more than a score of tall office buildings would be completed in Melbourne between 1955 and 1960. It excited rivalry too. The final unveiling of plans in April 1956 was front page news in the Sydney Morning Herald, beneath the shocked headline: \u201cMelbourne to have tallest building.\u201d In due course height limits would stand no chance against the urges of oneupmanship.</p> <p>BSM benefited: the firm was commissioned to design a second ICI House (1957), at 10 storeys, on Circular Quay, and handsome headquarters for Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance (1957-1960) in Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and Hobart. But Melbourne was the place to be. As EA Watts Pty Ltd began to manoeuvre the steel skeleton into place in May 1957, ICI had to erect a viewing platform for the benefit of \u201cpavement superintendents\u201d \u2013 the crowds, sometimes running into hundreds, who gathered round the site each day, including one man who would come every single morning, without exception, for nearly two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bcb18b5463172c44ca3bf843fa2742585445d0ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb18b5463172c44ca3bf843fa2742585445d0ef/0_0_2745_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ICI House interior in full colour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It wasn\u2019t simply about modernism\u2019: an ICI House interior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bates Smart McCutcheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watts\u2019 workforce was itself a cross-section of the new postwar Australia: Australians and Englishmen alongside Italians, Greeks, Dutchmen, Americans, Yugoslavs, Poles and Egyptians, building their futures by making up to <strong>\u00a3</strong>50 a week. They worked speedily and harmoniously, completing the framing by Christmas, and the flooring systems within six further months. They paid a price too: three workers died, two in falls from height. Struan Gilfillan, then the most junior architect on the BSM team assisting McCutcheon, and today the last survivor, recalls the headlong rush: \u201cTowards the end I was doing much of my work on the site. You\u2019d design something one day, it would be built the next day, and you\u2019d be inspecting it the day after.\u201d</p> <p>Though ICIANZ\u2019s Begg and Glenn were interested clients, BSM exerted a control over the project that by modern lights seems quite extraordinary, even designing the custom-made furniture, manufactured by Collingwood\u2019s Hunt Son &amp; Oliver, with contributions from Grant Featherston. For browsing architectural eyes, there was much to see. The pilotis harked back to the <a href=\"http://www.villa-savoye.fr/en/\">Villa Savoye</a> (1928) in Pouissy \u2013 the prototype modernist dwelling, designed by Le Corbusier. The landscaped courtyard garden, with its <a href=\"http://www.paulhagon.com/playground/nla/geo/pi/nla.pic-an25110332\">fountain sculpture</a> by Gerald Lewers, was patterned by John Stevens on a similar feature of the <a href=\"http://modern-brazil-architecture.blogspot.com.au/2009/12/ministry-of-education-and-health.html\">Ministry of Education and Health</a> (1936) in Rio \u2013 the original International Style office building, designed by Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer under Le Corbusier\u2019s sway.</p> <p>The entranceway steps, which subtly slow the visitor\u2019s transition from outside to inside, are a Japanese motif. The interior reliance on wood \u2013 warm and easy on the eye \u2013 shows Scandinavian influences. All of it encased in a characteristically American building typology for a British multinational client \u2026 and in an Australian city.</p> <h2>An Australian landmark</h2> <p>Height\u2019s allure could be dark also. Fifty-eight-year-old PMG technician Ben Edwards had not been himself for some days. Since starting a course of blood pressure tablets, he had been forgetting things, feeling panicked. Could he be going out of his mind, he asked his GP. And though assured otherwise, he hesitated to go to work in Flinders Lane on 6 November 1958, before deciding he must. </p> <p>At 1.45pm, having drawn his pay, he asked leave from his superior to sort out some money orders. Two hours later, he became the site\u2019s fourth death, plummeting to the pavement of Albert Street from the roof of the nearly complete ICI House, passing by two window cleaners, who took him for a large bag. The next week his wife received two money orders, although no note, and the coroner returned an open verdict. (The 25-year-old investigating constable who deemed there \u201cno suspicious circumstances\u201d also played back pocket for St Kilda. Allan Jeans went on to be a sainted name in Australian rules \u2013 in Melbourne, you are never far from football).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b44b1a009c11150bf3f36cbcefa7319033101eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b44b1a009c11150bf3f36cbcefa7319033101eb/118_62_983_1228/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Osborn McCutcheon\u2019s speech notes, written on the back of an old memo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Osborn McCutcheon\u2019s speech notes, written on the back of an old memo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bates Smart McCutcheon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When ICI House was opened a fortnight from Christmas, the fascination it exerted was more obviously wholesome. In his speech to assembled dignatories, British chairman Fleck spoke of \u201can Australian landmark\u201d, \u201ca Commonwealth occasion\u201d, and of the duty borne by companies \u201cto see that the buildings they commission shall be not only appropriate to their needs and efficient, but also aesthetically satisfying\u201d. McCutcheon\u2019s speech notes, dashed off at typical speed on the back of a memo, capitalised the word DIGNITY next to a lower case efficiency. And it is fair to say that of the 20,000 citizens who took the opportunity to tour ICI House during the ensuing Open Week, very few were enticed by its efficiency. On the contrary, the building seemed the last word in worker comfort, from its 100-seat ground floor theatre and Wales banking chamber, to its top floor 400-seat cafeteria with uninterrupted views for 70 miles in each direction and gleaming Gaggia coffee machine.</p> <p>By day the air conditioning system and sealed windows, maintaining a constant 20C and 50% humidity, were a revelatory relief from summer swelter \u2013 not to mention the pampering indulgences like the roof garden, sub-basement recreation rooms and 12th-floor staff lending library. By night, with 5,500 electric lights, ICI House blazed like a Chinese lantern. \u201cProbably no other building project since \u2026 the Exhibition Buildings in 1879 has captured Melbourne\u2019s imagination as much as this glass-house giant,\u201d reported The Herald, whose cartoonist \u2018Weg\u2019 (William Ellis Green) depicted ICI House as a vitreous mountain while a suited businessman ran towards three mischievous cricket-playing boys. \u201cPlease! Kids!\u201d he was exclaiming. \u201cDon\u2019t play here!\u201d</p> <p>Such critics as had existed were disarmed. The ageing artist Norman Lindsay had denounced the glass box as \u201ca final triumph to modernistic art, with its cry of death to all beauty\u201d. As if to head the charge off, ICIANZ began amassing what became <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34939812?q=ici+australia+art&amp;c=book\">Australia\u2019s most extensive corporate art collection</a>, including works by Arthur Boyd, Arthur Streeton, John Brack, Sidney Nolan and \u2026 Norman Lindsay. The collection complemented a building that was itself a kind of art object.</p> <p>A 20-minute ICI movie, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUG0HLOwwBI\">Skyscraper Story</a>, painted its headquarters in heroic hues. Soaring towards the clouds reflected in its glass, ICI House was the perfect subject for the cool, functionalist, objective photography of Wolfgang Sievers. Arising <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-140508210/view\">like a mirage</a> beyond the foliage of Parliament Gardens or <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-140510360/view\">contrasted with the antique</a> Lonsdale Street, ICI House appealed to the alert and discriminating urban eye of Mark Strizic.</p> <p>Particularly reveling in the attention was the company\u2019s public relations manager, Peter Ryan \u2013 later, at Melbourne University Press, one of Australia\u2019s most distinguished publishers. For him, the building was an \u201cunimaginable boon\u201d, redefining what had been a rather dour and inscrutable enterprise: \u201cFor a time, editors and journalists from all over Australia would do almost anything to be invited on a personal tour of inspection, accompanied by lunch in the splendid private dining room.\u201d Through Ryan, Geoffrey Blainey was employed to write a company history of ICIANZ, on which he worked in ICI House for a year. \u201cIt was very handsome from the outside,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIn the low skyline of that era it stood out like a glass trophy.\u201d Like many a worker since he was less enamoured of the open plan, which affirmed a personal preference: \u201cI like rooms with walls.\u201d</p> <h2>Breaking glass</h2> <p>Another significant and sincere admirer also withheld a little of his approbation. Robin Boyd was then embarked on his seminal modernist critique of The Great Australian Ugliness (1960), with its denunciation of the local taste for busy and obtrusive \u201cfeaturism\u201d. He welcomed ICI House, relieved that \u201ceven in a frantically featurist society a non-featurist building can be a success\u201d. Here was \u201cas good a representative of the crystallised mid-century style as can be found anywhere in the world\u201d, particularly ingenious in its \u201cclever separation of service and office areas\u201d, which were \u201cnicely complementary to each other in strength and proportion, like male and female.\u201d At the same time, part of him shrank from its implications: in future corporate design suites, he speculated in The Puzzle of Architecture (1962), there might be \u201cno seat \u2026 for the architect, let alone a throne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoyd saw that office building could become a formularised system,\u201d says Melbourne University\u2019s Goad. \u201cWith the standardisation of work spaces, the exterior mattered little in the long run, and architectural aesthetics were unnecessary, which worried him greatly \u2013 because at the other end of the spectrum were the Eero Saarinens and J\u00f8rn Utzons, one-off gymnastic performers. In an architecture of extremes, how do you teach beauty? How do you judge whether the Opera House is spectacular, or just an ugly spiky thing? So although he admired ICI House, it also caused him grief.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c33674cf8566b1fd9409dae2b2fcdf3811804f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c33674cf8566b1fd9409dae2b2fcdf3811804f67/0_0_3225_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Melbourne skyline including the old Gas &amp; Fuelbuildings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Melbourne skyline including the old Gas &amp; Fuel<br>buildings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Age/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, too, grief had come McCutcheon\u2019s way, and more directly. At first, the only problems with ICI House were minor, even amusing. It was found, for example, that the building swayed ever so slightly \u2013 at the top, about \u00be of an inch in a 80mph gale. The only place this was perceptible was in the fish tank on the executive floor, where the water lapped gently from side to side \u2013 BSM\u2019s solution was a thick black line round the top of the tank.</p> <p>Then, just before Christmas 1960, one of the glass panes shattered into tiny fragments. It was such a shock that, at first, a sniper was suspected. But then another shattered, and another. \u201cEveryone hoped that it wasn\u2019t anything major,\u201d recalls Struan Gilfillan. \u201cYou always accept a few breakages. But pretty soon they seemed to start falling like confetti.\u201d Altogether, 71 panes of the Pan-O-Glass from Belgium\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Belge d\u2019Exploitations Verri\u00e8res would shatter, and it would be more than a year before any explanation emerged. In the hiatus, timber canopies had to be erected over nearby footpaths.</p> <p>BSM smarted. \u201cOh, we were shocked and horrified,\u201d remembers Gilfillan. \u201cThe criticism from architects at other firms was endless. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re from Bates Smart? You did <em>that</em> building, did you? Well, fancy that.\u2019 We were very relieved when the scientific analysis was done.\u201d Research by ER Ballantyne of the CSIRO\u2019s Building Research Division sheeted the blame to the manufacturer, explaining how the Pan-O-Glass was fatally weakened by nickel sulphide impurities, particles smaller than the head of the pin, as they expanded and contracted in Australian temperatures. That Ballantyne\u2019s paper, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21036804?q&amp;versionId=25028407\">Fracture of Toughened Glass Wall Cladding</a>, ICI House, Melbourne (1961), was another world first was little consolation. ICIANZ\u2019s announcement that it was replacing all the panes on the west wall at a cost in excess of \u00a350,000 made for an unwelcome front-page headline in the Herald in March 1962.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not only can you see out both sides of Orica House, but the views are \u2026 well, they\u2019re to die for</p> <footer> <cite>Philip Goad</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Glass curtain walls would prove problematic in other ways too. ICI House was an expensive building to operate, air conditioning absorbing nearly 40% of the building\u2019s running costs. Others experienced difficulties still more pronounced. In January 1962 the AMP Society clawed back for Sydney the mantle of the location of Australia\u2019s tallest building, opening a 25-storey tower at Sydney Cove, but when the sun got the better of its unsheltered northern curtain wall it became virtually uninhabitable. When its architects, Peddle Thorp, were sought to design a headquarters for Custom Credit on St Kilda Road, the commission specifically referred to \u201ca dignified building \u2026 not a flimsy glass box \u2026 something to reflect the stability of the credit system\u201d. The glass curtain wall lost Australian favour, and was scorned for decades afterwards.</p> <p>In the end, ICI House\u2019s chief legacy became its size, on lists of which it steadily slipped down. Developers, whose ambitions increasingly defined city skylines, used their emancipation from height limits not for aesthetic enrichment but steeper rents; much as Boyd had prophesied, the architect\u2019s role was diminished. Corporate image-making was likewise refined, visible in the contrast between ICI House and <a href=\"http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/4690\">BHP House</a> (1972), the definitive headquarters of the next generation. The former looked as stylish as James Bond\u2019s cigarette lighter; the latter, designed by the mighty American corporate practice Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, as darkly cool as a presidential limousine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"04ffe25b8c1b0f4a8da22fa231be3f0f39de28f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04ffe25b8c1b0f4a8da22fa231be3f0f39de28f8/0_49_1331_964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An office inside ICI House in 1958.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An office inside ICI House in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Sievers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And as it transformed city streets into dark and windy canyons, sucked energy, crammed people and flattened textures, the tall office building began courting a critical eye. \u201cSo here we are,\u201d sighed the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s arch sceptic <a href=\"http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/molnar-george-14136\">George Molnar</a>. \u201cOur boxes are not economical. They are functional in a restricted sense only. They fail in the aesthetics they profess. What made us build them? It is an old story. Unnecessary centralisation in the city through real-estate speculation. They are jungle creatures, rising to the sky for light \u2026 It is not just a question of style. We should aim for a saner conception of our cities.\u201d And one who would have nodded approval was Osborn McCutcheon. <br></p> <h2><strong>A fall from fashion</strong></h2> <p>If he never regretted ICI House, McCutcheon grew to share Boyd\u2019s ambivalence about its unintended legacy. Knighted in 1966 and increasingly required to act as a grand old man of architecture, he enjoined audiences to design more humanely. \u201cWe act for communities; for private and public bodies; and not as creators of monuments to directors or to ourselves,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe test of a building is the human responses it evokes, not its size or glamour.\u201d</p> <p>McCutcheon was strongly influenced by The Club of Rome\u2019s sobering world prospectus The Predicament of Mankind<em> </em>(1968), Paul Ehrlich\u2019s Malthusian prophecies in The Population Bomb (1968), and Ian McHarg\u2019s hopes of ecological redemption in Design with Nature (1969). Some of his writings assumed almost a mystical air: \u201cThe simple man, the quiet man, is moved and has deep satisfaction from earthy smells, the sky, wind, tree; by the storm and night murmurings, by the friendship and companionship of birds and animal life, and the power to plant and tend growing things and to human relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Seventy-year-old McCutcheon then founded, as a joint venture between BSM and engineering firm Rankine &amp; Hill, a unique multi-disciplinary planning consultancy to provide more holistic solutions to what were commonly typed building problems. Urban Design and Planning Associates was led by his son Andrew, who had qualified as an architect, sheered away to become a Methodist minister, then studied social planning in the UK on a Churchill Scholarship. UDPA rose and fell, at one with the planning propensities of Whitlamism, at odds with the intellectual apathy of the Fraser years \u2013 although by standing between rapacious developers and recalcitrant protesters in the 1970s, it did much to save what remains today of Sydney\u2019s Rocks. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/07/story-cities-17-canberra-capital-australia-walter-griffin-ideal-city\">Story of cities #17: Canberra's vision of the ideal city gets mired in 'mediocrity'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the 1980s, ICI House itself looked in peril. Grandiose head offices fell from fashion \u2013 some argued that they were no longer necessary, tied up capital and induced bureaucratic torpor. Some of ICI House\u2019s luxuries, like the lofty cafeteria and roof garden, were sacrificed to economy. When ICIANZ was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/business/ici-australia-shares-drop-sharply.html\">granted independence</a> by its restructuring parent company in July 1997, the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/14/1058034935481.html\">great art collection was dispersed</a>, and the building itself sold to Macquarie Bank. ICIANZ\u2019s descendant, Orica, now occupies only five levels; the building\u2019s top floor is rented by British engineering consultancy Arup.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, however, a new tenant looped Orica House back to its origins: BSM, architectural credits now including the likes of Melbourne\u2019s Crown Casino and Federation Square and Sydney\u2019s Mid City and Police Headquarters, moved into the sixth floor of its most significant building. Observing the new fashion for post-industrial bareness, but also as if to admire its original handiwork, it stripped the suspended ceiling system to reveal the prefabricated concrete flooring so revolutionary in its time. And while the face of the city has changed, the tall building of today being the soaring apartment tower, the thrill of gazing on it from elevation abides. \u201cMany big buildings these days are very fat for economic reasons, which is why you end up with big windowless areas,\u201d says Melbourne University\u2019s Goad. \u201cSo while there are some inefficiencies in the slab plan, the amenity advantages are huge \u2013 potential for cross ventilation, visual connection etc. Not only can you see out both sides of Orica House, but the views are \u2026 well, they\u2019re to die for.\u201d</p> <p>Multiple overlapping heritage protections, and nomination as one of eight buildings on the World Register of Significant Twentieth Century Australian Architecture, have further secured that outlook. Sensing that a touch of Mad Men chic might enhance its rental appeal, current owner Charter Hall has recently begun refurbishing its eight lifts, inspired by the original BSM design fished from a microfiche in the firm\u2019s archives, with Aalto-esque curved timber ceilings that roll gently into the rear wall.</p> <p>What once seemed to dwarf human scale today seems tactfully restrained \u2013 refraining from gobbling its whole block, making good on the ground its imposition on the sky. And what once was a vision of Melbourne\u2019s future now offers a powerful sense of communion with the architectural and social past.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>"
