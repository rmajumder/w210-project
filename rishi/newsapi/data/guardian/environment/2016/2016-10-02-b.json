Katla\u2019s last eruption, in 1918, produced five times more ash than its neighbouring volcano \u2013 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull \u2013 did in 2010, and Katla\u2019s 98-year period of dormancy is unsettling for a volcano that averages an eruption approximately every 50 years. Adding to the jitters is the knowledge that two of Katla\u2019s previous eruptions have followed eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.</p> <p>Everyone agrees that Katla is due an eruption, but <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-katla-crying-wolf-icelandic-volcanos-rumblings-dont-mean-airspace-chaos-is-imminent-64920\">volcanologists are refusing to become excited</a> just yet. They point out that similar quakes have happened in previous decades and that increased earthquake activity is common in late summer, as glacial melt-water increases the pore pressure in underlying rocks. Furthermore, there is no sign of volcanic swelling or rhythmic earthquakes, that often accompany magma movement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/icelands-katla-volcano-eruption-imminent\">Icelandic ash cloud part two? Scientists monitor rumblings of larger volcano</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless Katla is a concern. Like Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, Katla is capable of producing a large long-lived ash-cloud and, if the wind blows the right way, she too could cause widespread disruption to air travel. Studies of Katla\u2019s previous ash deposits show that prevailing winds usually carry ash northwards, but <a href=\"http://blogs.reading.ac.uk/weather-and-climate-at-reading/2016/double-double-toil-and-trouble/\"> southerly plumes travelling towards Europe are not uncommon</a>. Essentially if the eruption carries on for long enough then the winds will swing towards Europe at some point.</p> <p>However, eruptions large and long-lived enough to cause this kind of disruption are not so common from Katla, and more likely we can expect a small explosive eruption in the coming years, bringing a couple of weeks of upheaval to Iceland.</p>",

  "<p>The hydrogen economy has been a long time coming. The use of hydrogen as a replacement energy source for oil and gas has been talked about since the early 1970s when the term was first coined by an engineer at General Motors in the US.</p> <p>It still hasn\u2019t really arrived. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/toyota-vs-tesla-can-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-compete-with-evs-60374\" rel=\"nofollow\">And doubters remain</a>.

Having put in place the architecture and the contracts to ensure that the equivalent of 100% of the electricity needs are sourced from wind and solar by 2020, the Labor government in the ACT is looking at how that clean energy can be used for transport and heating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/21/saving-silver-portable-micro-factories-could-turn-e-waste-trash-into-treasure\">Saving silver: portable micro-factories could turn e-waste trash into treasure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The environment and energy minister, Simon Corbell, recently announced that the two companies \u2013 Spain\u2019s Union Fenosa and France\u2019s Neoen \u2013 that won bids to provide electricity to build large wind farms to supply the ACT <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/act-leads-180m-investment-hydrogen-storage-car-fleet-33870\" rel=\"nofollow\">will invest $180m</a> to develop hydrogen facilities.</p> <p>Union Fenosa, the developer of the Crookwell Wind Farm, will look at how to use hydrogen as a substitute for natural gas in gas-fired generators, either alone or in combination with natural gas; while Neoen will build Australia\u2019s first commercial electrolyser to create hydrogen for vehicles and other uses.</p> <p>Union Fenosa will invest $125m, including a research and development partnership with the Australian National University and ActewAGL Distribution. This will focus on renewable energy power to gas, investigating efficiencies in the production of hydrogen from renewables and how it can then be introduced to the ACT gas network or provide support to the electricity network. A pilot testing facility will also be established in the ACT to produce hydrogen from water using the ACT\u2019s 100% renewable electricity supply.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>For Garth Heron, the head of wind energy for Neoen in Australia, the idea <em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>of building Australia\u2019s first commercial electrolyser came up as part of his company\u2019s tender for the wind contract. He says there are three factors that made him change his mind about hydrogen energy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The first is hydrogen cars. These are often dismissed by EV enthusiasts as being just like petrol cars but with different fuel. That\u2019s not exactly right. Hydrogen cars will use the same electric drive train as EVs, and because EVs are now a major focus of production, half the development problem is solved. Furthermore, in hydrogen cars, the fuel cell \u2013 which is as easy to fill as a petrol car, according to its proponents \u2013 replaces the petrol engine, while in EVs<em tabindex=\"-1\">, </em>it\u2019s the battery that replaces the engine.</p> <p>The second issue is the amount of wind and solar energy used. The biggest input for making hydrogen is electricity. To make hydrogen, you need an electrolyser: electricity and water go in one end, and hydrogen and oxygen come out the other. But the process consumes a lot of power. Heron says that because wind and solar often produce excess energy, driving down wholesale electricity costs, this can then be used to power the electrolysers. </p> <p>The third factor is new technology which means these electrolysers can be switched on and off in an instant, taking advantage of the plunges in the wholesale price of electricity, and also providing network and load support when required.</p> <p>Neoen is teaming up with Siemens \u2013 which built the wind turbines for its big Hornsdale wind farm in South Australia \u2013 and will contribute $55m towards the cost of a 1.25MW electrolyser in the ACT.</p> <p>That\u2019s enough to keep 1,200 hydrogen cars going each year, but initially it will power a fleet of just 20 new-generation Hyundai hydrogen cars, enough to test the infrastructure. Still, that 20 will be the first hydrogen fleet in the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of a hydrogen fleet of vehicles sounds rather old-fashioned,\u201d Garth says. \u201cIt was an idea in vogue about 10 years ago, and people thought that because of battery technology, it made no sense. But then we started hearing more about hydrogen \u2013 from Hyundai and Siemens, and looking at what Toyota was doing, we realised that the technology has moved quite far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted something that was major and long-lasting and could help turn the dial. And we wanted an idea that could attract business and others to the ACT to be part of the hydrogen economy that we hope will come out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Heron says using electricity at low cost means fuel for hydrogen cars might be around 75c/litre. But still, there is more work to be done. \u201cThe main thing holding back the idea of hydrogen cars is infrastructure. We are not there yet. It is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. We need infrastructure there to get cost down but without cars, there is no need for infrastructure. This plan in the ACT is to try to get around the situation. And we\u2019re not saying hydrogen will replace every electric vehicle. We think there is lot of technology that common to both.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7aaee69814e112a19e683ce6c5acf25cdf01aa59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aaee69814e112a19e683ce6c5acf25cdf01aa59/0_196_3629_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hyundai\u2019s hydrogen car, the ix35 Fuel Cell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hyundai\u2019s hydrogen car, the ix35 Fuel Cell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hyundai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Currently Hyundai <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/australias-first-hydrogen-car-launched-with-solar-refueller-63637\" rel=\"nofollow\">has a single hydrogen car in Australia</a> as a demonstration model and plans that its fleet of 20 will come from a new, yet-to-be-released SUV-style vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first order in the world for the vehicle,\u201d says Hyundai spokesman Bill Thomas.

  "<p>In this sporting era where individuals and occasions are proclaimed as the greatest of all time with bemusing regularity, there is quite a clamour at the top of the pile.

Football\u2019s recurring nastiness, much of it amplified by social-media warriors, existed even before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/02/sam-allardyce-manager-england-farce\">scandals of recent days</a> which have tarnished the game\u2019s image further. Cycling and cyclists also operate in an atmosphere dogged by suspicion, as is the case with athletics.</p> <p>It is a shame that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/01/ryder-cup-empty-heads-lager-atmosphere-fans-behaviour\">noisy minority of the Hazeltine crowd</a> may provide the lingering memory of this Ryder Cup, however. The cat-calling is so noticeable because it emerges from an otherwise respectful scene, where the mood as a player lines up a crucial putt can be genuinely spine-tingling. Nothing compares in tour golf, with tribal connection absent for 102 weeks out of 104.</p> <p>Ryder Cup golfers should not be portrayed as honest amateurs, but this event transcends like no other. Even the removal of commercial shackles to the point where many of Europe\u2019s players have not worn caps over the three days, let alone standard sponsored ones, is a positive. Personality is encouraged and likely to be noticed more than it ever would at a Portuguese Open or Honda Classic, say. The shift into foursome and fourball formats in the first two days also test aspects of the game not possible during 72-hole strokeplay events.</p> <p>The key thinking behind getting golf back into the Olympic Games was to take it to fresh markets, towards spectators who would not normally bother \u2013 the Ryder Cup already does that. A cross-section of society, never mind sport, books into and keeps an eye on this occasion every two years. Golf\u2019s problem is the inability to retain that interest.</p> <p>That the players fully buy into the scene is hardly a shock. For the vast majority of every two-year cycle, golf is an individual sport carrying individual aspirations. It can be a lonely place, even for the leading lights. When part of a collective, the idea of working hard for a team and towards a broader goal instantly appeals. Players love it when seeing themselves as a Wayne Rooney or Joe Montana. The negative potential, which always lingers, relates to the player who may miss that crucial putt; just ask Bernhard Langer, who still carries painful memories of Kiawah Island in 1991.</p> <p>The European Tour provided a backbone for the 12-man contingent at Hazeltine but individual targets more often lie on the US equivalent due to blunt economics. Nationalistic fervour surrounds the USA, moreover, whereas the concept of singing and dancing for Europe has always appeared more contrived. Put bluntly, the latter would not exist in another environment.</p> <p>The idea of being a proud European grew due to a dislike of perceived American arrogance, initially propagated by the late Seve Ballesteros. That feeling \u2013 and it has diluted given the residency of so many European players in the state of Florida \u2013 provides scope for golfers to tread where their young friends once did or still do, by feeling part of a team. In progressing through the ranks, there is no dressing-room dynamic. Some struggle with the change in aspiration, Tiger Woods the obvious example, but tend to revel in it more often than not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/02/ryder-cup-2016-sunday-singles-live-rory-mcilroy-patrick-reed\">Ryder Cup 2016: Sunday singles \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That this is team golf rather than individual pursuit is not the only cause for the Ryder Cup\u2019s status. In the Presidents Cup the USA take on the rest of the world minus Europe every two years. Australia\u2019s Jason Day, the No1 player in the world, may be a part of that but that tournament will always be the poor relation.</p> <p>The standard on display at Hazeltine cannot be regarded as irrelevant. The Ryder Cup has risen to the point where even the weakest matches routinely throw up brilliance. The weakest links are stronger than ever before.</p> <p>Emotion has tinged the past week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-dies-87-peoples-champion-the-king\">Arnold Palmer\u2019s death</a> at the age of 87, while not exactly a surprise, immediately preceded this Ryder Cup, meaning dedication was logical. Given that it was he who hauled the sport he loved into competitive and commercial territory, the tributes for once were not remotely over the top.</p> <p>Even Palmer could not have envisaged how a biennial meeting would batter down barriers. That applies to level of play just as much as scale of competition. Nothing compares to the Ryder Cup; golf\u2019s fiercest rivalry and peerless selling point. The greatest of them all? It at least deserves to form a part of that discussion.</p>",

  "<p>Brexit may be the greatest constitutional and political challenge facing Britain in living memory; but Theresa May is determined that it must not dominate the Conservatives\u2019 annual conference in Birmingham this week.</p> <p>Instead, she wants her ministers to get down to the business of creating what giant banners throughout the conference centre call \u201ca Britain that works for all\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the prime minister took the unusual step of addressing the party faithful at the start of the gathering, in addition to the traditional end-of-conference rallying cry on Wednesday, to reassure them she has no intention of backsliding on Brexit \u2013 and, she hopes, to set the issue aside for the next few days.</p> <p>With that aim in mind, May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">told her party three things</a> about how she hopes to ensure that \u201cBrexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it\u201d \u2013 words that have become her catchphrase since the 23 June referendum, but which still raised enthusiastic applause from delegates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/beware-brexit-three-blind-mice-nick-herbert\">Don't trust Brexit 'three blind mice', says Tory former minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she will trigger article 50, and the formal process of negotiating an exit, by the end of March. That sets a two-year clock ticking, within which time Britain must agree new trading arrangements with its EU partners, and most likely some transitional agreement that would apply until Brexit formally happens.</p> <p> Secondly, she plans to pass a grandly titled \u201cGreat Repeal Act\u201d in the new year. It will strike down the 1972 legislation that took the UK into the European community, as it was then, and enshrine the so-called acquis, the body of EU legislation, in UK law so that control of it will be returned to Westminster at the moment of Brexit. </p> <p>That\u2019s aimed at providing stability for businesses, by maintaining the status quo for the time being, while opening up the possibility that legislation originating with the EU could be unpicked over time.</p> <p>This Great Repeal Act, which at the outset will do little more than replicate EU law in domestic legislation, is a pragmatic act of housekeeping: it would be simply impossible for Britain\u2019s lawmakers to run the slide-rule over every piece of EU legislation pre-Brexit to decide what to keep and what to ditch.</p> <p>Yet May is keen to satisfy what her Brexiteer colleagues saw as a key part of the appeal of the Vote Leave campaign: the urge to \u201ctake back control\u201d from Brussels. So she painted the Great Repeal Act as returning Britain to being a \u201cfully independent, sovereign country\u201d. </p> <p>But she was quick to pledge that she had no intention of unpicking EU law in one key area in which Brexiteers whinge about Brussels bureaucracy: workers\u2019 rights. That promise undercuts one of the key warnings of remain campaigners in the run-up to the referendum, that hard-won freedoms including maternity rights and paid holidays could be up for grabs if Britain voted to leave.</p> <p> Thirdly, May repeatedly said she would not give a running commentary on Brexit negotiations or set out Britain\u2019s demands in advance. That was a mistake that her allies feel David Cameron made in his ill-fated EU renegotiations last winter. </p> <p>But May does want to make clear that regaining control over migration is key. However, senior politicians across the EU have repeatedly made clear they believe unfettered freedom of movement to be an indivisible element of the single market, and most experts believe Britain will have to pay some price for \u201ctaking back control\u201d of migration.</p> <p>May herself refused to accept a trade-off between Britain\u2019s economic relationship with the EU after Brexit and the ability to decide who comes to live and work here. Instead, she said, she hopes to negotiate \u201cthe kind of mature, cooperative relationship that close friends and allies enjoy\u201d.</p> <p>Anyone who has witnessed the hard-nosed tit-for-tat of global trade negotiations over recent years, or the uncompromising way in which the EU has handled the many rounds of brutal bailout talks with Greece, knows that appeals to friendship and maturity are unlikely to cut much ice in Brussels, or indeed at the World Trade Organisation\u2019s HQ in Geneva.</p> <p>May knows that very well, too, but she will hope that by flourishing her Great Repeal Act, and setting a hard deadline for Brexit, she has done enough to quieten the grumblings from her own backbenches \u2013 and allow her to switch attention this week to her real political project, to occupy the political centre ground.</p>",

But this doesn\u2019t quite cut it. In the short term, the drop in sterling is already leading to job losses in flower farms in Africa, as they struggle to absorb an effective 10% price cut. In the medium term, uncertainty around the UK\u2019s future trade position means that tea and sugar farmers in Malawi or Mauritius don\u2019t know if future UK sales will expand or drop off a cliff. In the long term, there could be major disruption to the lives of millions of the very poorest if, for example, new deals open up new import routes from emerging economies that squeeze out the least developed countries in Africa.</p> <p>The government must promise that any changes to trade rules will at least do no harm, but preferably benefit the poorest countries in the world. The least developed countries already enjoy duty free access to the UK as part of EU trade rules, so a unilateral commitment to stick with this would be a start. Second, the UK should look closely at how future deals will affect the poorest farmers, and commit to avoid harmful effects and create new opportunities.</p> <p>In his Manchester speech the trade secretary also talks positively about Fairtrade\u2019s work delivering fair prices to 1.5 million farmers in developing countries. Fairtrade can only do its job if there is market access in the first place, and these same farmers urgently need clarity on the UK\u2019s intentions.<br><strong>Barbara Crowther</strong><br><em>Director of policy and public affairs, Fairtrade Foundation</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox presents a myopic view of world trade. Globalisation is not a panacea; there have always been winners and losers as the international economy develops. In the days of Adam Smith, Britain\u2019s industrial revolution destroyed India\u2019s indigenous cotton industry. China was exploited in the opium trade. Calcutta boomed as Englishmen built a European city. Indian agricultural labourers were reduced to poverty.</p> <p>Today, China and India are in an era of expansion, Britain runs a systemic trade deficit and London has become the new Calcutta: the new global rich buy up property as many of the native population are driven into penury. Nothing Liam Fox writes is wrong, it is just selective from a wider whole.<br><strong>Martin London</strong><br><em>Henllan, Denbighshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox correctly argues that international free trade creates increased incomes. However, he ignores the distributional effects of trade. Britain grows but with increased inequality, devastating old industries. China grows and becomes more unequal thereby currently increasing the popularity of Maoist groups. Trade has to involve the compensation of losers with welfare support, retraining and other market interventions if social harmony is to be preserved. Such investments are inadequate in Britain and China.<br><strong>Professor emeritus Alan Maynard</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox writes of the \u201cbrave and historic decision of the British people to leave the European Union\u201d. But the British people en masse didn\u2019t decide any such thing, bravely or not. Even if, in the June referendum, a few more had voted to remain than to leave, the result could only have been more a preference than a decision, since no one could remotely forecast the impact of Brexit (and Fox\u2019s own government department still can\u2019t tell us).</p> <p>There was, however, a very clear message: that the country is almost exactly split down the middle in its preferences, ill-informed as they may or may not have been. Maybe once the impacts of Brexit and the possibilities of reform within the EU have been defined and digested, we should have an informed debate and decision \u2013 but not yet.</p> <p>The government has done nothing to assuage the raw emotions raised on both sides. The country remains divided (and still ill-informed), and the underlying problems that may have influenced the votes have not been investigated, addressed or solved. Liam Fox, instead of wilfully misinterpreting the vote, or trying to rewrite history, should buckle down to bringing the bruised and divided British people together again.<br><strong>Peter Davis</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 The fact that a judge has decided (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/government-must-disclose-legal-arguments-article-50-procedure-peoples-challenge\" title=\"\">Early legal win for anti-Brexit campaigners over article 50</a>, 29 September) that the government should disclose the basis of its claim to prerogative power in relation to the timing and terms of Brexit is to be welcomed. But this is fundamentally a matter of politics, not law, and should be settled in parliament. It is the job of parliament to challenge prerogative power, not to be rolled over by it or to leave it to the courts.

  "<p>Legal ivory markets across the globe must be urgently closed in order to combat the elephant poaching crisis, according to an agreement struck by 182 nations on Sunday. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/Com_II/E-CoP17-Com-II-06.pdf\">decision</a> is significant in intensifying the pressure on countries that still host such markets, which conservationists say provide cover for criminals to launder illegal ivory. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites), gathered this week in Johannesburg, agreed for the first time in its history that national ivory markets should be closed rather than regulated. All international trade in ivory is banned but many countries allow antique and other ivory pieces to be bought and sold domestically.</p> <p>Domestic ivory markets are a highly controversial issue, but the Cites nations agreed unanimously that every country should \u201ctake all necessary legislative, regulatory and enforcement measures to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw and worked ivory as a matter of urgency.\u201d</p> <p>More than 140,000 of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts\">killed for their ivory</a> between 2007 and 2014, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">wiping out almost a third of their population</a>, and elephants are still being killed every 15 minutes on average.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no legal market that doesn\u2019t contribute to the illegal trade,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, at the Wildlife Conservation Society. The Cites decision is not legally binding, she said: \u201cBut there is now the will of the global community to see the end of domestic ivory markets. There is renewed hope for Africa\u2019s elephants today.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Hepworth, a former chair of Cites\u2019 top committee and now at the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation, said the decision would exert real political pressure: \u201cIf your country has a domestic ivory market, this does have a tangible effect.\u201d</p> <p>The final wording of the decision was a compromise and specified domestic ivory markets that are \u201ccontributing to poaching or illegal trade\u201d, a potential loophole. Daniela Freyer, at the Pro Wildlife group, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a step forward. However, the European Union and a small minority of southern African countries are to be blamed for watering down the motion. Elephants deserve better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe believe domestic ivory markets are driving poaching across Africa,\u201d said Patrick Omondi, a member of the delegation from Kenya, which co-chairs the African Elephant Coalition, a group of 29 countries which want a crackdown on the ivory trade. \u201cBut we are happy with the decision: it was the best we could get.\u201d</p> <p>China, the largest domestic ivory market, had argued against the loophole, a move seen as major progress. It has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/29/china-agrees-to-phase-out-its-ivory-industry-to-combat-elephant-poaching\">already committed to close its own ivory markets</a> but has not yet given a deadline. Japan, another large domestic market, said on Friday its market did not contain illegal ivory, although a new <a href=\"http://eia-global.org/news-media/exposed-the-dirty-secrets-of-japans-illegal-ivory-trade\\\">Environmental Investigation Agency report claims to show evidence of illegal activity</a>.</p> <p>International pressure to close domestic ivory markets is building. Nations at a major conservation summit in September also <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/007\">agreed the domestic trade in ivory should end</a>. In September, the UK banned the domestic sale of ivory younger than 70 years old, though critics said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/22/conservationists-and-mps-call-for-a-total-uk-ban-on-ivory-sales\">move fell short of the total ban</a> needed. In June, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/us-adopts-near-total-ban-on-commercial-ivory-trade\">US imposed a near total domestic ban</a>.</p> <p>The Cites nations also agreed for the first time that destruction is an option for the disposal of seized ivory stockpiles, a course already taken by 22 nations. There was further action as well on countries which seen as failing to tackle the illegal ivory trade, with tougher reporting requirements. Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon and Nigeria should all have reported on the measures they are implementing, but have not.</p> <p>The most controversial debates on the poaching crisis will come on Monday, when Cites decides on a proposal by southern African nations to overturn the ban on selling ivory and a rival proposal from 29 other African countries which aims to elephant protections even stricter.</p>",

In earlier days such a question at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Conservative party conference</a> would probably have been scandalous.

Conservatives must beware Brexit fundamentalism, or giving themselves up to a romanticised 1950s vision of Britain, a country of imperialist chauvinism. We should be talking about financial passporting and the need to prevent a haemorrhage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/hard-brexit-will-cost-city-of-london-its-hub-status-warns-bundesbank-boss\" title=\"\">banking jobs from the City</a>, not fixating on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/eu-passport-british-passport-brexit-referendum-home-office\" title=\"\">colour of our passports</a>. We should be discussing how to strike the best deal with our biggest trading partner, not how to relaunch a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/royal-yacht-britannia-should-not-rise-again?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">royal yacht</a>.</p> <p>The idea of Britain as a global trading nation reborn, turning away from an ailing Europe, may superficially be seductive. But our markets on the continent did not suddenly vanish in an act of democratic will. Our businesses still export there. Inward investors with plants in the UK \u2013 major companies such as Nissan \u2013 still want to sell there, and they are worried. They might have thought of selling in Brazil, India or China already without the helpful advice of politicians that they should just try harder.</p> <p>The collective naivety about the ease of doing global trade deals or what they would entail is staggering. One senior minister said there would be a trade deal with New Zealand before Christmas. Another leading Brexit campaigner predicted a deal with India \u201cfaster than you can say masala bond\u201d. Those who talk so excitedly do not stop to consider the inevitable first demand of major agricultural exporters, which is that we drop our farm subsidies. And they clearly haven\u2019t understood that even poor deals take years to complete.</p> <p>A high quality trade deal with Australia would be a great thing \u2013 but it would account for under 2% of our trade. A deal with India would be a prize \u2013 if ever they would open their markets to us. Yes, let\u2019s try to drive trade deals on the far side of the world. Let\u2019s beat our chief executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/golf-businessman-liam-fox-lazy-brexit\" title=\"\">with their golf clubs</a> until they sell more in Bangalore and Beijing. But it\u2019s folly to believe that new trade deals are a simple or swift substitute for unhindered access to the world\u2019s largest market of 500 million people on our doorstep, a bloc with which we do half our trade.</p> <p>In case we don\u2019t notice while we\u2019re \u201cre-joining the world\u201d, to use one particularly glib Brexit slogan, trade deals aren\u2019t exactly flavour of the month with the public. On either side of the Atlantic and the Pacific, big proposed deals are foundering. Voters supported Brexit less in a rush of enthusiasm for free trade than to pull up the drawbridge. Prominent Brexiteers who now preach free trade urged sanctions against imports of Chinese steel during the campaign.</p> <p>So if part of the seduction of a hard Brexit is that there\u2019ll be comfort for us across warm oceans, we need to wake up quickly. There won\u2019t be. That\u2019s why we must above all drive the most advantageous deal possible with Europe. It\u2019s not just a question of ensuring that tariff barriers remain down. The single market removes non-tariff barriers, too, while being in the customs union makes it far easier for businesses to sell into Europe.</p> <p>The ideologues may see it as obvious that we abandon these arrangements as we leave the EU, but pragmatists will want to weigh the consequences and the options. During the campaign, many Brexiteers extolled the virtues of Norway or Switzerland, countries which are outside the EU but retain access to the single market. We should at least understand the costs and benefits of these kinds of options \u2013 if not the exact models \u2013 before peremptorily ruling them out.</p> <p>If there is an emerging consensus, it is that Britain must now have more control of immigration. It suits hardline Brexiteers and European politicians alike to argue that this means a binary choice for the UK, either in the single market with free movement of labour, or outside with control over migration. But weren\u2019t we told, time and again, that Britain is big enough to drive its own bespoke deal? It\u2019s hard to see why it\u2019s wise or attractive to say that what we want from the outset is the most brutal severance with the least advantage to us and the most potential economic damage.</p> <p>The jury is out on the new government structure to deliver our departure from the EU. The so-called<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\"> \u201cthree Brexiteers\u201d </a>have so far rather more resembled three blind mice, stumbling around the world\u2019s capitals with inconsistent messages, united only in their assurance that it will be all right on the night.</p> <p>Business, which above all prizes certainty, is not so sure. Now the politicians who were already inclined to be deaf to business concerns have been emboldened by the apparent resilience of Britain\u2019s economy in the face of a predicted short-term shock. The risk is that important concerns about the long-term impacts of a hard Brexit will be dismissed. We may all be Brexiteers now, but leaving without being able to reassure inward investors or the financial services industry that they will be able do business as usual would be a catastrophe.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\" title=\"\">article 50 trigger</a> that will now be pulled within months irreversibly counts down the clock to our departure. That negotiating process, in which we are shut out of the deciding EU council, will disadvantage our country enough as it is. We should not make it even more difficult by allowing the naive ideal of a new Britannia to get the better of us.</p>",

In truth, if \u201csoft\u201d Brexit is defined as continued membership of the single market, then the fact that May is heading for a hard version is not a great surprise.

For example, there is no such thing as a choice between \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This line of argument \u2013 in which \u201csoft Brexit\u201d amounts to some form of continued EU membership and \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a conscious decision to reject trade with Europe \u2013 is simply a false dichotomy. And it is one that is too often propagated by people who, I am afraid to say, have still not accepted the result of the referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>But May defined \u201chard\u201d Brexit as the rejection of trade with Europe. In reality, though, \u201chard\u201d Brexit is generally taken to mean a Brexit that puts an emphasis on independence, and rejects EEA (Norway) or EFTA (Switzerland) arrangements that involve retaining a measure of pooled sovereignty. May made it clear that this was exactly what she was proposing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we are now talking about is very different. Whether people like it or not, the country voted to leave the EU. And that means we are going to leave the EU ...</p> <p>So the process we are about to begin is not about negotiating all of our sovereignty away again. It is not going to be about any of those matters over which the country has just voted to regain control. It is not, therefore, a negotiation to establish a relationship anything like the one we have had for the last forty years or more. So it is not going to a \u201cNorway model\u201d. It\u2019s not going to be a \u201cSwitzerland model\u201d. It is going to be an agreement between an independent, sovereign United Kingdom and the European Union. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May made it clear that, although she wanted companies to have \u201cthe maximum freedom\u201d to trade with the single market, she would not accept any deal that involved the UK having to accept European court of justice rulings or EU free movement laws.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want it to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market \u2013 and let European businesses do the same here. But let me be clear. We are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again. And we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that workers\u2019 rights would continue to be protected as long as she remained prime minister.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert the \u2018acquis\u2019 \u2013 that is, the body of existing EU law \u2013 into British law. When the great repeal Bill is given royal assent, parliament will be free \u2013 subject to international agreements and treaties with other countries and the EU on matters such as trade \u2013 to amend, repeal and improve any law it chooses ... Any changes in the law will have to be subject to full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate. And let me be absolutely clear: existing workers\u2019 legal rights will continue to be guaranteed in law \u2013 and they will be guaranteed as long as I am prime minister. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the government would invoke article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process, \u201csoon\u201d and before the end of March.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was right to wait before triggering article 50. But it is also right that we should not let things drag on too long. Having voted to leave, I know that the public will soon expect to see, on the horizon, the point at which Britain does formally leave the European Union. So let me be absolutely clear. There will be no unnecessary delays in invoking article 50. We will invoke it when we are ready. And we will be ready soon. We will invoke article 50 no later than the end of March next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is marginally more specific than what May said on the Andrew Marr Show this morning; this morning it was just \u201cbefore the end of March\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Scotland would not have a veto on Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are the responsibility of the government and nobody else ... Because we voted in the referendum as one United Kingdom, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, and we will leave the European Union as one United Kingdom. There is no opt-out from Brexit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She implied that she would block further attempts to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will never allow divisive nationalists to undermine the precious Union between the four nations of our United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected the argument that parliament should take the decision to trigger article 50. </strong>The government is being taken to court over this point, but May said Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, would be in court himself to argue the government\u2019s case. (The attorney general is the government\u2019s chief legal adviser, but it is unusual for him to appear in court in person on behalf of the executive.) She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it legislated to establish the referendum, Parliament put the decision to leave or remain inside the EU in the hands of the people. And the people gave their answer with emphatic clarity. So now it is up to the Government not to question, quibble or backslide on what we have been instructed to do, but to get on with the job. </p> <p>Because those people who argue that Article Fifty can only be triggered after agreement in both houses of parliament are not standing up for democracy, they\u2019re trying to subvert it. They\u2019re not trying to get Brexit right, they\u2019re trying to kill it by delaying it. They are insulting the intelligence of the British people. That is why, next week, I can tell you that the attorney general himself, Jeremy Wright, will act for the government and resist them in the courts.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted a future in which \u201cBritain is always the most passionate, most consistent, most convincing advocate for free trade\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She condemned those politicians (like Labour\u2019s Owen Smith and the Liberal Democrats) who are arguing for a second referendum.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because even now, some politicians \u2013 democratically-elected politicians \u2013 say that the referendum isn\u2019t valid, that we need to have a second vote.</p> <p>Others say they don\u2019t like the result, and they\u2019ll challenge any attempt to leave the European Union through the courts.</p> <p>But come on. The referendum result was clear. It was legitimate. It was the biggest vote for change this country has ever known. Brexit means Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make a success of it.</p> <p>The final sentence is one that May repeated continually over the summer. She used it again this afternoon with the familiarity of a comedian using a favoured catchphrase.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She reaffirmed her intention not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the Brexit talks.</strong> She implied that speculative media stories about the UK\u2019s negotiating position could harm the national interest.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we will not be able to give a running commentary or a blow-by-blow account of the negotiations. Because we all know that isn\u2019t how they work. But history is littered with negotiations that failed when the interlocutors predicted the outcome in detail and in advance. </p> <p>Every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She praised David Cameron for being willing to \u201cput his trust in the British people\u201d.</strong> May said that was her answer to those who said Cameron made a mistake when he called the referendum.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11c78e4b05962fdf4a25b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:41:17.368Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says if the UK wants to be treated with good will in the Brexit negotiations, it needs to act with good will too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b8be4b015be6383365c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:37:37.333Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says he is \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d the government will get a deal that allows EU citizens to remain in the UK.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b34e4b015be63833659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:35:58.135Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Davis says the UK does not want the EU to fail.

After Theresa May told Andrew Marr that she would invoke article 50, starting the formal two-year EU withdrawal process by the end of March, we now have a government commitment to a timetable. The UK has six months at most before article 50 tips us down the slipway towards leaving the EU. In theory at least, once the article 50 letter has arrived in Brussels there is no going back.</p> <p>This is a more important announcement than the overnight one about the \u201cgreat repeal\u2019 bill. It was inevitable that leaving the EU would involve repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, and the press statement from the Tories about the bill said relatively little about what this legislation would look like. But by announcing that she will trigger article 50 before the end of March, May will firmly quash the speculation that has been bouncing around Westminster about the EU withdrawal process being delayed for a year, or even more.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end of March\u201d sounds quite soon, but arguably May is announcing a one-month delay. In public, until now, all she had said was that article 50 would not be invoked this year. But in private she has been telling EU leaders it would be triggered early next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/theresa-may-likely-trigger-article-50-brexit-talks-early-2017\">Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said after a recent meeting with May that he expected the article 50 declaration in January or February.</a></p> <p>Article 50 was easily the key story in the interview, but other bits were interesting too. In particular, May sounded less evangelical about grammar schools than she has done in the past. She preferred to describe the policy in terms of extending selection, and she was very keen to stress that this was only one aspect of a policy document intended to improve standards for everyone.</p> <p>I will post a summary with the main quotes soon, as well as rounding up some reaction.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:33:18.705Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f0cc4de4b015be638334ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:04:04.492Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Are you trying to restore cabinet government?</em></p> <p>May say she wants to ensure ministers are involved as policy develops.</p> <p><em>Q: Was government too informal under Cameron?</em></p> <p>May says the last government achieved a great deal.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329#block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329\">8.42am.) </a>But here are some of the other lines from Tim Shipman\u2019s interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May was more explicit than she has been before about ruling out a general election before 2020.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s right that the next general election is in 2020. This isn\u2019t about political games, it\u2019s about what is right for the country. I think an early general election would introduce a note of instability for people.</p> </blockquote> <p>May has ruled out a \u201csnap\u201d election before, and argued that there is \u201cno need\u201d for an election before 2020. But if May is now saying an early election would introduce \u201cinstability\u201d, then it would be harder for her to justify changing her mind on why there might be a need for a pre-2020 poll.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She hinted that she would not wait until the German elections in September 2017 to trigger article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process.</strong> Number 10 has signalled that it will be triggered early next year, probably in January or February.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the Tories wanted to build \u201ca new centre ground\u201d and that she wanted to appeal to people who had not backed the party before. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there will be many people who have not been traditional Conservative voters who will see we\u2019re the party that is actually respecting their views, listening to their concerns and responding to them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she thought government should be \u201csmall, strong and strategic\u201d. </strong>Asked her view on government intervention in the economy, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in that position of thinking that all government is somehow bad. Government is good. But it\u2019s important that government is small, strong and strategic.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She denied having Margaret Thatcher as a role model.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t had a role model in my political career and I\u2019m not somebody who says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be like X\u2019. I just look at the issues that I\u2019m faced with and get on and do what I believe to be the right thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that, unlike David Cameron, she stayed up late to do her prime ministerial paperwork. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m an owl rather than a lark, so I will tend to work late. I carry on working and do the boxes that I have.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shipman says it is not unusual for May to finish working at 2am. Cameron preferred to get up at 5.45am to get through his ministerial red box.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She took a swipe at Jamie Oliver.</strong> May loves cooking, but not necessarily Oliver, Shipman suggests. He writes:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her approach to the kitchen is as averse to gimmicks and quick fixes as her politics. I suggest that, with time tight, she might make use of Jamie Oliver\u2019s book Jamie\u2019s 15-Minute Meals. \u201cYes, 15-minute meals with 45 minutes of preparation,\u201d she said wryly, followed by a quick \u201csorry\u201d as she realises she is traducing a national treasure.</p> </blockquote> <p>Towards the end of the interview Shipman also includes this unusual, and possibly quite telling, anecdote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a world that has often portrayed her as humourless but the tape of our conversation is punctuated by laughter. The transcription service sent it back with a note saying: \u201cTheresa May is a very nice woman and the transcriber thoroughly enjoyed listening to her.\u201d No one has sent such a message to me about a politician before.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03c29e4b015be6383332b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T08:02:58.172Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory conference policy announcements</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Conservative conference policy announcements from yesterday.</p> <p>I will be updating the list as new policy announcements get made.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">Matthew Taylor, head of the RSA thinktank and former head of the Number 10 policy unit under Tony Blair, appointed to lead an independent review of employment practices in the modern economy.</a></strong> Announcing the move, Tory HQ said: \u201cSignalling the importance she attaches to extending workers\u2019 rights - and ensuring they keep pace with these developments - the prime minister today launches an independent review of modern employment practices.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/dwp-scraps-retesting-for-chronically-ill-sickness-benefits-claimants\">People with the most severe health conditions who receive employment support allowance, a disability benefit, to be exempt from having to undergo regular health assessments to continue receiving payments.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-plans-to-make-the-uk-one-of-the-most-digitally-skilled-nations\">Free training to be offered to adults who lack basic digital skills.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/220-million-for-cutting-edge-new-technology\"><strong>A \u00a3220m investment to help life science companies and universities develop viable business projects.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/building-to-start-on-new-nuclear-submarines-as-government-announces-13-billion-investment\">A \u00a31.3bn investment with BAE Systems to enable construction work to begin on the generation of submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles.</a></strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T07:42:02.312Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May became prime minister this summer with voters having only a relatively hazy view as to what her views are. She had been home secretary for six years but she is something of a political introvert and as a cabinet minister she only gave speeches addressing matters outside her home office brief on perhaps two or three occasions. During the Conservative leadership contest she was all set to elaborate on her thinking during the final stage of the contest. But then Andrea Leadsom pulled out, with the result that only one of the series of speeches May was planning,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf#block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf\"> the Birmingham economy speech,</a> actually got delivered.</p> <p>So that is one reason why this promises to be more interesting than the average Conservative party conference. Normally, if the party leader is prime minister, we already know quite a lot about them. This week, and particularly in her keynote speech on Wednesday, May has the chance to flesh out her politics and to present herself to the country she runs in a sharper focus.</p> <p>But there is second issue that will dominate proceedings too: Brexit. Over the summer ministers have said very little about how they will proceed with the EU withdrawal talks, beyond the vacuous and tautologicial \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. This week, and particularly this afternoon, when the conference holds a session on Brexit, May and her team are going to have to say a little more. Equally importantly, conference fringe meetings on the subject are going to give members and MPs the chance to set out what their Brexit demands are.<br></p> <p>Overnight May has announced that Brexit will involve a \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill. Here is the our story on this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">Theresa May to propose 'great repeal' bill to unwind EU laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>May and the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a>, will use the opening day of the conference to detail plans for their \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill that will allow Britain to \u201ctake back control\u201d of its legislation. The bill will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which gives direct effect to all EU law, and at the same time convert Brussels regulations into domestic law. </p> <p>This will give parliament the power to unpick the laws it wants to keep, remove or amend at a later date, in a move that could be welcomed by MPs who are keen to have a say over the terms of Brexit. The move is also designed to give certainty to businesses and protection for workers\u2019 rights that are enshrined in EU law.</p> <p>Davis will say: \u201cTo those who are trying to frighten British workers, saying, \u2018When we leave, employment rights will be eroded\u2019, I say firmly and unequivocally, \u2018No, they won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9am: </em>Theresa May is interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show.

Two years after it is triggered, Britain will find itself outside the European Union, unless there is unanimous agreement among the other member states to extend the time limit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/brexit-clean-quick-break-article-50-bernard-jenkin\">We need a clean and quick break from the EU | Bernard Jenkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contrary to popular perceptions, article 50 inaugurates a withdrawal process, not a trade agreement. It will involve negotiating essentially technical issues, though important ones \u2013 such as the rights of British citizens in the EU and of EU citizens in the UK \u2013 and can be achieved within the two-year limit.</p> <p>Article 50 does allow for a shadow negotiation on trade matters. But, clearly, the EU cannot conclude a trade agreement with another country until that country ceases to be a member, and it is highly unlikely that a detailed trade agreement can be achieved within two years. When, in 1985, Greenland \u2013 whose population is smaller than that of Uxbridge, and whose one staple industry is fishing \u2013 withdrew, an agreement took three years to negotiate.</p> <p>In any case, EU procedures for ratifying most trade agreements are far more stringent than for ratifying a withdrawal agreement, which requires merely a qualified majority in the council and a majority in the European parliament. A trade agreement would probably require unanimity in the council, a majority in the European parliament, and also ratification in national parliaments as well as in some regional parliaments \u2013 for example, those of Flanders and Wallonia. That involves 36 legislatures, each of which has a veto.</p> <p>Matters would be easier, of course, were Britain to emulate Norway and join the European Economic Area. That, however, was established for countries proposing to join Europe, not leave it. The EEA obliges member states to incorporate not only current EU laws but also future legislation into domestic law, and to accept the principle of free movement. It also subjects member states to review by a European court \u2013 not the European Court of Justice, but the court of the European Free Trade Association \u2013 and requires a contribution to the EU budget. Per head, Norway currently pays around 83% of the British contribution.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a more competitive and harsher world, it will be those most likely to have voted for Brexit who will suffer the most</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the Brexiteers wanted to end the supremacy of European law, supervision by a European court and contributions to the EU budget, this option will hardly satisfy them. It would indeed be worse than EU membership since it would involve EU regulation without representation, a kind of colonial status in which Britain would be dependent on others to look after its interests.</p> <p>Some suggest the Swiss relationship as an alternative. Switzerland has negotiated, over a period of 20 years, some 120 bilateral deals with the EU. These have to be regularly revised and renegotiated to take account of new EU laws, a cumbersome procedure. The EU dislikes this arrangement, and wants it to converge towards the Norwegian model. It is highly unlikely to replicate so broken a model for Britain.</p> <p>Remaining in the EU customs union but outside the EU is open to the obvious objection that when the EU signs a trade agreement with a third country, that third country would have access to British markets but Britain would have no access to those of the third country.</p> <p>Britain therefore may well find itself in 2019 trading under the rules of the World Trade Organisation \u2013 of which it was an original member \u2013 while still negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other countries. WTO membership, if Britain moved towards freer trade, would allow it to benefit from cheaper food from outside Europe \u2013 EU prices on beef and veal are currently around 30% higher than world prices \u2013 as well as cheaper cars, textiles and other goods subject to the EU\u2019s common external tariff.</p> <p>But the irony is that, contrary to the hopes of many Brexiteers, leaving the EU will expose Britain to more globalisation, not less; and in a more competitive and harsher world it will be the \u201cleft behind\u201d, those most likely to have voted for Brexit, who will suffer the most.</p> <p>Brexit, therefore, will be Margaret Thatcher\u2019s revenge. It will suit the vision of the Tory right, which hopes that outside the EU Britain could become like Hong Kong or Singapore, a global trading hub. These two territories have no natural resources except for their brains, which they use to the full.</p> <p>We, by contrast, have a deep-seated skills problem, first noticed by Joseph Chamberlain \u2013 the hero of Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s special adviser \u2013 well over 100 years ago. The priority, if May\u2019s socially responsible capitalism is to become a reality, must be a radical skills policy. That means more resources devoted to further education colleges, currently the Cinderellas of the education service, and to university technical colleges, for those whose skills are technical and vocational rather than academic.</p> <p>In 1950 Britain was asked to engage with the continent by joining the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor of the EU. The then foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/25/are-we-still-capable-of-governing-ourselves/\">Ernest Bevin, declined</a>, warning that once one opened that Pandora\u2019s box, all sorts of Trojan horses would fly out. Today it\u2019s clear that Brexit too will release a multitude of Trojan horses.</p>",
  "<p>A new American isolationism and the transformation of Russia\u2019s global status has led to the \u201cworld order getting out of control\u201d, and \u201cunimaginable things happening\u201d, the international development minister Rory Stewart has said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He also suggested that, faced by a swaggering Russia, there was little that \u201cpoor old\u201d John Kerry or Barack Obama can do in Syria in the final few weeks of their White House administration. He suggested different strategic questions could be asked if Hillary Clinton were elected.</p> <p>In a frank assessment of the scale of global disorder rarely offered by a serving government minister, Stewart warned: \u201cThe world is getting out of control. You look at that whole arc of what is happening in northern Nigeria, in Mali, in Chad, what is continuing to happen in Libya, the problems that persist in Somalia, not to mention what is happening in Darfur, South Sudan, Yemen, Ukraine, in Iraq, in Syria, you are looking at a real collapse of the multilateral system at a time when the United States is increasingly doubtful about what it can do to solve it.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at a fringe meeting organised by the thinktank Radix at the Conservative conference, Stewart added: \u201cA lot of the great driving theories that kept the American public involved have gone, of which the most important from 1946 to 1989 was the fight against communism. That was the way of really motivating the American public to invest and spend on defence. Those ideas have gone now. You cannot motivate the public in the same way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/boris-johnson-russian-complicity-in-war-crimes-precludes-syria-talks\">Boris Johnson: Russian complicity in war crimes precludes Syria talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat leads to a situation in which things are happening that would have been unimaginable 15 years ago \u2013 the Saudis directly intervening in Yemen without the US directly behind them.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart, a former diplomat, is one of the Conservative party\u2019s acknowledged thinkers on foreign policy, and his appointment as minister of state at international development gives him a new platform.</p> <p>Russia, he explained, \u201chas been able to transform its global status in the past three years\u201d, requiring a complete rethink of how the UN operates, and new ways of strengthening multilateral institutions.</p> <p>He said: \u201cRussia has succeeded within the past few years in completely transforming its global position at a time when you thought it would be at its weakest. Its economy is struggling, it is not getting the incomes it would have expected and yet it behaves like a much bigger country than Britain.</p> <p>\u201cIt swaggers its way around. The way it is currently operating in the Ukraine, the way it is threatening in the Baltic states and in Syria would be almost unimaginable a few years ago. What Russia is demonstrating is that they are able, like Iran, to do very, very strange things.\u201d</p> <p>He also admitted that Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, had been saved by Russian military intervention. \u201cAssad was in very real problems two years ago. The likelihood is that he would have lost Aleppo, most of the south and probably Homs as well if Russia had not intervened. Russia has been decisive in that intervention.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the west was in a double bind. He said: \u201cAssad has done genuinely terrible things and it is almost unimaginable that there will be peace in Syria so long as that guy is around, partly because it is in his interests to keep disorder. It is in his interests for terrorists to be there because terrorists are his legitimating principle. It is the way he gets support; to say there are terrorists out there.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cOn the other hand, what are the options facing President Obama? Setting aside the fact there are only nine weeks to go for this administration \u2026 it is pretty difficult for poor old Kerry and Obama to make a strong decisive act at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe model of successfully taking on a Russian-backed central government from the point of view of an opposition was only pulled off by the US once and that was in Afghanistan in 1981-89. But \u2013 there is a big but \u2013 because the success of the opposition to Russia led to the catastrophe of Afghanistan from 1991-2000, you end up funding, if you are not careful, opposition groups that are much more radical than you want them to be and actually when the government collapses it leads to a civil war and the situation comes become worse on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>He said the task was to bring some structure of global order and security back into place, partly by investing in the idea of the United Nations. But, he added: \u201cMy God, that organisation needs reform. We have to be aware that aspects of the UN, some people will remind them in some ways of the issues we had around Brexit \u2013 supranational government, bureaucracies, the way that money is spent, what does this organisation actually do?\u201d</p> <p>He argued that, before greater military intervention could be considered by the UK or the US in Syria, fundamental questions needed to be asked about the role of regional partners, such as Saudi Arabia, the role of the Kurds, the balance of military advantage inside Syria and the future of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, which is due to be attacked by the west in the next few weeks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Financial markets are preparing for an uncertain final quarter of the year as traders fret about Theresa May\u2019s more concrete Brexit timetable, the health of European banks and the US presidential elections.</p> <p>The British prime minister suggested on Sunday that the country\u2019s exit from the EU would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">lean towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>, as she implied regaining control of immigration was more important than access to the single market. May earlier announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 \u2013 the legal device to begin the process of departure \u2013 would be triggered by the end of March</a>.</p> <p>Some traders fear the prime minister\u2019s moves might lead to a swift fall in the value of pound, mirroring the markets\u2019 reaction immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">sterling slumped to a 31-year low</a>.</p> <p>One trader said that financial markets had not taken account of a \u201ctimetabled hard Brexit\u201d when markets closed on Friday evening, meaning the pound could \u201cgap lower\u201d on Monday.</p> <p>However, others argued that the triggering of article 50 in early 2017 was expected, but the debate about what that move would mean would create uncertainty. <br></p> <p>Joshua Raymond, a director at financial trading firm XTB, said he expected volatility in the value of the pound, with both sides of the Brexit argument using the media to sway public opinion to their side of the argument. He believes that the government had hedged its bets by also implying a soft Brexit.<br></p> <p>He said that the prime minister\u2019s indication that the UK would enact article 50 before the end of March could actually be supportive of the pound in the very short term \u201cbecause of the certainty it provides investors and businesses that the roadmap to Brexit has begun\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cHowever, the main support could come from recent comments from both the prime minister and chancellor, who spoke out against the idea of a hard Brexit to end freedom of movement. That leaves the door open for positive conversations about remaining in the single market, which is the markets key area of concern\u201d.</p> <p>The wavering over what Brexit eventually means comes as traders also try to take stock of how prices might be affected by a host of geopolitical issues, such as the increasingly bitter US presidential election.</p> <p>Alastair Winter, the chief economist at the investment bank Daniel Stewart, wrote in a research note on Sunday: \u201cBarclays Bank\u2019s latest survey shows geopolitical developments to have become the biggest concern to investors. Moreover, concern over the developed market economies (i.e. democracies) continues to overshadow those over China and other emerging markets. This suggests rising fears that the \u2018sans culottes\u2019 with their pitchforks will yet storm the great citadels of the west.</p> <p>\u201cIn summary, the political fundamentals are bad enough but may not get much worse soon. Of course ... the economic fundamentals also look grim.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by 6% in the July-September quarter, its best performance since 2013, as the weaker pound pushed up the value of internationally focused blue-chip companies. Sterling, though, fell against the US dollar for the fifth quarter running \u2013 the worst run since 1984.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">What will happen now timescale for article 50 has been revealed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>James Stanley, a currency analyst at foreign exchange group DailyFX, also believes the fourth quarter will be challenging.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some very pertinent themes for markets as we enter the final quarter of 2016,\u201d he said, referring the US election and concerns about the health of European banks following last week\u2019s gyrations in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\">Deutsche Bank</a> share price. The Deutsche sell-off followed reports that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/commerzbank-job-cuts-restructuring\">hedge funds were pulling assets from the bank amid suggestions that Berlin may be forced into a bailout</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s plight has prompted fears that global markets are facing turmoil of the kind triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight years ago this month. </p> <p>Stanley said: \u201cThe big worry here isn\u2019t just one bank getting hit. The bigger concern is a contagion effect; because banks trade with each other and if one major bank gets taken out, this can create a nasty cascade effect across markets as other banks get pinched by counterparty risk. </p> <p>\u201cSo going into Q4 this is the top theme for markets to watch because, frankly, it can have the most firepower. It\u2019s also going to be one of the most difficult to time and follow, as this is basically a liquid situation that will continue to morph and develop as there isn\u2019t a template-response for the European Central Bank to handle such situations.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Russia is deliberately aiding the bombing of hospitals in Syria, committing war crimes that will make it impossible for peace negotiations to begin, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson has said.</p> <p>Speaking to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham on Sunday, Johnson condemned the \u201ccontinuing savagery of the Assad regime against the people of Aleppo\u201d.</p> <p>He said the devastation continued with \u201cthe complicity of the Russians in committing what are patently war crimes \u2013 bombing hospitals when they know they are hospitals and nothing but hospitals \u2013 is making it impossible for peace negotiations to begin\u201d.</p> <p>On Saturday, regime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/-syriaairstrikes-major-offensive-against-rebel-held-areas-of-aleppo\">barrel bombs hit the largest hospital on the rebel-held side of Aleppo</a>, a facility that was already out of action, having been subjected to heavy shelling in the week before, in an attack that the UN branded a war crime. </p> <p>In a speech that was light on policy, Johnson opened with an anecdote about meeting Sergei Lavrov, Moscow\u2019s foreign minister, at the UN last month, who said to him: \u201cIt was you guys who imposed democracy on us in 1990.\u201d </p> <p>Johnson said he had asked British diplomats and their foreign counterparts in the room for a show of hands in favour of democracy. \u201cMuch to my amazement, our opposite numbers just kept their hands on the table and gave us what we diplomats call the hairy eyeball, and of course they felt I was winding them up. And there is a sense in which my question was semi-satirical.</p> <p>\u201cBut the exchange was also deeply serious and revealing about the way the world has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson said he wanted a post-Brexit UK to be unashamed about promoting the values of liberal democracy and free markets around the world. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live\">May says workers' rights will be protected as long as she is PM - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been winded and sometimes lacking in confidence in these ideals, and if you look at the course of events in the last 10 years, I am afraid you can make the case that it is partly as a result of that lack of western self-confidence \u2013 political, military, economic \u2013 that in some material ways the world has got less safe, more dangerous, more worrying,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cFreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to practise whatever religion you want and to live your life as you please. These freedoms are not inimical to prosperity \u2013 they are in fact essential to sustained growth.\u201d<br></p> <p>Johnson criticised what he said had been an \u201cera of dithering and dubitation\u201d and said Brexit should signal a new generation of global engagement. </p> <p>\u201cWe stick up for free markets as vigorously as we stick up for democracy and human rights, and when all is said and done, my friends, and I know that not everyone will agree with this ... I believe that vote <a>on 23 June</a> was for economic freedom and political freedom as well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Johnson gave a cautious signal that he would be prepared to back further military intervention in the right circumstances, citing the British action against the Somali pirates, during the civil war in Sierra Leone and during the Ebola crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIn spite of Iraq, it is simply not the case that every military intervention has been a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we don\u2019t want to wield our hard power; we think an age before we do so. </p> <p>\u201cBut when we give our armed services clear and achievable missions, we can still be remarkably effective, and with 2% of our GDP spent on defence, we will be the leading military player in western Europe for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>British farmers growing wheat typically <a href=\"https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/pusstats/surveys/documents/arable2014v2.pdf\">treat each crop</a> over its growing cycle with four fungicides, three herbicides, one insecticide and one chemical to control molluscs. They buy seed that has been precoated with chemicals against insects. They spray the land with weedkiller before planting, and again after.</p> <p>They apply chemical growth regulators that change the balance of plant hormones to control the height and strength of the grain\u2019s stem. They spray against aphids and mildew. And then they often spray again just before harvesting with the herbicide glyphosate to desiccate the crop, which saves them the energy costs of mechanical drying.</p> <p>Most farmers around the world, whatever the crop, will turn to one of just six companies that dominate the market to buy all these agrochemicals and their seeds. The concentration of power over primary agriculture in such a small number of corporations, and their ability both to set prices and determine the varieties available, has already been a cause of concern among farmers. Yet by next year the competition is likely to shrink even further.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/bayer-takeover-monsanto-66-billion-deal\">Bayer's $66bn takeover bid of Monsanto called a 'marriage made in hell'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The six global chemical and seed giants will become three behemoths with even greater market control. Just when climate change demands a more diverse and adaptable food system, resilient to changing conditions, agriculture is being dragged further down an ever-narrowing agroindustrial route.</p> <p>Bayer, Monsanto, Dupont, Dow, Syngenta and BASF currently account for three-quarters of the global agrochemical market and nearly two-thirds of the commercial seed market. As commodity prices have fallen, their profits have been flagging. Farmers who are getting less for their crops have struggled to make money. In the US they have begun turning away from expensive GM seed, and in Europe more than 3m farms have been lost in eight years. So for two years the agrochemical companies have been engaged in a flurry of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/05/monsanto-dow-syngenta-rush-for-mega-mergers-puts-food-security-at-risk\">merger and acquisition activity</a> to become even bigger and more powerful. The bids have settled, for the moment, on a trio of megadeals.</p> <p>The most recently agreed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/bayer-takeover-monsanto-66-billion-deal\"> merger, worth $66bn</a>, is between Monsanto, the controversial US-headquartered giant that is the world\u2019s largest seed and seventh-largest pesticide company, and German-based Bayer, the world\u2019s second-largest agrochemical and seventh-largest seed company.</p> <p>To give a sense of the scale of this deal and its impact, Monsanto, as well as being the leading global supplier of genetically modified seed, controls nearly a quarter of the vegetable seed market in Europe and is a big player in conventional maize seed. The herbicide glyphosate, its big earner, is now so commonly used across Europe that <a href=\"http://www.foeeurope.org//glyphosate-reasons-for-concern-briefing-130613\">it has been detected</a> in the urine of 44% of people surveyed for Friends of the Earth. Bayer is a leader in most pesticides, including neonicotinoids used to treat about 90% of UK cereal, sugar beet and oil seed rape.</p> <p>The proposed Bayer-Monsanto merger follows a $130bn deal between the US corporates DuPont (No 2 in seeds, 6 in pesticides) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/dow-chemical-dupont-merger-dowdupont\">Dow Chemical company</a> (5 in seeds, 4 in pesticides). China, focused on its own food security, wants a bit of the action too, and its state-backed agrochemical company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/03/chemchina-makes-43bn-dollar-offer-for-swiss-pesticide-firm-syngenta\">ChemChina</a> (seventh in global pesticide sales via subsidiaries) has successfully bid $43bn for Swiss Syngenta. A parallel process of concentration is taking place in the fertiliser sector.</p> <p>The narrative offered to justify this dominance of a supposedly free market is that only bigger, braver new entities can rise to the great challenge of our time: how to feed <a href=\"https://www.advancingtogether.com/en/about-the-combination/compelling-strategic-rationale/\">an additional 3 billion people</a> by 2050 without destroying the planet. We are asked to accept the intensive model of agriculture as the heroic march of science, against primitive, low-yielding, traditional methods of production. There is no alternative. But in fact it is this model of food production that is stuck in a rut.</p> <p>Postwar, there were indeed huge strides in increasing the amount of food produced globally thanks to plant breeding and the use of chemicals in the form of artificial fertilisers and pesticides. But alongside the triumphs of that green revolution, its longer-term shortcomings are increasingly apparent.</p> <p>Overuse of agrochemicals has contributed to steep losses in biodiversity, and crucially of pollinators vital to food. Increases in pest resistance threaten to reverse previous gains in yields. <a href=\"http://www.ipes-food.org/reports\">Research</a> has found that over a short period yields per hectare for individual crops are greater in intense agricultural systems. But over a longer period, and when you look at total farm output, more mixed and diverse farming produces more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/16/pakistan-fights-devastating-malnutrition-with-mass-food-fortifying-programme\">Pakistan fights devastating malnutrition with mass food-fortifying programme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the prime purpose of a food system is to nourish people and keep them healthy, this one is failing. Despite a doubling of available food in some regions, more than 750 million people still routinely go hungry. At the same time nearly 2 billion are overweight or obese.</p> <p>The agroindustrial system these companies underpin is primarily focused on a small number of commodity crops for export. The <a href=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/recent-reports\">ETC</a> research group points out that GM seed companies have concentrated their development efforts on maize, soya and rapeseed (canola) rather than a wide range of the 7,000-odd food crops grown by farmers around the world. Breaking these commodity crops down into their constituent parts and reselling them as sugars, starches, and fats adds shareholder value in the chain but depletes nutritional value. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/\">Diet-related diseases</a> have now overtaken infectious diseases as the largest cause of premature death globally.</p> <p>Although the companies talk of tackling the threat that climate change poses to food security, the agroindustrial food system is one of the most significant causes of it, contributing a third of all manmade <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/one-third-of-our-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from-agriculture-1.11708\">greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p> <p>Corporate concentration in the food system has sucked the money to be made in the chain up to a handful of companies at the top. It works for the few but not for the many. As if to underline the point, the chief executive of Monsanto stands to collect over $135m from the Bayer merger in share options and severance pay. But paradoxically, these three mergers to increase power reveal a sector that is also vulnerable. The pesticide business is under pressure \u2013 Bayer and Syngenta are both big producers of the three types of neonicotinoids recently banned in the EU because of their <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:139:0012:0026:EN:PDF\">impact on bees</a>. The EU has been under pressure too to restrict the use of <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2012_en.htm\">glyphosate</a>, since it was ruled a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2815%2970134-8/abstract\">probable carcinogen</a>\u201d by the WHO last year.</p> <p>This way of producing our food is broken and most people, including those still promoting it, know it. So why does it not change? The former UN rapporteur on the right to food, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/olivier-de-schutter\">Olivier de Schutter</a>, has described a series of \u201clock-ins\u201d that prevent change. Because value accrues to a limited number of actors, their political and economic power and ability to influence government policy is reinforced.</p> <p>The latest frontier is Africa, where there is a new scramble to spread the agroindustrial model of farming. It may well be in Africa, however, that a different, more ecological vision of the food future emerges. I had a glimmer of it on a trip to a large-scale horticultural export company based on Kenya\u2019s Lake Naivasha.</p> <p>The company, Flamingo Homegrown, has abandoned its long and heavy use of chemical pesticides, partly in response to a campaign highlighting their effect on workers\u2019 health, but partly too in recognition that they were on a losing treadmill of spraying and pest resistance.</p> <p>They have reinvented their agriculture in a way that makes the science of agrochemical use look as primitive as a blunderbuss. Instead they employ groups of highly trained African scientists to study and reproduce in labs the fungi and microrrhizae in healthy soil that form intricate links with plant roots. Rather than waging chemical war on the land, they are working to harness its immensely complex ecosystems. They have built vast greenhouses dedicated to breeding and harvesting ladybirds to control pests biologically rather than chemically.</p> <p>There is an another route to food security \u2013 and it is the polar opposite of three agrochemical giants bestriding the world.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2016.

Sports fans, whether we love golf or hate it, should recognise the huge service this tournament has done for English, and British, sport \u2013 a service that gives the lie to all those who, jumping on the back of the Sam Allardyce affair, have accused our national games of still being imbued with, or even governed by, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/britain-sporting-virtue-sam-allardyce-fair-play\" title=\"\">Rule Britannia spirit</a>.</p> <p>Talking of Big Sam is a reminder of golf\u2019s strange attraction to pro footballers. Indeed, golf often seems to be football in disguise, with the papers appearing to have more photos of footballers on the fairway than in the penalty area. (What do golfers do in their downtime? Play football.) And when I was growing up, in the 70s, acquiring a rudimentary sense of history, it was our footballers who gave me the belief that we \u2013 that is, England \u2013 were the best in the world.</p> <p>After all, we invented the game. We had recently won the World Cup (1966). We had more recently been stopped from winning the World Cup by having our<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/09/world-cup-stunning-moments-gordon-banks-england-1970\" title=\"\"> ace goalkeeper poisoned</a> (1970). And so on the evening of 29 April 1972, as England faced West Germany at Wembley (in an excitingly rare televised game) I recall to this day being 100% certain that the result would be a royally enjoyable England win, especially as our ace goalkeeper was now safe from dodgy foreign grub.</p> <p>Like I said, my grasp of history was rudimentary. Forget the grub: England were <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gubbed\" title=\"\">gubbed</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/englandfootball/story/0,9565,541541,00.html\" title=\"\">Hugh McIlvanney wrote</a> in the following day\u2019s Observer: \u201cNo Englishman can ever again warm himself with the old assumption that, on the football field if nowhere else, the Germans are an inferior race.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How did the sport of rightwing suburbia react in the era of Europe-bashing Thatcherism?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, a sport-mad patriotic teenager had other sports to warm him in that decade. Cricket: regular drubbings at the hands of Lillee, Thompson and any number of fabulous West Indies players. The Olympics: a world-beating 13th place in the 1976 medal table. Rugby union: just ask any Welsh supporter (or Scottish, or Irish, or French).</p> <p>So the notion that the mother country was a paragon of sporting virtue was crumbling long before the Tories had sold off one school playing field. But what gave it the coup de grace was good old golf and its three-day leisure convention we call the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>The tournament, set up by the <a href=\"http://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/content/herts-history/people/sportspeople/samuel-ryder\" title=\"\">St Albans seed merchant Sam Ryder in the 1920s</a>, had not been going well for the Britain and Ireland team. By 1979, our sorry record read: won three, lost 22 (one tie). The Americans were losing interest.</p> <p>So how did the sport of rightwing suburbia react in the era of Europe-bashing Thatcherism? It invited Europe on board. Out with lose Britannia, in with rule Europa.</p> <p>Since the golfers started looking outwards, things have looked up: the European record since 1979 reads: won eight, lost seven (one tied).</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just this achievement for which I doff my cap to the game of golf. It\u2019s also the example it has set to our other great sports. From Arsenal to Liverpool \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/09/huddersfield-david-wagner-no-electricity-no-beds-football-championship\" title=\"\">Huddersfield</a> \u2013 our football clubs have opened themselves up to foreign expertise; the era when the British game shunned the World Cup is another country. British rugby union has embraced the southern hemisphere, and even France. Perhaps most extraordinary, the national cricket team has \u2013 gasp \u2013 an Australian coach.</p> <p>Yes, this afternoon the golfers may need a repeat of 2012\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/golf/rydercup/9764959/Miracle-of-Medinah-How-Europe-turned-the-2012-Ryder-Cup-on-its-head.html\" title=\"\">Miracle at Medinah</a> to retain the Ryder Cup.

Banning the trade will make it easier for law enforcement agencies to crack down on the poachers and smugglers and give the remaining wild populations some much-needed breathing space.\u201d</p> <p>The African grey parrot is a popular pet not only for its ability to chat, but also for its longevity: it can live up to 50 years. One famous African grey, called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot)\">Alex</a>, lived to 30 and was able to communicate using 100 words. </p> <p>The African grey is a gregarious bird, making it easy for trappers to cast nets over flocks of dozens at a time.

It currently has the highest level of protection, following a plunge in its population from the 1950s to the 1970s as pesticides, including DDT, wrought havoc. Persecution by farmers and egg collecting also hit the falcons\u2019 numbers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/wildlife-summit-cracks-down-on-illegal-rosewood-trade\">Furniture that destroys forests: crackdown on 'rampant' trade in rosewood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the population has rebounded and there are now about 300,000 spread all over the globe. The raptor has adapted to the spread of towns and cities by learning to catch feral pigeons. Furthermore, only 500 or so falcons are officially traded every year, almost all of which are bred in captivity, according to Canada, which led the proposal.</p> <p>The downgrade was supported by Arab states, where falconry is popular. \u201cIt is part of our history and heritage,\u201d said the delegate from the UAE, who said falcon \u201cpassports\u201d ensured only captive-bred falcons were used. Some conservation groups also backed the downgrade. \u201cThe recovery of this species from catastrophic decline is one of the great conservation success stories,\u201d said O\u2019Criodain. \u201cIt is time this is recognised.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Pro-Wildlife conservation group said several local populations were still vulnerable, especially those with unusual colour variations, which can fetch $50,000 on the black market.</p> <p>The EU opposed the downgrade, arguing it would increase the demand for wild-caught falcons. Iran\u2019s delegate also opposed it, claiming that 300 illegally caught peregrines had been seized in one operation in 2014. \u201cWe have a very big problem with poachers all around the country, and even the injuring or killing of wildlife rangers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The proposal was forced to a vote and was defeated 57-52.</p>",
  "<p>Very early in the morning, Diana Phololo and a dozen elderly women from 54 Soper Road step out on to the dark streets of central Johannesburg. If they are quick, they will beat the municipal cleaners to the detritus left overnight by revellers in the newly hip neighbourhoods of South Africa\u2019s sprawling commercial capital.<br></p> <p> There is little solidarity among the 100 residents of the burned-out building where Phololo, 58, has lived unlawfully for nearly 20 years. Each races to the shattered bottles left on the pavements outside the bars and restaurants. Sold by the kilo for recycling, the glass provides the residents with enough money to eat. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s not easy at my age, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got,\u201d Phololo says.</p> <p> By dawn, the residents of 54 Soper Road are back home. They rest in overcrowded, windowless rooms or on the verandah, enjoying the few rays of sun that pierce the wall of tower blocks surrounding their small, derelict building. There is no gas, electricity or sanitation. Water comes from a single standpipe. Children play in the rubbish-strewn yard.</p> <p>\u201cNothing really has changed here for years,\u201d says Mandla Kayise, 50, who moved into the squat a decade ago when he arrived jobless in Johannesburg from his poor village in KwaZulu-Natal, 350 miles south. </p> <p>But soon he, Phololo and the others will be gone. An eviction is scheduled later this year.

Blocks that were once no-go zones now house art galleries, cafes and museums. New businesses are opening. Neighbourhoods such as Braamfontein and Maboneng are now seen as hubs of creativity and cool.</p> <p>But the change, though real, is limited \u2013 and exactly how widely its benefits will be shared is not yet clear.</p> <p> \u201cRegeneration has to be for everyone \u2026 I have no problem with land for luxury apartments, as long as there is commensurate land for the poor,\u201d says Stuart Wilson, of the local NGO <a href=\"http://www.seri-sa.org/\">Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa</a>.</p> <p>Many have dated the decline of the 18 sq km inner city of Johannesburg to the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, which saw the African National Congress (ANC) take power.</p> <p> But this is unfair, says Gerald Garner, a local historian and guide. Racist measures adopted by the apartheid regime from the 1950s gradually forced industries out of Johannesburg\u2019s centre in search of labour. Then international sanctions led to the exodus of global companies and their staff in the mid 1980s. </p> <p> The cumulative effect was devastating, according to Garner. Apartment blocks and homes emptied, the doors of multi-storey offices were locked, luxury hotels closed. Basic utilities were disconnected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebf2692bf74a04b2f1a82a1c6ea0658945c4ed55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebf2692bf74a04b2f1a82a1c6ea0658945c4ed55/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Jay Jay\u2019 makes traditional beer to sell from his room inside 54 Soper Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jay Jay\u2019 makes traditional beer to sell from his room inside 54 Soper Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When racist laws restricting movement were reluctantly eased by the beleaguered apartheid regime, tens of thousands of poor migrants rushed to the city. Others came, and still come, from elsewhere in Africa. About 1,000 vacant buildings became vast squats, often run by violent gangs. The centre became an internationally infamous no-go zone. </p> <p>Fitful regeneration efforts began around 15 years ago with major public projects funded by the ANC-run town hall, central government and overseas aid. Momentum gathered as South Africa prepared to host the 2010 World Cup, and private developers began buying up the \u201chijacked\u201d buildings, evicting squatters and constructing apartments. </p> <p>Sometimes this occurred peacefully, but in the past the process of emptying occupied buildings has, on occasion, involved significant violence. This was directed both at South African citizens, some of them long-term residents, and the large numbers of migrants who continued to flow in from poorer, less stable neighbouring countries and beyond. </p> <p>Now only 100 or so illegally occupied buildings remain, though these still provide accommodation for about 60,000 people.</p> <p>The residents of 54 Soper Road, in the tough neighbourhood of Berea, are among them. Berea has proved resistant to regeneration. There are many illegally occupied buildings and few of the signs of economic growth seen elsewhere. Pawnshops, nail parlours and liquor stores line dirty streets. Violent crime and prostitution is rife.</p> <p>\u201cThe washing gets stolen before it dries,\u201d says Majozi Thembezile, 57.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4917d426d15fd6eab926bc6d549a908cb2598d41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4917d426d15fd6eab926bc6d549a908cb2598d41/0_164_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A security guard outside the new Joziburg Lane development in central Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A security guard outside the new Joziburg Lane development in central Johannesburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the last three years the residents have faced eviction but, despite the appalling conditions, they do not want to leave. \u201cWe have very little hope from our side,\u201d says Thembezile, who like many residents at 54 Soper Road came to Johannesburg from a rural village 20 years ago.</p> <p>A last-ditch legal battle may delay the eviction, but is unlikely to halt it.</p> <p>The fate of Thembezile\u2019s home raises important questions about the future regeneration of Johannesburg, and has implications across South Africa and beyond. One is how to find alternative accommodation for thousands of very poor people living in neighbourhoods that are now being gentrified.</p> <p>Current provision is grossly inadequate. Since a landmark court ruling in 2011, the local council is obliged by law to house anyone evicted to make room for either private or public developments. Campaigners and experts, however, say authorities have provided only a handful of squalid and overcrowded blocks where families are forcibly split up. Even these can only meet a fraction of the demand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"885ead1c25f916aeb9da701e048df73aee896a1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/885ead1c25f916aeb9da701e048df73aee896a1e/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, the development of the city centre is forcing the very poor living there, who are almost all black, <a href=\"http://www.seri-sa.org/index.php/latest-news/547-spatial-justice-seri-present-spatial-mismatch-findings-13-september-2016\"> </a>to the distant edges of Johannesburg where rents are cheaper.

They say the city council has told them there is no money to rehouse them locally, when most make a living within walking distance of their home as security guards, day labourers or recyclers.

As the election draws nearer and the media hysteria mounts, levels of fatigue are hovering around the \u201cplease induce a coma and wake me up when this is all over\u201d mark.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing, though \u2013 nobody is forcing us to keep talking about the elections. We don\u2019t live in Trumpenistan yet; we are not all legally obliged to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s name in every second sentence. The democratic process does not hinge on us spending hours writing long Facebook posts explaining our views on the candidates in block capitals to echo chambers of our own opinion. We are allowed to talk about other things. In fact, \u2019tis the season to talk about other things: there are some autumn conversations that are obligatory. Here are five to get you started and get your mind off the election.</p> <h2><strong>The great pumpkin debate</strong><br></h2> <p>Every year, pumpkin-flavoured drinks, capitalism\u2019s way of ringing in the autumn, start appearing earlier and earlier. This is not a weird sign of climate change; it\u2019s the sign of a weird national obsession. According to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/01/pumpkin-spice-lattes-summer-starbucks/\">Dunkin\u2019 Donuts</a>, \u201cIn the New York City area, pumpkin-flavoured drinks were available starting 18 August due to customer feedback that they wanted pumpkin even earlier.\u201d However, pumpkin spice lattes \u2013 popularised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/starbucks\">Starbucks</a>, but now peddled everywhere \u2013 really come into their own when the temperature starts to drop, as it has in the last few days in New York. For the next couple of weeks, millions of people are going to be pulling on their Lululemons and Uggs, grabbing their first PSL of the season and exclaiming: \u201cAh, now I really feel like it\u2019s autumn!\u201d Meanwhile, millions of PSL haters are going to inform you how abominable the beverage is, to ensure you know they\u2019re not \u201cbasic\u201d. Pumpkin spice lattes are the 2016 election in a cup. Divisive, disgusting and everyone\u2019s got an opinion. Dammit, we\u2019re back to the elections.</p> <h2><strong>Harambe Halloween costumes</strong><br></h2> <p>Americans take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween\">Halloween</a> almost as seriously as democracy. People spend weeks planning their outfits. Somewhere in the US right now, I can guarantee a group text like this is happening:</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s all dress up as a sexy poop emoji or sexy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> this year!\u201d<br>\u201cI dunno \u2026 What do you think about the sexy <a href=\"http://www.kmart.com/women-s-pink-ribbon-costume/p-05038429000P?sid=KDx01192011x000001&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwmri_BRCZpaHkuIH75_IBEiQAIG0rIa1jtaEUruvndQxJAxXmygXNtyLNEB5FQdw0dac_gPAaArqw8P8HAQ&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">breast cancer awareness costume</a>?\u201d<br>\u201cSome people might find that offensive.

And if gorilla-style politics is not for you, there\u2019s also a <a href=\"http://www.yandy.com/Donna-T.-Rumpshaker-Costume.php\">sexy Donald Trump costume</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.yandy.com/Capitol-Hill.php\">sexy Hillary Clinton costume</a>. Who says we need to make America great again? It\u2019s already perfect.</p> <h2><strong>Cuffing season</strong><br></h2> <p>In New York, dating is a blood sport. When the temperature starts to drop, however, competition really hots up and \u201ccuffing season\u201d starts. <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cuffing%20Season\">Urban Dictionary explains</a> that, as autumn begins, people \u201cwho would normally rather be single or promiscuous find themselves along with the rest of the world desiring to be \u2018cuffed\u2019 or tied down by a serious relationship\u201d. Cuffing season is often accompanied by \u201czombieing\u201d. This is when an ex long gone from your life rises from the dead (metaphorically speaking) and starts randomly liking your social media posts or sending you one-word texts such as \u201cHi\u201d. If you go to a bar in New York during cuffing season, you will overhear long discussions about if \u201cI should say \u2018hi\u2019 back?\u201d (No.) You may also see already-cuffed couples in matching flannels discussing their apple-picking plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad61b2c9af6116e56834ee1336247bc179f76bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad61b2c9af6116e56834ee1336247bc179f76bb/0_14_699_699/500.jpg\" alt=\"Why not dress up as Harambe for Halloween?\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Why not dress up as Harambe for Halloween?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fantasy football</strong><br></h2> <p>According to <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/09/05/nearly-75m-people-will-play-fantasy-football-this-year/\">a 2015 study</a>, almost 75 million people, about a quarter of the US population, play fantasy football, spending $4.6bn (\u00a33.5bn) on it. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html?_r=0\">only 9% of the US chose Trump and Clinton</a> as the presidential nominees. Fantasy football (I\u2019m talking about American, no-feet-involved football, obviously) is an obsessive topic of discussion around this time of year. Unfortunately, I could not tell you what is being discussed; Trump\u2019s policies make more sense to me than the ins and outs of imaginary leagues. And it turns out, though, you can\u2019t even escape the nightmare of politics with the fantasy of football this year. Clinton is <a href=\"http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/hillary-clinton-runs-espn-ad-mocking-trump-as-fantasy-football-player.html\">running ads on fantasy football websites</a>, describing Trump as \u201clike that guy in your fantasy league who talks trash all week and forgets to set his lineup\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>The weather</strong></h2> <p>Ah, autumn. The leaves are changing colour, the air is crisp and the carbon dioxide is abundant. Environmental scientists recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\">announced</a> that climate change has reached the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d, with the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere permanently passing the 400-parts-per-million threshold. Some people will tell you that this is a very real disaster of our own making. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/china-climate-change\">Others will tell you</a> that the concept of global warming was a conspiracy created by the Chinese to make US manufacturing non-competitive. Other people will post angry messages on social media asking: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t everyone who is worked up about Harambe start getting worked up about climate change, which really matters!\u201d People have always enjoyed talking about the weather; it used to be a safe topic of conversation. Alas, this is no longer the case. Now if you tell someone \u201cGosh, it\u2019s got cold recently\u201d, there is a good chance they will reply with their unsolicited opinion on global warming. Which will lead you back to politics. Which will lead you back to the elections. There is really no escaping it, after all.</p>",
  "<p>Some years ago, in the guise of Rugby League Week\u2019s \u201cMan On The Hill\u201d, I headed down to Remondis Stadium, the home ground of Cronulla Sharks. There on the hill I laughed along with the Sharks fans as their centre-three-quarter Ben Pomeroy dropped the ball, time and again. We laughed like fiends.</p> <p>Such was the lot of your average Sharks fan \u2013 you just laughed. What else could you do? It was like you owned the players and their errors. They were the fans\u2019 errors. And it was all a big gag, a bit like the Barmy Army celebrating their terrible team by singing songs of their badness. It was the height of good humour.</p> <p>But they\u2019re laughing long and loud for a different reason now, Sharks fans, because their improbable rugby league team has made off with the Provan-Summons trophy. In a hard-boned and willing grand final at Sydney\u2019s ANZ Stadium in front of a near capacity 83,625 people, a heaving, pulsating, roiling sky-blue sea, with occasional algal blooms of two-tone purple, saw a great game of rugby league.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/oct/02/nrl-grand-final-cronulla-sharks-vs-melbourne-storm-in-pictures\">NRL grand final: Cronulla Sharks vs Melbourne Storm \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was intent early. Brutish intent. As Knights enforcer Paul Harragon said before the 1997 decider, \u201cYou can\u2019t get sent off in a grand final\u201d. And it\u2019s probably true. You\u2019d have to be really bad. Early on, the players set out to test it. Mick Ennis threw a high shot in the first twenty seconds. Marika Koroibete swung a forearm at Chad Townsend\u2019s Rick Astley-looking head and was put on report. He\u2019s off to rugby, though, Koroibete and thus had license to kill. Maybe not kill. But he was put on report and won\u2019t serve a sentence on the Wallabies\u2019 spring tour.</p> <p>Giant Cronulla prop Andrew Fifita was a factor early, and throughout. Luke Lewis would win the Clive Churchill Medal, and had a great game, his head finishing like a very bad boxer\u2019s, his cheeks like Cro-Magnon man\u2019s. But Fifita was huge, a real factor. \u201cThe Fifita Factor\u201d: ordinary airport novel, but the man was up there with the best on ground. </p> <p>Storm lock Dale Finucane\u2019s defence was staunch, this chunky jack-hammer of a man. Dean Lance redux. Lewis almost scored a try from a James Maloney burst, slid towards the try-line but couldn\u2019t reach out and score because the double-movement law\u2019s an ass. It\u2019s not the worst law in rugby league. But it\u2019s one of them.</p> <p>Bouncing Ben Barba scored the first try from a scrum move that referees sent to the bunker because referees couldn\u2019t believe someone had ripped it off. <em>Can you do that? Is that allowed? </em>The move went like this: halfback fed under the lock\u2019s feet, the lock took off with it, turned it back inside to the second-rower \u2013 Barba \u2013 who scooted over the line. And up went \u201cTRY\u201d and up went the Shark people, happy as Leisure Suit Larry.</p> <p>And from there the Sharks\u2019 bombed in. All the momentum. It was the same momentum they\u2019ve had all year. They just kept on coming, playing footy, and rucking their way down field \u2013 equal parts hot potato Raiders and staunch-wall Storm. A heady combination.</p> <p>Jack Bird hurt his arm, it hung limp like a deadweight. \u201cBird has one wing,\u201d said commentator Ray Warren. Someone had to say it. And Our Rabbi did, God bless him for it.</p> <p>On field the Sharks ran fast and with intensity, all hard bodies, footwork and endeavour. Storm couldn\u2019t hold them, couldn\u2019t slow things down. Normally they do. That\u2019s their thing \u2013 brutalise their opponents, kill the ruck with the moves of judo. Cop a penalty. Do it again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed7923a55c83e250796882c44946ee1fbc620e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7923a55c83e250796882c44946ee1fbc620e88/0_0_4714_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cronulla Sharks players celebrate their 2016 NRL premiership win\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cronulla Sharks players celebrate their 2016 NRL premiership win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Golding/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not this game. And referees Matt Cecchin and Ben Cummins, it seems, have adjudicated a clean one. The Sharks, freed up, broke free of the human net and won the ruck. Won the first half. Only 8-nil. But they owned it.</p> <p>Yet the Storm were good. Their completions were \u201cperfect\u201d. They played \u201cStormball\u201d. But the Sharks played footy. And monstered the Storm.</p> <p>On field Ennis continued to menace. It\u2019s what he does. He rubbed it in, he annoyed, he pushed people. He\u2019s probably the game\u2019s most disliked opponent. And fair enough, he\u2019s not out there to be nice. \u201cHe\u2019s in their heads,\u201d reckoned Phil Gould of the latest Ennis-inspired push-n-shove. And say what you will about Ennis, love him or hate, agree or disagree, one thing is clear: he\u2019s a grub.</p> <p>In the second half it was more of the same; Sharks just hammering away, bludgeoning the Storm line. Yet Storm, again, held firm. They love that stuff. Love copping it and throwing it back. And back they came. It\u2019s what they do. They stay cool and play their Stormball. \u201cCool\u201d will be on Cam Smith\u2019s tombstone. His resting heart-rate is just above dead. </p> <p>The Sharks were bashed. Head bin here. Bad knee there. \u201cHe\u2019s still on one wing, the Bird man,\u201d said Warren again, warming to the theme. And from nothing Jesse Bromwhich, the indomitable giant of New Zealand, rumbled over for a try. It had been all Sharks. But they only led by two. It was in their heads. How could it not be? They knew Storm would not go away, would not panic. But hell! They\u2019d smashed them for 55 minutes. Still couldn\u2019t shake \u2018em. <em>Who are these people?</em> </p> <p>Koroibete ran on one wing. Will Chambers ran on the other. Channel Nine threw up a statistic: Storm had completed 28 of 30 sets; Sharks 22 of 24. There was 22 minutes to go. It was a close to \u201cperfect\u201d game. And still anyone\u2019s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/02/cronulla-sharks-beat-melbourne-to-break-50-year-nrl-premiership-drought\">Cronulla Sharks beat Melbourne to break 50-year NRL premiership drought | Sam Perry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chambers stepped Ennis and scored a try that took his team into the lead.

No human could weather such a Shark attack and survive. But Storm had beaten it, eaten it, owned it. And now led by four points.</p> <p>Fifteen to go and you couldn\u2019t pick a standout player. Willing replacement punk Christian Welch threw an ill-advised swinging arm at Townsend\u2019s very bad haircut. Fifita rock-and-rolled over through a phalanx of judo-trained bodyguards to somehow plant the ball under the posts. Try-time. A marvel of human movement.</p> <p>Sharks by two. Sweet Jesus and DK Lillee it was tense. Cronk stabbed for the line and Bird fielded at second-slip. Maloney kicked out on the full trying to kill off a set. And the Storm came again and again.

And still they came, these horrible automatons. What a team. What a club. They can never be killed. But the Sharks made a desperate late tackle on Koroibete. Time off. Ennis hugged some ball-boys.

  "<p>Like any marketing-approved generational epithet, to be a millennial is not as simple as it sounds.

Vote or Die didn\u2019t literally mean that you would die if you didn\u2019t vote, though there was certainly the implication that you might get drafted and sent to Iraq if you didn\u2019t support Democratic candidate John Kerry.

This year, Rock the Vote is joining forces with Glamour magazine, Refinery29, Jezebel and the Cut to register at least 100,000 women before the election, an initiative called #OurVoteCounts. As one would imagine with the strategic placement of the hashtag in the name, most of this registration drive will take place online, unlike the TV-centric campaigns of yesteryear. To better appeal to its newer, younger, sexier partners, Rock the Vote might want to also consider rebranding for the 21st century \u2013 maybe something like Electric Democracy Carnival? Organizers can hold voter registration drives in the desert, hand out glow sticks and pacifiers, and build a giant wooden statue of Thomas Jefferson that they can set on fire every evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d39fa66113621b5d51d90e5b654a09d03ee180fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d39fa66113621b5d51d90e5b654a09d03ee180fa/0_0_2934_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Liles, Mary J Blige, Russell Simmons, Puff Daddy, and Jay Z on stage at the Last Chance For Change Rally in support of Barack Obama on 2 November 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Liles, Mary J Blige, Russell Simmons, Puff Daddy, and Jay Z on stage at the Last Chance For Change Rally in support of Barack Obama on 2 November 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, it\u2019s good to see Rock The Vote make the jump from the airwaves to the internet.

What pops a hole in that theory is that millennial voting rates <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/08/six-take-aways-from-the-census-bureaus-voting-report/\">fell</a> 7% from 2008 to 2012. Instead, there\u2019s the very real possibility that as millennials age, they are less apt to stomach a thing called hope. The Obama presidency did not usher in a new age of cooperation.

  "<p>A fly lands on Evan Rachel Wood\u2019s lovely face, but she doesn\u2019t swat it away because she is a robot called Dolores, one of the automatons in HBO\u2019s Westworld. \u201cA place with unlimited possibilities,\u201d is how she describes the bubble she calls home, a carefully rendered cowboy town, designed for the pleasure of human visitors, who can shoot and shag at will, safe in the knowledge that the inhabitants are all pleasure-bots. Forgers forge, sheriffs police and barmen serve whiskey from behind amazing moustaches. Welcome to Westworld, where everything is fine and dandy. For now.</p> <p>Westworld was originally a 1973 sci-fi movie starring Yul Brynner as a malfunctioning robot gunslinger who runs amok in a wild west theme park. Basically, for writer-director Michael Crichton it was a dry run for his later franchise Jurassic Park. The guy really hates theme parks. What the movie did in 88 minutes, this 10-part series plans to chew over for longer. Which means there is more to it than a tech malfunction when things start to go wrong. Westworld the series goes beyond merciless killer droids and ponders \u2013 like Blade Runner and Channel 4\u2019s Humans \u2013 the possibility of sentience and the nature of memory. And, given the lack of rules in the wild west, the show pulses with baseness and boobies in the same way Game Of Thrones does.

He dwells in a basement in the park\u2019s nerve centre, alongside all the decommissioned \u201chosts\u201d (a polite euphemism for the droids) and is tolerated by management as the eccentric genius behind it all. Borgen\u2019s Sidse Babett Knudsen (the best prime minister Denmark never had) works there too, as head naysayer. Whenever something glitches, she shakes her head, stubs out a fag and warns her colleagues to take the rogue host out of circulation. Do they listen?

It will take effect on the day Britain leaves the EU, now set at no later than the end of March 2019, with future governments able to unpick EU-derived laws as desired.</p> <p>Much of all this work will plainly need to be completed before article 50 is triggered, at which point the two-year clock starts ticking. Liam Fox\u2019s international trade department, meanwhile, is to focus primarily on exploring new trade deals with non-EU countries (none of which can be signed before Britain has left).</p> <h2>The long goodbye</h2> <p>As far as the exit process then goes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> lays down the basic steps. The very first \u2013 a significant potential obstacle \u2013 states that the decision to leave has to have been taken in accordance with Britain\u2019s \u201cown constitutional requirements\u201d.</p> <p>That is one reason why nothing can happen before next year: several cases are currently before the courts arguing that the government does not have the power to invoke article 50 without parliament\u2019s approval. The issue is likely to move swiftly to the supreme court, which will be under pressure to deliver a final judgment by Christmas.</p> <p>Assuming that hurdle is cleared, article 50 says the leaving state must notify the European council \u2013 made up of the 28 heads of government, the council president, Donald Tusk, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 of its intention. This could be in the form of a letter, or a formal statement at a council meeting; the first full European council meeting of 2017 is on 9-10 March.</p> <p>Article 50 then states: \u201cIn the light of the guidelines provided by the European council, [the EU] shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with the state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/hard-brexit-new-bigotry-warns-nicky-morgan\">Hard Brexit will breed new bigotry, warns former Tory minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Steve Peers, professor of EU law at the university of Essex, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/how-eu-works-leaving-eu/\">points out</a>, article 50 goes on to define three distinct stages of that withdrawal process. First, the council, in the form of its chief Brexit negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/belgian-diplomat-to-head-eus-brexit-taskforce\">Didier Seeuws</a>, and the member states it represents \u2013 without the UK \u2013 must agree the broad guidelines for negotiations. </p> <p>This in itself is likely likely to take some months \u2013 and may be complicated by elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany that could well see the arrival of new governments with new positions. </p> <p>Next, the commission\u2019s negotiating team, headed by the French former foreign minister and EU commissioner, Michel Barnier, and his German deputy, Sabine Weyand, negotiates the exit agreement with Britain on behalf of the EU.</p> <p>The third stage of article 50 requires the deal to be approved by the UK and qualified majority of the council: 20 of the 27 remaining states. The European parliament also has to approve it, by a simple majority (and will, its president Martin Schulz and Brexit representative Guy Verhofstadt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/osborne-warns-may-against-hard-brexit\">have said</a>, be no pushover.)</p> <p>All of this, the article states, must be concluded within two years after notification \u2013 at which point Britain, unless it has won the unanimous agreement of the rest of the council, or the agreement specifies an earlier or later date, will no longer be an EU member.</p> <h2>What will the deal need to cover? </h2> <p>Charles Grant of the <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/\">Centre for European Reform</a> likens it to a divorce settlement, \u201cdividing up the properties, institutions and pension rights, and dealing with budget payments and ... the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa\u201d.</p> <p>The most sensible way to tackle the process, <a href=\"https://infacts.org/article-50-process-will-cats-cradle-complexity/\">according to David Hannay</a>, a highly experienced former UK ambassador to the EU, would be for both parties to first sit down and, in a largely technical first stage, agree on a list of everything that has to be covered.</p> <p>Among the most complex issues Hannay identifies are the \u201cacquired rights\u201d of UK and EU citizens, and Britain\u2019s international obligations under agreements it entered into as an EU member \u2013 such as the commitments made on its behalf at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/22/paris-climate-deal-set-signed-record-number-states-un\">Paris climate change conference</a>.</p> <p>There will also, he predicts, be \u201clengthy and contentious\u201d arguments over Britain\u2019s remaining budgetary and other financial liabilities \u2013 many complicated by the fact that EU programmes in fields such as scientific research and regional development often involve commitments beyond the exit date.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/tory-conference-brexit-divisions-moderate\">Bitter fight over Brexit set to overshadow Conservative conference</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And that\u2019s not all ...</h2> <p>That is not the end. Most experts understand the phrase \u201ctaking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union\u201d to mean, however, that Britain will have to conclude two separate agreements: one on its legal separation from the union, and the other on its future trading relationship.</p> <p>Both the commission and Tusk have said talks on the trade agreement cannot start until after Britain leaves, but several member states \u2013 including Germany \u2013 have indicated that in practice, they will have to be conducted in parallel. </p> <p>In any case, Grant has argued that there will almost inevitably have to be a <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/theresa-may-and-her-six-pack-difficult-deals\">third agreement</a>, too: an interim arrangement to bridge the gap between Britain leaving the EU and the entry into force of the trade deal.</p> <p>That final agreement, trade experts say, could take several years to negotiate, and will be subject to unanimous voting and national ratification by all 27 remaining EU states, leaving open the possibility of almost endless haggling by every member with something to ask of Britain \u2013 think, for example, of Spain and Gibraltar. </p>",

But the uniquely polarising candidacy of Trump has raised the prospect that, with important faultlines such as age, gender, geography and race <a href=\"http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/\">relatively settled from election to election</a>, socioeconomic class could swing the presidency in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7/0_221_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One marker is education. In 1992, Republican voters were much better educated than their Democratic counterparts, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/15/educational-divide-in-vote-preferences-on-track-to-be-wider-than-in-recent-elections/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. Today registered voters with a college degree favour Clinton by 23 percentage points, while those without a college degree prefer Trump by five. This trend cuts across demographic groups, although it is most pronounced among whites. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_clinton_is_defined_by_an_educational_gap_among_white_voters.html\">The Slate website noted:</a> \u201cThe educational split among white voters is the defining characteristic of this election.\u201d If this holds in November, it will be the widest educational divide at the ballot box for several decades. </p> <p>Another marker is cultural and about optics. When Clinton recently referred to half of Trump\u2019s supporters as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">\u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d</a>, critics also seized on the context: she was addressing millionaires at a fundraiser headlined by the singer Barbra Streisand at the New York restaurant Cipriani Wall Street. And her backers include those other temples of coastal privilege, Hollywood and Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, was anointed the \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d at the Republican national convention, where Willie Robertson of the TV reality show Duck Dynasty, wearing stars and stripes bandanna and bushy beard, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/18/duck-dynasty-star-willie-robertson-might-have-a-point-about-the-media/\">declared that media pundits</a> \u201cdon\u2019t hang out with regular folks like us, who like to hunt and fish and pray and actually work for a living. Heck, I don\u2019t even know that they know how to talk to people from middle America. I mean, when I tell \u2019em I\u2019m from Louisiana, they really start talking real slow and real loud.\u201d</p> <p>In Boonsboro, a town of 3,400 people steeped in revolutionary and civil war history, a giant Trump sign has been spraypainted with the word \u201clove\u201d. Opposite a Subway restaurant and closed-down bakery, the <a href=\"http://www.ttpbooks.com/\">Turn the Page Bookstore</a>, owned by the romance novelist Nora Roberts, sells soy candles, handmade soaps and organic coffee. Its employees make little secret of their allegiance to Clinton. Two doors away, at Crawfords Restaurant, Guns &amp; Ammo, a handwritten sign behind the laminated counter warns \u201cNo free refills on drinks\u201d and the staff are for Trump.</p> <p>As a reality show about hunting in the woods played on the TV, Rutherford, who is cashier, dishwasher, shelf stacker and much else, said of Clinton\u2019s supporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise the importance of small-town America and they don\u2019t see the value of it. Everybody in this community loves this little store but big companies make it harder and harder for us.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018You must be doing well with Obamacare\u2019. I say, actually, unless you have an astronomical salary or a company to pay for it, it\u2019s crippling. Our health insurance is $900 per month for the family; that\u2019s why I work.

But she moved to Boonsboro in 2002, where the family keeps horses, dogs and chickens on 30 acres of land and hunts 80% of their own food. Her daughters, aged 13, 14, 15 and 16, \u201call hunt and play volleyball\u201d.</p> <p>Displaying a phone picture of herself with a deer she bagged, Rutherford said: \u201cA lot of my friends don\u2019t agree with what I do but they don\u2019t have trouble wearing a full-length coyote coat to a fundraiser in January. They will wear leather shoes and carry an alligator handbag. The people of Washington don\u2019t want to go out to the rural areas; no one wants to go out of their comfort zone. But I would love to go to a Clinton rally just to eavesdrop and hear the interaction.\u201d</p> <p>Along the street, at Marly\u2019s Laundry, Wayne Stonesifer was waiting patiently as his clothes spun in a tumble dryer.

If you try to interrupt me when I\u2019m hunting, that\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>The country has a bigger divide now than ever, he added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your gay rights, abortion laws, racism.

Times are getting nearer.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Dobereiner, 36, owns two small businesses and complains that taxes are too high. He is also supporting Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not a liberal and we\u2019re $20 trillion in debt and unemployment is too high and our healthcare is terrible. The community organiser-in-chief has no qualifications and Hillary Clinton is just an extension of that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Trump says; I care what he does and he\u2019s not a billionaire because he\u2019s stupid. I like a guy who puts his foot in his mouth because at least he tells the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s plain speaking has been identified as one of the sources of his appeal to voters angry at the status quo in general and Republican establishment in particular. Even his outlandish gaffes are said to humanise him, emphasising his status as outsider and non-politician. His anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim diatribes have disgusted liberals and been cheered at raucous rallies, where he declares his love for \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/john-hudak/\">John Hudak</a>, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cI think supporters look at Donald Trump and see a bit of an everyman, even though his biography completely opposes that worldview. Then they look at Hillary Clinton and see her as more elite than her background would actually suggest. Trump is the person you want to see on TLC; Clinton appears to live the way an average wealthy person lives.\u201d</p> <p>There is a crucial gender dimension, Hudak argues. \u201cA female candidate would not be allowed to ramble like Trump does or Bill Clinton did. Only in a race between a man and a woman could her polish be a liability and his freewheeling be an asset.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has scrambled the orthodoxy of class, for example by tweeting a picture of himself eating McDonald\u2019s fast food and drinking Coke on his luxurious private jet. He loves both boxing and golf. He has named Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece Citizen Kane as his favourite film but also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo\">once told the New Yorker</a> that Bloodsport, a violent action flick starring Jean Claude Van Damme, is \u201can incredible, fantastic movie\u201d. The music at his rallies ranges from Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera Turandot, to Elton John. His properties are crammed with chandeliers, gold leaf, mirrors and marble \u2013 tacky to some, aspirational to others. Both patrician and plebeian, his reading list is said to consist mainly of articles about himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf/0_153_2624_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme \u2026 right up there with Citizen Kane, according to Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some would say he lacks class, in every sense. And there is a tenacious myth that, free of the ossified layers of agricultural and industrial Europe, America is a class-free land of opportunity, where someone born into poverty can become president. It is not so simple, according to sociologists. Arlie Hochschild of the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, said: \u201cClass is profoundly important, imprinting all aspects of childhood, self, character and behind, and the denial of it is in the service of keeping alive the hope of lifting out of it. But America would be far better off talking about the realities of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.robert-h-frank.com/\">Robert H Frank</a>, a professor of economics at Cornell University and author of Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy, added: \u201cPeople here, if you ask them, will say they are \u2018middle class\u2019. Even relatively rich people will answer middle class because we deny there\u2019s such a thing as class here, which is of course preposterous. The barriers are different from England but they\u2019re real.\u201d<br></p> <p>Research suggests that Trump\u2019s core support should not be simply characterised as the white working class. Many earn an average of $70,000 but are caught in the downdraft of deindustrialisation, losing jobs to factory or mine closures, lacking the skills for a digital economy, anxious that their children will be worse off than they were. Joe Sims, a member of the national board of the <a href=\"http://www.cpusa.org/\">Communist Party USA</a>, said: \u201cMy sense is that Trump\u2019s support comes not so much from the white working class but the lower middle class and small business people who have been pushed into the ranks of the working class. The wages are flat and they\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>But in a supposedly classless society, there is often a gap between perception and reality. Sims added: \u201cDuring the 1950s and 1960s there was a myth propagated about the American dream and the American way of life and the sense that everyone was middle class and upwardly mobile. Certainly during that period there was at least a steadiness in increase in income and their children were able to do a little better than them. But this idea of everyone being middle class has crashed on the rocks of reality. Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Numerous academic studies have found that the extent of social mobility was probably always exaggerated and, in the past generation, may have become deteriorated. The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html\">soaring cost of studying at university</a> has been blamed for stifling upward movement and allowing middle-class families to entrench their advantage. Pew\u2019s research, published last week, found a growing ideological divide, with highly educated adults holding increasingly liberal attitudes, while under a third of the less educated held liberal views.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gqrr.com/stanley-b-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>, a veteran political consultant and senior pollster for Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the biggest divide between working-class voters and those with a college degree in this election. It\u2019s already there in the polls. Trump is reinforcing it by the nature of the campaign he\u2019s running and the issues he\u2019s running on. He\u2019s driving away college graduates as well as the whole Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>In the Republican primaries, Trump the class warrior made Ted Cruz, the conservative Christian ideologue, look quaint. Greenberg admits that he was surprised. \u201cThe college-educated Republicans keep moving year after year more to the Democrats but this election has really accelerated it because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a candidate running on a straight working-class campaign. [George W] Bush was very much centred on faith; that\u2019s legitimate but it wasn\u2019t an economic argument.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6/0_69_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he warned against an oversimplified binary split, pointing to the success of Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, in the Democratic primaries. Sanders stressed issues of economic inequality and access to college education, to the extent that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">criticised by some for neglecting race</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of Democrats who were voting for somebody who was a self-described socialist, running against big money, getting big money out of politics, going after Wall Street and big banks, attacking Hillary for being a creature of the big banks, so you need a third bucket,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThere are others who are not so focused on the racial and cultural issues who are quite ready to rally. Sanders, in the polls at least, was stronger than Hillary against Trump because he actually was winning both millennials and working-class voters.\u201d</p> <p>But now Sanders is out, there are two historically unpopular candidates and a fear of two classes, or tribes, or nations, mutually hostile and suspicious. Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote in Britain,</a> a painful rift has been exposed and polling day itself will not necessarily heal it. If diehard Clinton and Trump supporters sat down to dinner tonight, would they find much to talk about?</p> <p>In Chevy Chase, an affluent neighbourhood in north-west Washington DC, an area where deer roam audaciously in the gardens of multimillion-dollar houses, Trump fans are hard to find.

Trump is a regrettable example of the latter. He has no politics and caters to the worst part of the American psyche. He caters to people who don\u2019t know what fascism is.\u201d</p> <p>Asked his opinion of Trump\u2019s supporters, Avdoyan replied: \u201cThey\u2019re scared little people.\u201d</p> <p>And how would they regard him? \u201cI\u2019m gay.

Anderton said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to talk to people who were Trump supporters. I wouldn\u2019t want to engage with them.\u201d </p> <p>Cohn responded: \u201cI would, even if they\u2019re \u2018deplorables\u2019. Bring them on. Those voting for Trump think it\u2019s two different countries and two different cultures. They see liberals and Democrats as alien life forms. I grew up in a rural environment and it\u2019s not like guns are totally alien to us. It\u2019s part of class, educational, geographical resentment: it\u2019s more their perception than my perception.\u201d</p> <p>America has been described as a split-screen nation and it is, of course, about much more than class: some polls show Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">at 0% among African American voters</a>. But this is the year that a Republican, campaigning as an anti-intellectual vulgarian, won over many who feel neglected by what they view as the metropolitan intelligentsia. America, home of the class divide that dare not speak its name.</p>",

  "<p>Three months ago it looked like a reasonable assumption. In the light of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership, the annual meeting of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund </a>would surely be a re-run of the knife-edge affair in October 2008, held less than a month after Lehman Brothers went bust and no western bank was deemed safe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/imf-annual-meeting-agenda-economics-growth-brexit\">Brexit, low growth  and the spectre  of protectionism stalk an IMF in sombre mood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The expectation was that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>vote would push the UK economy into an immediate recession, with severe knock-on consequences for the eurozone. Financial markets would be sent into a tailspin, just as they were eight years ago when finance ministers and central bank governors assembled in Washington with the global banking system hanging by a thread. Credit had dried up, trade had stopped, factories were being mothballed. Talk of a return to the 1930s was common and not misplaced.</p> <p>But history has not repeated; Brexit has not proved to be nearly as disruptive to global financial markets as many feared. The strongest echo of 2008 is the speculation surrounding Deutsche Bank; but unlike Lehman Brothers, Deutsche will survive. There will be no talk this week of a second Great Depression. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Yet there is a sense in which the challenge for policymakers is even more testing than it was back then. At least in 2008, they knew what they had to do. It was obvious the banks needed a lot more capital to ensure they remained solvent and it was also clear that the public sector would have to provide it.</p> <p>Instead of the normal lengthy communique, the G7 issued a succinct <a href=\"http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm081010.htm\">five-point plan </a>designed to show that the world\u2019s leading industrial nations would act swiftly and decisively. Recapitalisation of the banks was followed in the ensuing months by aggressive measures to boost growth: deep cuts in interest rates, quantitative easing, extra public spending and reductions in taxes.</p> <p>That, in retrospect, proved to be the easy bit. Global capitalism lost its mojo in 2008 and never got it back. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/21/no-economy-is-even-close-to-achieving-its-personal-best\">Growth has remained weak and fragile, even though central banks have kept monetary policy looser for longer than even the deepest pessimist expected when the stimulus programmes began</a>. Brexit is the manifestation of a problem that surfaced in 2008 and has never remotely been solved: how to make the globalised model of finance-dominated capital work for the mass of voters in the developed world. Voters are no longer satisfied when they hear politicians say there is little they can do in the face of global forces. They think that is a cop out, which indeed it is. Governments retain enormous powers: they just have to be prepared to use them. Governments of the left have proved to be just as pusillanimous as governments of the right, which helps explain why the politics of the post-crisis period has not gone to script.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The belief on the left was that 2008 sounded the death knell for the model of capitalism that dominated the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st; one based around privatisation, trickle-down economics, and a shift in the balance of power away from organised labour and towards international banks. Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy would prove to be the equivalent of the Opec oil shock of 1973, the moment the pendulum swung, only this time from right to left.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work out like that. There was no social democratic moment because social democratic parties had largely bought into the idea that markets knew best. They had no critique of what had gone wrong so they lacked a strategy to put things right. What\u2019s more, they still don\u2019t, which is why challenges to Jeremy Corbyn from his Labour party rivals have been so feeble.</p> <p>While the social-democratic left has been flailing around, the public mood has darkened. In Britain at least, this cannot be blamed on rising inequality because inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient has not risen since the financial crisis and has stayed pretty much unchanged for the past 25 years.</p> <p>The problem in the UK has been that living standards for those on average incomes have flatlined while those of the 0.1% at the very top have continued to rise. In the years leading up to the crisis, rising living standards meant there was less anger among the workers on \u00a320,000 at the generous pay deals being awarded to their bosses. Now there is barely disguised fury and a political backlash against globalisation that has made negotiating new trade deals a thankless task.</p> <p>Individual governments can sniff the way the wind is blowing. As John Gray wrote in a recent edition of the New Statesman: \u201cMost people are unimpressed by visions of an imaginary egalitarian capitalism. They turn instead to the power of the state to protect them from the anarchy of the market.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the appetite among voters for controls. Ask them whether they support a financial transactions tax and they answer yes. Ask them whether they support curbs on the dumping of cheap Chinese steel that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/tata-steel-financial-aid-pledge-remains-despite-scrapping-of-sale\">threatening jobs in Port Talbot</a> and they answer yes. Ask them if they want controls on immigration and they answer yes.</p> <p>In this, the public shows more consistency than the politicians. Conservative Brexiters are in favour of free movement of capital and goods, but not of people. The Labour party is up for controls on money and goods but supports free movement of labour. The freedoms integral to globalisation are increasingly at odds with democracy. Something has to give.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In the introduction to <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119120950.html\">a recently published book of essays</a>*, Michael Jacobs and Mariana Mazzucato say that the state has a crucial role to play in making economies more prosperous and successful, not least through the role the state can play in nurturing and supporting innovation. This runs counter to the idea that governments should limit themselves to correcting occasional and short-lived market failure, but as Jacobs and Mazzucato rightly note markets are the result of political decisions.</p> <p>The past eight years have been spent trying and failing to get the pre-2008 model of capitalism back on its feet. In its recent trade and development report, UNCTAD conjured up the memory of Karl Polanyi, the Hungarian-American economist who insisted that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)\">a \u201cgreat transformation\u201d was needed to ensure that markets delivered a stable and prosperous future for all</a>. </p> <p>As UNCTAD wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cTrust would have to be rebuilt, regulations strengthened, and rights and representation expanded. Western governments after the second world war were able to strike a balance between market-driven efficiency and the demands for shared prosperity and greater economic security.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There is one big difference with eight years ago. Central banks have become hyperactive in their determination to prevent weak growth and low inflation becoming recession and deflation. Ironically, the great transformation of central banks has helped ensure that nothing else has fundamentally changed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119120950.html\">*Rethinking capitalism; Wiley; \u00a314.99</a><br></p>",
  "<p>A naked middle-aged man is sitting on a donkey, captured in the cool light of northern European art, unsparing of its description of flesh. The image is a self-portrait by the German-born art and fashion photographer Juergen Teller, shot in the London workplace that the British architects <a href=\"http://www.6a.co.uk/\">6a</a> have designed for him. He tells how, as a young man travelling in Turkey, he was nearly raped while riding such a beast, by the man sitting behind him. This photograph, he says, is \u201cmy way of making my peace with donkeys\u201d.</p> <p>To the casual eye there\u2019s not much to see in the grey architecture in which the picture was taken. It\u2019s certainly less arresting than the Teutonic Silenus or ass-centaur in the centre. But the space is integral to the image: by a combination of intent and chance, 6a\u2019s building is a landscape that acts as a setting, prompt and influence on Teller\u2019s work. It is an active participant, sometimes conspicuous and sometimes not, which is what architecture should be.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.emerson.arch.ethz.ch/\">Tom Emerson</a> of 6a puts it, Teller is not a studio photographer, but uses \u201cthe natural environment, just where it is\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During a shoot the studio can have the frenzy of a baroque court. At other times it is monastic, a place of quiet work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He might shoot in a hotel bathroom or the back of a limousine. The ostensible purpose of the new building was therefore to serve all the pre- and post-production work that goes with photography, the planning of props and personnel that a shoot requires, the refinement of the tone and balance of images, the laying out of books and exhibitions, more than to make a place where photographs might actually be taken.</p> <p>As the project progressed, however, its site became the sort of environment that inspires Teller. He was engaged by the spectacle of trees being lifted into place in its courtyard gardens, their rootballs neatly wrapped. He was also struck by the costs involved: \u201cOh my God, are you kidding me? I had to pay \u00a320,000 just to have the street closed so they could get the trees in. OK, so I might as well photograph it. Then I got inspired.\u201d So trees became a favoured prop and subject. He shot workmen labouring to insert one in the ground: \u201cI find that really poetic, like those Americans putting their flag up. You know\u2026 <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/WW2_Iwo_Jima_flag_raising.jpg\">Iwo Jima</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The building site became a location, as did the exterior of the building, in an area of west London that is punctuated by industrial units (still), postwar housing and flyovers, as eventually did the completed interiors. Teller shot a famous actress with urban foxes he found inhabiting the property.

Walls are sometimes glass to allow space to flow from inside to outside, sometimes opaque. There are double-height spaces and mezzanines to house such things as offices for Teller\u2019s team, a kitchen and dining table where staff and visitors can be convivial together, a secluded room for thinking and yoga.</p> <p>The material is wherever possible concrete: concrete floors, walls, ceilings, stairs, paving and a strong rhythm of concrete beams that hold apart the party walls with the two neighbouring properties. There are touches of brass and ceramic, some decorative floor tiles Teller found in Beirut and surprisingly old-fashioned taps. Emerson borrows a phrase from another member of his practice to describe these: they\u2019re \u201cthe \u2018whiskers on the dragon\u2019, that thing that gives the whole building character, and makes it angry or serene or whatever\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ab5cbc65ce6ab3105b99ceea83af54e45361342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ab5cbc65ce6ab3105b99ceea83af54e45361342/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"The baby on the plate is Ed Teller, Juergen\u2019s son.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The baby on the plate is Ed Teller, Juergen\u2019s son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To make almost all the building out of a single substance gives it the quality of a body. Somewhat in the way that parts as different as fingers, ears or stomach are unified through all being flesh, the concrete can change itself from something massive and earthbound to precise beams overhead, to forming treads and balustrades that you touch with your feet or hands. It can be rough, marked with the boards of its moulds, or smooth. In the courtyards a thin concrete layer was selectively smashed, so that plants can grow through the cracks. Where ventilation is needed it is perforated with cruciform patterns of holes. In places there are graffiti-like stains, accidentally caused by cleaning, that \u201creally upset\u201d Teller, \u201cbut now I like them\u201d.</p> <p>Hard and grey as it is, the concrete could be monotonous, but here it serves as a medium for revealing variety. Apart from the range of its own surfaces, it catches different kinds of light, blue-ish from one direction and gold-ish from another, that changes with the time of day and the seasons. Some incidents from the site\u2019s former lives are allowed to stay, the vegetation from neighbour\u2019s gardens that engulfs a party wall and, a bit like a bit of colonnade in a Roman desert city, a fragment of concrete frame.</p> <p>It also serves the workplace\u2019s multiple moods, which during a shoot can have the frenzy of a baroque court, with 40 or 50 people pursuing their trades in makeup, hair, lighting, props and whatever, plus models or actors and their entourages, plus whatever livestock Teller might want to introduce. At other times it is monastic, a place of quiet work. The building has a semi-public aspect and a very private one, as the front facade tells you. Generally mute, it suggests through unusual aspects of its scale and detail an exceptional universe beyond. It is flat, but when the front door opens, a deep vista is revealed, through layers of glass and courtyards, 60 metres to the back of the site.<br></p> <p>Teller\u2019s images take a frank relish in the specifics of surfaces, in the half-repulsive glisten on a piece of seafood, in mottled skin, body hair, the granularity of dirt, talcum on the nappy zone of his baby son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9d7661099035b312815483d6a5a84cc3ccb3b8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d7661099035b312815483d6a5a84cc3ccb3b8d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Rampling with fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Rampling with fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>6a have a comparable but gentler fascination with the tactility of building materials. Teller combines an openness to chance with a will to be exacting when it matters. As I know from having commissioned 6a myself, for a domestic extension that is all wood rather than Teller\u2019s all concrete, so do they. In Teller\u2019s building, for example, they took care to match the width of the board marks on the concrete with that of the actual timber of the doors. They set up barely noticeable echoes, as with a certain splayed shape that appears as a brass door-pull, a concrete hood over the place where the charger for an electric car is placed, and the housing for roller shutters.</p> <p>So the building and its uses are complementary and unfold over time. It deals nicely with architecture\u2019s generative paradox, which is that it is about creating a fixed and stable object that also, as both a construction site and an inhabited place, is in constant flux. It shows how architecture works as a background to life, without being inert and boring. \u201cI use this place in a very inspiring way,\u201d as Teller puts it, \u201cand wherever I go it looks fresh to me. I shoot anywhere. I like it that I can do a lot of things here and make them totally new.\u201d</p> <p>No donkeys were harmed in the writing of this article.</p>",
  "<p>The road to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/07/retail.theobserver\">Haparanda</a> in Sweden winds through elk country. Where there are clearings in the birch and pine the view is snowy tundra, empty as the moon. It is a bus route, but it could be heading to the rim of the world, an impression that is only reinforced, as the bus I\u2019m on begins to slow, by the appearance of the terminal itself. Round, sleek and built of glass and steel, it hovers in the mud and snowdrifts like a spaceship making an unscheduled call. High on its flank, bold lettering announces that it serves the twin towns of Haparanda-Tornio, one here in Sweden and the other in Finland.</p> <p>The border, on an island just outside the shopping mall, is 50 yards away. Marked by an artificial stream, it would be obvious, but for the ice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Locals are fond of their Ikea, the planet\u2019s northern-most blue box, built to attract Russians and Finns</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The midnight sun in summer must be magical here, and if I had arrived in February I might have seen the Northern Lights. But the timing was not my choice; I had to follow someone else. In April 1917, at the height of the first world war, the Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, came through here on his way from Switzerland to Petrograd, the capital of revolutionary Russia.</p> <p>It was the most momentous rail journey in history, the first step on the road to Soviet power, and Lenin completed it in eight days.

It must be packed at some point \u2013 each year, they say, two million shoppers tramp through \u2013 but now the car park is empty.</p> <p>Trade in the town was brisker in the first world war. Back then, unending Swedish trains brought rubber, British boots and broadcloth, jute sacks marked for Tokyo, and oranges for old Peking. The border town was flooded by a sea of crates, a shadow-city with its own dark streets and dead-end squares. No bureaucrat could possibly keep pace, still less search every crate for contraband. By day, the bars in town were full of men in cheap, ill-fitting suits; at night the action shifted to the forest, where fortunes could be made from army-issue guns and fuses, German pharmaceutical supplies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905a75d9d591c76736fd1916dd4a48ec4a4313ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905a75d9d591c76736fd1916dd4a48ec4a4313ad/0_50_4011_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another country: the Tornio river follows the border between Sweden and Finland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another country: the Tornio river follows the border between Sweden and Finland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strangers could disappear in moments in those primal woods. Bad debts were settled with a bullet in the dark; it would have been a simple matter to have dealt with Lenin by the same technique. The British even sent an officer to see to it. The man did what he thought he could. He strip-searched Lenin and he questioned him, but in the end he sent the Russian on his way. Lenin went on to create the first ever Communist superpower.

When I was growing up it was thought of as a woman\u2019s book, therefore not of interest to me. It\u2019s written by a woman and the central character is a woman, but it\u2019s about the history of racial tension in the US. I was expecting some elongated Mills &amp; Boon scenario and I found something profoundly interesting about a period of history that I\u2019m quite interested in.

  "<p>The upper echelons of pop are a global concern, unlimited by physical space. Swedish producers buff songs for Barbadian singers via email; faraway fanbases are cultivated through social media.</p> <p>Further down the food chain, a fierce sense of localism often prevails.

A set of love-gone-wrong songs set in a not hugely salubrious bit of Greater Manchester, <em>Blossoms</em> sounds immediately familiar, like a record you already own but have forgotten, repurposing as it does the DNA of the band\u2019s obvious musical forebears (Oasis, Stone Roses, the Courteeners) with a chart-facing polish that recalls Cheshire\u2019s the 1975.</p> <p>Backlit and barely visible for the first few songs, Blossoms actually enter to a very different sound altogether: Kanye West\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q604eed4ad0\">Black Skinhead</a>, a slab of glam-rock oompah that finds some surprising common ground with Blossoms\u2019 driving set opener, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VXvOJ6b12k\">At Most a Kiss</a>.

Born in a Stockport scaffolder\u2019s yard <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35167399\">and named after a local pub</a>, Blossoms have become the latest standard-bearers for a strain of northern guitar melodicism, passed like a baton around Manchester and Liverpool, with occasional forays into Sheffield (Arctic Monkeys) and the East Midlands (Kasabian, Jake Bugg). So Blossoms are not wildly innovative (their use of keyboards doesn\u2019t count as radical) or actually that rebellious \u2013 they lack the gang swagger and rock\u2019n\u2019roll fundamentalism of a Catfish and the Bottlemen, say.</p> <p>Indeed, the forbidding initial dazzle of Blossoms\u2019 light show, tasked with making the five-piece seem a little more mysterious than perhaps they are, soon melts away with the warmth of the bellowing crowd and Blossoms are revealed as tousled young men, rocking the kind of lankiness that suggests slap-up dinners have been few and far between on the band\u2019s seemingly never-ending 2016 tour (roughly, February to mid-December; they were on tour in late 2015 as well).</p> <p>So: they\u2019re not selling anything novel. But they do understand their audience well. \u201cAnyone in the crowd been dumped recently?\u201d asks Ogden of his young crowd at one point. His flowing locks and angular limbs can\u2019t help but conjure up the young Richard Ashcroft; he\u2019s wearing very, very white shoes.</p> <p>A guy called Dan has been dumped. A girl called Kayleigh has done the dumping, it transpires. \u201cLet\u2019s have a big boo for Kayleigh everybody,\u201d Ogden says, without much rancour, before launching into My Favourite Room, a Noel Gallagher-esque ballad about his own break-up. The key moment? Ogden ends the song with the chorus of Babybird\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIQRZn-JvPs\">You\u2019re Gorgeous</a>, which then segues into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e6oDGfLZrU\">Half the World Away</a> by Oasis, both prompting a mass singalong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBtVjjLtEY8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WBtVjjLtEY8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Charlemagne.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>You forgive a lot of this canon-worshipping lack of topspin, because the tunes come hand over fist. The crowd sing the final two choruses to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ5TjID7Hvg\">Blow</a> unaccompanied; it\u2019s a song whose debts divide intriguingly between Arctic Monkeys, the La\u2019s and Echo and the Bunnymen.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrbL5hLGZ6A\">My Favourite Room</a> itself is nicely granular, sifting through feelings, invoking what Ogden\u2019s friends say. Most accomplished of all is their signature tune <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBtVjjLtEY8\">Charlemagne</a>, a nagging, baggy throwback that glistens with 80s keys and opaque lyrics. The band\u2019s debut has correctly been likened to a Spotify playlist, light on filler; tonight\u2019s run-through bears out that analysis. Ogden tears his set list off the floor and hands it to a fan; there is no encore.</p>",

  "<p>Amma Asante is drinking tea \u2013 \u201cIf you have PG Tips, all the better,\u201d she calls to the retreating waiter \u2013 in the plush quietness and gleaming surfaces of London\u2019s Cafe Royal.

Earlier this year Asante was also invited to become a member of the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has had its biggest ever intake of new members following intense criticism over the lack of racial diversity in Oscar nominees. In joining a Hollywood club with a decades-long reputation for being largely white, male and aged over 50, she\u2019ll now have voting rights on the Oscars, and a part to play in steering the industry and what comes to our screens in the future.</p> <p>For the moment, though, she\u2019s concentrating on <em>A United Kingdom</em>, which had an unexpected \u2013 and even inconvenient \u2013 genesis. About 18 months ago, Asante was about to move not only home but also country, quitting the Netherlands, where she had lived for eight years, in favour of Denmark, where her husband is from. Amid all the upheaval and readjustment the phone rang. At the other end was actor David Oyelowo, whom Asante had known since they worked together on the BBC drama <em>Brothers and Sisters </em>back in 1998. Oyelowo, fresh from playing Martin Luther King in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/selma-observer-film-review\"><em>Selma</em></a>, wanted to persuade her to be part of an idea whose moment had come \u2013 \u201ca labour of love\u201d, as he described it.</p> <p>The project was to film the life of Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, the first prime minister of Botswana and his wife, an office clerk from Eltham. Their marriage, in 1948, when Botswana was still the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, had immense ramifications, both personal and political: Khama, who had met Williams at a missionary society dance in London, had been supposed to return from his stint at Balliol College, Oxford and subsequent studies for the bar to take up the kingship of the Bamangwato people. He was not supposed to return with a white, English bride, and particularly not just as neighbouring South Africa had made interracial marriage illegal under the apartheid system; her arrival angered both Bamangwato chiefs and many who couldn\u2019t believe that their future leader would choose an outsider above a local. Ruth Williams\u2019s family also opposed the marriage, and there was vehement objection from the British government, enraged by what they saw as a dangerous misstep in managing regional relationships.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x97b\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2683649\"            data-video-name=\"A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bedbcfe4b0fe30498a4a41\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video\">A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Oyelowo had first come across Susan Williams\u2019s book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/colour-bar.html\"><em>Colour Bar</em></a>, on which the film is based, in 2010, through producers Justin Moore-Lewy and Charlie Mason, who had acquired the rights. Since then, the three had struggled to get the project, with Oyelowo playing Khama, off the ground. But the story of Khama, Williams and Bechuanaland\u2019s gradual journey towards independence immediately struck a chord with Asante, fresh from her success with the recently released <em>Belle</em>, which also drew on a complex piece of history to explore relationships across racial divides. Her father, she tells me, was a pan-African, a man who believed in a united states of Africa. \u201cHe grew up in Ghana when it was still the Gold Coast; grew up, as my mother did, as the child of a colony, and watched it become independent. And Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence, so we always lived with that badge on our chest; I was always raised knowing that was the country that I came from. I grew up being able to repeat \u2013 at seven or eight years old \u2014 the speeches of Kwame Nkrumah, who became the first president of Ghana.\u201d</p> <p>Consequently, she explains, she was gripped not only by the fierceness and endurance of the romantic relationship at the heart of the story, but also by the intricacy and subtleties of its sociopolitical setting. Reading her way through Williams\u2019s book \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant, she says, but so dense with complex detail that she could only read 18 pages a day \u2013 she realised that she wanted to explore how Khama came to a point where he could contemplate utterly changing the political landscape of his country. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t know the story,\u201d she remarks, \u201cI was very aware of the young, privileged men of Africa who moved through the UK in the 1940s, who were sent to be educated. I knew it because the women weren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>What she didn\u2019t want, she explains, was to privilege one aspect of the drama over the other. And neither did she think it was necessary: \u201cYou could create a very political backdrop against the love story. Because, really, what is interesting about being a black man married to a white woman today? Yes, in certain quarters, it\u2019s still difficult and there is still a taboo. But it\u2019s not that interesting \u2013 why pick them, as opposed to any other interracial couple? What\u2019s really interesting is what happened once this couple chose to fall in love, the period in which they fell in love, which was right as South Africa was about to enshrine apartheid into its laws, and the fallout that occurs.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qx90wdRD2I\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9Qx90wdRD2I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qx90wdRD2I\">The trailer for Belle, Assante\u2019s second film as director.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She notes \u2013 while also acknowledging the earlier film\u2019s vital importance at the time \u2013 that <em>A United Kingdom</em> is not a rerun of <em>Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner</em>, the 1967 film in which a black man played by Sidney Poitier courts a white woman, to the consternation of her parents. Rather, she says, she had to find those things in the story that would resonate with contemporary issues. Among those is the issue of transition and identity. One facet of the story she focused on explores the idea that someone might be sent away at a formative age to experience life and education in another country and yet still be expected to return essentially unaltered; it also shows those at home, inching their way towards establishing nationhood in the face of societal change.</p> <p>I tell her that I was struck by the numerous interwoven stories of restriction and emancipation, and the different weight that history accorded them. Near the start of Asante and screenwriter Guy Hibbert\u2019s film, Khama and his wife, played by Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike, return to Bechuanaland and are met with hostility, despite his previous popularity; he determines to address the <em>kgotla</em> \u2013 a public meeting \u2013 and put his case. Scores of Bamangwato men, many of them dressed in suits, walk from their villages to attend, but there is barely a woman to be seen. Asante nods: she dotted a few around the edges, she remembers, as if to suggest that they couldn\u2019t help themselves from coming to listen, but there was a firm message that politics was not for women.</p> <p>And yet she knew that she had to represent the view of Bamangwato women. \u201cWhen I first came to the script, the point of view of the black female wasn\u2019t really there, and it was very important,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought about my mother, I thought about my aunts; my mother was born and raised in a very rural village, but her brother is a chief. And the idea that he should go abroad and return, even with someone of the same colour but who was an outsider, and say, this is going to be your queen, I just imagined what their response would be. And there you have it, in the film.\u201d</p> <p>Asante has had a lifetime of considering the nuances that attach themselves to the questions of identity and power informing her work. Now 47, she reckons that she is in a position to empower two sides of her identity \u2013 her Ghanaian heritage and her British upbringing \u2013 to be in dialogue with one another. \u201cI allow that conversation to happen, and it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what side I\u2019ll come out on each day, or what decision I\u2019ll come out with on each day, but it is a dynamic rather than a conflict.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2613452f51f0f0245ceb64ca9cb832f80999453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2613452f51f0f0245ceb64ca9cb832f80999453/0_45_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo in A United Kingdom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo in A United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is she able to put into words what characterises these different parts of her? She mentions her pride in the traditions of her parents\u2019 Ghanaian background, and of how important it is to her to be able to speak their language. \u201cAnd yet, the very British side of me, who is the child of immigrants, is the side of me that welcomes outsiders \u2013 the modern British side, that is \u2013 and enjoys crossing boundaries and sharing boundaries and being open to what an outsider might bring. But I\u2019m still deeply protective of my traditions at the same time.\u201d (Amusingly, as we both ponder the miniature glass cloche covering the miniature biscuit that has accompanied tea, she puts her mild aversion to elaborate service down to her British \u201cside\u201d.)</p> <p>She grew up in Streatham, which she describes, in the early 1980s and beyond, as \u201ca pretty racist environment\u201d \u2013 complete with graffiti on the walls and lit matches pushed through the letterbox. \u201cThat was just a way of life,\u201d she says now, inadvertently making reference to the title of her first feature film, \u201cbut I was aware of the stress it put my parents through.\u201d Her accountant father\u2019s response was to tell his family that there was one thing they had to remember at all times: \u201cKnow that you are loved.\u201d</p> <p>Fascinatingly, these exact words recur as a line in <em>Belle </em>(2013), the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/04/dido-belle-slaves-daughter-who-lived-in-georgian-elegance\">Dido Elizabeth Belle</a>, the child of a British admiral and an African slave, who was brought to England by her father and left in the care of her great-uncle, Lord Mansfield; they are the words spoken to her by her father, whom she only knows for a few hours, as he bids her farewell. Even more poignantly, Asante\u2019s father died during the filming of <em>Belle</em>, and she talks movingly about his impact on her work. She will always, she thinks, create benevolent fathers who are also flawed; hers, whom she describes as her hero, \u201cmade mistakes, but when he got it right, he got it really right\u201d.</p> <p>Belle grew up in Kenwood House in Hampstead, surrounded by great material privilege and familial love, but simultaneously excluded from vast swaths of society by the colour of her skin. As in <em>A United Kingdom</em>, there is a love story; but there is also a highly involved narrative that chronicles the changing legal position of slave cargo \u2013 at heart, the degree to which slaves being transported at sea were regarded as human beings rather than mere possessions, to be jettisoned at the drop of a hat. Both elements of the film unite to portray a mixed-race woman growing in self-recognition and self-possession, and balancing the different claims made on her loyalties.</p> <p>Both movies also imply that a key moment in the journey towards selfhood is the acceptance that individuals contain multitudes. As a child, Asante began to act, and joined the cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/07/bbc.television1\"><em>Grange Hill</em></a>; she was part of the \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign, and was one of nine cast members to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/mar/07/grange-hill-nancy-reagan-white-house-just-say-no\">visit Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House</a>. But she would also develop lines to use in her off-screen life; for instance, she always used to reply \u201cGhana\u201d when asked where she was from, because \u201cStreatham\u201d seemed to cause confusion of the \u201cNo, where are you really from?\u201d variety. \u201cSo that became too complex,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand also it was a big fat rejection, because I actually felt as British as anybody else but I would constantly be reminded that I wasn\u2019t. And so it was easier to just say African.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14bff481e025f0a69d560c0c0091d44e09f3dd36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14bff481e025f0a69d560c0c0091d44e09f3dd36/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Assante\u2019s debut feature, A Way of Life, told a story about racism using white characters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assante\u2019s debut feature, A Way of Life, told a story about racism using white characters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagenet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But things changed somewhat when her debut, <em>A Way of Life</em>, was released. Set in Wales, the film tells the story of a young, single mother fighting extreme disadvantage, and also of her Turkish, Muslim neighbour. It started to get a little attention, and \u201cquite often I would read about myself, and it would be, \u2018young British film-maker\u2019. And when you see words written about you, they\u2019re very powerful.\u201d Did she feel that, in a sense, she was being claimed? Yes, she replies, \u201cbut there was a sense of, well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying all along, but haven\u2019t been allowed to say. But that\u2019s exactly what I am. I\u2019m a young British director.\u201d</p> <p>We talk more broadly about the issues of migration and the resistance to it that are bedevilling the world at the moment. Asante locates in much of the fear that surrounds the conversation an interesting insight into entitlement. \u201cI often think about what we might look back at in 100 or 200 years\u2019 time from now and see as really\u2026\u201d \u2013 she grasps for the word \u2013 \u201c<em>primitive</em>. Because we fear, we really believe, there isn\u2019t enough to share, and there really isn\u2019t enough to go around, because that\u2019s a narrative that we\u2019re given. But that\u2019s because we\u2019ve decided that certain boundaries should exist and must exist, and you should stay over there, because the world over there is created for you, and the world over here is created for us. Well, that\u2019s never worked.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, she points out, change is always complicated, and when it happens too quickly, can be problematic. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a country of fearful people,\u201d she says, and in <em>A United Kingdom</em>, she is understanding of the competing demands on the Attlee and Churchill governments, both of which adopted problematic stances towards Bechuanaland as they sought to rebuild postwar British society. And yet, as she also says and the film makes clear, there was a good outcome: Seretse Khama took his country towards independence and democratic representation, and there it remains. She has already been criticised, she says, for making too much of a crowd-pleaser, to which she retorts that she can\u2019t change history. But does she think that underlying that attitude is an unfamiliarity, perhaps even tantamount to disbelief, with the business of telling an African success story?</p> <p>She nods vigorously. \u201cThere was an argument over whether we should show some of the more beautiful images that we have in the film of Africa. This is why you need a person of colour at the table. Because I said, why not? That\u2019s the Africa I know. Hundreds of thousands of people travel to Botswana every single year to go and see the animal life there. Why would we pretend that that doesn\u2019t exist? Why wouldn\u2019t we show the beautiful sunsets? I remember waking up in my mother\u2019s African village to beautiful sunrises and beautiful sunsets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re so used to seeing flies in African children\u2019s faces, we\u2019re so used to seeing what I call a degraded Africa, that does not have a person of colour at the centre of their own story \u2013 they\u2019re usually a supporting character who\u2019s an observer of their own story \u2013 that sometimes I think that when you see it told a different way, which means that you take a character like Rosamund Pike played in Ruth and flip the switch and make her the other, then it makes some people feel uncomfortable. Your expectations are disrupted. And I believe that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. I hold that flag.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/amma-asante-female-directors-a-united-kingdom\">Amma Asante: film industry chiefs 'don't trust female directors'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asante is full of praise for Pike, who came to film after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/05/gone-girl-review-two-different-readings-modern-marriage\"><em>Gone Girl</em></a>, and immediately embraced the no-makeup, frizzy hair and sensible shoes look that her character adopted when she moved to Botswana (there are rather more swinging skirts with nipped-in waists at the jazz clubs that feature in the film\u2019s London scenes). \u201cTo me, she embodied the courage that I imagined Ruth had,\u201d she says. Particularly impressive was Pike\u2019s insistence that she would simply drop to the ground during a scene in which Williams, suffering from diphtheria, collapses on a dusty road. Asante, worried about the numerous rocks in the path, had had sleepless nights wondering how they could conceal a mattress, but had to content herself with setting the crew to remove as many stones as they could. When one of Khama and Williams\u2019s sons visited the set, he delivered the ultimate imprimatur: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see your mother and father come back to life.\u201d</p> <p>Next, Asante is going to tackle the Nazis. <em>Where Hands Touch</em>, which she has written herself, will start filming in October, with <em>The Hunger Games\u2019s</em> Amandla Stenberg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/captain-fantastic-review-viggo-mortensen\"><em>Captain Fantastic\u2019s</em></a><em> </em>George MacKay starring as a teenage couple facing the not inconsiderable obstacle of his membership of the Hitler Youth and the fact that she is a mixed-race girl living in the Third Reich. Once again, issues of identity play an integral part, as does Asante\u2019s abiding interest in capturing social and political structures at the moment where they begin to fall apart.</p> <p>We conclude by talking about broader issues of representation within the film industry, and specifically in the context of her recent membership of the Academy. How effective does she feel that development will be in promoting change and inclusion in the entertainment business? It is, she says, a \u201csubstantial and relevant\u201d move, and she commends the Academy for doing it. But she remains realistic: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in it, it seems slow and it feels slow. When we look back in 100 years, who knows how it will look with hindsight. However, it does feel like we\u2019re turning a corner. It\u2019s not a short corner, it\u2019s a very big bend, and we\u2019re some way around it and we\u2019ve still got a long way to go. Let\u2019s be really honest about this: the Oscars reflect the industry, so the Oscars can change but they can only do so much without the industry changing as well.\u201d</p> <p>In other words the movies need to get made in the first place, so that audiences are not presented with eight identical films when they go to the multiplex. Cinemagoers, too, can play their part, choosing to see a more diverse range of films as they are released, and not necessarily waiting until they come out on DVD.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting, \u201cshe continues, \u201cthat if you walk into an industry party and it\u2019s predominantly male, predominantly of a certain age, predominantly white, it starts to feel old-fashioned. It doesn\u2019t feel progressive. When you walk into a place and you see women, and you see people of colour, and varying abilities and disabilities, it feels like it\u2019s somehow a reflection of the world \u2013 you\u2019re in the world, and that we\u2019re in a relevant industry.\u201d She laughs, remembering her recent trip to a vibrant Toronto. \u201cThat didn\u2019t mean to say that the lovely old white men were gone. They were still there!\u201d</p> <p>The bottom line, she thinks, is that the industry needs to see a broadening of the wares as a business opportunity, not merely as a matter of morality: \u201cIf you do not have a flourish of new lifeblood,\u201d she says, \u201cyou don\u2019t get a beautiful ocean, you get a dull, dank puddle.\u201d</p> <p><em>A United Kingdom opens the </em><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=unitedkingdom\"><em>London film festival on Wednesday</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.aunitedkingdomfilm.com/\"><em>will be in cinemas from 25 November</em></a></p> <h2>Race on screen: critic Jonathan Romney\u2019s highlights from this year\u2019s London film festival</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc23ee529cce4b0df99ea55e96756a7caa9a7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc23ee529cce4b0df99ea55e96756a7caa9a7a1/0_112_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teyonah Parris in Chi-Raq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teyonah Parris in Chi-Raq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/chi-raq-review-spike-lees-urgent-angry-and-very-sexy-midlife-masterpiece\"><strong>Chi-Raq</strong></a><br>Dir: Spike Lee<br><strong>The Greek comedy of Lysistrata\u2019s sex strike, adapted as the story of a Chicago woman who campaigns to stop gang war</strong><br>Spike Lee\u2019s most acclaimed film for ages \u2013 a jovial yet impassioned musical strike against violence within black communities.

He gives it some juice, the line looks good \u2026 because it is good. Plop! In it goes. A birdie! Dustin Johnson to answer. He can\u2019t. Europe 1up in the first match.

He shows lovely touch as he lofts his approach past the flag, spinning it back to within 15ft to set up a fine birdie chance and put a little bit of early pressure on the US pairing. Koepka attempts to salvage something from this hole with a chip from the fringe. It\u2019s good but not good enough. Meanwhile, Dustin Johnson\u2019s approach has left him 30ft away from the pin. He pushes his putt along the undulating green and it\u2019s got the line \u2026 but is agonisingly short. Pieters, from off the back of the green, goes just as close. So McIlroy, from 15ft, to win the hole for Europe. He gives it some juice to secure the line \u2026 but it misses to the left.

He attacked his Democratic rival in starkly personal terms, saying: \u201cShe has bad temperament. She could actually be crazy,\u201d and implying that she had been unfaithful for her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t even think she\u2019s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth. And really, folks, why should she be, right?\u201d </p> <p>The Republican nominee, whose rallies have long included loud chants of \u201clock her up\u201d directed towards Clinton, said bluntly on Saturday: \u201cShe should be in prison.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/hillary-clinton-debate-good-mood-reporters-rallies-enthusiasm\">Clinton rides wave of enthusiasm after Trump debate: 'One down, two to go'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump also mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">Clinton\u2019s collapse in September</a> at a ceremony commemorating the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t even make it 15ft to a car,\u201d he said of the incident sparked by the Democratic nominee being dehydrated while fighting pneumonia. In doing so, Trump pretended to stumble and then staggered about the stage. <br></p> <p>Trump also warned of the specter of voter fraud without evidence, revisiting accusations he first made in August that there would be voter fraud in \u201ccertain areas\u201d of Pennsylvania, a statement that was a clear dog-whistle about African American areas of Philadelphia. \u201cWatch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas,\u201d the Republican nominee told the almost exclusively white crowd in Manheim. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t lose an election because you know what I am talking about.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://billypenn.com/2016/08/08/what-sean-hannity-got-wrong-about-philly-election-fraud/\">A popular rightwing conspiracy theory</a> has long held that Mitt Romney was the victim in voter fraud there in 2012. The theory was premised on the fact that in 59 precincts in African American neighborhoods, Romney did not receive a single vote. There are 1,687 precincts in the city and Obama received over 85% of the vote there in 2012.</p> <p>The Republican nominee also complained about what he saw as a rigged debate and insisted that he had actually bested Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">on Monday night</a>. Trump also suggested that the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates deliberately gave him a defective microphone in an attempt to sabotage his performance. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/782313153308884992\">had said on Twitter</a>: \u201cI won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided \u2018spin\u2019 that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.\u201d</p> <p>While he was onstage, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">the New York Times reported</a> that Trump may not have paid taxes for an 18-year period. The Times, which obtained a leaked copy of Trump\u2019s 1995 returns, reported that the Republican nominee had taken a loss of $916m that year. The result of that loss was that Trump could have avoided paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades afterward. Trump is the first presidential nominee in decades who has not made his tax returns public. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/expat-trump-supporters-mexico-republicans-us-election\">Gringos for Trump: an unlikely cohort of American expats fuel support in Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a statement, a campaign spokesman did not deny the story. \u201cThe only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic party and their global special interests.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cMr Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\u201d </p> <p>The Clinton campaign also weighed in on the report. In a statement, campaign manager Robby Mook said: \u201cThis bombshell report reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump\u2019s past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever.\u201d The Clinton staffer added: \u201c[Trump] apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades \u2013 while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that \u2018smart\u2019. Now that the gig is up, why doesn\u2019t he go ahead and release his returns to show us all how \u2018smart\u2019 he really is?\u201d</p> <p>The speech had originally been billed as an attempt by Trump to woo former supporters of Bernie Sanders from the Democratic primary. Trump characterized a leaked audio tape of Clinton talking about the motivation of Sanders supporters in a February fundraiser as \u201cdemeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders\u201d. He went on to appeal to former Sanders supporters on the issue of trade while also calling the Vermont senator \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d, stating that he drew bigger crowds than Sanders and yet again labelling Sanders\u2019 endorsement of Clinton as \u201ca deal with the devil\u201d.</p>",

Lynch is a quality actor, capable also of fine fast comedy, as in <em>Sliding Doors</em>, but is getting to be the equivalent of listening to Orla Guerin on the radio, whose monotonal voice will drop in timbre only when sighing the word \u201cchildren\u201d.</p> <p>Hence the delight in hearing a clever Belfast doctor, talking quickly. \u201cNone of your CT shite \u2013 he needs to go straight to theatre,\u201d urged Coyle. Theatre was a battleground. The actual surgery was what might have resulted had Keith Floyd made a more than usually visceral cookery programme. For cannibals.

She redeemed herself hugely later, with some fiercely restrained weeping. I still find it unsettling to find such a star in such a very northern Irish cop drama, like seeing Ban Ki-Moon trying on trainers in Sports Direct or, um, watching George Clooney pop up on <em>ER</em>, but there\u2019s little doubt that, when she\u2019s not running pointlessly or looking gormlessly bloodied, her acting in close-ups lends this series even more of its deserved heft.</p> <p>There was a little of the stuff about why one should spend so many hours saving the life of someone who in other times might have been hastened to a noose, but it wasn\u2019t within in their hands, or pay grades, to judge and thus sensibly passed over. That\u2019ll have to be wisely left to our handsomely principled government. Coyle emerged, gruesomely knackered, with the cheerful, legally dodgy yet unassailable: \u201cHow\u2019s our strangler doing?\u201d This opening was his; give the man a spin-off. I would watch an entire series telling the tale of how Belfast\u2019s hospitals went from boondock backwaters to global cutting-edge within about 25 tiny years, thanks only to a lovely little surfeit of bullet wounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e4282e9d2b98e4acafb0eb8384d7a41e2b544f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e4282e9d2b98e4acafb0eb8384d7a41e2b544f3/0_0_5487_3658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karla Crome, left, and Laura Haddock in The Level.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This promises acres\u2019: Karla Crome, left, and Laura Haddock in The Level.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV Plc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.itvmedia.co.uk/programmes/programme-planner/level\"><strong>The Level</strong></a><strong> </strong>is set in Brighton and the ad-breaks are bookended with shots of the forlorn, burnt, buggered West Pier.

  "<p>The Instagram moment is the bare bum, of course: a gigantic backside clutched by a pair of muckle hands. It comes straight from the carnivalesque. Or not quite straight, because the artist, <a href=\"http://antheahamilton.com/\">Anthea Hamilton</a>, has enlarged it from a design by Gaetano Pesce for a New York apartment block, to which it would have been a doorway (a back entrance, so to speak) for social housing tenants.

The action of sunlight on kitchen surfaces produces a sequence of beautiful photograms: whorls left by wires, discs by plates and so on, geometric abstractions that resemble graceful paintings. Her hand photographs are also subtle and pensive. Female fingers touch objects \u2013 books, smartphones, pens \u2013 and are estranged into objects themselves. The nails are painted, producing five little palettes of colour in each shot: hoar frost on pine cones rhymes with silver fingernails; orange hair and orange nails contrast with blue denim. It is a way of noticing the sculptural qualities of our hands, as well as the peculiar connections between art, fashion and life.</p> <p>But the subtlety of these works seems undermined by the pygmy train that sits motionless in the gallery, covered in graffiti, including the significant exclamation Pride. When this was originally shown in <a href=\"http://www.wattis.org/view?id=213\">the US show</a> for which Pryde was shortlisted, it was to send up today\u2019s participatory art (<a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-carsten-holler-test-site\">Carsten H\u00f6ller\u2019s slides</a> and so forth). The bitter tone of this train, which infantilised every gallery-goer the artist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28ESoIGS5uA\">took for a ride</a> on its little seats, feels out of tune with the rest of her work.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.t293.it/artists/helen-marten/\">Helen Marten</a>, at 30, is the youngest but by far the most feted artist here. Her assemblages of apparently humdrum objects are catnip to galleries and collectors. Here\u2019s a sledge bearing the remains of a doll, fillets of plaster fish, cotton wool buds that splay from a toy foot like sparklers. Here\u2019s an unglazed teapot and then another, in the next accumulation, now painted yellow as if to carry some inscrutable running gag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76ef438b1dcda7e7d3b7753f57cf3af944d9d6a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76ef438b1dcda7e7d3b7753f57cf3af944d9d6a3/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brood and Bitter Pass, 2015 by Helen Marten.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brood and Bitter Pass, 2015 by Helen Marten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marten deals in overload and palimpsest \u2013 drawings upon drawings, images dragged and dropped over each other in paintings, which in turn appear slotted into gigantic sculptural contraptions. A game is deconstructed \u2013 solitaire played out against itself with white and brown balls; an object ramifies like hypertext, metal bars implying a cage, but also suggesting a cradle and the tripod for a witch\u2019s cauldron.</p> <p>The method appears split-new and digital, conjuring a seething web of random data. But the material itself is paradoxically old-fashioned. Stuff that might be metal may be sculpted in plaster; Marten also hammers, carves and welds. Each heap has its own syntax, which cannot quite be discerned; each feather and screw is itself, but also a clue to something else. The pull of this work (if it pulls you) is the invitation to keep trying to connect and decipher.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.heraldst.com/michael-dean/\">Michael Dean</a> (born 1977) has created what looks at first like a sort of dead man\u2019s gulch. You enter through hoardings of corrugated iron and wood, into a desert of glyphs \u2013 letters bent and twisted in various media that resemble nothing so much as standing figures or bristling cacti. It feels like the wild west, and there\u2019s a shining oasis of coins on the floor like a mirage, amounting to \u00a320,436.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eeabbe63c5d3536bf9c976da287a5020686ec914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeabbe63c5d3536bf9c976da287a5020686ec914/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sic Glyphs, 2016 by Michael Dean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Like the wild west\u2019: Sic Glyphs, 2016 by Michael Dean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the exact sum a British family of four is supposed to be able to live on; except the Dean has removed one penny to take it just below the breadline.

In other galleries, slabs of marble are exquisitely overpainted with patterns that float like water lilies on the surface; carpets, lampshades and chairs with a hint of art deco refer back to the tearoom that preceded the gallery long ago. The artist brings the gardens into the building too, with friezes of ferns, foliage and trees on pale sage walls. Stained glass in the windows casts pink and green light across the rooms, picked up by the gorgeous patterned carpets. This is pure charm: decoration fused with space, and it is no wonder that among all these homages Chaimowicz has planted a beautiful painting by his revered forebear: the great French intimist Edouard Vuillard.</p>",
  "<p>One Friday afternoon, I decided to check out a pea-sized lump on my neck that was causing me consternation. I started by calling my GP\u2019s surgery in south London. A recorded message informed me there were no appointments that day; after a few minutes, a receptionist came on the line and said that I could have an appointment on Monday. Not too bad, I thought, until I realised she was not talking about the Monday three days hence, but the one 10 days away. Not so good. I could also try for a walk-in slot or a phone consultation from 8am to 10am on weekday mornings.</p> <p>At this point, I downloaded the app from <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/babylon-health/id858558101?mt=8\" title=\"\">Babylon Health</a>, one of the leaders in online doctor consultations, on to my smartphone. The homepage was purple and teal, the writing welcomingly blobby. I tapped on \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d and after half-a-dozen questions, it suggested that I \u201cbook a consultation\u201d. I was offered a choice between a GP, a specialist or a therapist. The appointment could be on the phone or a video call.</p> <p>I selected a GP and a video call and was booked in to see Dr Patel 34&#xa0;minutes later. As I waited to speak to him, I learned from his biographical detail that he was practising in Leeds, that he\u2019d visited five of the seven continents and enjoyed cycling and skiing. At exactly 3.30pm, he materialised on my phone and welcomed me to Babylon. Our appointment was much like a regular exchange with a GP. There were some surreal moments: as I tried to show Dr Patel my neck, I was reminded of an Amy Schumer comedy sketch on the precariousness and indignity of sexting.</p> <p>But he was engaged and reassuring, calling back when the video feed dropped, and after a few prompts he determined we were probably looking at a sebaceous cyst. They are non-cancerous and can be left alone, as long as they don\u2019t change in size or shape. Soon after the consultation, in case I\u2019d forgotten anything, a video of it was available on my Babylon app and I was sent a short text from Dr Patel that summarised his findings and advice. If I had needed a prescription, it would have been sent within the hour to a local pharmacy. Two days later, my phone beeped with a message to check how I was feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8e8d45168196bb44f3bb3846d4be12068596f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e8d45168196bb44f3bb3846d4be12068596f3e/0_0_696_1294/538.jpg\" alt=\"GP on iPhone\" width=\"538\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a very thorough service, but there was a cost. Babylon offers its triage services, which advise on the urgency of treatment, free, but to speak to a doctor, it\u2019s a rolling monthly payment of \u00a34.99 or a one-off fee of \u00a325. In my case, it provided peace of mind 10 days quicker than if I\u2019d waited to see my GP. But the bigger question is what impact online doctors will have on the provision of healthcare in the UK: are they a valuable tool to reduce the demands on our overloaded doctors and nurses or are they, as one GP I spoke to said, opening \u201ca door to NHS destruction\u201d?</p> <p>The offices of Babylon in South Kensington have been designed to evoke the hanging gardens, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. A tough brief, you\u2019d imagine, and the original designers estimated a cost of \u00a31,000 per square foot. Ali Parsa, the founder of Babylon, bristled at such extravagance and decided to oversee the decorations himself. The result is a long, open-plan office with fake trees and hanging plants dotted around. All the accoutrements of the kidult, forward-thinking workplace are present: free toast and cereals, ping-pong tables that double as large desks for team meetings. An adult scooter leans against a desk, although it\u2019s not clear if this is personal transportation or to whizz along the banks of desks.</p> <p>Why the name Babylon? \u201cFirst, I was born in Iran,\u201d says Parsa, an energetic, fast-talking 51-year-old with a bald head and statement Cutler &amp; Gross spectacles, \u201cso Babylon was always part of our culture as one of the big Persian cities. And two, there is a story about Babylon that goes really well with healthcare. If you got sick in Babylon about two and a half thousand years ago, you\u2019d stand on the square that was designated as a square of the sick and every resident that passed by would tell you if they\u2019d ever come across that disease and, if they had, how they cured themselves. And with that very simple peer-to-peer health service, they had the longest life expectancy in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are going to put an affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth</p> <footer> <cite>Babylon's mission statement</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parsa laughs: \u201cBut the truth is that all of that is nonsense. We called it Babylon because we were too cheap to pay a design agency or a PR agency to go out and figure out some funky&#xa0;name.\u201d</p> <p>In the reception area, the mission statement of Babylon is written on a large mirror: \u201cOur purpose is to democratise healthcare. We are going to put an accessible and affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth.\u201d That\u2019s quite an ambitious goal, I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he nods. \u201cBut actually, if you dissect that, the most difficult part is that you put something in the hands of every human being on Earth. Well, somebody already has. Almost every human being on Earth now has a mobile device. What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony\" title=\"\">Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX</a>, creating a ship, sending it to space, that\u2019s difficult! Putting a doctor on your mobile phone, relatively speaking, is not difficult.\u201d</p> <p>A number of progressive tech entrepreneurs appear to agree with Parsa. <a href=\"https://www.pushdoctor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Push Doctor</a>, founded by Eren Ozagir, claims to be the largest service of its kind in Europe, with about 7,000 NHS doctors in its network. It came about, apparently, after Ozagir fell sick on a trip to the US and bemoaned the fact that you could organise a taxi, a boat, even a helicopter through your phone, but not a doctor. Push Doctor does not attempt to triage or diagnose patients, but instead puts them straight in touch with GPs doing consultations during the time they could otherwise be doing private practice. An appointment costs at least \u00a320 and a premium membership is the same price per month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/googles-deepmind-shouldnt-be-sucking-up-our-nhs-records-in-secret\">Google's DeepMind shouldn't suck up our NHS records in secret</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other players in this market include <a href=\"http://www.drnow.com/\" title=\"\">Now GP</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/GB/app/id1051208054?mt=8\" title=\"\">GPDQ</a> (GP delivered quick). GPDQ can arrange for a doctor to come in person to a home, office or hotel in central London between 8am and 11pm, 365 days a year. The average wait is about 90 minutes.</p> <p>The core message of all of these services is that they are not threatening the NHS, but working alongside it to reduce the burdens it faces coping with a growing and ageing population. Babylon, for example, has started a trial scheme with two GP surgeries in Essex where all patients can use the service free of charge. Early reports apparently found that the average waiting time for appointments came down by a week, to two weeks.</p> <p>The development also fits with the idea that millennials now expect all their services to be streamlined and efficient: from getting the new ramen joint to deliver via Uber to having your dry cleaning picked up from your desk. David Mott from Oxford Capital, which raised \u00a38.2m in funding for Push Doctor, even suggested the NHS should be left to the elderly and infirm, while time-poor 18-40-year-olds use the new app-based services.</p> <p>Where Babylon seems to be taking the lead \u2013 and, Parsa believes, reducing the crisis of the global shortfall of doctors \u2013 is with its use of artificial intelligence. When I tried its \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d feature for the lump on my neck, I was actually being quizzed by what they consider the world\u2019s first accurate AI triage service. In June, an in-house \u201clive challenge\u201d pitted Babylon\u2019s AI against a senior A&amp;E nurse and an Oxford-educated junior doctor. UCL professor Irwin Nazareth compared the results. According to Nazareth, \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d was consistently faster and more accurate in triaging patients than its human rivals: it scored 92% accuracy compared to the doctor\u2019s 82% and the nurse\u2019s 77%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c886d33987eb8aa75a356eb33165d77ab578769d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c886d33987eb8aa75a356eb33165d77ab578769d/136_146_2462_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Push Doctor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Push Doctor offers video consultation with NHS GPs, who can provide sick notes, referral letters and prescriptions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Agency One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This experiment was not the most rigorous of scientific evaluations, but it has shown enough promise for some heavyweight backers to get behind Babylon. In January 2016, the company raised \u00a319m to further develop its artificial-intelligence platform. Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founders of DeepMind, the AI startup bought by Google for $500m, who had already been advising Babylon, invested, as did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/18/theobserver.observerbusiness12\" title=\"\">Richard Reed, Adam Balon and Jon Wright</a>, the men behind Innocent Drinks. For Parsa, the next stage, probably as soon as next year, is that the Babylon app will be able to diagnose patients without a doctor ever needing to be involved.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d trust a machine over a human any day of the week \u2013 and I already do,\u201d says Parsa, whose background is in engineering, not medicine. He arrived in Britain as a refugee in his late teens and has been, among other things, an investment banker and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/09/circle-patients-hinchingbrooke-sick-dream-impossible\" title=\"\">Circle</a>, the private healthcare company that runs hospitals in Bath and Reading and in 2011 took over the struggling Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire. Parsa stood down as Circle\u2019s chief executive in 2012, before launching Babylon in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe machine doesn\u2019t get worked up, it doesn\u2019t get angry, it doesn\u2019t get pushed because there are 20 people outside in the queue,\u201d says Parsa. \u201cA machine learns every time a diagnosis happens. A doctor might do 7,000 consultations. The machine will do thousands of times more. Therefore the speed at which it learns and everything it sees increases. So we believe in time we will do this more accurately than a human.</p> <p>\u201cEven the specialists. How many papers were published last year on dermatology? It was 11,000; 11,000 pieces of research that were worthy of being written down for somebody to take note. Which dermatologist reads this? They say, \u2018Oh yeah, I spend my weekends catching up.\u2019 How many can they read? So the idea that a human brain can keep in touch \u2013 ha!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/05/google-deepmind-nhs-machine-learning-blindness\">Google DeepMind pairs with NHS to use machine learning to fight blindness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parsa does not think that artificial intelligence will replace humans \u2013 at least not in the foreseeable future. But the potential is clearly there. He cites the example of <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/\" title=\"\">DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program</a>, which inflicted a stunning 4-1 defeat on the 18-time Go world champion Lee Sedol earlier this year. The 3,000-year-old Chinese boardgame had been considered one of the \u201cgrand challenges\u201d of AI because of its almost infinite number of possible moves. DeepMind puts the success of AlphaGo down to the fact that the program almost mirrored a human brain: it used trial and error, allied to a dense historical database of games from the past, to play both creatively and minimise mistakes.</p> <p>\u201cThe one game AlphaGo lost was because the guy [Lee] did something that the machine had never imagined can be done,\u201d says Parsa. \u201cHe used his intuition to say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to do something very human here.\u2019 As opposed to something very machine. And the machine got confused. So the methodology we employ is very similar to the way a human brain works, whereby we teach a human how to become a doctor and the same way we teach a machine how to become a doctor. We don\u2019t just use ginormous amounts of data, we give them rules and functions.\u201d</p> <p>It takes around seven years to train a human to become a doctor \u2013 how long then for a machine? \u201cWell, we\u2019ve been at it for three years,\u201d says Parsa, \u201cso maybe it will take us seven years too.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone is excited about the boom in online doctors. While there has been a rush by GPs to supplement their incomes with shifts at places such as Babylon \u2013 it has about 100 doctors on call \u2013 others are concerned about the impact that paid-for services will have on the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d192878149bacd2cc3c7b5a3464b5122dac3049c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d192878149bacd2cc3c7b5a3464b5122dac3049c/0_0_616_1255/491.png\" alt=\"Now GP\" width=\"491\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Now GP offers video GP services and can courier prescription medicines to your home for a fee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NowGP handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGeneral practitioners are a resource in short supply and in great need,\u201d says Margaret McCartney, a GP in Glasgow, Radio 4 regular and author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/state-of-medicine.html\" title=\"\"><em>The State of Medicine: Keeping the Promise of the NHS</em></a>. \u201cWe as a profession are under huge strain and enormous pressure. These companies are essentially using market forces to determine access to GPs rather than need. GPs working in these companies will probably make more money and have a less stressful career. However, patients are far less likely to benefit. This might work in your favour if you are basically healthy, need a one-off appointment and have the money to pay to put yourself in the front of the queue. But if you have an ongoing condition, or multiple or complex needs, the research shows that your care will be better if you have continuity and are looked after by a team that can care for you holistically.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of \u201ca GP in your pocket\u201d emphasises speed and convenience, but McCartney fears that it may ultimately derail our health service. \u201cThese schemes may mean that you end up having to wait even longer to see your NHS&#xa0;GP, as the workforce becomes more depleted,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of these companies won\u2019t see people with chronic diseases or mental illness. This kind of cherry-picking is rife in the private sector and I see these companies as the thin end of the wedge of sleepwalking us into an insurance-based model of healthcare. It needs to be resisted by everyone who cares about the values of the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Parsa is aware that not everyone will approve of services such as Babylon. \u201cListen, there will be many comments from your readers that say, \u2018That is brilliant.\u2019 And there will be many that say, \u2018That is awful.\u2019 That\u2019s OK. Think of anything: Facebook \u2013 lots of people say it\u2019s brilliant and lots of people think it\u2019s awful. But the existing model of healthcare we\u2019ve got, guys, is nothing to write home about. One in five of us can\u2019t see a doctor when we need to. One of eight of us gets misdiagnosed. About a thousand of us a month get killed because of avoidable mistakes. So the system we are protecting so much is good but it\u2019s not great.\u201d</p> <p>There has been much discussion of the failure of Britain\u2019s technology sector to produce a Facebook, Uber or Airbnb. Parsa feels that Babylon has the potential to become a similar, game-changing enterprise. <em>Wired </em>magazine recently named the company as one of Europe\u2019s 100 hottest startups and the <em>FT</em> made a conservative valuation of it \u201cin excess\u201d of \u00a377m. Babylon is certainly thinking globally; although its main operation is in the UK, the service is also launching in Rwanda, a country of 11.75 million people that has only a few hundred doctors.</p> <p>Parsa insists that Rwanda is not a publicity stunt: it\u2019s a country where mobile phones are commonplace and it has a progressive, if often heavyhanded, government. Besides, if Babylon can work in sub-Saharan Africa, then it should thrive anywhere. \u201cIn Rwanda or in many countries in the world, people are dying from things that a doctor can fix in no time,\u201d he says. \u201cSo this is not populist. If you\u2019re not doing it, it\u2019s stupid. If you\u2019re waiting two weeks to see a doctor and you can press a button and see it on Babylon, it\u2019s not right.\u201d A shake of the head: \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Parsa is a convincing pitchman and my first experience with Babylon for my neck was a good one.

  "<p>\u2018Why are you going to the Labour conference?\u201d asked the Liverpool taxi driver.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got used to attending funerals this year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but not suicides, I bet!\u201d</p> <p>This somehow captured the mood of a conference where the enthusiasm of the \u201cCorbynistas\u201d contrasted with the unutterable gloom and dire forebodings of such traditional Labour party supporters and MPs as had bothered to turn up at all.</p> <p>Here we have a government that is crying out to be challenged on so many fronts, yet the main occupation of the Labour party has been to oppose itself.</p> <p>I confess that, in common with not a few other observers, I could not quite take the atmosphere of the conference and beat a hasty retreat on the Tuesday. Thus it came about that I found myself watching Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech on television back at home.</p> <p>It received an execrable reception in the media \u2013 as did shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s speech the day before \u2013 with cries amounting to \u201csame old story: tax rises, more public spending, masses of borrowing\u201d etc.</p> <p>Now, I fully understand the wrath of the anti-Corbynistas over the widely reported bullying tactics of Corbyn and McDonnell\u2019s \u201cbovver boys\u201d, and the antipathy towards a \u201cTrotskyite takeover\u201d of the party. When I said to one senior former cabinet minister \u201cit\u2019s just like the early 1980s\u201d, he replied: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s worse than that. At least then we were in control.\u201d</p> <p>But there were some good things in the speeches of both Corbyn and McDonnell: they are obviously leading with their chins to boast about \u201csocialism\u201d, even though this word that frightens the media was used in the past by Roy Hattersley, John Smith and even Tony Blair.</p> <p>Once upon a time socialism was closely associated with communism, and the British left had some embarrassing moments with this over the years. Way back in the 1950s, Tony Crosland wrote an influential book entitled <em>The Future of Socialism</em> and phrases such as \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d became widely used, and the \u201cmixed economy\u201d became all the rage.</p> <p>After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many people, including me, were concerned about the triumphalism that followed, as we saw an acceleration of the deregulation that had begun with Reagan and Thatcher, and the obeisance to rampant markets.</p> <p>Then came the global financial crash, the impact of which we are still experiencing \u2013 with the ultimate irony that the prospect of a massive fine on Deutsche Bank is even being talked about as a last straw that might precipitate the next financial crisis!</p> <p>Now, while I can understand the despair of the parliamentary Labour party, I wonder whether the rightwing press that excoriates Corbyn and McDonnell are aware of the wider debate that is going on.</p> <p>We now have the International Monetary Fund and, less surprisingly, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, bemoaning the abysmal state of the post-crisis economy and crying out for governments to intervene to boost economic demand. It is now widely accepted that monetary policy has reached its limits, and may, via the effect on savers, be having a perverse impact on attempts to boost demand.</p> <p>Too many corporations are sitting on cash piles and not investing. The concentration of so much of the increment in national income in the hands of the top 5% means they themselves have plenty to spend but the sum total is not enough to boost world demand and ward off mounting fears of another recession.</p> <p>Corbyn and McDonnell call for increased government borrowing, at negligible rates of interest, to boost infrastructure. So do the most orthodox central banking institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements, based in Basel. The reaction to their calls has been little short of hysterical in some places.</p> <p>They should not be excoriated for this. More to the point are the widespread concerns that for other reasons, not least their abysmal poll ratings, they are not electable.</p> <p>Anyway, they should be going for this government, which has lamely accepted the wish of 37% of the electorate to leave the EU (ie, although 52% of those who voted were for Out, only 37% of those eligible to vote were, God forgive them, Brexiters).</p> <p>Which brings us to the recent speech by George Osborne in Chicago. He said the British people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\" title=\"\">had not voted for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>. He was right. Only 37% voted for a hard Brexit. For what does leaving the EU mean other than a hard Brexit? And if you allow for all those under-18s who are keener on Europe than their grandparents, the proportion of population that wish to leave the EU must be closer to 25%.</p> <p>I bet that a fair proportion of the 37% did not appreciate the implications of what they were doing. The vultures are already descending, in the shape of foreign embassies in London approaching financial institutions and offering \u201chelpful\u201d advice about moving their operations elsewhere. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">Nissan is just one of many multinationals</a> considering the impact of Brexit on their future investment plans.</p> <p>How can a nation such as ours be so stupid? To coin a phrase, we need our country back. Our sovereign parliament must veto this absurd and self-destructive policy.</p>",
  "<p>Early inquiries into South Australia\u2019s blackout say it was not caused or exacerbated by the state\u2019s dependency on renewable energy, the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has said, calling for a \u201creal debate\u201d on the issue regardless.</p> <p>Extreme weather in South Australia has included widespread flooding and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/live/2016/sep/28/south-australia-storms-entire-state-left-without-power-after-wild-weather-live\">a severe storm</a> last week saw more than 20 power pylons destroyed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame\">electricity knocked out</a> for the entire state. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/02/south-australia-floods-more-rain-to-batter-state-as-residents-evacuated-in-nsw\">More rain and possible thunderstorms have been forecast.</a></p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the blackout a number of politicians and commentators sought to connect it with South Australia\u2019s 41% reliance on renewable energy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/the-lights-go-out-in-sa-and-turnbull-flicks-the-switch-to-peak-stupid\">despite a lack of any evidence to suggest a link</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Frydenberg said preliminary advice told him the high proportion of renewable energy levels was not the catalyst for the blackout.<br></p> <p>However, the minister said a full inquiry into exactly what happened was needed and it would be the subject of discussions at a Council of Australian Governments meeting, expected this week.</p> <p>Frydenberg said the states were pursuing \u201cridiculously high and unrealistic\u201d renewable energy targets and they \u201chave an illusion\u201d about the impact of renewables on the energy system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/02/south-australia-floods-more-rain-to-batter-state-as-residents-evacuated-in-nsw\">South Australia weather: Adelaide suburbs flooded as residents evacuated in NSW</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said a \u201creal debate\u201d was needed, in particular about the intermittent supply of wind and solar power and how it impacts the stability and price of electricity.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have a high use of renewables, some 41% in South Australia, it leads to a lack of consistency in the quantity of generation, namely that when the wind\u2019s not blowing, or the sun\u2019s not shining, electricity is not being generated, and that means there\u2019s a higher reliance on interconnectors,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/officials-admit-no-modelling-shows-how-australia-will-meet-paris-climate-pledge\">Government officials admitted to a Senate inquiry last week</a> there had been no modelling to determine if existing policies could achieve the emissions reduction targets Australia agreed to in Paris in 2015, of lowering emissions to between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/australias-emissions-wont-fall-by-2030-without-greater-climate-action-modelling-shows\">energy advisory firm RepuTex recently advised</a> Australia\u2019s emissions will likely remain at the same level through to 2030 based on current policies.</p> <p>State governments have said the state level targets are what\u2019s needed to reach the Paris goal.</p> <p>Frydenberg said the federal government was confident it would reach its target of 23.5% renewable energy by 2020, through policies already in place and those still in development. The current mix is 15%.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, of course, reducing our emissions is vitally important but, for the states, for the Greens, for the Labor party, they seem to put that ahead of energy security, and we don\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re unapologetic that keeping the lights on and energy security is our No 1 responsibility and our No 1 concern.\u201d</p> <p>He said the states seemed to have adopted their targets \u201cwithout understanding the impact for energy security\u201d.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s energy spokesman, Mark Butler, told Sky News there had to be recognition that Australia could not continue to operate power generation infrastructure, much of which had been built in the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>\u201cOver the next 10 or 15 years, even if there was not a climate change imperative or a renewable energy revolution sweeping the world, Australia would have to be having a discussion now about how we were going to renew our electricity generation infrastructure,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> <p>Frydenberg also criticised the South Australian senator Nick Xenophon for claims made on the night about the blackout and for going to the last election with a renewables target of 50%.</p>"
