  "<p>The federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, wielded some big numbers this week as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/green-abuse-warrants-australian-law-review-says-resources-minister\">pleaded with the Queensland media to help save the mining industry from an \u201cunprecedented\u201d threat</a>.</p> <p>The sunshine state, he said, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/activism\">under attack from \u201cenvironmental activists\u201d</a> who have brought court cases against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carmichael-coalmine\">Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine</a>. The big numbers came from a PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which found that \u201clegal delays\u201d had already cost Queensland $3.9bn in economic output and 2,665 \u201clost\u201d jobs and had cost Adani $200m. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/green-abuse-warrants-australian-law-review-says-resources-minister\">Green 'abuse' warrants Australian law review, says resources minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, the minister advised the assembled media \u201cis a story\u201d. </p> <p>Turns out, they were already onto it. Canavan cited what he called an \u201cexpose\u201d in the previous week\u2019s Sunday Mail entitled \u201cStop with Madness: Greens jeopardise Queensland\u2019s future\u201d. That story, in turn, favourably cited the minister railing against the greens and <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/opinion/editorial-eco-madness-strangling-queenslands-economy-must-stop/news-story/93525e9bb6af6642c674c37cf0551bbc\">an accompanying editorial</a> implored the federal government to \u201cstep in\u201d and \u201crid Queensland of these delays\u201d.</p> <p>Conveniently, that happens to be exactly what the minister wants to do. </p> <p>As a backbencher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/coalition-to-remove-green-groups-right-to-challenge-after-carmichael-setback\">he was one of the most vocal advocates of the Abbott government\u2019s so called \u201clawfare\u201d changes</a> \u2013 the amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to remove the right of most environmental organisations and other groups to challenge developments under federal laws unless they can show they are \u201cdirectly affected\u201d. This, the government argued, would stop the dastardly \u201cgreen saboteurs\u201d. The senate refused to pass the changes and the early indications after Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister was that they would be shelved.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/green-abuse-warrants-australian-law-review-says-resources-minister\">But Canavan is now the resources minister and is determined to revive them</a>, speaking to the new senate crossbench and insisting the government \u201cremains committed\u201d to the changes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/coalition-to-remove-green-groups-right-to-challenge-after-carmichael-setback\">Coalition to restrict green groups' right to challenge after Carmichael setback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be easy to forget, given these screaming headlines and dire economic predictions, that conservation groups have recently lost a number of cases against the Carmichael mine in the courts, which they are now appealing. Easier still to forget how few cases are actually taken, and how few succeed. </p> <p>In any case, the argument for watering down Australia\u2019s central environmental legal protections is now being framed in terms of the cost of delay while the legal challenges play out, rather than the cost of blocking projects altogether. Which brings us back to the PwC report and the very big numbers.</p> <p>A quick search revealed the report had actually been <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/state-economy-missing-39-billion-and-2665-jobs-because-delays-to-adani-megamine/news-story/d0a653456208de71308f64d008c0f486\">first exclusively reported in the Courier Mail in June, as well as in numerous mining publications.</a> But PwC told Guardian Australia it was unable to provide a copy because it remained the property of the client who commissioned it \u2013 Adani. </p> <p>And Adani\u2019s spokesman said that even though it had been cited in numerous articles and a minister\u2019s speech the chief executive had determined the report would \u201cnot be released\u201d.</p> <p>Luckily Guardian Australia was able to procure it elsewhere, and it made for interesting reading. </p> <p>Its overarching assumption is the Carmichael mine will proceed, at the scale originally envisaged, and as soon as the legal hurdles are cleared. Many analysts question whether the project is financially viable at all, and <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/adani-prepares-for-an-end-to-lawfare-with-a-smaller-cheaper-carmichael-20160921-grla4o\">even those who think it is say the plan is to proceed with a much smaller operation.</a></p> <p>And even accepting that the Adani mine is ready to go, the figures are being quite creatively interpreted.</p> <p>The report appears to say, for example, that the mine will employ exactly the same number of workers as was always assumed. But if it starts three years later than originally planned, some of those jobs will be created later than first envisaged. The report averages the number of jobs over the decade from the original start date, first assuming the mine did start then, and then assuming it started three years later. The \u201c2,665 lost jobs\u201d was the difference in those averages. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/greg-hunts-approval-of-adanis-queensland-mine-upheld-by-federal-court\">Greg Hunt's approval of Adani's Queensland mine upheld by federal court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And those calculations were based on the project\u2019s original size and the original widely-advertised claim that the mine would create 10,000 jobs. </p> <p>But evidence from an economist commissioned by Adani itself \u2013 Jerome Fahrer of ACIL Allen \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/27/adani-coalmine-would-not-deliver-jobs-and-royalties-promised-land-court-hears\">given in the land court </a>in one of the legal cases said: \u201cOver the life of the project it is projected that on average around 1,464 employee years of full-time equivalent direct and indirect jobs will be created.\u201d In other words, fewer jobs in total than those we are told have been \u201clost\u201d due to legal delays. Adani has said the higher estimate was based on a \u201cbroader assessment\u201d of the project\u2019s impact.</p> <p>The document also raises questions about whether \u201clegal delays\u201d have cost the company $200m. It says legal consulting costs were in fact $5.9m and internal staff costs to manage the cases were $1m. Another $21.8m is slated as the \u201cholding cost\u201d of maintaining a workforce. But the biggest cost by far was $123m, primarily for \u201credesigning previously approved components\u201d. The main redesign was due to conditions imposed by the federal government to force the company to dispose of dredge spoils on land, rather than in the water. But the former environment minister Greg Hunt boasted about this so presumably we shouldn\u2019t count it as part of the unbearable cost of lawfare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/linking-adani-coal-mine-to-social-uplift-in-india-ridiculous-says-conservationist\">Linking Adani coalmine to social uplift in India ridiculous, says conservationist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is true the company has faced additional costs because of the court cases.

  "<p>Nowadays there is one essential prerequisite for any Argentinian wishing to play top-level rugby, aside from skill and stamina. \u201cIf you\u2019re a nervous flyer you can\u2019t play for us,\u201d says the muscular flanker Pablo Matera on the eve of the first Rugby Championship game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/05/argentina-australia-twickenham-rugby-championship\" title=\"\">staged at Twickenham</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve never counted how many miles we\u2019ve flown but it\u2019s lots. I think we\u2019ve already taken more than 30 planes this year \u2013 and we still have five more matches to come.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/argentina-daniel-hourcade-residency-rule\">Argentina\u2019s Daniel Hourcade urges World Rugby to tighten residency rule</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Welcome to rugby\u2019s wandering blue-and-white minstrels, who even decamp to Europe for a scheduled home game. Matera, like many of his team-mates, plays Super Rugby for the Jaguares, who commute to South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. Last month the Pumas were in Hamilton and Perth, last week Buenos Aires and now London to face a similarly nomadic Australia side on Saturday. Next month Argentina will be playing Tests in Tokyo, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London, again.</p> <p>\u201cWe get to travel the world but we don\u2019t get to know the places because we are always training and playing,\u201d says Matera, a touch wistfully.</p> <p>It is the unavoidable long-haul price of joining the global elite. Not so long ago the Pumas led a competitive half-life, with their leading stars all based overseas and no Super Rugby avenue for their developing players. Now they have lurched the other way, having committed to a time zone-defying schedule that would disorientate the most experienced cabin steward. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult sometimes because the trips make you a little tired,\u201d concedes Matera, employing a nice line in understatement.</p> <p>The boys from the pampas could probably do with some pampering rather than contesting a dead rubber on a foreign field with several top men unavailable. There is a bigger picture, though, and to listen to the impressive 23-year-old, once of Leicester, and his sharp-eyed coach Daniel Hourcade, was to marvel again at the unquenchable spirit that makes the Pumas such passionately popular visitors wherever they play.</p> <p>True, they conceded four tries before half-time against New Zealand last week but the All Blacks, attempting to equal the world record for consecutive Test wins when playing in South Africa on Saturday, are a cut above all their opponents. There is also the political calculation that requires the Pumas, for now, to operate without their best European-based players, such as Racing 92\u2019s Juan Imhoff and Leicester\u2019s Marcos Ayerza. \u201cIt is a political decision but we support it,\u201d says Hourcade, preferring to dwell on the future benefits of exposing home-based players to the game\u2019s ultimate examinations.</p> <p>The end goal is clear enough: Argentina do not just want to be makeweights, propping up the Rugby Championship, winning the odd game here and there. \u201cThis is the first year we have set ourselves specific objectives,\u201d Matera says. \u201cWe wanted to win two games in the Rugby Championship, so this is our last chance to make that happen. We also wanted to win three of our four autumn games. In November we want to be in the top eight in the world rankings to have a better chance of a good group at the 2019 World Cup. That\u2019s our last objective: to play in the World Cup final. We\u2019re setting ourself little objectives now to help us achieve that.\u201d</p> <p>With emerging young figureheads like the bullocking Matera and the wildly promising No8 Facundo Isa (rested this weekend), there is clear hope of growth from a group who earned global admiration for their freewheeling rugby en route to last year\u2019s World Cup semi-final, where they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/25/argentina-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">lost 29-15 to the Wallabies</a>. The great Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez is injured but could be back to face England next month; in time Argentina may follow Australia\u2019s example and give selectorial exemptions to Pumas with a high number of caps plying their trade in Europe. \u201cI think Argentina is going to do that in the future but I don\u2019t know,\u201d Matera says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have lost some players because they have stayed in Europe. Now we have the chance to play in a really good tournament at home but playing in Europe is still a real interest for players.\u201d</p> <p>He is honest enough to concede that choosing between the Pumas and a juicy European club contract remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d for all. \u201cI have chosen to play for Argentina and in Super Rugby because playing internationally is the best level a player can play at. But we\u2019re always watching what\u2019s happening in Europe and thinking it could be good as well.\u201d</p> <p>The flip side is the chance to elevate rugby in South America to a new level, building on the promising foundations of last year\u2019s World Cup, when football was briefly shoved out of the limelight. \u201cRugby in Argentina is getting really popular,\u201d Matera says. \u201cThere are lots more young kids starting to play rugby and looking for a club and I think that is because of the World Cup. When I first started playing it was after the 2007 World Cup when we were third in the world. Now we have more games at home because of Super Rugby, with big teams coming to play in Argentina. It\u2019s making more people interested in rugby.\u201d</p> <p>With a healthy crowd of around 50,000 expected at Twickenham, the Pumas\u2019 profile is also rising abroad. This week came confirmation Argentina are looking to bid to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup; what a gloriously colourful and unmissable event that would be. They would also love, at some stage, to welcome the British &amp; Irish Lions to Buenos Aires, Tucuman, Rosario, Salta and beyond. Matera, for one, reckons the prospect would attract travelling fans as well as players: \u201cI think the Lions would have more chance to win against us than against New Zealand.\u201d</p> <p>With the inspirational and smooth-taking Gus Pichot now in situ as World Rugby\u2019s vice-chairman, they are also lobbying for tighter eligibility rules that would make it harder for many of Argentina\u2019s rivals to strengthen their squads by recruiting players from overseas.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand that some countries with one million players have to go after players from other countries,\u201d Hourcade muttered. \u201cNew Zealand represent four countries.\u201d His battered, jet-lagged squad may be weary but, longer-term, they are a steadily growing force.</p>",

Right now, the government could have been devoting itself to a diplomatic offensive aimed at persuading the EU\u2019s 27 other members to grant us a Norway-plus arrangement, allowing us to enjoy the benefits of single market membership with a degree of flexibility on how free movement is implemented. (Bear in mind that not all the four core freedoms are applied absolutely: there are exceptions to the free movement of services, for example. Recall too that what Europe originally enshrined in treaty was free movement of labour, not people: that too could allow for some British leeway.) Yes, it would have been a big ask. But with the moral mandate of the referendum behind her, Theresa May would have been hard for the EU 27 to refuse outright.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/07/francois-hollande-uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56cdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2784418\"            data-video-name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: UK must pay price for Brexit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f78d10e4b0e4aaeaa8ce42\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/07/161007HollandeBrexit_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733801&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733801&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/07/francois-hollande-uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-video\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: UK must pay price for Brexit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Instead, the government keeps slamming its fist on the table and insisting on the worst possible deal for Britain. No to the single market, says May. Liam Fox wants to go further, exiting the European customs union as well. Economists warn that if we do that, it won\u2019t just be jobs, investment and people that will steer clear of Britain the day after we leave: basic food imports won\u2019t be allowed in either. We currently lack the basic trade agreements we\u2019d need on day one outside the EU. They will not fall into our lap automatically, and will take a lot longer than two years to negotiate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we are methodically trashing our brand, the very international reputation that has made us an attractive place to invest, visit or live. Most countries long to bring in the best and the brightest. We seem determined to turn them away. This week the government signalled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/jeremy-hunt-accused-devaluing-contribution-foreign-doctors-to-uk\">foreign-born doctors and students</a> that they are no longer wanted here, as well as warning diverse, global companies they will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">named and shamed</a> for the crime of drawing on a wide, international pool of talent. On Friday the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/lse-brexit-non-uk-experts-foreign-academics\">London School of Economics claimed</a> the government had told its non-British experts on Europe that their wisdom was not wanted. The Foreign Office rejected that claim. But a desire to purge ourselves of foreigners does seem to be turning into a fever: hot, irrational and ugly.</p> <p>And all this while telling EU residents who have made their homes in Britain that they are to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/liam-fox-refuses-to-guarantee-right-of-eu-citizens-to-remain-in-uk\">one of our main cards</a>\u201d in future negotiations with the EU \u2013 as if, should Britain not get what it wants, it <a href=\"http://reaction.life/may-government-making-big-mistake-eu-immigration/\">might actually deport</a> up to 3 million people who came here legally and in good faith. It\u2019s one thing to listen respectfully to those millions of leave voters who want a say over how future migration works. It is quite another to demonise, and terrify, those who are already here.</p> <p>To do all this, May has had to rewrite the history of 23 June. No longer the winner in a fairly narrow vote of 52% to 48%, leave was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37563510\">recast in the PM\u2019s conference speech</a> as a mass consensus, the unambiguous stance of the great British public. All that had ever stood in their way was a liberal, monied elite, the Davos set of footloose globetrotters devoid of national allegiance, citizens of the world and therefore citizens of nowhere. Before our very eyes the 48% are being rebranded as the 1%.</p> <p>What\u2019s so odd about this is that it is former remainers who are doing it. Recall that May stood \u2013 not very visibly, it\u2019s true \u2013 alongside those who wanted to stay in the EU. Amber Rudd, she of the foreigners\u2019 lists, confronted Boris Johnson in a TV debate. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary now eager to denude the NHS of the world\u2019s best medical talent, was a remainer too.

They \u2013 we \u2013 are not looking for a champion who will pretend that the referendum never happened, but one who will fight for a Brexit that does not deprive us of all we cherished in our relationship with Europe. It means arguing for a sane, practical deal that serves, rather than harms, our national interest \u2013 and that could then be put to the British people in an election or even, if that\u2019s what it takes, another referendum. It means challenging, for instance, Fox\u2019s ludicrous, dogmatic search for commerce with every far-flung corner of the planet except the 500 million-strong market on our doorstep with whom we currently do nearly half our trade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/oct/04/the-pound-is-worth-less-but-what-does-it-mean-for-brits\">The pound is worth less \u2013 but what does it mean for Brits?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key arena for this battle will be parliament.

The Lib Dems are too few, though <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/clegg_free_trade_deal_with_the_eu_isn_t_possible_in_two_years\">on this</a> Nick Clegg is a serious asset. Tory remainers still outnumber leavers in the Commons, but they\u2019ve gone quiet, with a few laudable exceptions. They need to rediscover their voice \u2013 not least because, as our politics currently stands, it is the challenge from within that threatens May most.</p> <p>Those MPs, of all parties, have a solemn responsibility. But it cannot fall on them alone. We the 48% have to speak for ourselves \u2013 and halt this march into madness.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 October 2016.

He said the meeting had become heated and he had asked Hookem to continue to deal with the matter outside the room which the Ukip MEP read \u201ctotally the wrong way\u201d. He said Hookem then hit him and he bashed himself on the door frame. <br></p> <p>He told the Daily Mail: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mike was obviously very angry and lost his temper. </p> <p>I wasn\u2019t bruising for a scrap. I asked to deal with the matter outside of the room because it was flaring up in the meeting and upsetting everybody, and Mike clearly read that totally the wrong way.

  "<p>About 100 current and former BBC presenters, and stars from other broadcasters, are being investigated by HMRC over claims of tax avoidance.</p> <p>The inquiries centre on allegations that the presenters falsely declared themselves self-employed to minimise their tax and national insurance bills.</p> <p>The revelation emerged in a BBC submission to a tax tribunal considering the case of the BBC presenters Joanna Gosling and Tim Willcox. They are appealing against an HMRC ruling that they did not pay enough tax while claiming not to be employed directly by the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cHMRC have indicated to the BBC that there are around 100 additional cases under consideration involving current or former BBC presenters,\u201d the broadcaster said.</p> <p>According to court documents, the BBC said it understood HMRC also intended to look into the affairs of \u201cpresenters who are engaged by other broadcasting organisations\u201d.</p> <p>It said: \u201cThe appeals are therefore extremely important not only to the individuals in question, but also to the BBC and to the broadcasting industry as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>The investigators are looking into whether \u201cIR35\u201d rules, which govern the tax paid by those who work for clients through an intermediary, have been followed.</p> <p>\u201cThe appeals are likely to be the first cases to test the freelance model in the broadcasting industry against the IR35 legislation,\u201d said Jennifer Henderson, the BBC\u2019s head of global mobility and employment tax, in the broadcaster\u2019s submission.</p> <p>The hearing before the first tier tax tribunal at the Royal Courts of Justice took place in July and was <a href=\"http://www.contractorcalculator.co.uk/100_bbc_presenters_face_huge_tax_bills_ir35_530210_news.aspx\">first reported on the website Contractor Calculator</a><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/07/more-than-100-bbc-stars-facing-tax-avoidance-probes-hmrc-reveals/\"> </a>on Friday.</p> <p>The BBC stressed that the case would touch upon the whole broadcasting industry, saying that the practice of paying presenters through personal service companies was standard.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs the judgment says, this is an industry-wide issue and affects those who have been engaged in this way for a number of different organisations,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <p>In 2012, a report from Deloitte found that the BBC had offered presenters the option of signing staff contracts or using personal service companies, but had not advocated one over the other.</p> <p>The BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/26/bbc-stars-presenters-face-bills-thousands-unpaid-taz\">changed its policy that year</a> after it was criticised for letting presenters be paid through service companies.</p> <p>\u201cIt is up to individuals to ensure they pay the right tax and, since 2013, the BBC has adopted a new employment status test that provides a clear and consistent approach to the employment status of journalists and presenters,\u201d the BBC\u2019s spokesperson said. Joanna Gosling and Tim Wilcox declined to comment.<br></p> <p>An HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cEmployment status is never a matter of personal choice and is always dictated by the specific facts. When the employment relationship does not accurately reflect the underlying reality of the relationship, the wrong tax is paid then we intervene to ensure the rules apply as parliament intended.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile there can be many legitimate business reasons for workers being employed through their own companies, there are rules in place enabling HMRC to make sure people who provide their services in this way pay the right tax and national insurance.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Cinema workers have brought extra drama to the London film festival with protests on the red carpet and the closure of one venue in a battle for better pay.</p> <p>The Ritzy in Brixton, south London, which was due to host two festival screenings on Friday, was closed as workers went on strike. Protests were also planned outside the premieres of La La Land, a new musical featuring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, at the Odeon in Leicester Square, and The Levelling, a film about the Somerset floods, at Picturehouse Central in Piccadilly.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a real problem with low pay in the film industry and we are going to take that to events where film directors and industry people are so they know those working to show their films are on poverty wages,\u201d said Kelly Rogers, a bartender at the Ritzy and a representative for Bectu, which organised the strike.</p> <p>The union called on the British Film Institute (BFI), organisers of the London film festival, to sever links with the Ritzy\u2019s owner, Cineworld, until it meets their demands.</p> <p>Workers at the Hackney Picturehouse in east London, which is also a festival venue, have voted to join the strike protest next weekend while staff at Picturehouse\u2019s Central cinema, on Shaftesbury Avenue, and other venues in Clapham, south London, and Crouch End, north London, have also started to get involved with Bectu.</p> <p>Workers at the Ritzy say Picturehouse reneged on a promise to work towards payment of the independently calculated London living wage of \u00a39.40 an hour.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rogers said cinema staff, most of whom are on zero-hours contracts, were paid \u00a39.10 an hour which was not enough to live on in the capital. At the Ritzy, workers get regular shifts although these are not guaranteed by their contracts.</p> <p>Staff who have worked less than a year do not get company sick pay. Longer term employees only get sick pay if they have been off work for eight days. Rogers said workers wanted sick pay for all workers from the first day they were off ill.</p> <p>Rogers said: \u201cWe have chosen to demand the London living wage because that\u2019s what we need to live in London. \u00a39.10 isn\u2019t enough and many struggle to make their rent.

We are therefore disappointed by the decision of a minority of staff at the Ritzy who voted for strike action on Friday 7 October.</p> <p>\u201cOur staff are hugely important to us, we pay fair wages and have a wide range of benefits within a good working environment.

The umpires review it but he was always in, and has a well-earned gusty century to his name. A two and a single follow, and Bangladesh are buoyant now. Shakib senses it too, and ends the over by somehow beating three diving fielders with a mow towards wide long-on for four.

No, obviously. He feels as significant a player in his national side\u2019s evolution as someone like Adam Gilchrist was for Australia. You almost assume now, when he bounds to the crease 30 or 40 overs into an innings, that he\u2019ll effortlessly take the game away from the opposition. Has he done so again here? The hunch is yes, given pre-match perceived wisdom that 270/280 is a par score at Mirpur.</p> <p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t a one-man effort. Ben Stokes hit new heights and Ben Duckett played with remarkable composure and intelligence on debut. Tellingly, Duckett sounded almost downbeat on TV just now in his post-innings interview, talking about various of his shots \u201cnot coming off\u201d or finding fielders. What a remarkable year he\u2019s having, despite the evident hindrance of playing for the sort of county side the ECB would like to wipe from the face of the Earth.</p> <p>Still, as Rob said, this is still a good and challenging test for England \u2013 perhaps the most truly unfamiliar conditions in which Rebranded ODI England have played in the past 18 months. Whether that means Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid will prosper from it or get taken to the cleaners by batsmen who\u2019ve seen their sort coming, we shall see. There was enough in there for seamers too, judging by the decent-ish performances of Bangaldesh\u2019s quicker bowlers, and that still might be where England make it count. Though Bangladesh are experienced (<strong>fun fact:</strong> their XI\u2019s combined number of ODIs played (929) is nearly three times England\u2019s (322), and formidable at home, they need to be more focused with the bat here than they were the field to win this.

We know all about England\u2019s Plain Jane Super Brain-style transformation in this format, but Bangladesh\u2019s has been equally impressive. They put Ye Olde England out of the last World Cup, and they have an exceptional recent record at home: 17 wins in the last 20 matches and six series victories in a row, including defeats of India, South Africa and Pakistan.</p> <p>Although Bangladesh have beaten England in the last two World Cups, they have never won a series against them. They have a great chance to do so in what should be spin-friendly conditions. The pitches will bear precisely no resemblance to those England will find in next year\u2019s Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup (both, in case you didn\u2019t know, are in England, and yes you have permission to be excited about the prospect of England maybe, finally, actually winning a global 50-over competition), but a lot of white-ball experience is universal \u2013 managing a run-chase, bowling yorkers, catching the cricket ball rather than dropping it pitifully at your feet. </p> <p>Those experiences will begin at <strong>0930 BST</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:49:44.551Z\">at 8.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f74ccae4b03258bcac5352\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:22:17.737Z\">8.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rob will be here shortly.</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, check out Will Macpherson\u2019s preview from Dhaka \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Underestimate Bangladesh at your peril. That has been the message all week from England, and one reiterated by the captain Jos Buttler on the eve of the opening one-day international in Mirpur on Friday. Thereafter they come thick and fast: another here on Sunday, and a third in Chittagong on Wednesday. A week\u2019s rest and refamiliarisation follows, before back-to-back Tests.<br></p> <p>According to Buttler, Bangladesh are favourites for the ODI series, and there are plenty of reasons to back up that belief. There are the infamous defeats at the past two World Cups, although so stark has England\u2019s resurgence been in the format in the last 18 months that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/09/england-crash-out-cricket-world-cup-bangladesh\">Buttler, Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes are the only three who played in Adelaide</a>. The only members of the party from the 2011 loss in Chittagong in 2011 on this tour are Andrew Strauss, the director of cricket, and Paul Collingwood, one of the coaches.</p> <p>The most pressing reason for concern is that Bangladesh have not lost an ODI series at home since August 2014. That is six of them, all won, taking in the three peaks of Pakistan, who were whitewashed, India and then South Africa between April and July 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/england-odi-series-bangladesh-captain-jos-buttler-duckett-mirpur\">Read it in full here.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/06/bangladeshi-security-tight-ahead-of-first-odi-against-england-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/568qm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2781859\"            data-video-name=\"Bangladeshi security tight before first ODI against England \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f625cfe4b0e2a2a25af82e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/06/061016cricket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/06/061016cricket.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11939093&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/06/bangladeshi-security-tight-ahead-of-first-odi-against-england-video\">Bangladeshi security tight before first ODI against England</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T07:50:36.277Z\">at 8.50am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The recent announcement of 1,500 extra medical school places is welcome. But, as over a quarter of current NHS doctors are from overseas, the extra places will not in themselves produce a self-sufficient UK medical workforce, and we will still need our overseas doctors.</p> <p>The announcement has led to our colleagues from overseas feeling that they may not be as valued as UK doctors and is affecting morale. We cannot let this happen.</p> <p>Currently a quarter of NHS doctors are from overseas, and the NHS has benefited from their talents, their abilities and their will to work with us in the UK. We must continue to support them, despite the insecurity caused by the Brexit situation, and reassure them that they are valued and needed.</p> <p>Diseases know no borders, and medicine has therefore developed as an international profession, with global cooperation in research, drug development, standards of patient care, and free movement of doctors around the world. This model has served the UK and the NHS well for decades. Moving away from it is a major risk to the success of the NHS.<br><strong>Professor Jane Dacre</strong><br><em>President, Royal College of Physicians</em><br><strong>Clare Marx</strong><br><em>President, Royal College of Surgeons</em></p> <p>\u2022 While the government\u2019s proposed ban on UK-trained doctors working overseas may sound appealing, it is a tacit admission of failure.</p> <p>As part of my training I benefited greatly from working in a rural African setting. Quite apart from what I hope I contributed, I returned to the UK with new skills, greater knowledge and full of&#xa0;enthusiasm for my chosen profession.</p> <p>Ever since, I have encouraged my junior colleagues to embrace any opportunity to work in a developing country. Many choose to do so after two years of working \u2013 the logical time in the highly structured and inflexible (government-imposed) training structure.</p> <p>I suspect the health secretary imagines doctors are rushing to work in Australia and New Zealand \u2013 and of course some do. But a thoughtless blanket four-year ban will have consequences for many developing countries that benefit from UK doctors. The proposed ban is necessary only because the failure to support the NHS has led to it becoming such a stressful place in which to work. People do not choose to go and live thousands of miles from their family and friends if they are enjoying their work.</p> <p>Rather than yet another negative restriction on junior doctors\u2019 working lives, can I suggest the health secretary reflect on a more carrot-oriented approach: that of making the NHS such a&#xa0;fulfilling and exciting place to work that&#xa0;anyone who chooses to spend some time overseas spends that year moaning about how great it is back in the UK and returns promptly.<br><strong>Dr Ed Moran</strong><br><em>Consultant in infectious disease, Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy Hunt has proposed that young doctors should be prevented from working overseas for a period of four years after qualifying in order to alleviate the staffing crisis in the NHS, or else face a fine by paying back some of their training costs. Perhaps I could propose that former cabinet ministers be prevented from taking up lucrative directorships or consultancies with private companies for four years after leaving office. After all, much of their expertise and their contacts would have been accrued at taxpayers\u2019 expense while they were in post.<br><strong>Dr John Nottingham</strong><br><em>Ravensthorpe, Northamptonshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy Hunt should also commit himself and his government to ending our reliance on bricklayers, plumbers, joiners and workers in many other trades and industries. How could they do this? By making employers offer decent pay and conditions. That would make such employment attractive to Britons who, justifiably, expect to be treated decently and are not as desperate as others.<br><strong>David Hibbert</strong><br><em>Chadderton, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Theresa May\u2019s statement \u201cOur NHS\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\" title=\"\">Key points</a>, 6 October) needs to be backed up by immediate real-term funding.

I am worried that we'll become an isolated island and the world will move forward while we struggle to keep up in terms of diplomacy, science, economic and culture. What good is it to speak of global trade when shutting the doors at the same time. Why cut ties with the largest market in the world where we export 50%, half of our trade to and to pay for visas to travel only 20 odd miles across the channel. That doesn't make sense. Our NHS will crash and companies and farms relying on migrant workers because we don't want to do those kind of jobs any more will suffer. The pound is tumbling.

First, the contrast with Labour\u2019s conference the preceding week. The Tories judge that their main opponents are out of commission \u2013 desperately divided and culturally remote from the voters who swing marginal seats. Second, Theresa May has embraced Brexit with sufficient gusto, despite her quiet endorsement of the remain campaign, that Conservative pro-Europeanism has been almost entirely marginalised. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The political landscape as viewed from Downing Street is now a subset of Tory internal politics.

Mindful of that problem, May used her main conference speech to appropriate the referendum result for her own project. It was a shrewd rhetorical strategy. She set out the causes of support for the Leave campaign in broad cultural terms \u2013 a sense of dislocation, resentment of liberal elites, economic insecurity \u2013 so that she might then present herself and her government as the solution. It was, in essence, a mandate-grab to obviate the charge that she is somehow obliged to simply continue on the basis of David Cameron\u2019s manifesto. <br></p> <p>Whether it works will depend on how smoothly she can navigate Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. It is likely to dominate everything, cause great economic turbulence and crowd out almost every other government ambition.

She didn't rose tint things, but she talked about how her interactions with people with Down Syndrome had positively impacted on her, and how it's now the best time ever to be a person with Down Syndrome. I'll never forget her opening words: &quot;Nothing I'm about to say will change the fact that this is a beautiful baby girl&quot;. If only she could have told us how amazing our daughter would be. Not only is she a spunky and determined wee lady, but cognitive testing shows she has no intellectual disability. She is in the 50th percentile for all children. I'm absolutely for a women's right to choose, but I honestly don't know what we would have done if we'd known before her birth. I do know that from time to time when she does something so typical of a child her age, I get an overwhelming wave of guilt that we might have prevented her from being because of our own fears and sense of being unable to cope.

We will be involved in peaceful protest, we have to make our voices heard.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>She said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">had overturned the local county council\u2019s rejection</a> of fracking at the site. \u201cThey\u2019ve been given the keys to Lancashire,\u201d she said.<br></p> \n<p>While Stephenson said her group was now scouring Javid\u2019s 600-odd page decision letter for further opportunities for legal challenges, in private, fracking opponents admit they have now largely run out of legal options over the Preston New Road site.</p> \n<p>The Roseacre Wood site, which Javid said he was minded to approve but deferred a decision on to give Cuadrilla more time to see if it could mitigate traffic impacts, is a different matter. </p> \n<p>Barbara Richardson, who lives around 550 metres from the site, moved to the area when she retired to enjoy walks and wildlife but said she had experienced two and a half years of \u201ctorment\u201d fighting the fracking bid. A lifetime Tory voter, she said she would never vote for the party again.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are six miles from the main road, and a further five from the nearest motorway junction. It\u2019s country lanes, single track in part. We have 9,000 cyclists use these lanes a year, there are livery yards. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the desolate north, it\u2019s very much an affluent farming and tourism area. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate anywhere, but particularly here.\u201d She said local residents were now gathering further evidence on the potential traffic problems as part of the inquiry the Department for Communities and Local Government was now opening following Thursday\u2019s decision.</p> \n<p>Sarah Walmesley, who lives in Blackpool North Shore said she felt betrayed by the government overriding local concerns and would be attending protests and rallies to stop Cuadrilla.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cWe have been let down in Lancashire by the very people who claimed not 24 hours earlier that this was a government that would listen to the people,\u201d she said, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">Theresa May\u2019s Conservative conference speech</a>.<br></p> \n<p>Jennifer Mein, Leader of Lancashire county council, said that the government\u2019s actions appeared to go against the grain of the localism agenda it had promoted in recent years.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cResidents and businesses in Lancashire mobilised themselves on this issue; their councillors listened carefully to what they and the applicant had to say,\u201d she wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/tory-localism-fracking-lancashire-sajid-javid-drilling\">an article for the Guardian</a>.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cThe subsequent overturning of three of those councillors\u2019 decisions not only underlines the theory that localism only applies when it suits the centre, it highlights the chasm that exists between people seeking answers and reassurance and a government that is either unwilling or unable to provide them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cuadrilla has said it hopes to begin drilling in the sites during the second quarter of 2017, and looks forward to demonstrating that fracking can be done safely in the UK.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>The theme of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-conference-2016\">Tory party conference</a> was \u201cBrexit is going to be amazing\u201d. Speaker after speaker got up to tell enthusiastic audiences they would be \u201cwanting it, loving it and getting it\u201d. Although the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has little to do for the next two and a half years until the exact details of Britain\u2019s new relationship with the EU are finalised, his department has been wasting no time in drumming up business for Britain PLC. Over the course of the last week, its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tradegovuk\">Twitter feed</a> has been bigging up business opportunities. \u201cA Norwegian importer &amp; distributor is looking for British suppliers of organic crisps\u201d; \u201cin Spain, a well-established importer is looking for cool new giftware gadgets\u201d; \u201cfrom scampi to scallops \u2013 Spanish importer is looking for a variety of frozen seafood\u201d; \u201ca Japanese importer is looking for UK seaweed powder\u201d; \u201cFrance needs high-quality, innovative British jams &amp; marmalades\u201d. All with the hashtag <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ExportingisGREAT\">#ExportingisGREAT</a>. Who could doubt Britain\u2019s future is in good hands?</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the most sacrosanct areas of the Tory party conference is the Blue Room, a hermetically sealed safe space where donors can hand over large cheques to grovelling cabinet ministers away from prying eyes. The room is protected by G4S security guards to make sure the riff-raff are kept out. Well, not quite all. Just by chance I found myself standing near the door when a number of people were being ushered inside and I managed to slip in unnoticed. It\u2019s hard to describe the disappointment. I was expecting lavish divans and a large array of corporate freebies. What I got was a narrow corridor adorned with a lot of advertising for Fujitsu, a mangy buffet offering bread and biscuits, and a long row of bored businessmen waiting to be blessed by personal appearances from Ruth Davidson, David Davis, Sajid Javid, Phillip Hammond and Damian Green. That\u2019s the kind of company most people would pay money to avoid. After five minutes I was eventually rumbled and escorted off the premises. My main feeling was of relief.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Only a year ago, Eurosceptic politicians such as David Davis, Liam Fox, Bernard Jenkin and Peter Bone were regarded as the awkward squad and would only be found at the dingiest of fringe meetings at party conference. Now they have become the mainstream, acceptable face of Conservative politics, and it is the pro-EU MPs who have been consigned to the outer edges. The waters have now so completely closed over since the referendum in June that almost every MP who backed the remain argument \u2013 including Theresa May \u2013 has now managed to convince themselves they actually supported Vote Leave. Only two MPs, Anna Soubry and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/hard-brexit-new-bigotry-warns-nicky-morgan\">Nicky Morgan</a>, were prepared to stick their necks out and hold on to their core beliefs by challenging the government over its Brexit plans. At one fringe event, Morgan picked out two government whips who had been sent to keep an eye on her to make sure she didn\u2019t stray too far off message. Dissent is not welcome in the new world order.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>My favourite story of the week: scientists have discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/cod-may-have-regional-accents-scientists-say\">cod may have their own regional dialects</a>, which helps to explain why fish stocks are low. Either a female Cornish cod can\u2019t understand the chat-up lines of a Liverpool cod, or she finds their accent unattractive. I\u2019ve often wondered if the same applies to other animals. My dog was born in Essex \u2013 near Barking, as it happens \u2013 but moved to Streatham when he was about two months old. For the last five years, almost all of his social canine interactions have taken place round this area of London, so it would make perfect sense if he were to have a south London bark. And what assumptions do other dogs make about him because of his accent? A friend of mine, who talks perfect Radio 4 in English, taught himself to speak Spanish when he moved to the Sierra de Aracena. Whenever he goes to Madrid, the Spaniards treat him like an idiot because he talks like an Andalusian peasant.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Oh no he isn\u2019t. Oh yes he is. Nigel Farage is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/nigel-farage-says-he-may-technically-still-be-ukip-leader\">back in charge of Ukip</a> for at least the third, if not the fourth time, following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/ukip-leader-diane-james-resigns-after-just-18-days-in-job-reports\">surprise resignation</a> of Diane \u201cI only signed the forms under duress\u201d James after less than a month in charge. Nigel has insisted he will only be an interim leader, but he\u2019s made similar noises before, and the other candidates seem to be falling over themselves to disqualify themselves before the next election campaign has even started. Steven Woolfe, the only candidate yet to nominate himself, ended up in hospital following a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/ukip-leadership-favourite-steven-woolfe-collapses-in-european-parliament\">fight</a> with fellow Ukip MEP, Mike Hookem, in the European parliament. Hookem was thought to have gone on the run following the incident but has since spoken to the BBC, claiming it was all just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/steven-woolfe-collapse-ukips-mike-hookem-calls-clash-handbags-at-dawn\">handbags at dawn</a> and that he never laid a finger on him. Meanwhile a former Ukip and now Conservative MEP, David Campbell Bannerman, said Ukip had always been a maverick party with strong views, and some members were liable to get violent and aggressive. It takes a lot to make Nigel look like a statesman. But Ukip somehow manage it.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: Brexit means breakfast.</strong><br></p>",

It seems that sterling is recreating last night\u2019s flash crash in slow motion, its losses against the dollar widening to 2.6%, taking it under $1.23 in the process; against the euro things were just as bad, the pound plunging under \u20ac1.13 following a 2.4% fall. </p> \n   <p> Beyond the post-flash crash fear that seems to have taken hold of investors, the intensification of sterling\u2019s decline can largely be pinned on two factors this morning. </p> \n   <p> Firstly, both the manufacturing and industrial production readings came in below expectations at 0.2% and -0.4% respectively, somewhat contradicting the positive PMIs from earlier in the week. Secondly, and perhaps most damningly, HSBC issued a pretty bleak statement claiming that, as the \u2018defacto official opposition to the government\u2019s [Brexit] policies\u2019, the pound could well find itself circling $1.10 by the end of next year.</p> \n   <p> As has been the trend this week the pound\u2019s plight has proven to be catnip for the FTSE, with the UK index climbing 58 points to tickle 7070.

They explain:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The problem with finding the actual low is that currencies are traded on dozens of different platforms, and the levels each shows reflect the trades that are conducted on that system. In normal market conditions, this makes little if any difference. The move overnight was\u2026 not normal.<br></p> \n   <p>EBS, the trading platform owned and operated by ICAP and one of the central points of reference, particularly for sterling, says it is taking $1.1938 as the low \u2013 a level that was traded \u201cin low amount\u201d.</p> \n   <p>Bloomberg\u2019s reported low is $1.1841.</p> \n   <p>Thomson Reuters, however, is our outlier. Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT \u2013 or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began.</p> \n   <p>That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a \u201cmarket low\u201d where a \u201cgood amount\u201d \u2013 ie, \u00a35m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window. This low was $1.15 and happened \u201caround the same time as the absolute low.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Good luck to the traders trying to work this one out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-57f7746de4b03258bcac53ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:30:15.839Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Juncker: EU must be firm with UK on Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1c45a2f103356033974fa0ba7094d3e04153e85c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c45a2f103356033974fa0ba7094d3e04153e85c/0_123_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Claude Juncker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>The message is coming in loud and clear from the EU now: we will be tough with the UK on Brexit.</strong></p> \n  <p>The latest comments come from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.</p> \n  <p>Speaking in Paris on Friday, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> It should be obvious that if the United Kingdom wants to have free access to the [EU\u2019s] internal market all the rules and all the liberties...need to be fully respected.<br></p> \n   <p>You can\u2019t have one foot in and one foot out.

  "<p>Junk food and sugary drinks are taking an enormous toll on children around the world, with soaring numbers who are obese and millions developing conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure previously seen only in adults, data has revealed.</p> <p>Children were facing crippling illnesses and shortened lives because of the spread of the heavily marketed fast-food culture, experts said, and health services around the world would struggle to cope.

Among the more populous countries facing the worst scenarios were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/egypt-obesity-battle-calories-overweight\">Egypt</a> \u2013 where more than a third (35.5%) of children aged five to 17 were overweight or obese in 2013 \u2013 Greece (31.4%), Saudi Arabia (30.5%), the United States (29.3%), Mexico (28.9%) and the UK (27.7%).</p> <p>More than 3.5 million children now had type 2 diabetes, which was once unknown in this age group and can lead to horrible complications in later life, such as amputations and blindness. The World Obesity Federation, which compiled the data, predicted that number would rise to 4.1 million by 2025.</p> <p>About 13.5 million children have impaired glucose tolerance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Around 24 million have high blood pressure and more than 33 million have fatty liver disease as a result of obesity, which is more often associated with alcoholism and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p> <p>If anything, the experts said, the figures were an under-estimate because they were based on the numbers of obese children, and some who were classified as overweight would also have the diseases.</p> <p>The figures are alarming for rich and poor countries alike, signalling soaring medical bills to treat the coming epidemic of disease. But the WOF experts who compiled the data said that, while rich countries were struggling, poorer countries were ill-equipped to cope.</p> <p>\u201cThese forecasts should sound an alarm bell for health service managers and health professionals,\u201d said Tim Lobstein, the policy director of the WOF. \u201cThey will have to deal with this rising tide of ill health following the obesity epidemic. </p> <p>\u201cIn a sense, we hope these forecasts are wrong: they assume current trends continue, but we are urging governments to take strong measures to reduce childhood obesity, and meet their agreed target of getting the levels of childhood obesity down to 2010 levels before we get to 2025.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-07T14:33:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Childhood obesity incidences\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-07T14:33:39/embed.html\">Childhood obesity incidences</a> </figure>  <p>The experts, whose findings were published <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijpo.12185/full\">in the Pediatric Obesity journal</a>, said that by 2025, 49 million more children would be obese or overweight than in 2010 \u2013 a total of 268 million, of which 91 million alone would be obese.</p> <p>Lobstein, one of the authors of the paper published ahead of World Obesity Day next Tuesday, said the food children were eating was at the heart of the problem and that in poor countries, obesity and stunting went hand in hand.</p> <p>\u201cWe find that the large majority of children suffering excess bodyweight are in low- and middle-income countries. Following the recent evidence from the World Bank on the continuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\">high levels of stunting in children in underdeveloped regions</a> of the world, it is obvious that something is severely wrong with the way our food supplies are developing,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou cannot replace contaminated water with Coca-Cola or Chocolate Nesquik, or a lack of good meals with a pack of fortified noodles, and still expect children to grow healthily. Breastfeeding is rapidly giving way to infant formula in large areas of Asia where markets have tripled in value in a decade \u2013 an area where we have seen some of the most rapid increases in overweight and obesity.</p> <p>\u201cStunting and obesity are part of a continuum of poor nutrition, and can be found together in the same communities, the same families, and even the same individual children. Health is a key factor in sustainable development, and healthy food supplies are essential for economic development. Healthy food supplies are also a basic human right for this and the next generation.\u201d<br></p> <p>The WOF president, Prof Ian Caterson, called for governments to take tough regulatory action to stop junk food companies targeting children. </p> <p>\u201cThe obesity epidemic has reached virtually every country in the world, and overweight and obesity levels are continuing to rise in most places,\u201d he said. \u201cCommon risk factors, such as soft drink consumption and sedentary environments, have increased. Fast food advertising continues to really influence food choices and what is eaten, and increasing numbers of families live in urban environments without access to space to exercise or time to exercise.\u201d</p> <p>In the last 10 years, consumption of sugary drinks worldwide increased by a third. More than half of the world\u2019s population live in urban areas, and 80% of young people aged 11-17 fail to get sufficient physical activity.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments hope to achieve the WHO target of keeping child obesity at 2010 levels, then the time to act is now. Governments can take a number of actions to help prevent obesity, including introducing tough regulations to protect children from the marketing of unhealthy food, ensuring schools promote healthy eating and physical activity, strengthening planning and building rules to provide safe neighbourhoods, and monitoring the impact of these policies.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Pamela Duncan</em><br></p>",
  "<p>My flight touched down at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport without any problems, at about midnight on 5 October. I had been invited to share my experiences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement</a> at two universities in Bangkok and to talk about becoming a young politician. </p> <p>But as I left the plane, I started to feel paranoid that officials at the immigration counter might take me away and deport me back to Hong Kong on the very same flight. A strange feeling came over me. I could see more staff than usual ahead of me. But there was nowhere else to go. When I stepped on to the bridge leading off the plane, I saw a crowd of immigration police. I knew something was wrong.</p> <p>What surprised me was that, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/hong-kong-pro-democracy-student-activist-refused-entry-malaysia\">when I was refused entry to Malaysia</a> \u2013 in May 2015, this time I didn\u2019t have to go to the counter to be taken away. This time the officials came to meet me. </p> <p>They asked if I was Joshua Wong. I told them I was. </p> <p>And as soon as I had acknowledged my identity, they announced the order from Thai authorities to detain me and asked me to hand over my passport. I was very nervous. I never would have expected this to happen having barely stepped off the plane. </p> <p>The unfamiliar environment knocked me off balance. The last time I felt this sensation \u2013 that my heart was about to leap out from my chest \u2013 had been two years ago, in 2014, when I was arrested during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/hong-kong-democracy-activists-ask-what-protest-achieved-umbrella\">umbrella movement protests</a>. <br></p> <p>Had this been happening in Hong Kong, I would at least have been able to contact lawyers or the media to buy some time. But Bangkok airport was a foreign place to me, and my phone wouldn\u2019t connect to the airport Wi-Fi. I couldn\u2019t reach anyone for help. I had no choice but to surrender my passport. </p> <p>The customs officer told me I had been blacklisted by the Thai government and would not be permitted to enter the country. After handing over my passport, I was made to follow more than 20 customs and police officers to an unknown location. My heartbeat quickened and I was filled with a feeling of helplessness. We had been walking all over the place since my arrival and the only word I had been able to understand from them was \u201cblacklist\u201d. </p> <p>After they took me to the detention cell, I couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. I asked which articles of their law allowed them to put a foreign citizen in a detention cell without good reason. I asked to be allowed to contact my family, or even just a local lawyer. <br></p> <p>But my passport had been taken away, and I had been forbidden to use my phones or computers, so I could not contact anyone. They could do as they pleased. My two requests \u2013 to contact a lawyer and for them to explain the legality of their action \u2013 were both rejected with a simple \u201cNo\u201d. <br></p> <p>I criticised them for detaining me without any legal basis as something that was a violation of human rights and they replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you why once we have you detained.\u201d I continued to point out that they were violating proper police procedure, but they simply replied: \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>I repeated those words to myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>He was right, I thought. It is like China \u2013 not like Hong Kong. After all, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">Hong Kong publisher Gui Minhai was kidnapped in Thailand</a> last year and was eventually sent to mainland China. </p> <p>My discussion with the police officer ended with him making the assertion: \u201cYou know we can treat you nicely like we are now. But we can also make it hard for you. We believe you understand how far we can go.\u201d I was fully aware of this. In fact, everyone in Hong Kong is fully aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/china-behaving-like-gangster-state-with-bookseller-kidnap-say-hong-kong-politicians\">bookseller scandal</a>, which saw five local booksellers taken away to mainland China. </p> <p>At about two o\u2019clock in the morning I was put in a cell at the airport. </p> <p>At first I thought the worst that could happen would be that the 20 police officers would \u201ckeep me company\u201d in the airport waiting room before putting me on a flight back to Hong Kong. </p> <p>What I never expected was that I was about to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-detained-thailand-china-deportation\">locked up in a foreign country</a> merely for agreeing to speak at the top university there. </p> <p>Detention cells in Hong Kong are not pleasant. In Thailand they are even worse. In Hong Kong you are at least allowed to see your lawyers. Two years ago <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theapjournalist/status/515533206721150976\">I was arrested in Hong Kong</a> for storming the Civic Square two days before the umbrella movement erupted and I was able to seek release by filing a habeas corpus petition in court. </p> <p>In Thailand detention centres are far more unpleasant. The lack of hygiene and the language barrier were not even the main problems. The worst thing was being cut off from the outside world in this tightly sealed cell. You can\u2019t see the light and you don\u2019t know what time it is. You don\u2019t know how long you will have to wait. But you do know that you won\u2019t have the chance to help yourself through any legal means \u2013 because there is no rule of law.</p> <p>In this 50sq ft cell, my mind was troubled; I felt terrified and uneasy. I wondered if my friends and colleagues from my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">political party Demosisto</a> would be worried, seeing that I had not appeared online; I wondered what my family and girlfriend might be thinking, having heard nothing from me; I wondered if my friends from Thai student movements might be able to get me out having not seen me at the airport; I wondered how the Hong Kong government might respond to this, or if it would simply ignore it as if it never happened. I felt frightened. I wanted to cry. </p> <p>Being cut off from the outside world is scary. But I told myself not to cry. No matter what happened, I should not cry. I could not let the police \u2013 the tools of the government \u2013 feel like they had defeated me. Looking at the walls of the cell, I kept thinking about when I might be able to go home. Would it be tomorrow morning? At noon? Or perhaps a day later? </p> <p>It sounds crazy, but I was truly worried that the Thai government might take me off to one of its courts, under some national security article, and wait a couple of weeks before deporting me home. Or perhaps worse, they might find me guilty and keep me in jail for years. The worst that I imagined could happen \u2013 although just for an instant \u2013 was that they might deport me to mainland China, as they had done to the five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing last year. </p> <p>You may think I was overreacting by thinking that I would never be able to go home. When I started having these negative thoughts, I tried to remind myself that \u2013 even in the worst-case scenario \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be jailed in Thailand, let alone deported to mainland China. My voice of reason told me such scenarios were far-fetched. </p> <p>But you know what? When the physical conditions are so hostile, and you can\u2019t breathe because of the repressive atmosphere around you, this kind of fear grows inside you. Because the reality was that I was detained in a foreign country, with no access to legal assistance or the media, and I was not even sure I would be permitted to return home. </p> <p>My mind became so troubled that I wasn\u2019t able to sleep. Finally I realised what \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d actually means. This detention experience was 100 times more terrifying than the five previous times I was arrested in Hong Kong.<strong> <br></strong></p> <p>By noon the following day I was told I would be put on the next flight home. A huge load was lifted off my shoulders. Just before I left I was given a document from the immigration office, declaring that they had rejected my entry into the country according to Sections 19, 22 and 54 of the Immigration Act B.E. 2522.</p> <p>So after China, Macau and Malaysia, there is now another territory I know I cannot enter. In fact, I still don\u2019t understand why. I have never criticised the Thai government. I was only invited there to share my experiences of being a young man who took part in the umbrella movement. And this led to me being detained as soon as I stepped off the plane and being treated in a way that goes completely against human rights and the law. I spent almost 12 hours in detention and was deprived of my passport and of contact with others. </p> <p>I am absolutely certain that my unlawful detention by the Thai authorities was motivated by their fear of youth movements around the world.</p> <p>Indeed, young people right across the globe will only become more united and engaged as our collective yearning for democracy, civil liberties and other universal values strengthens. So too will our commitment to street activism. Our hopes and dreams transcend culture, language, country and political realities. <br></p> <p>My political party and I will continue to work with civic groups in the region to chart a new path towards liberty and justice. <br></p> <ul> <li>Translation by Y.M Wong, Jason Y Ng and Christy Yao <br></li> </ul>",

It comes as a surprise for many Colombians who believed his chances had been scuttled by the rejection of the peace deal his government had hammered out with Farc rebels after four years of talks in a referendum on 2 October. </p> <p>According to Kristian Herbolzheimer, of peace consultancy Conciliation Resources, given the \u201ctoxic dynamic\u201d of local politics after the referendum, the prize\u2019s consequences domestically are \u201cunpredictable\u201d.</p> <p>Critics of Santos had derided the president for allegedly being motivated by winning the Nobel prize in his search for peace in Colombia. Last night someone who voted no in the plebiscite told me she was happy because the result of the vote meant Santos wouldn\u2019t get the prize.</p> <p>Carlos Holmes Trujillo, a member of the opposition Democratic Centre party and the committee designated to search for a way out of the crisis, told local radio that the prize is \u201ca well-deserved recognition by the international community of the efforts he has been making for peace\u201d.</p> <p>The former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who campaigned vehemently against the peace deal with the Farc and has been a constant critic of Santos, has been tweeting since 5am (11am UK time) but has made no mention of the peace prize for his arch-rival. Also no reaction yet from Farc leadership who are in Havana.</p> <p>C\u00e9sar Rodriguez Garavito, the director of Dejusticia, a Colombian thinktank, says the Nobel prize will boost efforts to reach a new peace deal. Those who led the campaign for rejecting the peace accord in last week\u2019s referendum are in talks with the government to make changes to the agreement that will make it more palatable to the half of Colombian voters who rejected it. </p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the results of the plebiscite, but it reminds the parties that what is at stake is the end of the war, not political calculations,\u201d said Garavito. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the titanic efforts to reach peace.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T12:23:16.861Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f77785e4b03258bcac5400\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:24:02.425Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sibylla Brodzinsk</strong><strong>y</strong> in Bogot\u00e1 reports that Santos has spoken to the Nobel committee by phone and will address the media at 7am local time (1pm UK time).

From nuclear inspectors in 2005 and the UN climate panel to the Tunisians last year, the tactic often seems to be to use recognition to reanimate flagging processes. In the case of Barack Obama (2009) the prize was awarded on the basis of little more than a few fine speeches, before he\u2019d really even got started.

This tribute is paid not least to the representatives of the countless victims of the civil war. </p> <p>President Santos initiated the negotiations that culminated in the peace accord between the Colombian government and the Farc guerrillas, and he has consistently sought to move the peace process forward, well knowing that the accord was controversial. He was instrumental in ensuring that Colombian voters were able to voice their opinion concerning the accord in a referendum. The outcome of the vote was not what President Santos wanted. A narrow majority of the over 13 million Colombians who cast their ballots said no to the accord.</p> <p>This result has created great uncertainty as to the future of Colombia. There is a real danger that the peace process will come to a halt and that civil war will flare up again. This makes it even more important that the parties headed by President Santos and Farc guerrilla leader Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o continue to respect the ceasefire.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T11:09:17.612Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f76ec2e4b05c2f1e952f38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T09:52:11.108Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is a fair amount of consternation from some quarters that Santos won despite the fact the peace deal he negotiated was rejected by the Colombian people (albeit by an extremely narrow margin) in a referendum.

  "<p>Giant kites could supply green energy without the need for taxpayer-funded subsidies within years, according to one of the firms developing the technology.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kitepowersolutions.com/the-company/\">Kite Power Solutions</a> expects to open the UK\u2019s first kite power plant in March 2017 at the Ministry of Defence\u2019s West Freugh site in Stranraer, Scotland.</p> <p>It hopes to roll out the technology onshore and at sea, building systems with the capacity to produce \u201chundreds of megawatts\u201d of power within the decade.</p> <p>The company believes the technology, developed by a handful of firms around the world, could slash the cost of wind energy supplied by conventional turbines. And it predicted that kite power would cost so little that developing countries would be able to use it to wean themselves off polluting diesel generators and other carbon-heavy energy sources.</p> <p>The technology involves rigging two giant kites, each up to 70 square metres, to either side of a turbine. The first kite rises with the wind, up to a height of 450 metres, moving in a figure-of-eight pattern. The movement pulls a rope that turns a turbine, generating power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9858ca0cf3f0f2d3f9b66519d13876aeea203562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9858ca0cf3f0f2d3f9b66519d13876aeea203562/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The kites are attached to hydraulic winches.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kites are attached to hydraulic winches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one kite descends, the other rises in tandem, meaning that electricity can be generated almost constantly.</p> <p>A spokesman for Kite Power Solutions said the technology could halve the cost of offshore wind energy, dispensing with the need for governments to <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-renewables-auction-pushes-down-costs\">subsidise wind</a> in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>David Ainsworth said offshore wind energy was predicted to cost about 10 euro cents (9p) per kWh by 2022, meaning governments would be forced to pay the difference between that and the wholesale cost of energy, currently about 5.5 cents per kWh.</p> <p>BVG Associates energy consultancy estimates that kite power could cost just five cents per kWh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a80279c0aeed0969eeb372aaf1a3f5e23ba9a042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a80279c0aeed0969eeb372aaf1a3f5e23ba9a042/0_186_5468_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kite tests in Essex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kite testing in Essex.

It has won planning permission for a 500kW demonstration system but plans to build a 3MW power station after that and is identifying other sites to develop.</p> <p>A 3MW system would be comparable in power to smaller wind turbines but can produce up to 20% more energy, the company claims. It will also be less than 20% of the weight of a conventional horizontal axis wind turbine, which is made partly out of steel. The kite can fly higher than the tip of a wind turbine, reaching heights where wind tends to be stronger and more consistent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"937cc0fe6f26fb631ff4aed7a2dd97a929cb5742\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/937cc0fe6f26fb631ff4aed7a2dd97a929cb5742/1252_868_2197_2746/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Hampton, left, and David Ainsworth test their alternative energy solution.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Hampton, left, and David Ainsworth test their alternative energy solution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK\u2019s green energy trade body, RenewableUK, welcomed the technology but warned it was not a silver bullet.

We will need a wide range of energy sources in the future to meet our needs in a sustainable way.\u201d </p> <p>Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has said there is a 10% chance kite power could be the \u201cmagic solution\u201d for global renewable energy needs.</p> <p>Kite Power Solutions has received funding from the former Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Energy Entrepreneurs Fund and private backers.

  "<p><strong>My daughter, who is now in her 40s, is very angry with me about her childhood, and has been for years. She says she had a miserable time, even though she seemed such a happy and sweet little girl. In the 1970s, I was a&#xa0;single parent and brought her up in a bedsit. She is very resentful about this. She openly criticises me and tells&#xa0;me that I should have found a council house. When we were staying in the bedsit, she appeared happy. The house we lived in was friendly and the setup was very family-like. The landlady was extremely kind, and my daughter would rush to her when she came home from school. When my daughter was nine, I met my husband, to whom I have been married for more than 35 years; my daughter seems to love him as a father. </strong></p> <p><strong>The financial hardship of her early years is in the past and nowadays none of us is hard-up. My daughter has a high-powered job, I am pursuing my chosen career, my husband is doing well at work, and I would say that my husband and I are devoted to one another. My daughter is not married, and reminds me that people from broken homes are not good at establishing relationships. She seems to have many friends, though.</strong></p> <p><strong>I was not married to my daughter\u2019s father. When I became pregnant, he wanted me to have an abortion. The last time I spoke to him, my daughter was six weeks old and he told me to have her adopted. There was no support for me because my mother died when my daughter was three months old and I was unable to go and live with my father. At the time, I was 20. I don\u2019t know what to say to her any more because she just \u201ctells me off\u201d and shouts at me about her past. How can I help her?</strong></p> <p>You can only help her up to a&#xa0;point. The rest is up to her. I think you have done remarkably well. I&#xa0;wonder if, in comparison with you, your daughter feels she hasn\u2019t done so well with her life, despite having it relatively easier (practically, at least). My GP once told me something very wise: \u201cYou can blame your parents until you are 18, but after that it\u2019s up to you.\u201d In other words, once we are adults, it is our own responsibility to sort ourselves out and stop blaming our upbringing.</p> <p>I contacted Dr Shelagh Wright, a family psychotherapist, at the Association for Family Therapy (<a href=\"http://www.aft.org.uk/view/index.html?tzcheck=1\" title=\"\">aft.org.uk</a>), who says: \u201cIt sounds as if your daughter hasn\u2019t grown up and isn\u2019t taking responsibility for herself.\u201d She wonders \u201cif your daughter is only seeing a small part of her upbringing and putting all the [negative] things in her life down to that\u201d.</p> <p>Do you think that, maybe, some of your daughter\u2019s anger might be aimed at her father? But as he is not there, he has become a fantasy figure (despite all the bad things he did). Whereas you are real and flawed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you told her about her father?\u201d asks Wright. We wondered how much she knew about her father\u2019s desire to have her aborted or put up for adoption \u2013 if she knows, those things can\u2019t be easy for her to process and may have had an effect on her self-esteem. She hasn\u2019t got the satisfaction of showing her father that she was worth having and keeping. None of this is her fault, or yours, but you are there as the whipping boy.</p> <p>Wright feels that someone should stop the defensiveness you both seem to feel. \u201cLook inside yourself. Were there any things you could have done differently? If so, acknowledge them and say sorry.\u201d</p> <p>I would counsel against constantly apologising for the same thing, though, as it will help nobody. If your daughter keeps on at you about particular incidents, a good thing to do is bat it back to her, as in: \u201cHow would you have handled things differently? What would you have done?\u201d This is a powerful thing to say and can often stop a person in their tracks, especially if they are used to berating someone for the same thing.</p> <p>In long-standing family rows, dialogue tends to fall into a groove. Try to alter what you say. Wright recommends something like: \u201cYou\u2019re my daughter and I love you. What do you need <em>me</em> to do? What do <em>you</em> need to do [about this situation]?\u201d</p> <p>Wright feels that your daughter needs the connection with you, and says that arguing about the past \u201chas become your connection. You also have to get rid of the guilt and stop thinking you\u2019ve ruined her life. For her part, your daughter needs to temper her anger.\u201d After all, as Wright points out, \u201cyour daughter has lived in a stable environment since the age of nine\u201d.</p> <p>Do you think she wants to trace her father? Is that possible? I wasn\u2019t sure how much you knew/remembered about him, but she may find this link helpful: <a href=\"http://www.look4them.org.uk/salvation-army.html\" title=\"\">look4them.org.uk/salvation-army.html</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, if none of these suggestions move you forward, Wright suggests saying something like: \u201cI want to have you in my life, but I can\u2019t solve this problem for you. I think that is something you need to do for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Your daughter is in her 40s now and it\u2019s time she took responsibility for her own life: the triumphs and the&#xa0;failures.</p> <h2>Your problems solved</h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

Each conflict can claim to have displaced more than 6 million, internally, and millions more beyond their borders. A quarter of a million lives have been snuffed out in Colombia over the last 52 years, but almost 400,000 Syrians have been killed in one tenth of the time.

  "<p>\u201cBring it on, lads,\u201d Sam Allardyce exclaimed at a press conference three days after accepting the job of managing England. So they did. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/gareth-southgate-england-sam-allardcye-exit\" title=\"\">And 64 days later he was gone</a>.</p> <p>The \u201clads\u201d had wiped him out, turning him into a candidate for a spectacular entry in the Guinness World Records. Allardyce became the recipient of the largest amount of money ever paid to a man for supervising a single game of football: about \u00a3550,000 in salary over the two months, plus a reported \u00a31m in \u201ccompensation\u201d for \u00a36m he had been due to earn under the terms of the truncated two-year contract.</p> <p>To the FA\u2019s outlay could be added the \u00a33m they were required to pay Sunderland for securing his services in the first place. That made it four and a half million quid for two halves of very unsatisfactory football barely redeemed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/slovakia-england-world-cup-2018-qualifier-sam-allardyce\" title=\"\">by a lucky 95th-minute winner</a>. In itself the match represented perhaps the most unimpressive debut by an England manager since the autumn of 1977 when Ron Greenwood, given temporary charge \u2013 despite a popular clamour for Brian Clough \u2013 after Don Revie\u2019s sudden retreat to the United Arab Emirates, packed his team with seven Liverpool players and watched them fumble and fret to a goalless friendly draw with Switzerland at a half-full Wembley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/football-quiz-england-manager-quotes\">'I don't know what I'm doing here': which England managers gave these quotes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Allardyce\u2019s appointment was always going to provide the answer to a question that had become tiresome. Finally we would know what happened if he got the job. Could the son of Dudley turn into the mythical Allardici of his own imagination, infusing England\u2019s players not merely with bullish confidence but with sophisticated tactical awareness? Or would he prove true to the negative stereotype, the purveyor of bluster and big-boot football still trailing the noxious fumes of a BBC Panorama investigation?</p> <p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-history-suspicion-dream-job-ended-67-days\" title=\"\">his downfall</a> he had showed all the signs of going the way of Steve McClaren. The brash facade quickly gave way to a series of mistakes, the first in cancelling a potentially useful friendly against Croatia followed by errors of selection and tactics and then to an absurd attempt to gloss over his captain\u2019s incoherent performance by claiming that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/england-slovakia-sam-allardyce-wayne-rooney-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">\u201cnot for me to say where to play Wayne Rooney\u201d</a>. Possibly the most bizarre comment ever made by a serving England manager, this should have put doubts into the minds of the FA even before the news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/sam-allardyce-fa-newspaper-sting-england-manager\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph\u2019s fatal sting</a>.</p> <p>So now we know. Allardyce was brought down by his failure to recognise the different standards of behaviour demanded by the position he prized so greatly. Those standards were not, after all, so hard to recognise and observe: act with a little discretion and \u2013 just for two years \u2013 rise above the rest of the creatures grubbing around in football\u2019s money pit. Not much to ask, for \u00a33m a year.</p> <p>In the case of Clough, we will never know how it might have turned out. A couple of months after that Switzerland stalemate 39 years ago, having guided England to victories over Luxembourg away and Italy at home in the meantime, Greenwood got the job full-time in preference to Old Big \u2018Ead, whose brand of self-confidence had not impressed the FA\u2019s committee men. Neither were they influenced by his success, in partnership with Peter Taylor, in getting Nottingham Forest promoted to the top flight and by their start \u2013 P18 W12 D3 L3 \u2013 to a season that would see them capturing the First Division title.</p> <p>That was something Greenwood never achieved. But he was an enlightened thinker about the game under whose aegis at West Ham three of England\u2019s heroes of 1966 had grown and prospered, and the FA had let it be known that they were looking for someone who would not just manage the senior international team but take control of the entire England coaching structure. Clough might not have been interested in that aspect of the mission statement. He would also have needed Taylor with him, and together they carried quite a lot of baggage that might have been prised open by the 1970s equivalents of the \u201clads\u201d who did for&#xa0;Allardyce.</p> <p>It is also questionable whether the environment of international football would have suited Clough who, even though his players often did not see him from Saturday night to Friday morning, appeared to thrive best once he had created a kind of family atmosphere. He was a strategist, and international football requires tacticians. Given only short periods of time with his squad, he might also have found it difficult to keep all the big egos&#xa0;happy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/06/bittersweet-memories-england-argentina-football-conflict-angels-dirty-faces\">Bittersweet memories of England and Argentina where football and conflict collide | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What we know about Gareth Southgate, who has four matches in which to stake his claim to the job that Clough was never offered, is that he is an intelligent, level-headed and well mannered fellow who rose above his limitations as a player, is ambitious without flaunting it, and seems to be able to learn from his setbacks. What he will need is the vision to evaluate his players and come up with a combination that works. Even half-decent international teams do not require micro-management or a ranting voice from the technical area.</p> <p>If he is unlucky to be without Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck \u2013 who might easily, if fit and in form, comprise his most effective attacking trio, give or take a Marcus Rashford \u2013 for the matches against Malta and Slovenia, he is fortunate to be coming in near the start of the sort of qualifying campaign from which England managers traditionally emerge unscathed, having given little indication of how they and their players will cope with a real tournament.</p> <p>And if there is to be a long term for Southgate, it should be to his benefit that he has been through the final stages of tournaments held on foreign territory twice in the past 18 months. He will have learned both from the unhappy experience in the European Under-21 Championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/25/deficit-experience-england-under21s-exit-gareth-southgat\" title=\"\">in the Czech Republic last year</a>, when England came bottom of a strong group, and from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/29/england-france-toulon-tournament-final-match-report\" title=\"\">winning the highly competitive Toulon tournament</a> in France this past summer.</p> <p>Sometimes coming in under the radar can be an advantage. Southgate has taken the job on a temporary basis, with few expectations. That will not absolve him from the kind of scrutiny only England managers experience and which, in Brian Glanville\u2019s famous phrase, drives them all mad in the end. But at least the chances are that he will be judged only on the grounds of how well he can get the team to play, and not on the sort of hubristic indiscretions that cast an unflattering light on the whole game.</p>",
  "<p>The death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/01/geoffrey-hill-one-of-the-greatest-english-poets-dies-aged-84\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Hill this summer </a>put one of his more astringent declarations back into circulation: \u201cAccessible is a perfectly good word if applied to supermarket aisles, art galleries, polling stations and public lavatories, but it has no place in the discussion of poetry and poetics.\u201d Characteristically for Hill, this sounds imperious, but you can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s funny. And it\u2019s funny because the statement embodies the difficulty it\u2019s arguing for \u2013 \u201cdifficulty\u201d not necessarily in the literary sense, where it\u2019s conflated with \u201cobscurity\u201d, but in the sense pertaining to human beings, as in \u201cShe\u2019s quite difficult\u201d, where the word is synonymous with peculiarity, intransigence and eccentricity. Human beings who are difficult are irritating; but their oddity sometimes gives them charm. Hill knows perfectly well that, notwithstanding his abrasiveness, there\u2019s a charm to what he\u2019s saying, because there\u2019s humour&#xa0;in a difficult man\u2019s gestures towards non-cooperation and resistance. \u201cHuman beings are difficult,\u201d he&#xa0;goes on. \u201cWe\u2019re difficult to ourselves; we\u2019re difficult to each other and we are mysteries to ourselves; we are mysteries to each other ... Why is it believed that poetry, prose, painting, music should be less than we are?\u201d</p> <p>What makes poetry \u201cdifficult\u201d? There\u2019s the fact that most poems have no story to outline the experience of reading, no characters to love or hate, no beginning or end in the sense we understand those terms. There is nothing in a poem to cushion us from the encounter with form and language. And form estranges: those short or long lines, one beneath the other, comprise an appearance that\u2019s immediately puzzling. Rhyme helps, as do refrains: they bind the disparate lines. But line endings in a poem constitute a primary strangeness.</p> <p>What about prose? Difficult prose might share some of those features \u2013 the lack of a storybook narrative; the absence of characterisation in an orthodox sense. But what fundamentally makes prose seem difficult will have to do with language itself (compound words, neologisms) and with punctuation (missing commas and full stops). These idiosyncrasies look as if they\u2019re deliberately meant to confuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/21/steven-poole-language-power-disarm-concerned-citizen\">Language has the power to disarm the concerned citizen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, \u201cdifficulty\u201d is subjective. Those who are diverted by the offshoots of 19th-century realism \u2013 the historical novel; fantasy; fiction with a well-rounded plot and characters, and \u201cconflict\u201d \u2013 will find all residues of poetic language and modernism, with some of the features I\u2019ve mentioned, repugnant and boring. On the other hand, addicts of poetry and modernist narrative will find conventional narrative, plot, characterisation and linearity difficult and tedious. According to these addicts, the expunging of punctuation marks from certain works, for instance, is done not to make language difficult; rather it\u2019s a way of unshackling language from the burdensomeness and difficulty of commas, full stops and colons. Some of these addicts might also find what\u2019s generally known as \u201cplot\u201d to be numbingly stultifying, and jettison it in favour of something more open-ended, some quality of narrative which they identify with ease.There\u2019s an ongoing war here, where different people have radically opposed ideas of what\u2019s difficult and resistant and what\u2019s open, accessible and free. Of course, the troops gathered in this battle on the side of immediate accessibility significantly outnumber the fighters in the opposing camp.</p> <p>We live in an epoch in which the battle for the complex and the resistant seems (\u201cseems\u201d is the operative word, as it often is) to have been lost. One of its early casualties was prose style. Style is not just a writer\u2019s personal signature; and yet \u201cclassic style\u201d is an oxymoron, because style is essentially idiosyncratic. Style needn\u2019t necessarily abjure conjunctions, as in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/24/classics.sebastianfaulks\" title=\"\"> Henry Green\u2019s <em>Living</em></a>, or make alienating gestures, such as dispensing with the definite article, as in his <em>Party Going</em>. In fact, style, going back to 19th-century English prose, and adapted by later experimenters such as Virginia Woolf and Henry James, can feel over-punctuated, because it is often syntactically complex and overwrought.</p> <p>Long sentences and intricate syntax are records of either a thought process or a sensory one. They\u2019re as much a feature of prose style in a novelist as they are in a writer of essays. Process can be embodied through thick punctuation \u2013 semicolons, dashes, commas. These signify stops and starts in thought, intakes of breath and revisions in perspective \u2013 they remind us that a sentence might be a single unit, but that it can take various decisions, and embark on different directions, before it reaches its end. Take the third sentence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/10/virginia-woolf-to-the-lighthouse\" title=\"\"><em>To the Lighthouse</em></a>, which comes after Mrs Ramsay has apparently told her son that they\u2019ll make a trip the next morning if the weather holds up and if he\u2019s up early: \u201cTo her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition were bound to take place, and the wonder to which he had looked forward, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night\u2019s darkness and a day\u2019s sail, within touch.\u201d Structurally, this is a Victorian sentence. But,&#xa0;in a Victorian novel, it would be part of the continual unfolding of the protagonist\u2019s life and ambitions. Woolf\u2019s \u201cnovel\u201d (she wanted another generic name for the work she was composing, according to a letter she wrote at the time) is implicated in a paradox \u2013 it\u2019s about a journey, but it\u2019s also about the shifts of meaning you\u2019re visited by before going nowhere. This is why the syntax of that third sentence asks you immediately to read and then reread it \u2013 because of Woolf\u2019s investment in arresting development and, in lieu of sharing information, altering experience within the sentence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"235efcc7ea42634ecde4a136e2e3f695e113a30f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/235efcc7ea42634ecde4a136e2e3f695e113a30f/107_0_1446_1445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virginia Woolf wanted to use a different generic name for the work she was composing other than \u2018novel\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virginia Woolf wanted to use a different generic name for the work she was composing other than \u2018novel\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CSU Archv/Everett / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A poem might be converted into prose narrative if we transcribe it sideways and remove the line endings: but, as a poem, its form asks us to consider both continuity and that the discrete lines that sit on top of each other be read as separate units that have potentially nothing to do with each other. Similarly, Woolf\u2019s sentence, despite its horizontal appearance, eludes conversion into normal prose and asks to be read as individual units demarcated by commas, each of which has an independent life of its own: \u201cas if it were settled\u201d; \u201cfor years and years it seemed\u201d; \u201cwas\u201d; \u201cwithin touch\u201d. As it happens, the next sentence \u2013 the fourth in the book \u2013 is more than twice as long as the third, an epic eulogy of many commaed sections to this child\u2019s excitement, who, at that moment, is cutting out a picture of a refrigerator \u201cfrom the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores\u201d. The fifth sentence, on how the boy views the cut-out as a result of his excitement, is unnaturally compressed: \u201cIt was fringed with joy.\u201d These exaggerated alternations, where sentences and their units, astutely marked out by punctuation, have a brief fragmentary life, create, on the first page of <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, a radical idea of \u201cstyle\u201d.</p> <p>One of the reasons style began to be looked upon with disfavour was because it came to be associated with elitism and hubris in a time of disingenuous free-market egalitarianism. A watered-down, moralistic version of anti-intellectualism also possessed Anglophone cultures from the early 1990s, and it frowned upon stylistic \u201cdifficulty\u201d. With style disappeared the semicolon, the colon and dashes, for reasons very different from, say, why Joyce jettisoned punctuation in his so-called stream-of-consciousness flood of words and references \u2013 and the long sentence full of internal variation also became rarer.</p> <p>In Britain, this led in the 90s to the emergence of an undemanding prose in newspapers whose chief characteristic was a friendly blandness: fewer clauses, shorter sentences, light punctuation, a deprecating tendency in the writing not to draw attention to itself. In this period, the semicolon became more or less extinct in Britain, as it did in America. The reasons for the banishment of syntactical complexity from American writing were similar to those in Britain, but in creative writing classes in the US there was also a new minimalism that reigned. It possibly originated with the prestige that Hemingway\u2019s terseness, his muscularity, had had right from the 50s onward; although, at his best, as in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/27/ten-best-fishing-trips-literature\" title=\"\">Big Two-Hearted River\u201d</a>, Hemingway alternated between the long and oblique and the short and direct: \u201cHe watched them holding themselves with their noses into the current, many trout in deep, fast-moving water, slightly distorted as he watched far down through the glassy convex surface of the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven spiles of the bridge. At the bottom of the pool were the big trout.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0dd02a02537ef3d59e4aec3dfbe0114139615df4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd02a02537ef3d59e4aec3dfbe0114139615df4/0_452_2103_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ernest Hemingway with his catch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernest Hemingway with his catch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/CPL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beauty of the short sentence has to do not with accessibility but distillation, and often, as in this case, with momentary entrancement. This can apply equally to the separate and distinct sections of a long sentence. By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/raymond-carver-editor-influence\" title=\"\">Raymond Carver</a> inherited Hemingway\u2019s mantle, there was perhaps not only a fetishisation of terseness in American creative writing classes, but a moralism to do with paring down and curtailment. Only lately have we discovered that Carver often preferred looser, more expansive, sentences, and that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/gordon-lish-books-interview-editing-raymond-carver\" title=\"\"> Gordon Lish</a>, his editor, was responsible for the incarnation which we\u2019re familiar with. Bill Buford coined a term, \u201cdirty realism\u201d, for an issue of Granta in which he showcased Carver and a selection of his contemporaries, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">Richard Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/11/fiction.familyandrelationships\" title=\"\">Jayne Anne Phillips</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/19/fiction2\" title=\"\">Tobias Wolff</a>. Once these literary congruences began to be established, the male writers in that group were seen to have descended from Hemingway, although Ford didn\u2019t like Hemingway and adored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/29/gatsby-great-scott-fitzgerald-greater\" title=\"\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>, a connoisseur of punctuation and the shape of the sentence, short or long.</p> <p>Late in the 20th century or early in the 21st, Larry Pressler, a Republican senator well-known in India for \u201cpro-India\u201d proclivities, visited Calcutta; he and I had tea with a friend, a scientist, who introduced us to each other. She\u2019d also given him a copy of my book of short stories, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/23/fiction.features\" title=\"\"><em>Real Time</em></a>. I remember Pressler, looking through its pages, as mildly struck and amused: \u201cI see you use the semicolon.\u201d After almost a two-decade-long drought in punctuation, it would seem that the semicolon has returned: syntactical complexity began to appear again in Brooklyn in New York City at the start of this millennium. It didn\u2019t originate in the New Yorker, which had cultivated plainness and simple elegance over rebarbative sentence structures. Remember we are speaking of an epoch that was still in the midst of, or just about to emerge from, the philosophical-political arabesque of literary theory. Unintelligible theoretical positions had become embedded in difficult sentences, which were to be found in the pages of Critical Inquiry rather than the New Yorker or the New York Times. Difficulty came not only to be identified with intellectual exploration but with academic expertise. The unobtrusive sentences in the New Yorker were, on one level, fences keeping out theory and protecting, even fetishising, writing as a form of amateurism (ironical for a paper resting on so much capital, and as famous for its extravagant writer\u2019s fees as for its fact-checking). These&#xa0;boundaries were muddled by the appearance of magazines such as n+1.</p> <p>This journal started out as, and still claims to be (a romantic anachronism) a \u201clittle magazine\u201d. It was, in fact, an early reminder that global capital had created \u2013 in America more than in Europe, where the middle class had been more thoroughly possessed by a democratic populism that partnered with the market \u2013 oases of elite education. With them came an American generation that knew where to place the semicolon. Equally, it knew that it knew, and wasn\u2019t nervous about this ability. It had no consistent counterpart in Britain. Most of the editors of n+1 had been educated at Harvard, the rest at \u201cschools\u201d of equal distinc-tion. The American word for higher educational institutions, \u201cschool\u201d, is a reminder that the sort of place Harvard is, and its location in the culture, has no equivalent in Britain: it\u2019s Eton and Oxford in one. Only an institution that saw no conflict between the closely guarded freemasonry one experiences in an elite school and the mass market could have produced Facebook. The editors of, and contributors to, n+1 were, however, seized by an Oedipal urge. They were smart kids; they read both literature and theory with excitement and thoroughness; some of them completed doctorates; but, oddly, unlike their predecessors, they didn\u2019t become academics. This left them free to express their interest in the literary; a fully paid-up academic at the time, engaged in inter-departmental theoretical argumentation, would have considered it beneath themselves to devote their work to literary works and to the question of style and sentences. The n+1 writers, in too irritatingly a smartass way for some, combined \u2013 in editorial columns such as \u201cThe Intellectual Situation\u201d \u2013 politics, theory, literature, criticism and sentences in one space. Their new-found amateurism allowed them this liberty.

Foremost among these is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/the-big-bang-theory-season-10-premiere-bust\" title=\"\">Sheldon Cooper in <em>The Big&#xa0;Bang Theory</em></a>. This sitcom, about four nerdish science graduate students in Pasadena \u2013 a theoretical physicist (Sheldon), an applied physicist (Leonard), an astrophysicist (Raj) and an engineer (Howard) \u2013 showcases Sheldon\u2019s eccentric obsessions in popular culture and especially his simultaneously tortuous and fluent way of communicating with others as a constant source of hilarity. Here\u2019s an example of a typical exchange between Leonard and Sheldon, who share an apartment. Leonard: \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what just happened.\u201d Sheldon: \u201cYou went out in the hallway, stumbled into an inter-dimensional portal, which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you\u2019re back, to bring us all with you to the year 7010, where we are transported to work at the think-a-torium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?\u201d Leonard: \u201cPenny kissed me.\u201d Sheldon: \u201cWho would ever guess that?\u201d (One again sees here, as in the Woolf and Hemingway, the effect of amplification and contraction, of alternating the very long with the very short.)</p> <p>The \u201cdifficulty\u201d of Sheldon\u2019s personality as well as his sentence structures comes from his mix of self-conscious formality and blithe social ineptitude. When, on his first meeting with his girlfriend Amy\u2019s mother, the latter says: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too Sheldon, I honestly didn\u2019t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend,\u201d Sheldon responds with: \u201cI assure you, I am quite real and I\u2019m having regular intercourse with your daughter.\u201d At the heart of Sheldon\u2019s comic impact is (besides speaking the unspeakable) exaggeration \u2013 the habit of saying in a complicated way what could be said simply \u2013 and this connects his maddening utterances to irony and literature. Irony is ambiguous but funny because it eschews directness and simplicity for subtle prevarication. And exaggeration is near-identical with the literary enterprise, in that literature is not about important things (it leaves those to committees) but about expending unnecessary effort on matters that may or may not be worth it. This can lead to a complexity that\u2019s intrinsically ironical; here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/08/classics.vladimirnabokov\" title=\"\">Nabokov, in <em>Pnin</em></a>, describing the protagonist\u2019s background in teaching Russian as we follow his ill-timed arrival into a small university town: \u201cIn the Fall&#xa0;Semester of that particular year (1950), the enrollment in the Russian Language courses consisted of one student, plump and earnest Betty Bliss, in the Transitional Group, one, a mere name (Ivan Dub, who never materialized) in the&#xa0;Advanced, and three in the flourishing Elementary; Josephine Malkin, whose grandparents had been born in Minsk; Charles McBeth, whose prodigious memory had already disposed of ten languages and was prepared to entomb ten more; and languid Eileen Lane, whom somebody had told that by the time one had mastered the Russian alphabet one could practically read \u2018Anna Karamazov\u2019 in the original.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db9e8edb75e5a19df2528575b0c16ecb352c91d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db9e8edb75e5a19df2528575b0c16ecb352c91d6/205_557_1404_842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Nabokov, a writer who \u2018in mid-life became a stylistic virtuoso in a language that was not his mother tongue\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Nabokov, a writer who \u2018in mid-life became a stylistic virtuoso in a language that was not his mother tongue\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Mydans/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a key difference between Nabokov and Sheldon. Both Sheldon and his creators claim that he doesn\u2019t understand irony. This makes almost everything he says sound ironical. It also leads us into a kind of unsettlement. We can\u2019t really be certain if there\u2019s some intended irony in Sheldon\u2019s hyperbole and in the way he\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d, and some unintended irony in Nabokov\u2019s. Perhaps some of Sheldon\u2019s faux pas are deliberate; and a few of Nabokov\u2019s tortuous bons mots a personality induced accident? We are in the realm of foreign languages. It\u2019s as if Sheldon were speaking a foreign tongue; certain ordinary aspects of the language \u2013 its emotional registers; simplicity as opposed to bluntness \u2013 are unavailable to him. This is partly because, as a <em>Star Trek</em> aficionado, his first language, into which he lapses occasionally, is Vulcan. He is descended, as an individual and a type, from Spock, one of whose parents came from that planet. Spock\u2019s manner is equitable, calm, intellectual, and objective; his speech is formal and distinct from everyone else\u2019s on the Starship Enterprise. There\u2019s a tendency in us \u2013 because of his detachment \u2013 to think Spock might be an ironicist. He\u2019s foreign, but, unlike Superman, has no \u201cregular\u201d Clark Kent side. As James said of Isabel Archer, an American trying to make her life in England, Spock is \u201cassimilated but unconverted\u201d to human life.</p> <p>In this matter of speaking English as if it were a foreign tongue, we find a convergence between Nabokov and Sheldon; for Nabokov, English was a second language, and the reason David Lodge, in his own somewhat hyperbolic gesture, called him a \u201cliterary genius\u201d was because there \u201cis no other word with which to describe a writer who in mid-life became a stylistic virtuoso in a language that was not his mother tongue\u201d. To be syntactically complex, then, is to be an outsider. It\u2019s also to conflate, in American literary and popular culture, a set of terms \u2013 genius; smartness; the oddity and concealed force of Jewish identity in American life and its language (as in European culture); the unmistakable hint of elitism (Nabokov\u2019s origins lay in the Russian nobility).</p> <p>Since the first issue of n+1 came out in 2004, and Sheldon made his entry in 2007, a number of other characters (all of them secondary to the protagonist except one) who speak strangely and differently have made their appearance on American TV. These include, in the 2009 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/16/mondays-best-tv-eating-well-with-hemsley-hemsley-marcella\" title=\"\">series <em>White Collar</em></a>, Mozzie (the name is a homage to the composer Mozart), a gifted, balding, myopic con man who is assistant to the dashing forger, Neal Caffrey. By common consensus, Mozzie \u2013 and not the protagonist \u2013 gets the series\u2019 best lines. Besides exuding a melancholy irony, they\u2019re marked by a dated formality (\u201cWe feel free when we escape, even if it be but from the frying pan to the fire\u201d); aphoristic exaggeration (\u201cLife is more manageable when thought of as a scavenger hunt as opposed to a surprise party\u201d); and literary allusiveness (\u201cI saw the best mind of my generation run down by the drunken taxi cab of absolute reality\u201d). There are others in this lineage: Dr Temperance \u201cBones\u201d Brennan, a forensic anthropologist in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/10/bones-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">eponymous series <em>Bones</em></a>, earnest, pretty, awkward and apt to speak with such stilted exactness that it\u2019s difficult to take anything she says as not being performative; and the secretive billionaire Harold Finch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/may/19/cbs-tv-previews-upfronts\" title=\"\"><em>Person of Interest</em></a> \u2013 again, secondary to, and the brains behind, the vigilante John Reese \u2013 whose utterances always have a deadpan, estranging precision and abnormality. These figures have signalled the reticent resurfacing of the privileged outsider in the cultural domain and, with them, the occasional reintroduction of mannerisms in speech and thinking, of pauses, asides and punctuation, which we thought had once and for all vanished.</p>",

Contradicting the health secretary\u2019s claim that many would-be doctors are being denied places at university, he said: \u201cSome medical schools are actually struggling to fill their places, meaning that these ambitions may also not be practical.

There simply won\u2019t be enough doctors for the number of patients walking through our hospital and GP surgery doors. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that training this number of extra doctors will not make the NHS self-sufficient by 2025.

  "<p>\u201cTake back control\u201d is one of those cunning political slogans that can mean whatever you want it to. This summer some people undoubtedly believed they were taking back control of our country\u2019s democracy; however, <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/publications/take-back-control/\" title=\"\">Transparency International\u2019s research</a> into the money behind the referendum campaigns tells a very different story.</p> <p>In the run-up to the poll both the remain and leave campaigns, alongside smaller outfits like Grassroots Out and Scientists for EU, had to declare any donations they received over \u00a37,500 to the Electoral Commission. These were then <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/jf3om53\" title=\"\">published online</a>, giving us a fairly good idea of who was bankrolling either side of the debate.</p> <p>Of the \u00a331m in private donations that campaigners declared, half came from just 10 people and private companies. In fact, it took only 12 donors for Vote Leave and seven for the Stronger In Europe campaign to finance the full \u00a37m they were each allowed to spend during the formal referendum period between mid-April and 23 June. So just who was taking control?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Transparency International has recommended that the UK adopt a \u00a310,000 annual cap on individual and company donations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These declarations go a long way towards telling us who really funded the leaflets, letters and adverts that drove home the arguments in the debate, but they also demonstrate some gaping holes in the rules controlling money in UK politics.</p> <p>One of the largest reported donations was made by a company called Better for the Country Ltd. It was registered with Companies House only in the spring of last year, and has yet to publish a set of accounts, so we cannot know for sure how it came to have almost \u00a32m to give to the Grassroots Out campaign.</p> <p>There are very strict rules on who can donate to referendum campaigns in order to prevent foreign influence on UK politics. It may well be that all this money came from sources who were themselves allowed to donate under these rules. But if not, we won\u2019t know until it\u2019s far too late.</p> <p>Although it is shocking to think that the future of our country may have been decided by the deep pockets of so few, this is only part of a wider problem. Our political parties are heavily reliant on a small number of big donors. They might have only the most philanthropic of motivations, but it should be a warning to us all of how vulnerable our democracy is to \u201cpolitical capture\u201d, where public decisions are made to benefit donor\u2019s private interests. It is more subtle than paying a bribe and often entirely legal, but every bit as effective.</p> <p>As our politicians scramble to discover how they lost the public\u2019s trust, they could start by noting the results of our Global Corruption Barometer. In a representative sample of more than 1,000 UK respondents, 28% thought most or all MPs are involved in corruption, and a massive 76% thought wealthy individuals are unduly influencing government to benefit their own interests.</p> <p>Now would be a good time to do something about that. As the government follows up on its commitment from Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ukanticorruptionpledgetracker.org/\" title=\"\">anti-corruption summit </a>to produce the UK\u2019s first anti-corruption strategy, it\u2019s essential that domestic problems are not forgotten in its ambition to provide global leadership on this issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/may-must-explain-tory-donors-links-to-russia-says-labour-mp\">May must explain Tory donor's links to Russia, says Labour MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To start, Transparency International has recommended that the UK adopt a \u00a310,000 annual cap on individual and company donations to political parties and their candidates, as first set out by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, and echoed more recently by the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldtupf/106/106.pdf\" title=\"\">cross-party Lords committee</a> examining the government\u2019s proposals for reforming trade unions\u2019 political funds.</p> <p>This measure would reduce political parties\u2019 reliance on a small number of donors \u2013 reducing the influence of any one person \u2013 and push them into spreading their funding base more widely. Whether public money covers any shortfall in the short term is a matter for parliament, but leaving the funding of our politics to so few is dangerous.</p> <p>Turkeys voting for Christmas, you say? Perhaps, but in my past experience as an MP, senior politicians no more wanted to be spending time courting wealthy donors than we want them to.</p> <p>I remember the groans of disbelief at one meeting of MPs where we were encouraged to take inspiration from Democrat congressmen who spend up to four hours a day calling current and prospective donors. That did, however, inspire one Republican earlier this year to introduce legislation known as the <a href=\"http://www.thestopact.com/\" title=\"\">Stop Act</a> to make it illegal for congressmen to ask you for money. It\u2019s still awaiting consideration from a Congressional committee.</p> <p>After the EU referendum, mainstream political leaders were left asking why they had failed to persuade the public to follow them, and what it would take to reconnect. Perhaps the answer lies in the attitudes about corruption and private interests that so many people have towards the political establishment. Whatever happens to our relationship with the EU after the referendum, political parties need to act before trust in politics is irretrievably lost.</p>",
  "<p>Wednesday was a historic day for the climate. No, not another record-breaking hottest month. Not another devastating hurricane. For once, it was a good day. </p> <p>Wednesday was the day enough countries \u2013 representing more than 55% of global carbon emissions \u2013 ratified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/05/obama-paris-climate-deal-ratification\">Paris agreement</a> on climate change for the treaty to enter force. </p> <p>A weary world, weighed down by Syria, Brexit and American presidential elections must wonder if fancy words like \u201cratification\u201d actually mean anything. The answer is unequivocally \u201cyes\u201d. This treaty sets us on an irreversible trajectory on which all investment, all regulation and all industrial strategy must start to align with a global economy powered by 100% clean energy.</p> <p>So dramatic is this change of direction that, as of last December, more than <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122015/divestment-campaign-grows-more-34-trillion-assets-vow-exit-fossil-fuels\">500 global institutions with assets in excess of $3.4 trillion</a> had committed to divest themselves from the fossil-fuelled extractive industries of the past. Government policies globally are now aligned with real-world market forces pushing forward the next great industrial revolution: the clean low-carbon revolution that will transform how we power our lives.</p> <p>The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have set about transforming the global company reporting system so that it takes account of climate change risks.</p> <p>Financial decision-makers at every level are recognising that fossil fuel investments risk their returns being undermined by stranded assets. They recognise that supply chains face disruption from the effects of climate change. Carney warned just last month that to minimise the risk to financial stability the transition away from high- carbon industries should begin early and follow a predictable path to help markets anticipate the central element of the Paris agreement: a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century. A disorderly transition would result in financial shocks that would make 2008 seem no more than a blip</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/global-temperature-climate-change-highest-115000-years\">Planet at its hottest in 115,000 years thanks to climate change, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To achieve the central goal at the heart of the Paris agreement, of creating a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century, we need an orderly, managed transition that minimises risks and allows us to seize the opportunities created by the new jobs and investment in clean industries that will increasingly drive our economies.</p> <p>Binding international law provides a solid bulwark against even the most unexpected political events \u2013 just think of Brexit or a Trump presidency. The involvement of city governments, investors and the private capital markets is making the progress to a clean future impossible to roll back.</p> <p>Latest figures from Office for National Statistics show that Britain\u2019s low-carbon businesses generate a <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2458701/uk-green-economy-worth-gbp462bn-in-2014-official-stats-reveal\">total annual turnover of \u00a346.2bn </a>for the economy and employ nearly a quarter of a million people. The growth in the low-carbon sector of the UK economy is now outpacing the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and has grown by almost 30% in the past three years.</p> <p>Of course, maintaining this level of growth requires clear signals from politicians \u2013 not the Tory stop-start decisions that have thrown renewable industries into chaos and energy investors into despair. A shale gas infrastructure would require a return on capital over 30 to 35 years. Quite simply this means that shale gas is an expensive detour the UK can ill-afford to take. That is why last week I announced that the next Labour government will ban fracking, and why community secretary Sajid Javid\u2019s decision this week to overturn 18,000 local objections and clear the way for fracking in Lancashire is a colossal mistake.</p> <p>Gas will play an important transitional role in the UK\u2019s energy supply over the next 15 years. But energy efficiency in domestic heating and the decarbonisation of our power supply by 2030 will see demand for it fall by 26%. </p> <p>We need to be investing in the low-carbon technologies that are creating the apprenticeships and skilled jobs of the future. Wednesday\u2019s ratification of the Paris agreement makes business as usual impossible. We are in a different world now.</p>",

We\u2019ve changed the way we work out, too, moving from repetitive, machine-assisted exercises to more functional training. Where once we jogged sedately for hours, now we run, jump, squat and lift, movements the natural world once demanded of us.</p> <p>Increasing numbers of people want to train like soldiers, the most functionally fit people on the planet. <a href=\"https://www.britmilfit.com\">British Military Fitness</a> runs 400 classes in 140 locations, and is adding more. \u201cAthletes aren\u2019t robust, they snap easily,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.redzonedoctor.com/about-me/#bio\">Dr Sundeep Chohan</a>, a medic who has worked extensively with the special forces and is dismissive of gym\u2011fit Instagram posers. \u201cMilitary fitness is a combination of 20 factors \u2013 things like peak flow and blood pressure.

Someone with a six\u2011pack won\u2019t last long in the Antarctic, where you need body fat to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Chohan is here with me in the jungle. So is Jason Fox, aka Foxy, a former SAS demolitions expert and the most approachable of the directing staff on Who Dares Wins. (Directing staff, or DS, is how the instructors are addressed; they prefer this to Sadistic Inquisitors or Total Bastards.) Foxy puts another myth to bed, about the SAS and masculinity: \u201cMacho guys who come to prove a point about their hardness usually quit first, having proven nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cA course like this strips you down to your base level, which a lot of people don\u2019t want. They don\u2019t want to know what their real character is. The people who get through need to explore themselves, or something that\u2019s happened in their lives.\u201d Foxy joined the SAS because he disliked bullies, craved autonomy and was \u201cfed up with the pageantry and bollocks of the regular military\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38429f42e78a6d92f12b214bf97554c54eba6b49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38429f42e78a6d92f12b214bf97554c54eba6b49/690_22_1864_2330/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rhik Sammader undergoes SAS training\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew \u2018Ollie\u2019 Ollerton gives Rhik a few pointers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Noriega/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is a gentle individual, with a lisp. It\u2019s hard to remember, as we bounce down a dirt track in a truck, that he is a trained killer with exceptional military capabilities. Of the 350 men with whom he trained for SAS selection, only 14 made the cut. The other instructors are equally surprising. There\u2019s Matthew \u201cOllie\u201d Ollerton, who advises us on resisting interrogation. (Humanise yourself; practise the controlled release of information; never answer questions with a simple yes or no, because this can be manipulated into a recorded confession.) Ollie is referred to by another instructor as the \u201cshort-haired hippy\u201d, and at one point I spot a whiteboard on which he has written: \u201cWhen ego is lost, universality exists.\u201d Jason and Ollie run <a href=\"http://break-point.com\">Break-Point</a>, a company that teaches special forces techniques on corporate awaydays, which I would happily pay to watch.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Mark \u201cBilly\u201d Billingham, grizzled, blue-eyed and scary, the sort of man I imagine Gordon Ramsay fantasises about being. Billy is a spotter: crossing a line of leafcutter ants, he explains that humans are the only animals clumsy enough to break it. \u201cEverything else will step over. If you see a broken column, there\u2019s an enemy less than 18 to 20 minutes ahead of you \u2013 which is how long it takes the ants to reform.\u201d Billy teaches us that immersion in the jungle eventually makes your skin reek of urine, due to the production of ammonia, \u201cbut you start to blend into your surroundings. I can smell soap on a person half a kilometre away.\u201d He tells us his training turned around an unpromising childhood on a West Midlands council estate, where he was stabbed at the age of 11. \u201cSuddenly I\u2019m learning Serbo-Croat, performing throat surgery in the field, advising prime ministers.\u201d</p> <p>Who Dares Wins features no weekly eviction; in the first series, there was no overall winner. Contestants simply try to endure: evading capture, rescuing casualties, being subjected to surprise interrogations and mind games, supporting each other through pain. Like Billy, many are aiming to turn their lives around, or overcome traumatic experiences. One contestant in the new series signed up after his son was killed in Afghanistan, having recently begun his own SAS training. Another, a young British Muslim who has suffered racist attacks, wants to prove himself as a role model. Reformed gamblers and ex-gang members rub shoulders with posh boys who want to be shorn of their privilege. It\u2019s much more than vicarious thrills; whole life stories are being played out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6dfa2e2a5a59011b51d74293a992bb777358907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6dfa2e2a5a59011b51d74293a992bb777358907/18_18_3518_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhik Sammader undergoes SAS training\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019d like this to stop.

It\u2019s a strange thing to do, passively watch other people absorb punishment. How much further can shows such as this go? Are we headed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games\">The Hunger Games</a>? The SAS selection process was last year the subject of a judicial inquiry after three soldiers died on the same training march in 2013. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33512416\">The deaths were attributed to neglect</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/20/soldier-dies-on-training-exercise-in-brecon-beacons-mod-says\">another death followed in July this year,</a> on another SAS march in the Brecon Beacons. Tests that explore the limits of human endurance may be necessary for those who want to join an elite fighting unit; it\u2019s less obvious that civilians need go anywhere near them. The ultra-fitness craze is supremely at odds with the comforts of the first world: what are we compensating for?</p> <p>***</p> <p>I\u2019m marching through the jungle with a bag over my head, blackout goggles strapped over the top. It is 35C, the humidity 95%. I stumble over branches and snag myself on thorns, to the irritation of my captors. Every step feels irrationally as if I\u2019m being walked over the edge of a cliff; and then they make me jog faster, totally blind. I\u2019d like this to stop, I think. Semi-delirious, I no longer feel like myself and my thoughts run away with me. Maybe I should change my job. Or move house. Maybe I will run into a tree and be granted unconsciousness. The only way for a contestant voluntarily to withdraw is to remove their numbered armband and hold it in the air. Due to an acute lack of bicep, my armband has long since slipped off my arm and been lost. The feeling is akin to being chained in a dungeon with no safe word. (Probably.)</p> <p>Soon, that\u2019s almost exactly where I find myself, when I\u2019m dragged to a cell and made to hold various stress positions. These are unnatural poses in which one\u2019s bodyweight is balanced on single muscles or joints \u2013 holding a deep squat for long periods, for instance. Even keeping my arms above my head proves agonising after 10 minutes. Threats are whispered in Spanish while my body convulses with pain. I\u2019ve reached my limit. Today I have hung from ropes surrounded by hornets, holding my entire bodyweight until my arms crumpled. I\u2019ve scrambled up banks through thick vegetation. There are vines to support me when both legs fail, but they bring the palms up in stinging boils, prompting a tricky cost/benefit analysis. I have fallen down steep climbs, slid face first through enormous webs, and now I can\u2019t take any more.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I give nothing away. The two men seem impressed by my resilience. The reality is that my brain has checked out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At this point, I am interrogated by Billy and another soldier, in scary mode, screaming questions in my face. I can remember neither the mission I am supposed to be on (something about reconnaissance on a drug plant), nor the cover story we invented. I know I have some names and coordinates on a square of notepaper tucked under my testicles, which I don\u2019t want anyone to go looking for. Even when the hood is lifted and I find I am kneeling at the edge of a shallow grave, I give nothing away. The two men seem impressed by my resilience. The reality is that my brain has checked out. Yet I\u2019ve been here only one day; the real competitors endure this quasi-torture for three sleepless days, spending 10 days in all pushed to their limits; when Foxy, Ollie and Billy went through real SAS selection, they did this for six months.</p> <p>Reality TV can never replicate these former soldiers\u2019 experiences. In the first season of Who Dares Wins, Foxy revealed he was discharged from the SAS after suffering from PTSD. How does he feel about military training being mined for entertainment? \u201cIt\u2019s education and exploration first,\u201d he says, thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing people that our humanity gets us through tough moments, not about being tough. We\u2019re not invincible superheroes, and people can relate to that.

Back in the UK, after my arms and legs and face have recovered, I find myself mentally reliving the few moments when I didn\u2019t let myself down. Scaling a tower of logs and throwing myself into deep brown water from the top. Accurately recalling the location of our camp when questioned, out of breath and disoriented. Spying the kidnappers early, gaining a time advantage and having the confidence to brave the bush. Even if it was just for a minute, I freed myself. I am left with an entirely unexpected feeling: pride.</p> <p>A few months later, I am turning into one of the people I hate. Someone who does exercise, and even worse, talks about it. I\u2019ve started running, and swimming. I\u2019ve started running around my local park. On holiday in France I circumnavigated a lake, clearing 8km without realising it, then 10km. I\u2019m wondering about a half marathon. It helps clear negative thoughts, gives me a sense of self-reliance, a scale of achievements I can be in control of reaching.</p> <p>I finally understand the value of exercise, and all it took was a simulated kidnapping and some piranhas.

I found that fascinating. None of the parents said \u2018if we didn\u2019t have guns, this wouldn\u2019t have happened\u2019. They mentioned other factors such as poverty and environment. Sadly, gun crime and murder happen every single day and it becomes part of the fabric of everyday life.</p> <p><strong>The talk also made me ask myself what I can do to help.</strong> I wish I had asked Gary what more we can do as individuals.

  "<p>Last year a committee of county councillors from Lancashire dealt with one of the biggest planning applications ever put before any council, as they considered Cuadrilla\u2019s applications to drill and frack for shale gas in two rural locations between Preston and Blackpool.

Nor am I going to address the broader concerns about finding a new way to take fossil fuels from under the Earth to satisfy our need for energy.</p> <p>What I do know is that those councillors called upon to make the decision, locally elected representatives of the people of Lancashire, took their responsibilities in considering these applications very seriously and exercised their duty to the best of their abilities. And, crucially, that is what local democracy should be about: local people making decisions about the big issues that affect them.</p> <p>One of the key themes promoted by central government in recent years has been localism, promoting the advantages of devolving power to communities up and down the country.</p> <p>Here in Lancashire we have embraced that theme, working hard to support the local enterprise partnership in acting as a catalyst for economic growth and, despite a hugely complex local government landscape, making strides towards establishing a combined authority that will see councils working together with the promise of more control over issues that affect the county as a whole, such as skills, transport and the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ffc671bf40e9b66bb1c17800e2f4e83d4c6239d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ffc671bf40e9b66bb1c17800e2f4e83d4c6239d/0_117_3018_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid. \u2018The council asked the government to lift the covers off a heavily redacted report about the potential impact of shale-gas exploration on rural communities.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is right and proper that this country\u2019s planning regime enables applicants to appeal against decisions that go against them. And as part of that process, the secretary of state has long had the power to recover the final decision.</p> <p>However, it is easy to understand the frustration felt by those who opposed the applications, and now find their local representatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">overruled by the secretary of state</a> \u2013 a member of a government that has made very clear its determination to see shale gas exploited on a large scale.</p> <p>Throughout this process, Lancashire county council has sought to consider these applications on their merits, according to planning guidance and law. Moreover, county councillors have more than once united to acknowledge that \u2013 wherever each councillor stands on the safety of fracking or the use of fossil fuels \u2013 many of our residents have genuine concerns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is what local democracy should be about \u2013 local people making decisions about the big issues that affect them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is why the council has twice formally called on the government to establish industry-specific regulation. It is why the council asked the government to lift the covers off a heavily redacted report about the potential impact of shale-gas exploration on rural economies. And it is why the council asked the government not to take planning decisions out of local hands.</p> <p>Residents and businesses in Lancashire mobilised themselves on this issue; their councillors listened carefully to what they and the applicant had to say. The subsequent overturning of three of those councillors\u2019 decisions not only underlines the theory that localism applies only when it suits the centre. It highlights the chasm that exists between people seeking answers and a government that is either unwilling or unable to provide them.</p>",

An intriguing clash in the first half, but it arguably failed to really hit the heights we perhaps expected from two such potentially entertaining and attacking sides.</p> <p>Coach John Aloisi with some very strong opinions as to referee Evans\u2019 performance tonight \u2013 he\u2019s perhaps hoping he\u2019ll receive a week\u2019s grace fine-wise from FFA because he\u2019s really gone to town: \u201cI was very disappointed with the referee tonight; he\u2019s a professional contracted referee, but his performance just wasn\u2019t good enough\u201d.</p> <p>Brisbane perhaps aggrieved to see their captain McKay sent off in his landmark 200th game, but in all honesty they don\u2019t have too much basis for complaint. Yes, the first yellow was perhaps harsh, but to tug an opponent back knowing you\u2019ve been cautioned was pretty reckless from the skipper.</p> <p>Victory for their part looked bright from the outset, but perhaps didn\u2019t create enough for Besart Berisha, who had a quiet evening \u2013 especially on his return to Suncorp.</p> <p>Holman and Kristensen looked impressive for the hosts, so positive signs for them, with Tommy Oar\u2019s cameo also showing he appears to be back to his full powers.</p> <p>Some carelessness in possession however. A rusty first offering from both sides perhaps, but definitely solid signs that these two teams could feature prominently in the end-of-season run-in.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f77e90e4b0e4aaeaa8cde1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:54:16.275Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some pretty long faces on the Victory bench, but it\u2019s all smiles among Brisbane supporters.</p> <p>Your final thoughts on that dramatic finale?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f77e0ae4b03258bcac5421\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:52:42.049Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Brisbane Roar 1-1 Melbourne Victory</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that\u2019s that!</p> <p>You\u2019d be a brave Roar supporter to suggest you saw that coming!

  "<p>For most Americans the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis was all too obvious. The economy imploded, jobs disappeared, house prices collapsed. But coming to grips with the reason it was happening \u2013 the run on mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (AKA, CDOs), credit default swaps, synthetic derivatives, tranches \u2013 was not so easy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> The mumbo jumbo mattered \u2013 and that\u2019s what made it all the more infuriating. It was a banking crisis that only the insiders could decode.</p> <p> Even on the occasions (both then and since) when the bank CEOs have been dragged in front of Congress for what have become almost ritual attempts to humiliate and shame them, most of those efforts have been failures. Why? Partly because of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-havent-bankers-been-punished-just-read-these-insider-sec-emails\">the way the bankers dodged and dived</a>, of course. And partly because the issues involved just didn\u2019t make it easy for anyone to catch a dodging, weaving banker, advised by a canny, high-priced lawyer. </p> <p>It just wasn\u2019t that easy for some of the non-specialists on Senate and House committees to be as effective as they might have liked in pillorying the finance industry when the subject was the way in which traders had rigged the Libor rate (the interbank borrowing rate against which the interest rates on most loans are benchmarked), say, or the precise way in which a hedge fund participated in selecting investments in a derivative sold to a pension fund client. It\u2019s even hard to explain how some of that stuff affected ordinary Americans (even though it did \u2013 ultimately, and sometimes indirectly.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-financial-crash-letter-doj\">Elizabeth Warren is still mad about the financial crash, and we should be too</a> </p> </aside>  <p> So let\u2019s be grateful that the banks have finally provided us with a scandal that we can understand, and to the regulators, for (belatedly) addressing a real problem that too many Americans grapple with daily. </p> <p> The Wells Fargo mess is the poster child for it all. Last month, the bank \u2013 one of the oldest in the country, with a tradition dating back to the Pony Express \u2013 disclosed that it would fork over $185m in penalties to regulators after an audit discovered that employees opened as many as 2m deposit and credit accounts in customers\u2019 names but without their consent. </p> <p> Testifying before Congress, John Stumpf, the bank\u2019s CEO and chairman, made much of the breach of trust on the part of more than 5,000 employees who opened the accounts, in an attempt to meeting sales quotas, either earning bonuses or simply holding on to their jobs. While initially he backed away from suggestions that he himself might have been held accountable, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/wells-fargo-sales-tactics-investigation-john-stumpf\">he discovered he will share some of their pain</a>: independent directors announced they will implement salary and bonus clawbacks, and Stumpf\u2019s own compensation will be on hold while the directors investigate.</p> <p> But Wells isn\u2019t the only venerable Wall Street name to run afoul of regulators in recent days. Morgan Stanley, too, appears to have been putting pressure on its brokers to engage in \u201cdishonest and unethical conduct\u201d, according to the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, pushing them to cross-sell products.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-sell.asp\">Cross-selling</a> is at the heart of both the Wells Fargo and the Morgan Stanley scandals, and unlike CDOs and credit default swaps, it\u2019s something that any bank customer can understand all too easily. If you\u2019ve ever walked into a bank \u2013 or talked to a bank representative on the phone \u2013 and had him suggest that you might want to consider opening a new account or that a different product might be just perfect for your needs, when you really just called to reset your pin or check your balance, well, you\u2019ve encountered cross-selling.</p> <p> There\u2019s nothing wrong with it as a business strategy. In fact, it\u2019s eminently logical, and can even be good for customers, to make them aware of products or services that might be out there and fit their needs. But it only works well when it\u2019s done carefully and on a customized basis. </p> <p> As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32b989ac-870f-11e6-a75a-0c4dce033ade\">retail banking in the United States has struggled</a> in the current low interest rate environment, with too few creditworthy customers eager to increase their borrowing and help banks boost their profits, institutions like Wells Fargo increasingly viewed selling more products as the best way to increase earnings. If they couldn\u2019t make more on the same number of products, well, they\u2019d just increase the number of products. And so they put in place the kind of bizarrely high targets that prompted those \u201crogue\u201d employees to begin opening fake accounts. Even after they were aware of what was happening, those targets remained in place; even when Stumpf first testified to Congress, the targets were still (theoretically, at least) what Wells Fargo bankers had to hit each day/week/month.</p> <p> You <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/finance-big-short/420903/\">don\u2019t need a Jenga game</a>, or Anthony Bourdain cooking a fish stew, Margot Robbie languishing in a bubble bath, or any other tortured metaphor, to explain the concept and just what is wrong with this picture. </p> <p> Similarly, Morgan Stanley allegedly crossed the lines <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-morganstanley-massachusetts-idUSKCN1231KD\">by running cross-selling contests for brokers in five offices</a> in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The brokers could win as much as $5,000 for convincing customers to take out as many as 30 loans against securities portfolios. Although the firm\u2019s own rules banned the contests, the compliance office didn\u2019t figure out what was going on for a year, until the end of 2014. Even then, the contests didn\u2019t stop until April 2015, according to the complaint filed by William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, the contests generated $24m in new loans for Morgan Stanley, Galvin said. </p> <p> A spokesman for Morgan Stanley has said the complaint is without merit and that the bank plans to defend itself vigorously. The loans were only open after discussing the product with each client, he added.</p> <p> That distinguishes it from Wells Fargo, whose clients had no idea that accounts were being opened in their name. On the other hand, did Morgan Stanley\u2019s clients know that their brokers were competing \u2013 and being paid \u2013 to open these new loan accounts? That the reason they were being offered the product might have as much or more to do with the broker\u2019s own financial wellbeing as with their own real needs? (Did they really need a new loan? Or the risk associated with taking out a loan against a securities portfolio when the market is near what seems likely to be its peak?) I suspect not.</p> <p> Thomas Curry, the US comptroller of the currency, has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-regulation-idUSKCN11L2U0\">warned other banks to review their own cross-selling practices</a> and has told Congress that his own staff will be evaluating what the largest banks are up to in this respect. It\u2019s about time. Hopefully, he\u2019ll report back with the answers. At least, when he does, we\u2019ll all understand what he\u2019s talking about. At the end of the day, it\u2019s really not much different than the high-pressure telephone sales guy who simply will not hang up or go away. Only because it\u2019s your banker who\u2019s putting you on the spot, you\u2019re a particularly vulnerable kind of captive audience who can\u2019t just hang up. </p>",
  "<p>A push by the shipping and oil industries for a five-year delay to curbs on toxic sulphur emissions would cause an extra 200,000 premature deaths from lung cancer and heart disease, according to an unpublished International Maritime Organisation (IMO) study.</p> <p> Fatalities from illnesses such as asthma were not covered by the leaked paper, which was based on shipping satellite data and modelling work. </p> <p>The shipping industry is by far the world\u2019s biggest emitter of sulphur with SOx levels in heavy fuel oils <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-shipping-regulation-imo-idUSKCN1240KF\">up to 3,500 times higher</a> than those in current European diesel standards for vehicles. A single large cruise ship can reportedly burn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/21/the-worlds-largest-cruise-ship-and-its-supersized-pollution-problem\">as much fuel as whole towns</a>, and emit more sulphur than 7m cars.</p> <p>At the end of October, an IMO meeting in London will decide whether to cap the sulphur content of shipping fuels by 2020 or 2025. Current levels can reach 3.5% but the cap would limit them to 0.5%.</p> <p>The 2020 deadline faces fierce resistance from the oil and gas industry association, <a href=\"http://www.ipieca.org/\">IPIECA</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bimco.org/\">Bimco</a>, a global shipping group, which argue that there is not enough low-sulphur fuel available to meet the global demand that the measure would spur.</p> <p>The EU has thrown its weight behind 2020, unilaterally imposing the new IMO standard from then. With China enforcing similar emissions control zones, the new benchmark for 2020 is thought likely to pass, although the US and large flag states\u2019 positions remain wildcards.</p> <p>James Corbett, one of the report\u2019s lead authors, told the Guardian that any slippage on the 2020 start date risked grave consequences.</p> <p> \u201cAn IMO policy implemented on time in 2020 could reduce the health burden on coastal communities, particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe inverse is also true. A delay would ensure that health impacts from sulphur emissions persisted in coastal communities that are exposed, where shipping lanes are most intense and communities most densely populated.\u201d</p> <p> Egypt, Panama, Japan, India, Singapore, the Philippines and China would be among the countries hardest hit, Corbett added.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Sveinung Oftedal, Norway\u2019s lead negotiator at the IMO, said that domestic health concerns had now overtaken fears about the acidifying effects that sulphur has on Scandinavia\u2019s lakes and rivers.</p> <p> \u201cAir pollution from shipping is not just a local or regional, but a global, problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is whether we can really continue to accept its effects, and the answer is: no, we cannot. The 2020 deadline is needed and it is achievable.\u201d</p> <p> But resentment in the beleaguered shipping trade is unmistakeable, and a sign of future fights to come in the IMO over shipping\u2019s CO2 emissions, which roughly equal those from aviation.</p> <p> \u201cMost shipping companies are not turkeys voting for Christmas,\u201d an industry source said. \u201cThey\u2019re under the impression that a decision to delay to 2025 would be of collective economic benefit. In the real world, shipowners are bleeding money. There is total depression in the industry.\u201d</p> <p> Thousands of container ships belonging to Hanjin, south Korea\u2019s biggest shipping firm, were left <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37241727\">adrift on the world\u2019s oceans</a> carrying a \u00a314bn cargo, after the firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/hanjin-shipping-bankruptcy-causes-turmoil-in-global-sea-freight\">filed for bancruptcy</a> last month. </p> <p> The International Chambers of Shipping (ICS) says that imposing the new benchmark in 2020 would cost industry an additional $50-100bn a year, owing to the cost of low-sulphur fuels.</p> <p> Ships today mostly run on cheap blends of the residues and remainders left over from the refining and distillation of crude oil for aircraft jet fuel and automobile diesel.</p> <p> Bimco argues that a premature move to low-sulphur fuels could have knock-on inflationary effects for other fuels, as increased diesel demand overwhelms supply.</p> <p> Lars Robert Pedersen, Bimco\u2019s deputy secretary-general, told the Guardian: \u201cQuite frankly, if the IMO decides to ignore these very concrete facts, ships will start to use other fuel streams and there will then obviously be a shortage in those streams and a potential disruption in the flow of energy to supply world markets.\u201d</p> <p> Corbett estimates the total cost of the measure at $30bn, compared to a value of seaborne trade approaching <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-southchinasea-idUSKCN0WA0ER\">$5tn in the South China Sea alone</a>. Supporters of an early sulphur cap say that its effect on commodity prices such as shoes or bananas would be little more than a few cents.</p> <p> Crucially, a second IMO report seen by the Guardian finds that enough refineries will be available in 2020 to guarantee the future availability of a low-sulphur fuel supply for all the world\u2019s ships.</p> <p> \u201cIn all scenarios, the refinery sector has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of marine fuels with a sulphur content of 0.5% m/m or less ... to meet demand for these products, while also meeting demand for non-marine fuels,\u201d it says.</p> <p> A capacity shortage in 2020 would be the only grounds for IMO delegates to delay the proposal, under its terms of reference, which some fear could then be extended indefinitely.</p> <p> In a reflection of differing opinions in the sea freight trade, the ICS is neutral on the timeline for phasing out sulphur, while calling for a speedy resolution of the issue.</p> <p> The oil industry too is ambivalent. One analyst with close knowledge of the issue said: \u201cMajor oil companies such as Shell and BP don\u2019t have a problem with a move to cleaner fuel in the shipping sector because they have advanced refineries which could sell higher value fuels and increase their revenues and potentially, their profits.\u201d</p> <p> Later this month, a global CO2 data collection system for ships will be launched. Neither shipping nor aviation firms are covered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">Paris climate agreement</a>, although the ICS has called for the UN\u2019s climate pledging system to be extended to the industry. </p>",

  "<p>Theresa May values \u201cthe spirit of citizenship\u201d.

No, I\u2019m talking about the concrete, legal citizenship that I have enjoyed since the age of 14. In 2019 it will most likely go up in smoke. </p> <p>One of the reasons the 23 June <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">referendum</a> was a fraud is that what was posed as a simple question of \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d in fact hid a multitude of other decisions. Though it wasn\u2019t framed this way, it served as an opportunity for a simple majority of voters (in fact, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information\">37% of the electorate</a>) to decide to strip the entire population of EU citizenship. This was mass deprivation of rights of abode and equal treatment on a scale not seen since the age of decolonisation. Legal scholar Dimitry Kochenov <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/LEQS%20Discussion%20Paper%20Series/LEQSPaper111.pdf\">calls it</a> \u201cone of the most radical losses in the value of a particular nationality in recent history\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\">Zero chance EU citizens in UK will keep same rights post-Brexit, says expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You might think that this is all done and dusted. I agree that there\u2019s no going back, no second referendum. But the issue of EU citizenship isn\u2019t quite closed \u2013 or rather, it needn\u2019t be. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/\">EU citizen</a> was created in 1993. It is a person who, across the union, cannot be discriminated against on the basis of nationality; can move and reside freely; can vote for and stand as a candidate in European parliament and municipal elections; and is entitled to consular protection outside the EU by European diplomats. More than that, citizenship established a identity, separate from nationality, shared between individuals in the union. A common bond of the kind that Theresa May otherwise admires. In the 23 years since, cultural, political, academic and social exchange has become the norm. What might have initially seemed like a paper exercise has become durable and meaningful to millions. Eurosceptics hate it, no doubt. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real. </p> <p>Neither was it an arrangement entered into lightly. It was the result of a treaty, signed, incidentally, by a Conservative government. A treaty is an international promise, and a promise to one\u2019s own people. There was no suggestion at the time that the rights granted would be taken away again. Mass stripping of citizenship had previously only occurred when an alternative citizenship was created, and often following war: for example, when Algeria won independence from France, and Algerian nationality came into being.</p> <p>As Kochenov points out, Europe has had a flexible attitude towards citizenship in the past. It has had to, as a result of the massive changes in the territories governed by EU members. That means there is some hope that something of the \u201cspirit\u201d of 1993 could be salvaged. Or there was, until very recently. <br></p> <p>The only way these rights could be maintained for British people would be for the UK to agree some kind of \u201cassociate nationality\u201d with the union of which it is no longer a member. With political will, that could be achieved. However, it would require reciprocal benefits, most likely equivalent rights for EU nationals in Britain. In apparently opting for \u201chard Brexit\u201d, without freedom of movement, May has made any such deal extremely unlikely. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/what-does-brexit-mean-for-eu-citizens-in-britain-and-brits-in-europe\">What does Brexit mean for EU citizens in Britain \u2013 and Brits in Europe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was bad enough that 37% of eligible voters were able to make an irreversible decision about the status of everyone else. The prime minister has now compounded that error, and drastically narrowed the horizons of this, and future generations of Britons. </p> <p>Many of the arguments over how to conduct Brexit are made in transactional terms. Can we swap security cooperation for financial passporting rights? The right of EU nationals to stay put for lower trade tariffs?

Those fears have helped knock the pound sharply lower on foreign exchanges.</p> <p>Liam Fox, international trade secretary, insisted the government was \u201cworking hard to ensure the UK remains an attractive place with which to trade and to help UK companies take advantage of the global demand for British goods and services\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile some sectors continue to perform well, there is still some way to go to ensure that we are exporting as much as we could and should do, so the government will continue to encourage and support the wider range of exporting we require to boost our national prosperity,\u201d Fox said.<br></p> <p>But businesses and lobby groups say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-exports-small-medium-sized-business-sme\">the government should do more</a> if it wants to come anywhere close to a goal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-exports-target-manufacturers\">almost double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020</a> \u2013 a target it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/17/uk-miss-2020-export-target-warn-mps\">widely expected to miss</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor\u2019s autumn statement needs to include measures that support businesses looking to access new export markets, including expanding support for trade fairs and missions, to at least match that provided by our competitors,\u201d said Mike Spicer, director of research and economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.</p> <p>The ONS estimated <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/aug2016\">the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services at \u00a34.7bn</a> in August, a widening of \u00a32.5bn from July. Exports increased by \u00a30.1bn and imports increased by \u00a32.6bn.<br></p> <p>The deficit on trade in goods alone was \u00a312.1bn, widening by \u00a32.6bn from July and worse than the \u00a311.3bn gap forecast by economists in the Reuters poll. The deficit on trade in goods with EU countries hit a record high of \u00a38.4bn as imports from the bloc rose 5.1% and exports fell 0.6%.</p> <p>The two reports on trade and industrial production follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/services-sector-growth-brexit-vote-uk\">signs in surveys that businesses had rebounded from the initial shock of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU</a>. Statisticians caution against over-interpreting any one month\u2019s figures, however.</p> <p>The data will give Bank of England policymakers more to chew over when they meet next month to decide whether to cut interest rates further from the already record low of 0.25%. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee reduced borrowing costs and expanded an electronic money-printing scheme in August to shore up confidence after the Brexit vote. <br></p> <p>Commenting on the latest official figures, Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cWhile these figures break the recent run of positive data for activity in the third quarter, the overall strength of recent data has probably lowered the chance of further monetary easing from the MPC.</p> <p>\u201cBut committee members have previously warned against over-interpreting incoming data \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/bank-of-england-too-pessimistic-brexit-vote-deputy-governor-ben-broadbent\">including Ben Broadbent in his speech this week</a> \u2013 so we still think that there is a decent chance that the bank rate will be cut to 0.10% in November.\u201d </p>",

This is a temporary reprieve for the Bight \u2013 an area of exceptional marine significance on the coastline of South and Western Australia, where 85% of the species in the shallows can be found nowhere else in the world. The region\u2019s unique biodiversity means that the impact of a major oil spill would likely be particularly harmful with a nearly 100% chance of oil reaching the shore of the Bight national park, according to BP\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/bp-modelling-great-australian-bight-oil-spill-new-south-wales\">modeling</a>. </p> <p>Concerns are exacerbated by a lack of transparency.

The <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060041053/feed\">regulator</a> in the US has asked for help from a number of agencies, including <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060041053/feed\">Nasa</a>.

Serious questions remain as to how the high-risk, high-cost, and controversial Bight has risen to the top of the list. More broadly, BP\u2019s and its peers\u2019 reliance on frontier oil projects signals structural problems for their business models. To satisfy shareholders, the company needs to find more oil to maintain its share price in increasingly risky, dangerous and remote places such as the Bight, the deep waters off Brazil and the tar sands of Canada. However, a low oil price, flattening demand, and global economic uncertainty make these projects financially unjustifiable in the short term. And increasingly ambitious action on climate change could choke off their future viability. </p> <p>BP\u2019s inadequate response to an accident in the North Sea and its push to the Bight merely underline how poorly equipped they are to manage both an oil spill and the future energy needs of a world turning away from oil. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Tom Hanks has said that he fears widespread public and political ignorance is the biggest threat to civilisation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-hanks-ignorance-is-one-935792\">According to the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Hanks was speaking in Florence to promote the latest Dan Brown adaptation, Inferno, in which his character must use clues from Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy to prevent the spread of a malicious disease designed to halve the world\u2019s population. Hanks said: \u201cIgnorance is one of our greatest threats \u2013 the idea of being able to solve complex issues with simplistic solutions. </p> <p>\u201cJust think about what happened in the Middle East,\u201d he continued. \u201cOr about the decision that we Americans find ourselves having to take every four years.\u201d</p> <p>Hanks called on voters to educate themselves and to try to prevent the sort of desperate scenarios depicted in the film. </p> <p>\u201cThere are any number of places you could go on the planet Earth and the environment is hellacious and the people are held in slavery and there\u2019s any number of degrees of misery that are in fact created by ourselves one way or another,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the concept of Inferno, to me, is one that can be avoided, but only if everybody understands what the problem is and works to avoid it.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>\u201cI still remember the shocked silence the first time I brought up the issue of menstruation,\u201d said Archana Patkar at Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/15/event-maintaining-the-momentum-for-the-sdgs\">recent Guardian panel discussion</a>. </p> <p>She was describing working with colleagues in education looking at reasons for the dropout of girls from school at around ages 11-13. \u201c[There were] a lot of discussions on teacher quality, classrooms, inadequacy of material, inappropriateness of curricular, but nobody was talking about what happens to girls at that point,\u201d said Patkar.</p> <p>Now there is recognition that starting their periods, and inadequate toilets and sanitation supplies, is a huge factor in girls missing out on their education. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/may/28/we-need-to-talk-about-periods-why-is-menstruation-still-holding-girls-back\">one in 10 African girls skip school during menstruation</a>, and some drop out entirely.

  "<p>\u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be an architect\u201d isn\u2019t something you often hear in the classroom. Shrinking school budgets \u2013 combined with exam pressures and a over-crowded curriculum \u2013 means there just isn\u2019t enough time for young people to learn about the creative fields and their related careers. When the National Society for Education in Art and Design <a href=\"http://www.nsead.org/downloads/survey.pdf\">surveyed its members</a> last year, it found that 38% of teachers working at key stage 2 believed their school was allocating less time for art and design. At secondary level, far fewer people are continuing their studies of creative subjects: entries to design and technology GCSE have <a href=\"http://www.baccforthefuture.com/press-coverage--news\">fallen by almost a third</a> (27%) in five years.</p> <p>But in today\u2019s world of technology overload, it\u2019s important we connect children with their physical environment and help them to understand how the things around us are made. Doing so allows children to develop creative and problem-solving skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/06/how-to-teach-architecture\">How to teach ... architecture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way to get children inspired about design is to set a creative brief. These help bring learning to life, and can form a good alternative to a traditional homework exercise. Here are some tips on getting started.</p> <p><strong>Mission possible<br></strong>I like to call my design briefs missions. Most children are familiar with that word from books, films or video games. When you send children on a mission, they have an objective and can start visualising the end result. It\u2019s the process between the two that\u2019s the important bit, of course. That\u2019s where the learning comes.</p> <p><strong>Start with an ideas generation exercise<br></strong>Before children start making, it\u2019s important they sketch their initial ideas. This is not about being artistic \u2013 it\u2019s more about getting ideas down on a page. Keep things simple with a pencil and paper \u2013 no materials or computer at this stage or they may get carried away with the tools rather than their own ideas.</p> <p><strong>Go hunting for design materials <br></strong>If children want to build a physical structure, encourage them to go beyond the usual paper and plasticine. Suggest children try to find something unexpected at home \u2013 as long as they ask permission from their parents before using it.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t be scared of the technology <br></strong>I\u2019ve been working in 3D software for children for six years and the scene has changed massively. The programmes have become much more user friendly and also more widely available. Programmes such as <a href=\"http://www.123dapp.com/design\">Autodesk 3D Design</a> are free, and easy to use and you can find our <a href=\"http://buildyourownpavilion.serpentinegalleries.org/teachers/autodesk-123d-design-tutorial-serpentine-pavilion-2016/\">tutorial videos</a> on the Serpentine Galleries website.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/jan/12/teach-drawing-illustration\">How to teach ... drawing and illustration</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A little guidance goes a long way<br></strong>Encourage children to think freely and independently by emphasising no idea is a bad idea. This is something I teach my students at university, too. At the beginning of a project, anything is possible. It\u2019s only later on you start filtering out the elements that don\u2019t work. If children make a mistake, encourage them to sketch over it. In the Serpentine Galleries\u2019 <a href=\"http://buildyourownpavilion.serpentinegalleries.org/\">Build Your Own Pavilion workshops</a>, which I facilitate across the country, we don\u2019t even give out rubbers. That way, children learn how to adapt their ideas, rather than just starting again.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t forget to set a deadline<br></strong>This is another real-world element of any design brief. It\u2019s important for children to learn the notion of a deadline and that you can\u2019t work on one thing forever. Set the timeframe from the start of the exercise and given them clear reminders throughout, while also encouraging them to stay calm.</p> <ul> <li>Looking for a creative brief to set your students?

  "<p>\u201cHer books\u2019 sensational success made the search for her identity inevitable. It also left financial clues that speak by themselves.\u201d So writes Claudio Gatti in the New York Review of Books. We know that money talks, but personal bank accounts have nothing to say for themselves unless a journalist is doing the ventriloquism.</p> <p>These accounts weren\u2019t the Panama Papers or bungs or bribes or secret payments to secret mistresses. The woman in question wasn\u2019t a politician or a Berlusconi-style businessman. She&#xa0;paid her taxes. She wished to live quietly and get on with her work. She is the writer we know as Elena Ferrante.</p> <p>Gatti tells us that a decade ago a team at La Sapienza University, Rome, analysed the books using software programs and decided that they were written by Domenico Starnone \u2013 a&#xa0;writer who happens to be the husband of the woman who is and is&#xa0;not Elena Ferrante.</p> <p>That must have been a relief to those who still want to believe that Branwell Bront\u00eb wrote everything for his mousy sisters, or that Willy really did write Colette\u2019s masterpieces, and that only a man can write about women \u2013 or write about anything, which is, after all, the basis of the literature myth. JK Rowling knew boys wouldn\u2019t read her books if she was called Joanne. Later, wanting a&#xa0;fresh start from both Harry Potter and from herself, she chose the name Robert Galbraith \u2013 definitely male, and soon unmasked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/elena-ferrante-literary-sensation-nobody-knows\">Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The not-so-wise men at La Sapienza (note that Wisdom is female \u2013 Sofia is her Greek and medieval incarnations) could not eliminate gender bias from&#xa0;the analysis of their software program, and I am sure that we will soon hear that Signor Starnone is the \u201creal\u201d author, by marriage, of the Neapolitan Quartet.</p> <p>Why? Because at the bottom of this so-called investigation into Ferrante\u2019s identity is an obsessional outrage at the success of a writer \u2013 female \u2013 who decided to write, publish and promote her books on her own terms.</p> <p>It is only 150 years in the UK and 110 years in Italy since women were able to own property, earn and keep their own money, and stand under the law equal to men. Women got the vote in Italy late \u2013 1946 \u2013 and Italy is still a Catholic country with strong patriarchial attitudes towards women. Gatti is no doubt a secular journalist, but listening to him talk about his scoop on the BBC \u2013 his pompous unthinking sexism, his desire to discredit the creator of both Ferrante and Ferrante\u2019s books, what he calls her \u201clies\u201d about her mother, tells us a lot more about him than about his subject. Which is not a surprise, because this is all about him. This is his shot at the limelight. Claudio Gatti is a nobody with too much time on his hands. Elena Ferrante is a writer with worlds at her fingertips.</p> <p>And I go on calling Elena Ferrante Elena Ferrante because that is who she wishes to be. She has been very clear about why she has chosen to be two people \u2013 one of whom can be known through her books, and one of whom cannot be known at all. Writing is an act of splitting \u2013 like mercury. Writers are multiple personalities. This is clear when we create other characters \u2013 it can be confusing when the character we create is ourselves.</p> <p>My first novel <em>Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit</em> uses a character called Jeanette. I like to read myself as a fiction as well as a fact. It is creatively freeing. Henry Miller, Philip Roth, Paul Auster and Milan Kundera have all used themselves as their own aliases. When men do it, it is called meta-fiction and part of their playful experiment. When women do it, it is called autobiography.</p> <p>Karl Ove Knausgaard writes about himself with monomaniacal fixation. Yet this does not reduce him \u2013 it expands him, because his claim to be his own artwork is accepted. Antony Gormley uses his own body as the cast for his forms. Tracey Emin has determined her own space in much the same way \u2013 as subject and object \u2013 but her reception has been very different. Women who say, as Beckett did, I and&#xa0;Not I, this is me and not me, this&#xa0;is&#xa0;myself but it is someone else, are&#xa0;driven back from the larger open spaces of the artwork to the smaller spaces of the self.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gatti has swivelled the lens so that we are looking at the writer instead of looking at the work in its own right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is exactly what has happened to Ferrante. By forcing us to concentrate on biography and bank accounts, on the writer and not the work, Gatti has invaded the space that belongs to the work. He has swivelled the lens so that we are looking at the writer through his eyes instead of looking at the work in its own right. He justifies this by telling us that \u201cFerrante has relinquished her right to disappear behind her books.\u201d</p> <p>This is the \u201cshort skirt \u2013 she was asking for it\u201d \u2013 argument. According to Gatti, inventing a life for the fictitious Ferrante, especially inventing a mother, is lying; in fact it is publicity seeking \u2013 so it\u2019s double lying, because she says she doesn\u2019t want publicity \u2013 therefore she deserves all she gets.</p> <p>In the Facebook world where privacy is an anachronism and nothing is real unless it is photographed and uploaded, Ferrante\u2019s desire to remain hidden in plain sight needed only one&#xa0;response: respect. Gatti did not respect&#xa0;Ferrante, and neither did the&#xa0;New York Review of Books. This&#xa0;is&#xa0;Hello! magazine journalism.</p> <p>The stripping and parading of Elena&#xa0;Ferrante is violent and crude. Creatively it might destroy her (she has&#xa0;said she cannot write without anonymity), so it is a deliberately malicious act, too. Rightly, around the&#xa0;world, most people seem disgusted&#xa0;by what has happened.</p> <p>There\u2019s an essay by TS Eliot from&#xa0;1919 called \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent\u201d. He talks about personality \u2013 and how creative work is&#xa0;a&#xa0;means of escaping personality. This is&#xa0;the I Not I that is difficult to explain. You lose yourself, yet you are most clearly yourself in the creative act. It\u2019s&#xa0;the Indian rope trick.</p> <p>Ferrante claimed the freedom of I&#xa0;Not I. I hope she will know, in time, that no one can take that from her by force, as Gatti has tried to do. It is her right to claim it, her right to keep it. Whoever else she is, she will always be&#xa0;Elena Ferrante.</p>",

We deal with new and growing businesses every day, and the founders are overwhelmingly rational, competent and highly experienced. Sure, this can often go hand in hand with a mindset that others find hard to follow. Entrepreneurs are not fond of abiding by the rules, but it\u2019s this bravery, creativity and energy that enables them to challenge convention successfully. And on the whole, this is rooted in the urge to change the world for the better in some way. </p> <p>Far from being rudderless or narcissistic, most entrepreneurs are driven by a clear vision and solid purpose. </p> <p>The founders we help to raise finance to grow are more likely to be in their late 30s, rather than 20-something hipsters. Many come from senior roles in financial services, consultancy or technology, and are equipped with the strategic and leadership skills that are pivotal to success in any industry. Many already have an expert understanding of the field \u2013 Ajan Reginald of biotech firm Celixir, for example, was previously global head of emerging technologies at healthcare company Roche. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard starting a business ... there\u2019s nowhere to hide and it takes a special type of person to do it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re also seeing more second-time entrepreneurs pitching on our platform, such as Tom Bloomfield who launched challenger bank Monzo after co-founding GoCardless or Alex Zivoder who raised \u00a34m for fintech innovator goHenry, after scaling companies like Expedia, viagogo and Lynda.com. </p> <p>Startup founders have to be a little bit crazy to see things differently, chuck in a well-paid job and embrace uncertainty and sacrifice. And it\u2019s a tough position to be in. Entrepreneurs need courage and determination to take risks, be creative and solve difficult problems \u2013 and this may sometimes manifest itself in behaviour that could be seen as impulsive or frantic. But this should be embraced, not knocked. It\u2019s hard starting a business, very hard; there\u2019s nowhere to hide and it takes a special type of person to do it.</p> <p>If an entrepreneur lacks experience in the industry they\u2019re launching into, or is a first-time entrepreneur, the best way to channel that energy in an effective way is to surround themselves with an expert team. Making mistakes is not something that should be seen as a negative \u2013 if you\u2019re not making mistakes, you\u2019re not taking risks, and changing the status quo is impossible without doing that.</p> <p>Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh, founder of Sugru, developed the mouldable glue she invented with the help of two retired scientists.

Many would hire experienced employees if they could afford to, but that often isn\u2019t an option. There\u2019s nothing wrong with nurturing and empowering young people to progress and develop. As the business matures, this will create the foundation of a strong, diverse leadership culture \u2013 at Crowdcube we have an ex-intern sitting on the management team alongside someone from Google, who joined us later.</p> <p>Creating a culture in which new enterprise can flourish means not leaving everything to the steady, risk-averse \u201cadults\u201d. Entrepreneurs won\u2019t get everything right all the time. But maybe taking a shot, getting it wrong and reacting quickly is better than being ultra-conservative or overly precise. </p> <p>Perfection is often described as the enemy of progress; well, entrepreneurs are gloriously imperfect, even the most celebrated ones. But they undeniably move us forward and change the world we live in. We should respect those who give it a crack.

That has been brought into question.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg was more measured, saying that after the talks the government would like to see \u201cgreat harmonisation\u201d with renewable energy targets and a \u201ctruly national system\u201d \u2013 but he also acknowledged that the review process he had set in train was a Coag process, and he said the states were not budging.</p> <p>The communique noted \u201cthe importance of integrating energy and climate policy at the federal level and the federal government\u2019s commitment to the Paris targets\u201d.</p> <p>At Friday\u2019s meeting, Koutsantonis also reached agreement with his New South Wales counterpart Anthony Roberts to develop a new interconnector between the two states to increase stability in the system.</p>",
  "<p>A Congolese king has introduced a specialised Wi-Fi network to a remote island after testing it in a similarly rugged and windswept environment: an estate in Scotland managed by a representative of Queen Elizabeth. </p> <p>An estimated 250,000 people live the island of Idjwi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has been referred to as a \u201cforgotten population\u201d by the world\u2019s media.</p> <p>There is no broadband infrastructure. Its benefits would be limited in any case: fewer than 10 homes on the island in the centre of Lake Kivu have a computer, while the cost of 3G and smartphones mean mobile internet is too expensive for most citizens, many of whom live on just a dollar a day.</p> <p>But since May, 10,000 islanders have been able to access the free Wi-Fi being beamed across the lake by a powerful antenna. It\u2019s a system otherwise known as \u201cmesh Wi-Fi\u201d, which starts with one connection \u2013 in this case in the town of Bukavu on the mainland 40 miles (60km) away \u2013 and then the signal is transmitted by a series of masts.</p> <p>The new Wi-Fi supplies a kiosk in Bugarula, the island\u2019s biggest village, which has five tablets and four computers. People can also pick up a signal within 100 metres of each mast. Unlike broadband, mesh Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t require cables to be installed and people can make <a href=\"https://www.fjordnet.com/workdetail/bringing-the-internet-to-africas-forgotten-island/\">homemade antennae</a> out of scrap metal to share the connection.</p> <p>The system was recently heralded Kevin Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine, as a <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/06/kevin-kelly-wants-people-to-embrace-the-futures-technological-promise/\">technology to \u201cshape our future</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffefe765eeee5b946909369fca8b61665f944487\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffefe765eeee5b946909369fca8b61665f944487/183_0_1317_790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Equipment for mesh wifi arrives\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Equipment for mesh Wi-Fi arrives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fjord/First Light</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Scottish test </h2> <p>Fjord, the <a href=\"https://www.fjordnet.com/\">innovation consultancy company based in the UK</a> and <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.ensemblepourladifference.org_&amp;d=DQMFaQ&amp;c=eIGjsITfXP_y-DLLX0uEHXJvU8nOHrUK8IrwNKOtkVU&amp;r=DGERBqedq3OrbUodKhBUitwxQWhqUyneBjUS1YGQ0FI&amp;m=uSXO7EHXwagS3z07Pof-kXavTRH1pr9ZrQG3MDLG2YM&amp;s=DevzplHY-aVZbxwheKhb6ZdCrhFkMs6gyJhwu1l1N4M&amp;e=\">Ensemble Pour La Difference</a>, a social incubator based in Bukavu that are delivering the project for the Idjwi king Gervais Rubenga, wanted to test the system before shipping it out to east Africa, which is where the Brahan estate near Inverness comes in.</p> <p>It was the ideal testing ground, thanks to the remoteness and limited interference from other signals, and the fact that <a href=\"https://www.fjordnet.com/workdetail/bringing-the-internet-to-africas-forgotten-island/\">the nephew of Lord-Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty</a>, who manages the land, had already set up a mesh Wi-Fi system for her community.</p> <p>The wind, rain and terrain were similar too, so much so that Patrick Byamungu, who leads the project in Idjwi for Ensemble Pour la Diff\u00e9rence and travelled to Scotland for the test, says he could have been back in DRC. \u201cIt helped that the people were kind, friendly and keen to help,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After successfully setting up a mesh system that delivered fast internet, the Fjord team drew up a plan to install a tower that would take the internet from Bukavu across the lake directly to the centre of the island. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/173611176\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/173611176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The system is tested in Scotland.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Up and running in May, the new connection has has brought many changes to Idjwi.

This is information that previously could have taken weeks to reach the island, explains Byamung, who lives in Bukavu but travels to Idjwi at least twice a month. </p> <p>Euan Millar, who is leading the project for Fjord, is also hopeful islanders may escape internet censorship imposed on the rest of the country. \u201cThe government is very controlling.

The king and the UK team want to keep basic health information and news available free by charging residents $2 a month to browse Facebook, YouTube and other sites.</p> <p>For Fjord, the ultimate goal of the project is to hand full ownership to the residents. However, while they are introducing new technologies \u201cit will take a little time for people to find their feet\u201d, Byamungu says.</p> <p>While Byamungu says that accurate weather information has been the most immediate and obvious benefit of the project, he has also been encouraged to see everyone from young people to traders and teachers connecting with the world. \u201cWhen I travel I see that everyone has this luxury, it should be the same on the island,\u201d he says. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Shawn Stussy, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.stussy.co.uk/\">eponymous clothing brand</a>, started his business selling surfboards and T-shirts on Long Beach, California in 1980. Stussy has since grown to be a figurehead for what is now seen as a predominantly urban genre.</p> <p>By 2011, the global streetwear industry was valued at an eye-watering <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soletron-streetwear-idUSTRE7BL1XK20111223\">$60bn (\u00a347bn) by Reuters</a>. But just what is it about cities and their streets that makes them such effective bases for a successful brand? </p> <p>By highlighting the subcultures and cities from which they have emerged, streetwear brands anchor their roots in authentic subcultures. This type of marketing targets millennials in particular, who, it is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlmoore/2014/08/14/authenticity-the-way-to-the-millennials-heart/#2d86d27c444a\">said</a>, respond well to brand authenticity. In America, millennials constitute the majority of the voting age population and the workforce, and so are clearly an important demographic for streetwear labels to address. </p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the most sceptical group of consumers are the millennials,\u201d says Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer psychologist at University College London. \u201cFrom the number of field studies I have conducted and my work as a brand consultant, the number one parameter that seems to both entertain and engage millennials is the authenticity of certain brands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b884bbe3c22bbea2b7304a1e5a55f092e9e3bd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b884bbe3c22bbea2b7304a1e5a55f092e9e3bd6/0_0_4956_3725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Preserving urban culture ...

But this is not news to the marketing and branding audience,\u201d Tsivrikos adds, \u201cbecause these new hubs are simply a contemporary extension of the \u2018made of\u2019 factor that used to attract consumer attention. Think high fashion and Paris, or cars and Germany.\u201d</p> <p>It may be the belief that urban subcultures are founded on love, rather than money, that makes them seem authentic. While it is possible to find ways of making such activities lucrative (the Banksy film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/04/exit-through-the-gift-shop-review\">Exit Through the Gift Shop</a>, for instance), on the whole they\u2019re seen as coming from the grassroots, and unfunded. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the eyes of the millennial, authenticity equates to edgy and upcoming cultural hubs</p> <footer> <cite>Dimitrios Tsivrikos</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Europe\u2019s largest street art and graffiti festival, <a href=\"http://www.upfest.co.uk/\">Upfest</a>, is still free, and according to its organiser, Stephen Hayles, \u201cthe ethos of the festival is all about inclusion,\u201d he says. \u201cWe like to include as many artists as possible, and also make it as accessible as possible. With the art being on the street, the artist is giving up their work for the people to view and comment on. There\u2019s a self-indulgence on the part of the artist, because they want to put their work out there, but also it is a gift that the artist is giving. To try to charge for that would go against the principles of graffiti and the ethos of the festival.\u201d</p> <p>While we have to pay to spend time in many parts of the city, with areas of free public space being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/04/pops-privately-owned-public-space-cities-direct-action\">diminished</a>, many subcultural activities take place free of charge.

Amy Spencer, author of DIY: The Rise of Lo-fi Culture told me that it \u201chas always existed ... DIY culture tends to increase at times when we have access to new technology. So, the rise in DIY culture at the moment is because now more people than ever are able to do it themselves. There are opportunities to reach audiences that we couldn\u2019t reach before.\u201d</p> <p>If authenticity means doing things ourselves \u2013 for love, and not money (and interacting with the city on our own terms, without paying to be there) \u2013 it could be argued that brands can never be truly authentic when their ultimate aim is to capitalise on their roots in urban subcultures.</p> <p>Indeed, the most successful brands can keep their consumers feeling grounded and authentic with faux rips in their jeans, as though they too participate in subcultural activities. </p> <p>But this line of thought does not play into the prevalent narrative, which is so commonplace in contemporary rap music: that we can all start from the bottom and work our way up to the top. When hugely successful streetwear brands invoke their origins in cities and their subcultures, they reinforce this rags to riches narrative in the consumer\u2019s mind, and present it as a tantalising possibility for them also.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"801474989f2552af3c7e6d3a52be3b34cac8a722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/801474989f2552af3c7e6d3a52be3b34cac8a722/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House of Vans event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The House of Vans event space was an attempt by the company to reconnect with its urban roots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.supremenewyork.com/\">Supreme</a> provides a good example of how a brand can successfully capitalise on its origins in an urban subculture. In April 1994, James Jebbia (who had previously helped to open Stussy\u2019s flagship store in New York) opened Supreme on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. The spacious shop, which cost around $12,000 to open, stocked clothes for an older demographic, which skateboarding brands had previously neglected. The shop has since grown into a brand, and in 2012 James Jebbia\u2019s net worth was estimated at $40m.</p> <p>Although Supreme now has a global audience, it remains exclusive with only 10 stores worldwide, six of which are in Japan. As well as having a large following in Japan, they boast an impressive online community of users that discuss, buy, and re-sell Supreme product. SupTalk, a popular Facebook page for Europe\u2019s Supreme fans, has over 60,000 members. </p> <p> Vans, which is now owned by VF Corporation (and according to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?/sites/abrambrown/2015/11/23/how-vans-shoes-became-a-quiet-fashion-juggernaut/&amp;toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2015/11/23/how-vans-shoes-became-a-quiet-fashion-juggernaut/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.co.uk/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/\">Forbes</a>, in 2015 was expected to make $2.3bn in sales), created the House of Vans events space in an effort to remain engaged with its subcultural origins. The site in Brooklyn hosts live music, art shows, and skateboarding events.</p> <p>Doug Palladini, Vans Global Brand President, says: \u201cHouse of Vans can be a large, permanent space in London, or a pop-up, moveable space winding its way across Asia, as long as the brand comes to life at every stop. This allows us to strategically place ourselves, down to the right street corner, and stand out with a bespoke, \u2018can\u2019t miss\u2019 experience.\u201d</p> <p>However, brands are not always successful in their engagements with cities and their subcultures. When Dr Martens commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&amp;v=j9qj3qP-5fU\">piece of art</a> to be painted in Stokes Croft, Bristol, many felt that the advert jarred with the spirit of the place. Tsivrikos commented, saying that:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/03/music-scenes-berlin-london-seattle-new-york\">From Berlin's warehouses to London's estates: how cities shape music scenes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSuch acts are perceived by millennial customers to be too obvious, and very much against the ethos of graffiti culture, which still holds elements of the anti-establishment movement and believes in artistic expression. When brands engage in such ill-advised acts, they are putting themselves at risk of being perceived as too obvious, far too commercial, and disrespectful of the local rules. These are qualities that go very much against what a cool zeitgeist brand is perceived to be by their number one customer base: the millennials.\u201d</p> <p>Brands tread a fine line when they sell the rags to riches narrative, which hopeful millennials buy in to. Are high priced goods commendable, because both our success and the success of the brand is predicated on them, or simply a sign that the brand is out of touch with the lifestyles of its target audience?</p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, many of these brands have genuine origins in urban subcultures, and appear to a lot of millennials as the last vestiges of a world in which there was such a thing as social mobility. </p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p> <ul> <br> </ul>",
  "<p>Following the Conservative party conference this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/young-people-does-theresa-mays-politics-speak-to-you\">we asked younger readers</a> whether Theresa May\u2019s politics spoke to them, and what issues they felt mattered to their generation. Here is a selection of responses.</p> <h2>Yes, she spoke to me</h2> <p><strong>Celine Kart, 18, from Calderdale: \u2018A lot of young women like me look up to Theresa May as she\u2019s strong and compassionate\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd980aed7d920ddcaa546e8d403466e2538768f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd980aed7d920ddcaa546e8d403466e2538768f9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Celine\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celine Kart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On BBC Radio 4 yesterday morning, Theresa May was asked what made her angry. She replied: \u201cInjustice, modern slavery, child sexual assault.\u201d She appeared compassionate and she\u2019s reminding us that women can stand out, be strong and compassionate at the same time. She is making a difference, and is reminding me that I can do all these things too. </p> <p>The political issues that matter to me are Brexit, human rights and international relations. I am very passionate about human rights as it\u2019s a basic necessity for everyone. I am also worried about Brexit as a young person, and I didn\u2019t vote to leave the EU. I think May is handling the situation as well as she can because we are in a limbo, waiting for article 50 to be triggered. She is trying to support people and give as much information as possible.</p> <p>Although I think May\u2019s speech and performance at the Conservative party conference was effective, and strong (necessary to prove herself as a new leader), it would\u2019ve been rewarding to have seen her discuss issues beyond Brexit. Obviously it\u2019s important but why not focus on other areas of concern, such as the humanitarian crisis, as well? <br></p> <p>I find May appealing because she is a woman in a patriarchal world and I know a lot of young women like me look up to her. When she was first elected I had my reservations but I think she\u2019s done a lot. I am not a Conservative voter normally \u2013 up until now I\u2019ve supported Labour \u2013 but May has changed all that. She has offered a good alternative to Corbyn who is not assertive enough.<br></p> <p><strong>James, 27, from London: \u2018May\u2019s policies speak to me in a way other politicians\u2019 have not\u2019</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t know. May\u2019s policies have spoken to me in a way that the current rhetoric from the Labour and Lib Dem parties have not \u2013 it\u2019s strange because I have been a lifetime opponent of the Tories. Labour are too far to the left, and I can\u2019t stomach Jeremy Corbyn or Momentum. The previously centre-leaning Labour politicians seem lost at sea, and don\u2019t really seem to be speaking to anyone right now.</p> <p>May\u2019s performance was very strong. I would like a strong condemnation of the current anti-immigrant sentiment, however. May\u2019s remarks on immigration are a cheap shot and can only vindicate the racist behaviour that has increased since the referendum. I believe it\u2019s possible to be anti-immigration and not racist, but I fear May\u2019s speech may well have added fuel to the fire. </p> <p><strong>Molly Rose, 21, from Dundee: Theresa May has a brain and shows common sense, unlike other politicians</strong></p> <p>Theresa May has taken a strong stance with Brexit by repealing the European Communities Act. She also may be enforcing a strict immigration policy and looks set to repeal the Human Rights Act. She is a powerful and driven women, a a role model to everyone.

We are European, if not global, in outlook, and value our cultural and historic connection with Europe. We don\u2019t blame migration for poor social mobility. After all, most areas of significant white working-class deprivation also have a smaller population of immigrants. </p> <p>As a young person living in London, the big issue for me is housing. As mayor, Boris Johnson made little difference to my chances of owning a home, and most people my age have accepted that in a few years we might not even be able to rent, let alone buy, in the capital. I want a government that will prioritise creating more affordable housing. High rents impact on my life in many ways: I have no financial security and cannot plan for the future. If I had a medical emergency, for example, I would have to turn to my parents for help.</p> <p>The politician I am more inclined to support is Jeremy Corbyn, but more because he is the best out of a bad bunch. I agree with a lot of his policies, such as the funding of a national education service, but also think that he puts a lot of people off as he is seen as stubborn.</p> <p>In her speech, I would like May to have given less weight to hard Brexiteers and talked about about committing money to housebuilding and ringfencing school and health budgets. She does, however, come across as very determined and more measured than David Cameron. I think that this is appealing to a wider section of society and she does seem more honest. </p> <p><strong>Michael Claro, 26, Glasgow: \u2018The Conservatives do not care about working people\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5168eb9e898d3e84549b55972f3b555409198fe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5168eb9e898d3e84549b55972f3b555409198fe8/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Michael Claro\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Claro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I do not believe that Theresa May or the newest incarnation of the Tory party care about working people. It is very difficult to believe that the party that only favours the very rich, and crafts its policies around the financial interests of the elite, now suddenly stands for working people. Ultimately I have little confidence that Theresa May will represent anyone but the wealthy. She is too out of touch with the state of the world today, and will likely ignore forward-thinking ideas in favour of paradigms she is accustomed to. </p> <p>I want a government that prioritises protecting the environment. There seems to be no real effort to conserve and preserve Britain\u2019s natural heritage. As well as this, protecting workers\u2019 rights is important \u2013 everyone has a part to play in society, not just the wealthy and those who work full-time should enjoy a decent quality of life. I also believe in promoting universal education and innovation: the UK should be modelling its policies on the Scandinavian countries, who provide free university education to their citizens.</p> <p>Much of Theresa May\u2019s speech was an overture to the disgruntled Ukip voters who the Tory party attempt to capture. She suggested that Britain would now become a real economic player on the world stage, but what exactly does that mean? I would have liked her to delineate specific proposals for promoting innovation, creativity, and sustainability for Britain\u2019s economy. These are the qualities that will make Britain stronger, not reverting to an outdated, obsolete economic ideology.</p> <p><strong>Sophia Gore, 24, Brighton: \u2018The future of the UK is very uncertain in her hands\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51a1f3c1161ec62e06b8eda5657d3645e62e42dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51a1f3c1161ec62e06b8eda5657d3645e62e42dc/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Sophia Gore\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophia Gore</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I find her prioritisation of immigration alarming and quite terrifying. She is steadily isolating Britain and alienating us from the EU. She is not recognising that while, yes, 52% of the population voted for Brexit, the remaining 48% voted in. I am confused with her ideological positioning. She claims to want to provide equal opportunities but is forcing through the academy bill, which to me is absurd and contrary to her public stance.</p> <p>I am also terrified that she has kept Jeremy Hunt as health secretary. The NHS is tragically crumbling before our eyes and steadily moving steps closer to privatisation. I also wish that she would take a greater stance on environmental issues, the elephant in the room.</p> <p>I prefer her to David Cameron, but to be honest I feel the future of the UK is very uncertain in her hands, especially in terms of maintaining positive relations with the EU. I am just very sad that we are in this position of Brexit and that she is evidently now campaigning for a \u201chard\u201d exit.

  "<p>The sound of chainsaws fills the forest of Bruny Island in Tasmania as a group of 30 arborists cut into white peppermint trees, which provide essential nesting for the endangered swift parrot.</p> <p>The arborists, from Victoria and Sydney, paid for their own flights and volunteered their time to climb into more than 100 trees and carve holes in them to provide safe nesting for the birds, which are fussy about where they will breed.</p> <p>Dejan Stojanovic, a conservation biologist who researches the parrots and is dedicated to preserving their environment, struggles to contain his excitement as he speaks over the chainsaws to Guardian Australia on Friday. He hopes the human-made hollows will lead to a breeding season boon for the birds.</p> <p>\u201cMy research has shown that of the naturally available tree hollows in the Tasmanian forest, only 5% are suitable for swift parrots,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe parrots are really picky about where they will nest, and the holes must have certain characteristics or the birds won\u2019t use them. The average nest is between 40 and 50cm deep, and the entrance hole in the tree needs to be small, about 5cm in diameter.</p> <p>\u201cThe birds need that small entrance to prevent Tasmanian predators (which typically have fat heads, like sugar gliders) from getting into them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109336e4ce89d78879cfa065cb06f4a3d366743d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/109336e4ce89d78879cfa065cb06f4a3d366743d/0_0_640_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Arborists carve hollows into Tasmanian peppermint trees in the hope endangered swift parrots will nest in them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arborists carve hollows into Tasmanian white peppermint trees in the hope endangered swift parrots will nest in them.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McKernan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Habitat loss owing to logging, illegal firewood cutting and clearing land for farming and housing means that safe and appropriate breeding spaces for the birds are increasingly rare. While numbers are hard to ascertain, Stojanovic says there are only about 2,000 of the parrots left. Habitat loss has accelerated their deaths to sugar gliders, which kill and eat the female parrot while she incubates her eggs, or return over several nights to feast on nestlings. </p> <p>But Stojanovic\u2019s research team has had an exciting week. In a further attempt to encourage breeding, they launched a <a href=\"https://pozible.com/project/193891\">crowdfunding campaign </a>through Pozible last year to build sugar glider-proof nest boxes. They raised $73,000 and by the end of the year had placed hundreds of nest boxes throughout the forest.</p> <p>Last week Stojanovic checked 40 of the boxes and found 11 of them occupied by the parrots. He has climbed up to check inside three of those 11 boxes so far, finding one containing six eggs, another containing four and one with a nest chamber prepared, signalling a parrot was about to lay. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/01/wont-somebody-think-of-the-swift-parrots\">Won't somebody think of the swift parrots? | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was three out of three,\u201d Stojanovic says. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever recorded one natural nest with six eggs in it before, and it\u2019s another sign it will be a great year for the parrots. It\u2019s nice to be able to say to people who donated to our campaign that their money has gone to good use, and it\u2019s such a relief for us.\u201d</p> <p>A combination of factors are working in the parrots\u2019 favour this year, he says. Their food source, blue gums, are flowering heavily, providing a food bonanza in an area of the island protected from sugar gliders. And, thanks to the efforts of researchers, there are more nesting options available to the birds than ever.</p> <p>But Stojanovic warns the parrots are nomads which move to different areas of Tasmania according to where blue gums are blooming. Deploying arborists to climb trees and carve out nesting holes each season according to where the birds are, combined with building the nesting boxes, is an expensive and time-intensive endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a Band-Aid solution and a desperate attempt to buy time for these birds by giving them a reprieve for their habitat loss,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we need to do long term is preserve mature Tasmanian forest. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we need to do long term is preserve mature Tasmanian forest</p> <footer> <cite>Dejan Stojanovic</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you consider that this is the best year for the birds since 2005 in terms of conditions and food supply, that\u2019s 11 years between drinks.</p> <p>\u201cIt is highly likely that next year the blue gums won\u2019t flower as well as they did this year and they might not for another five years, forcing the birds on to the mainland to breed where there is less habitat and more predators.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew McKernan, an arborist with Melbourne Tree Care, spent Friday ascending the peppermint trees, which he says had been chosen because they aren\u2019t endangered and are near to the blue gums.</p> <p>He heard Stojanovic on the ABC\u2019s Radio National program early this year talking about the parrots and their natural habitat being destroyed by illegal firewood cutters.

  "<p>\u201cI am ready to die for conserving the rhino,\u201d says Wisdom Makhubele. But the brave young ranger now has another weapon in the war against rhino poaching: the extraordinary nose of tracking hounds.<br></p> <p>The trained dogs can run poachers to ground far faster than people, sometimes even being set free in packs and followed from helicopters. The new canine training unit at the Southern African Wildlife College (SAWC), near Acornhoek, opened earlier this year and dogs have already brought armed poachers to heel in Kruger national park, the epicentre of the rhino poaching crisis.</p> <p>At least 6,000 African rhinos have been slaughtered by poachers since 2008, to fuel the soaring demand for its horn in Asia, where it is highly valued as a supposed tonic and status symbol. The rhino poaching epidemic across Africa has exploded in recent years, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/09/record-number-of-african-rhinos-killed-in-2015\">annual increases in killings every year since 2009</a>: 1,338 were slaughtered in 2015. </p> <p>It was a hot topic at the major wildlife trade summit in Johannesburg this week, where an attempt by Swaziland to legalise rhino horn trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/bid-for-stronger-protection-for-all-african-elephants-defeated-at-wildlife-summit\">was defeated</a>.</p> <p>South Africa hosts more than 90% of the 20,000 surviving white rhinos and almost half the 4,800 remaining black rhinos and saw a slight dip in the slaughter in 2015, the first decrease in nine years. Over 70% of the rhino kills occur in Kruger and a sign on the way into the park reads \u201cPoachers will be poached\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19e82392a0162073bb3e271170ca0d50b758707a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19e82392a0162073bb3e271170ca0d50b758707a/0_0_5100_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Airforce helmet with an anti-poaching slogan on the back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airforce helmet with an anti-poaching slogan on the back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Edwards/NG/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dogs have been used for camp security for years, but the escalating poaching crisis has found them a new role. \u201cThey are awesome \u2013 they are instinctive to tracking,\u201d says Johan van Straaten, manager of the dog unit, which has been funded by <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.za/what_we_do/wwf_nedbank_green_trust/?18801/Using-Community-Based-Natural-Resource-Managment-to-benefit-Rhino\">WWF Nedbank Green Trust</a>. \u201cAll these dogs can track, it\u2019s in their genes. But we train them to track the scent we want. These dogs are imprinted on human scent, like narcotics dogs are on drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Two dozen dogs are in training at the camp, protected from predators by an 8,000-volt electric fence. Most are cross-breeds of English foxhounds and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetick_Coonhound\">blueticks</a>, although beagles are being tested too. They are trained to detect poached horns and weapons as well as track. The rest of the pack are Belgian Malinois, a slightly smaller, more agile German shepherd, which are used for \u201cbite work\u201d \u2013 apprehending poachers.</p> <p>Sophie, a seven-month-old hound, is first out of the kennels to start training today. It\u2019s only her third outing, but she criss-crosses the ground and picks up the scent left by Makhubele in seconds and bounds off in pursuit. She leads van Straaten like an arrow to the hollow 500m away where Makhubele is hiding. If the dog loses the scent on older trails, the handler helps out, looking for footprints or flattened grass. \u201cIt\u2019s teamwork,\u201d says Makhubele.</p> <p>Next out is Belgian Malinois, Dozer, this time chasing Makhubele who has donned a thick padded jacket. Makhubele runs off screaming and shouting and Dozer is given the order \u201cbring him!\u201d. The dog latches on to Makhubele\u2019s arm and refuses to let go, even when swung from the ground.</p> <p>The dogs are first trained to bite the arm, says Makhubele: \u201cBut later we train them to bite everywhere.\u201d After Dozer is stood down, he pads around looking for strokes and praise. \u201cIt\u2019s controlled aggression,\u201d says van Straaten. </p> <p>Currently, about a third of Kruger\u2019s 22 ranger stations have a trained dog but the aim is to have four dogs per station, so all of the day\u2019s patrols can use them. <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/?id=55353\">South African National Parks have trained</a> and <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Rhino-poachers-get-14-years-in-prison-thanks-to-tracking-dog-20151027\">used their own tracker dogs</a> for a few years and in Kenya, <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/12/tracker-dogs-are-an-elephants-best-friend/\">bloodhounds are now tracking elephant poachers</a>.

The 128 trainee rangers currently at SAWC live in tents, with inspection drill every morning and severe physical training. Their enemy are often ex-military too, frequently coming across the border from <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/negotiations-between-frelimo-renamo-suspended-mozambique-war-escalates-1573691\">troubled Mozambique</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA ranger\u2019s life in South Africa used to be all about conservation but now it is all about anti-poaching and that is sad,\u201d said Theresa Sowry, SAWC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut they are fully aware of the risks, which is why we have had to up the training.\u201d</p> <p>Self defence is a critical part of this, she says: \u201cIf you have a weapon pointed at you, you have the right to shoot.

A panel of experts was chaired by Guardian journalist Annie Kelly.</p> <h2>Boycotting slavery</h2> <p>For Thailand, the issue became more acute last year, when the EU threatened it with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/21/eu-threatens-thailand-with-trade-ban-over-illegal-fishing\">trade ban</a> on seafood imports if it did not tackle illegal fishing and labour abuses.

But the company\u2019s sustainability director, Darian McBain, said boycotting Thailand would achieve little. \u201cCompanies might say they\u2019ll just source from another country that has no slavery in their supply chain, but I\u2019d like to know what that country is. This is an issue that occurs across the fishing industry worldwide.\u201d</p> <p>By staying put in Thailand, companies can have more impact, said Libby Woodhatch, head of advocacy at Seafish. \u201c[Companies] have the buying power collectively to make a difference and ensure [slavery] isn\u2019t acceptable and that regulations are enforced,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Threat of lawsuits</h2> <p>Since the publication of damning investigations by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">Guardian</a> and Associated Press, multinationals, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/24/nestle-admits-forced-labour-in-seafood-supply-chain\">Nestl\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"http://tu.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20160615-tu-modern-slavery-en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thai Union</a>, have openly admitted to problems with slave labour and human rights abuse in their supply chains. McBain sees little benefit to this transparency. \u201cThere are a lot of companies you have never heard of that are dealing with seafood. That isn\u2019t to say they are being more transparent with their supply chains or investing more into them, it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve never heard of them,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/obama-revives-anti-slavery-law-to-target-thailands-seafood-exports\">US legislation</a> like the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act actually makes you more cautious about what you say about what you find in your supply chain, rather than encouraging transparent dialogue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yukilo/status/776351188291903488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great panel on slavery in seafood industry \"it seems we care more about the fish than the fishermen\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/slaveryevent?src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\">#slaveryevent</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MrRdBqgYmu\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/MrRdBqgYmu</a></p>\u2014 Yuki Lo (@yukilo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yukilo/status/776351188291903488\" rel=\"nofollow\">September 15, 2016</a> </blockquote> </figure>  <p>For human rights barrister and UN expert on trafficking Parosha Chandran, it is not media coverage that companies should worry about but legal action from individual victims of slavery or human rights abuses. While the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\">Modern Day Slavery Act</a> in the UK does not provide for civil remedies for those who have been abused, she said it could be possible under international law.</p> <p>In the US, cases against Nestl\u00e9 and Costco have failed. But an ongoing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/cambodian-villagers-sue-us-thai-firms-human-trafficking-forced-labour-claims-walmart-shrimp\">lawsuit</a> brought on behalf of Cambodian fishermen recruited to work in the Thai seafood industry and filed against four companies, including alleged suppliers to Walmart, could set a successful precedent. \u201cThere is a momentum towards litigation because as human rights lawyers we are looking at the abused and ways to have their voices heard that say stop this,\u201d said Chandran.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>One of the main obstacles at present is the defenselessness of workers in the seafood sector, particularly those working on boats. \u201cThis is an incredibly vulnerable community of victims ... out at sea, remote. Unless there is a system that enables victims to feel safe and encouraged to come forward and give evidence there is going to be a big gap in bringing companies to account,\u201d said Chandran.</p> <h2>Response from industry</h2> <p>While much of the focus has been on Thailand as a major supplier of seafood to Europe and the US, Trent pointed out that you could also find human rights abuses on an individual scale in the UK, France or Spain. In response, Seafish has added human rights clauses to its certification scheme for fishermen. Backed by third-party checks, the updated <a href=\"http://www.seafish.org/rfs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responsible Fishing Scheme (RFS)</a> aims to give fishermen and boat operators a chance to prove they are not exploiting or endangering crews, as well as adhering to sustainable catching methods, Woodhatch said.</p> <p>A number of UK retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, have made commitments to ensure all their suppliers are RFS certified. However, a former fishing industry auditor in the audience criticised the scheme for interviewing only the captain as part of the auditing process, rather than speaking to ordinary crew members. Trent agreed, \u201cIt makes no sense. They are the fishermen catching the fish. They are completely outside all these schemes\u201d. Woodhatch said they wanted to incorporate crew interviews into future revisions of the scheme.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2014/jun/10/slavery-thai-fishing-industry-worker-suicides-video-animation\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3qvq2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2106785\"            data-video-name=\"Slavery in the Thai fishing industry: how workers are being driven to suicide \u2013 video animation\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/9/1402326079810/Thai-Prawns-Animation-2-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-438955963\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/9/1402326079810/Thai-Prawns-Animation-2-010.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2-16x9.mp4\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2.webm\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2/140609ThaiAnimation2.m3u8\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/11/140609ThaiAnimation2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2014/jun/10/slavery-thai-fishing-industry-worker-suicides-video-animation\">Slavery in the Thai fishing industry: how workers are being driven to suicide</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Chandran also pointed out that as the scheme was voluntary and did not yet cover non-UK boats, its impact on the wider global problem of human rights abuse in the seafood sector was limited. To get that global impact in Asia, Africa and Europe, individual companies need to be accountable under UK laws, she said. \u201cIf a British company is able to establish itself in an industry where there is an absence of rights for workers, then it\u2019s a necessity to ensure there is protection for the workers.\u201d</p> <p>McBain and Woodhatch agreed that this is a difficult task for seafood companies, especially when they source fish on a daily basis from multiple boats. Chandran said the most obvious solution is to work with competitors to check on suppliers or shorten the supply chain. Trent concurred: \u201cThe more companies only source from people they have reasonable degrees of surety [about] the more it squeezes out the dark side. You can\u2019t switch to a situation where you have no slavery or abuse tomorrow, but you can push very hard.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenmctaggart/status/776379093176705024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianSustBiz\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GuardianSustBiz</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/slaveryevent?src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\">#slaveryevent</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejfoundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">@ejfoundation</a> calls on biz to show l'ship in slavery + fish.

Both of these steps would undoubtedly come at the cost of cheap seafood.</p> <p>McBain pointed out that at least one retailer promises to bring prices down every year. \u201cIf prices are going down each year, where is the money for the workers and the living wage at every point along that supply chain?\u201d The answer, said Woodhatch, was that retailers had to take the decision out of consumers\u2019 hands and ensure they don\u2019t sell seafood produced using slave labour. \u201cThe consumer is hit with so much information about what they should and shouldn\u2019t eat.

  "<p>When Kavya Menon first brought up the idea of installing a sanitary pad dispenser in the girls\u2019 bathroom of Calicut Medical College, fellow students said she shouldn\u2019t really discuss such matters openly at a student union meeting, where boys were present. \u201cIt was strange. I mean, we\u2019re supposed to become doctors yet some people would say, \u2018How can you talk about this here?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/13/menstruation-temples-mosques-india-ban-women\">Will India open its temples and mosques to menstruating women? | Amrit Dhillon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Menon, the sanitary pad dispenser was a necessity: \u201cIf you start your period in the middle of the day and you can\u2019t find a pad, you have to go all the way to the hostel, which is at least a 10-minute walk away. There\u2019s no time between classes to go there.\u201d</p> <p>Periods are only ever mentioned in hushed tones, Menon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t raise your hand in class and tell your professor you need to leave because of period pain, for example. You have to be discreet.\u201d</p> <p>She eventually convinced her fellow students that the dispenser was a worthy expense for the college. But still, she found she couldn\u2019t talk openly about her period when there were boys around. </p> <p>\u201cWe learn about menstruation and yet we can\u2019t talk about it. Even I was hesitant to talk about it openly at first, but soon I realised that when I did, the boys were supportive. Sometimes I think we women impose this secrecy about periods on ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>At the college\u2019s literary club, a group of core members decided to launch a menstruation-themed haiku and poetry competition to mark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/live/2016/mar/08/international-womens-day-2016-iwd-live\">International Women\u2019s Day</a> earlier this year. </p> <p>But not all the club\u2019s members were keen. Among those initially resistant was Maiz Wafy, a second-year male student. \u201cThis is a taboo subject,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not comfortable for me. In my family, the women discussed this among themselves \u2013 I was never really exposed to it. Many of the students at the college are from conservative backgrounds, and I didn\u2019t know if it would be offensive to them. I said that we didn\u2019t need to be so open about this topic. I thought \u2013 would anyone write about this?\u201d</p> <p>But as the entries started to pour in and he read the poems, Wafy changed his mind. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think it should be a taboo. I still don\u2019t think we should be very open about it, but I am OK with talking about it.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She loved biology. <br>Wanted to be a doctor. <br>Then biology took over. <br>She never saw school again.<br><strong>Athira Unni, Pune</strong></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/22/india-menstruation-periods-gaokor-women-isolated\">Banished for menstruating: the Indian women isolated while they bleed | Gagandeep Kaur</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The competition was publicised through social media and entries arrived from across the country. \u201cWe started circulating those on WhatsApp and Facebook, and then people from our college started writing in too,\u201d said Menon. </p> <p>Sreya Salim compiled the haikus and poems into a magazine. \u201cWe got 87 entries,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose to have a haiku competition because some people don\u2019t feel comfortable writing entire essays about it.

  "<p>As things stand at the moment, I can\u2019t tell you what the re-elected Turnbull government is about. I don\u2019t think anyone would be able to tell you. As some pundits would put it, there is no narrative. As I would put it, there is no coherent agenda.<br></p> <p>But what there is, in abundance, is problem solving.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, the government has moved with alacrity to clean up various messes: the backpacker tax, the deeply troubled VET Fee-Help scheme, the dangerously internally contested superannuation policy, and even the marriage equality plebiscite \u2013 which, on current indications, will finally hit the fence next week when parliament resumes.</p> <p>There are two ways of looking at this bout of problem solving. The first way could be that this represents, for the government, a strategic lowering of ambition \u2013 don\u2019t try to set some grand agenda, just do what the voters say they want, which is to find practical solutions for practical problems, and use that as a basis for post-election recovery.</p> <p>The second way is to see a prime minister trying to remain one step ahead of people who would do him harm. Putting runs on the board is a practical method of staying a step ahead of Tony Abbott, who is like a mini typhoon, building up ground speed on his Quadrant reunion world tour, throwing bones to the base from the European capitals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/30/ignorant-rubbish-daniel-andrews-slams-malcolm-turnbull-over-sa-blackout-comments\">\u2018Ignorant rubbish\u2019: Daniel Andrews slams Malcolm Turnbull over SA blackout comments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So laser-like has the focus become on problem solving that the government has ticked over and gone one step further in the past week, dusting off the old Howard-era trick of <em>creating</em> a problem to solve.</p> <p>John Howard was the master of the pea-and-thimble trick, the barbecue stopper, the sudden pull on the handbrake to move the government minibus in another direction to try to deliver some kind of short-term fillip. The deeply inglorious fight about renewable energy that has broken out since the South Australian blackouts has some of the hallmarks of the ageing magician.</p> <p>Look. Over. There. Tabloid shitstorm. It\u2019s pretty unbecoming.</p> <p>So let\u2019s not look over there. Let\u2019s look at what has actually happened.</p> <p>During the Abbott era, the government repealed Labor\u2019s carbon pricing scheme and waged an ideological attack on renewable energy, a protracted bout of warfare that damaged not only the aural sensibilities of ordinary Australians but also, much more pertinently, clubbed an important growth industry for this country at a time when good growth industries can be hard to find.</p> <p>The absence of federal leadership created a vacuum that various state governments stepped into with their renewable energy targets.</p> <p>When Turnbull returned to the leadership of the Liberal party, asserting any ambition on climate policy would clearly be incendiary behaviour. So he didn\u2019t express ambition. In fact, he was at pains not to.</p> <p>He just calmed things down, with similar tactics to those he deployed to calm down the febrile and cartoonish national security debate \u2013 it wasn\u2019t an apocalypse, people, it was just a windfarm.</p> <p>With the apocalypse consigned to the past, Greg Hunt, the then environment minister, fresh from signing Australia up to climate commitments in Paris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/renewable-energy-get-your-story-straight-act-tells-coalition\">gave state governments clear encouragement to develop their own renewable energy schemes</a>. \u201cI have encouraged the states that if they want to do something extra, [they should] apply reverse auctions to the renewable energy target in the way the Australian Capital Territory has done,\u201d Hunt said last December in Paris.</p> <p>That was 10 months ago.</p> <p>Hunt was then replaced by Josh Frydenberg. Frydenberg was Turnbull\u2019s most interesting ministerial appointment for a couple of reasons: the prime minister combined the portfolios of energy and environment, creating a long-overdue synthesis, and Frydenberg is someone Coalition conservatives are eyeing off as a future leadership contender, so long as he makes the right gestures.</p> <p>Frydenberg\u2019s opening signal in his new portfolio was always going to be important, and it was typically well thought through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing\">when I spoke to him in July</a>.</p> <p>Just for the record, on my count, July is three months ago.</p> <p>The new minister said several things. He said coal was on the way out. He said he was interested in gas as a transitional fuel to safeguard base-load power during the transition. He said a key focus in his work with the states would be \u201chow to ensure we get a greater integration of renewables into the electricity market, and a greater focus on new technologies\u201d. Clear signal: renewables OK.</p> <p>He was keen to play down a nascent narrative from conservative commentators that power outages recorded in South Australia in 2015 were attributable to <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/wind-energy-not-to-blame-for-south-australia-power-outage-31520\">that state\u2019s high proportion of wind energy</a>. Frydenberg said there were several factors involved in the blackouts, only one of which was the intermittency of wind. Again, a clear signal. Renewables OK. Chill.</p> <p>Frydenberg certainly did raise in his opening gambit an issue he had with the inconsistency of the state renewable energy targets. He clearly didn\u2019t care for the patchwork of schemes \u2013 but he raised it in neutral terms.</p> <p>He noted that all the states had different targets and they were at different points of diversification in their respective energy mixes. Tasmania, for example, had more than 90% renewables. South Australia was about 41%, Victoria about 12% and New South Wales about 8% \u2013 and then there was the federal renewable energy target.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/04/renewable-energy-get-your-story-straight-act-tells-coalition\">Renewable energy: get your story straight, ACT tells Coalition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe question is how do I integrate the state and the federal policies,\u201d he said \u2013 which is obviously a quantifiably different question to how do I get the states to dump their targets.</p> <p>So the intention three months ago, broadly defined, at the political level, was to calm things down. The government gave the clear impression it was resolved on trying to thread a needle on climate and energy policy. Various stakeholders breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>Roll forward to the past week, and the South Australian storm that has reset the political debate.</p> <p>Now we\u2019ve entered a period of asserting the inalienable rights of Australians to watch cricket with the lights on at the MCG. The lights must remain on has been the political refrain of the past week, like some kind of primal bringing of the fire moment.</p> <p>If you were a deeply cynical person, you\u2019d say that maximising a problem, setting off a mini culture war, gives the Australian something to write about on page one other than Tony\u2019s Quadrant tour.</p> <p>If that was the objective, it has worked a treat.</p> <p>But of course short-term politics isn\u2019t the only consideration. So let\u2019s take a minute to sort the reasonable from the cynical.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s energy sector is facing a big transition. We obviously do have to keep the lights on while that happens.</p> <p>The intermittency issues from technologies such as wind are utterly reasonable for regulators and governments to consider, as are other equally pertinent matters, such as the state of the infrastructure, the sufficiency of interconnectors and the obvious trend towards decentralisation.</p> <p>It\u2019s utterly reasonable for voters to want power to be affordable, but it\u2019s also reasonable to expect that any debate about affordability will reference the fact that wind and solar costs are falling much faster than forecasters have predicted, and battery costs are also heading lower \u2013 and the combination of those two facts spells opportunity. These are just facts, not utopian fantasies from lentil-eating leftists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing\">Josh Frydenberg: Australia's use of coal is falling 'and that is not a bad thing'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also have to recognise Australia has an obligation to decarbonise, and rapidly, for the health of the planet, and because of specific commitments the Turnbull government has signed Australia up to.</p> <p>There\u2019s now no credible pathway for the kind of emissions reductions Australia will require to meet its Paris commitments. That\u2019s just a fact, and one that the Turnbull government, thus far, seems very reluctant to face up to, given that doing so will generate another war within its own ranks.</p> <p>To put this simply: lecturing the state governments about their emissions reduction policies tends to work better if you have a clear medium-term pathway of your own.</p> <p>On the logic of what Frydenberg has been saying since he took the portfolio, the policy pathway for the government is clear. If the minister wants gas as the transitional fuel to deliver base load, and a nationally harmonised policy structure to help bolt new technologies into the electricity grid, he should lead the discussion about an energy intensity scheme for the power industry, because such a scheme would deliver those eventualities.</p> <p>He could also put the states back in their box by setting a more ambitious federal renewable energy target, legislated over a longer time horizon, to give certainty to investors, who are again fretting about having to endure another toxic cycle of finger pointing about climate change.</p> <p>That\u2019s the test of political bona fides.</p> <p>The rest is really so much theatre.</p>",

Vote-by-mail requests among Hispanics in Florida, for example, were up 77% since this juncture four years ago, Mook said. </p> <p>The trend of more vote-by-mail requests extended to other demographics who have increasingly voted Democrat and might feel alienated by Trump, such as Asian Americans.

While Clinton\u2019s campaign acknowledged Democrats were unlikely to overtake their opponents overall in early voting this cycle, they were optimistic about closing the gap.</p> <p>Mook also said the campaign was requesting that officials in Florida extend its Oct. 11 voter registration deadline in light of Hurricane Matthew. The Category 4 deadly storm, which is making its up up the Florida coast, prompted its governor to declare a state of emergency. </p> <p>Mook additionally previewed the next presidential debate, slated for Sunday evening in St. Louis, Missouri.

The state of emergency declared by Governor Pat McCrory ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Matthew this weekend follows similar civil measures in September when the police killing of a black man set off a wave of angry protests on the streets of the state\u2019s largest city, Charlotte.</p> <p>Few of the tempests to sweep by in 2016 have defined the national mood quite as much, though, as the political maelstrom battering this state. A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> <p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/battleground-states-north-carolina-trump-clinton-sharp-divisions\">Battleground states: North Carolina's sharp divides put election on knife-edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South \u2013 race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of America\u2019s major transport and financial hubs.</p> <p>Pride in North Carolina\u2019s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality.

He casts his guests in a burlesque he scripts for them, and cattle-prods them into playing their parts, first fawning over them until they feel like celebrities, then bringing down the hammer of humiliation. He\u2019s a diabolically domineering scene partner. No interviewer has ever been as adroit with treacherous leading questions in the vein of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d Stern, in other words, gets people to publicly embrace their worst selves\u2014and say things they live to regret.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what happened with Trump. Today, as the Republican nominee, he may fashion himself as a boss and a master of the universe. But what comes across in old tapes of the show, resurfaced recently by BuzzFeed and other outlets, is that Trump, like many of Stern\u2019s guests, was often the one being played. By nailing him as a buffoon and then\u2014unkindest cut\u2014forcing him to kiss the Howard Stern ring, Stern and his co-anchor, Robin Quivers, created a series of broadcasts that today showcase not just Trump\u2019s misogyny but his ready submission to sharper minds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/howard-stern-donald-trump-2016-214322#ixzz4MK5DCjOP\">full piece here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f674cae4b03b0685c083de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T16:06:40.025Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul Ryan to campaign with Donald Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for every Republican running away from Trump.
