  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>David Cameron famously once said he wanted to be prime minister \u201cbecause I think I\u2019d be rather good at it\u201d. (Spoiler alert: he really wasn\u2019t.) Even that expensively acquired self-belief may have suffered a wobble, however, given the reaction to Cameron\u2019s announcement that he was scarpering from Westminster (sample from the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/david-camerons-petulant-resignation-as-an-mp-shows-why-he-leaves/\">Telegraph</a>\u2019s James Kirkup: \u201cpetulant ... no big idea... a lack of seriousness\u201d \u2013 you get the picture). </p> <p>It\u2019s been a humbling few days for the former PM, forced to watch Theresa May coolly reversing his decisions, one by one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/grammarschools\">Grammar schools</a>, opposed by Cameron, back on the agenda. The chair of the BBC Trust Rona Fairhead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/13/rona-fairhead-to-stand-down-as-bbc-chair\">whom he reappointed, gone</a>. Now, the lowest blow of all. The Bullingdon Club, it has emerged, is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/bullingdon-club-at-oxford-university-faces-extinction-because-no/\">threatened with extinction</a> because nobody wants to join. \u201cEvery reasonable person thinks it\u2019s a joke,\u201d said a mole. Well, yes. </p> <p>Like we say, not a great week for Cameron. On the other hand, this fact alone may have cheered yours immensely, so every cloud and all that. </p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>TV audiences have inevitably been smaller for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics\">Paralympics</a> than last month\u2019s Olympics, which is a shame because there\u2019s no doubt the games have showcased plenty of sporting brilliance. Consider, for example, the T13 1500m men\u2019s final, <a href=\"https://www.rio2016.com/en/paralympics/news/abdellatif-baka-paralympics-rio-2016-games-visually-impaired-athletics-would-have-won-olympic-gold\">won by the Algerian Abdellatif Baka</a> in a world record time of 3:48.29. Ethiopia\u2019s Tamiru Demisse and Kenyan Henry Kirwa claimed silver and bronze, while Baka\u2019s brother Fouad just missed a medal in fourth. </p> <p>Runners in the T13 category are visually impaired, which makes it particularly striking that each of the first four finishers, had they been competing in the Olympics 1500m final on 20 August, would have beaten the entire field, including Matt Centrowitz who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/usa-matt-centrowitz-gold-olympic-1500m-final\">claimed gold for the US</a> in a snail-like time of 3:50.00. The American\u2019s victory came in a highly tactical race that got off to an unusually slow start, but still. Did someone say \u201cbackwards and in heels\u201d?</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>A big week for food-based transportation calamity headline gags, which \u2013 speaking personally \u2013 has been just about the only thing that has got me through. First, of course, there was the embarrassing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-37341511\">pasta disaster</a> on the A5 near Shotatton in Shropshire, where a lorry slopped 20 tonnes of spaghetti bolognese across the carriageway. Then came that incident with the tanker transporting molasses off the Cumbrian coast which \u2013 dear reader, you are ahead of me \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-37348840\">got stuck</a>. </p> <p>Is it just possible, all the same, that we have overindulged just a little on the food puns with the news that a baking programme is moving channels? I mean, crumbs, newspapers do like to rise to the challenge when faced with these ingredients, but whether we kneaded quite so many overcooked puns about the Great British Bake Off\u2019s BBC1 departure is a matter of taste. Let\u2019s all agree: the BBC got burned, Mel and Sue were delicious and Breadxit means Breadxit. Now can we leave it there? I\u2019m feeling queasy.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>So we are, after all, to have a new nuclear power station at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley Point</a>, after May declined to overturn her predecessor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-point-c-hard-choice-wrong-call\">bafflingly unfavourable deal</a> with its Chinese backers. For all their glee at the Hinkley contract, the real prize for Chinese investors is a potential new plant at Bradwell, on a sparse stretch of coast near Maldon in Essex.</p> <p>Bradwell, as it happens, has been of interest to incomers for some time. Just east of the power station site is a small stone building that could pass for a ramshackle old barn. It is, instead, the <a href=\"http://www.bradwellchapel.org/\">chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall</a>, built by St Cedd, a missionary from Lindisfarne, in 654, which makes it probably the second oldest church in Britain. Cedd\u2019s builder-monks reused stones from the <a href=\"http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=385939\">Roman fort of Othona</a>, and the tiny, single-roomed chapel stands at the end of an <a href=\"https://toomanyphotos.wordpress.com/2015/01/11/winter-walk-bradwell-on-sea/\">arrow-straight stretch of Roman road</a>, with just the North Sea behind. It feels like a miraculous survival from another time, perched on the very edge of the world. Do visit before the chaps in radiation suits and the three-eyed fish take over. </p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Sometimes life writes its own punchlines. So it must seem, at least, for Rebecca Moss, who sailed from Vancouver last month on board a container ship bound for Shanghai. Moss, 25, is an \u201cabsurdist artist\u201d and her project \u201c<a href=\"https://toomanyphotos.wordpress.com/2015/01/11/winter-walk-bradwell-on-sea/\">23 Days at Sea</a>\u201d was intended to examine the comedic friction between mechanical systems and nature. In a textbook case of \u201cbe careful what you wish for\u201d, however, the Hanjin Shipping Company, which owns the tanker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/hanjin-shipping-bankruptcy-causes-turmoil-in-global-sea-freight\">went bust on 31 August</a>, leaving the ship stranded at sea since port operators, afraid they won\u2019t be paid, have refused to let them dock.</p> <p>Meat and drink for an absurdist artist, one might think. Maybe so, but when contacted by email on Friday for an update, it was clear the comedy of the situation was wearing thin for Moss. She is looking forward, she said, to \u201cbeing out of this situation and to be in a position to reflect back on it. When you are in it, the stress is hard to manage.\u201d Friday was the day she was due to disembark; her plan was to spend a few days with collaborators in Shanghai before flying home to London. \u201cNow this is looking somewhat unlikely.\u201d Quite enough absurdity for one lifetime.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> All at sea</p>",

Next week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic challenger whose campaign was powered by young people and students, will campaign for Clinton in the coming days.</p> <p>\u201cElections aren\u2019t just about who votes but who doesn\u2019t vote,\u201d she said, imploring the young people in the crowd to support Clinton.

  "<p>There is rarely room for sentiment in the harsh environment of the tennis court, even when two friends find themselves on opposite sides of the net, and there was no danger of Gordon Reid allowing compassion to cloud his vision when he collected his first Paralympic gold medal at the expense of Alfie Hewett, his doubles partner and ParalympicsGB team-mate.</p> <p>To choose a life as a tennis player is to accept a largely lonely existence during the heat of battle and Reid, the owner of four grand slam titles across singles and doubles this year, was merciless in dispatching his young friend, beating him 6-2, 6-1 in under an hour in the wheelchair tennis final.</p> <p>A day after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/15/gb-alfie-hewett-gordon-reid-silver-wheelchair-doubles\" title=\"\">fell short against France\u2019s St\u00e9phane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer</a> in the doubles final Reid and Hewett were back on Centre Court. There is an iron bond between a pair dubbed Heid by their supporters, forged in their victory over Houdet and Peifer in the Wimbledon final in July, and their mutual affection for each other always shines brightly when they are together off court.</p> <p>They shared a tender embrace at the net when a return from Hewett sailed long to bring an end to 54 minutes of one-sided tennis. It is, after all, only a game, nothing to fall out over. They even bumped into each other in the physio room before the match.</p> <p>\u201cWe kind of swiftly decided to move to a different room,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because we\u2019ve come through a lot together in the last two years; we\u2019ve had a lot of highs together. It\u2019s difficult to put all that to one side, especially after playing the final together last night. We work with the same coaches, having to fit our warm-ups around each other. Nobody had a clue what to do but you\u2019re playing to win.\u201d</p> <p>And that was Reid\u2019s plan. After Andy Murray\u2019s victory in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/andy-murray-beats-juan-martin-del-potro-rio-2016\" title=\"\">Olympic final over Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro</a> last month, another Scot topped the podium on Centre Court.</p> <p>Reid has had a wonderful year since ending his wait for a grand slam singles title at the Australian Open in January. The Glaswegian, who also won the French Open with Japan\u2019s Shingo Kunieda, backed up his Melbourne breakthrough at SW19. Now he is a Paralympic champion, with the promise of more trophies and garlands to come.</p> <p>\u201cI hate losing,\u201d Hewett said. But he was comprehensively beaten here. Still, Hewett deserves credit for providing more evidence of his vast potential in the past week. The 18-year-old has had time of his life in Rio and has two silver medals to show for his worthy efforts.</p> <p>Ever so briefly, it seemed that a proper contest was on the cards when Hewett earned an early break in the first set. But such impertinence would not be tolerated by a player who is six years his senior. Reid was soon back on level terms, drawing a forehand error from Hewett, who would pocket only one more game in the entire match.</p> <p>Reid was superior in every department, hitting the ball flatter and harder, moving better, showing greater variety and pushing Hewett around the court. Just as in the doubles, Hewett\u2019s serve was vulnerable under pressure. Reid swatted a forehand return away to take the first set.</p> <p>An increasingly sympathetic crowd tried to encourage Hewett who desperately wanted to prolong the fight. But it was a lost cause. Reid was too good. The consolation for Hewett is that he is not the first person to find that out.</p>",

We have also been in contact with the four most recently affected athletes this evening and have offered our support. We spent yesterday contacting Team GB athletes about the possibility of their TUE data being released and we will continue to keep our athletes and stakeholders apprised as more information becomes available. It is incomprehensible that someone would use athletes\u2019 personal information to try to undermine the global anti-doping system. These athletes have obtained TUEs through a robust and independent system. The use of TUEs is not a doping offence, and all of these athletes have legitimately applied for, and been granted, medical support within the anti-doping rules.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When Donald Trump went to Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday in his first visit to the city since lead was detected in the water in 2014, he began, inappropriately enough, with a joke.</p> <p>\u201cIt used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint,\u201d Trump said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-visit-water-plant-tour\">Flint residents bristle at Donald Trump's visit to beleaguered city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his appearance at a Methodist church Wednesday, Trump added that the lead poisoning \u201cwould have never happened if I were president\u201d. On the contrary: under a president Trump, what happened in Flint could happen everywhere. It would be the inevitable outcome of what is quite possibly the only Trump policy we can be sure of: radical deregulation.</p> <p>Look at what happened in Flint in the 1980s: when nearly all of General Motors\u2019 plants in the city were either deemed to be noncompliant or flagged for potential noncompliance with EPA regulations, GM started closing its plants rather than face increasing labor and cleanup costs, according to <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11117022/flint-michigan-water-crisis-lead-pollution-history\">an investigation</a> into the source of the Flint water contamination by the Verge. (Industry is not to blame for the whole water-poisoning debacle, but neither is it innocent.)<br></p> <p>Local officials were more worried about saving money than protecting the safety of Flint residents. But they didn\u2019t poison the water to begin with \u2013 a whole structural array of forces did, including Trump\u2019s beloved private sector dumping untreated waste.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the best check on the kind of gross state and local government mismanagement that we saw in Michigan is the EPA. The problem in Flint was not what the EPA did; it\u2019s what it didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s that the EPA was by an order of magnitude far too weak and inactive.<br></p> <p>As Joel Beauvais, head of the agency\u2019s water office put it in <a href=\"http://www.clickondetroit.com/live/watch-live-house-oversight-committee-holds-hearing-on-flint-water-crisis\">his testimony</a> before the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, the EPA urged local authorities to address the lack of corrosion control in Flint\u2019s water, \u201cBut (the EPA) encountered resistance.\u201d</p> <p>If Trump had his way, the agency would be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-says-hed-eliminate-department-of-environment-protection/article/2584908\">gutted</a> entirely. And that gets to the heart of what\u2019s so terrifying about a potential Trump presidency.</p> <p>Set aside the outlandish racism \u2013 the calls to build a wall on the border and seize oil in the Middle East \u2013 and his campaign is still in essence a Mitt Romney-esque embrace of right-wing deregulation.</p> <p>He\u2019s not trying to hide that fact. After leaving Flint, he turned around the very next day to condemn the EPA\u2019s Clean Water Rule in a speech in New York Thursday, and earlier this year, Trump lackey Chris Christie discussed Trump\u2019s desire to fire federal workers at the EPA and other regulatory agencies, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">replacing them with CEOs</a>.</p> <p>As New York magazine <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/trump-hopes-to-purge-civil-service-of-democrats.html\">noted at the time</a>, \u201cIn Trump\u2019s America, progressives won\u2019t have to worry about former banking executives regulating their old colleagues \u2014 active CEOs will be doing that for their current ones.\u201d (You might replace \u201cprogressives\u201d with any old human worried about being poisoned.)</p> <p>Perhaps Christie\u2019s own abysmal record on clean water is worth mentioning as well. He recently vetoed a bill aimed at protecting children from lead poisoning in a cost-cutting measure that protects his budget, uncannily similar to the cardinal sin of local officials in Flint. Under Christie\u2019s administration, environmental inspections and enforcements have been slashed by at least 60%, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/02/flint_can_happen_in_nj_with_christie_siding_with_water_polluters_opinion.html\">according to</a> the New Jersey Star-Ledger. </p> <p>But let\u2019s keep the focus on Trump. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/john-doe-files-scott-walker-wisconsin\">the John Doe papers</a> leaked in the Guardian this week, Trump donated to the third-party group of a special prosecutor accused of coordinating with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s recall campaign along with, guess who? The head of a lead paint company facing millions in lawsuits from poisoned residents.</p> <p>Walker would later sign off on legislation granting effective immunity to the lead paint industry (the law was later <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/report-scott-walker-wisconsin-club-for-growth-received-support-from/article_b805be8e-b7f7-5b07-a7a6-682e1f4847f8.html\">blocked</a> by a federal court). And though Trump was not directly involved with that issue, he was broadly on their side of the political battle, donating $15,000 to the group at the center of the investigation. As in Flint, the population most affected was poor children.</p> <p>Defunding federal regulatory agencies like the EPA is simply easier to do as the country\u2019s chief executive than anything else Trump is proposing \u2013 Congress is <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/245137-house-panel-approves-3017b-bill-to-cut-epa-funds-block-climate\">already halfway there</a>. The upshot is the most tangible policy behind the plan to make America Great Again at this point is to let America\u2019s kids be poisoned, again. The proof is looking at us in Flint.</p>",

  "<p>Shares in Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, took a dive after news that the institution faces a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) charge over mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. Here are some of the questions raised by the bank\u2019s latest spat with regulators.</p> <h2><strong>Why is Deutsche Bank in trouble?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/european-banking-shares-unsettled-by-deutsche-bank-fine-fears\">The prospect of a $14bn penalty from the US Department of Justice has rattled investor confidence</a> in Deutsche. Sentiment was already weak following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/deutsche-boss-tells-staff-the-bank-is-rock-solid\">turbulent start to the year</a> when prospects of a slowdown in global growth and lower interest rates raised questions about the bank\u2019s future profits and dented the share price. The penalty aims to settle allegations, dating back to 2005, about the way the bank selected mortgages, packaged them into bonds and sold on to investors. These bonds are known as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). </p> <h2><strong>Can Deutsche afford the bill?</strong></h2> <p>Deutsche Bank has been quick to describe the fine as an \u201copening position\u201d from Washington. It is easy to see why. It would be one of the largest ever fines levied by the US. It could also strain the bank\u2019s finances. For 2015, the bank reported its first annual loss since 2008 and could be heading for another loss this year regardless of the threatened justice department fine. According to Tomas Kinmonth<strong>, </strong>an analyst at Dutch bank ABN Amro, a settlement on that scale could impede Deutsche\u2019s ability to pay coupons \u2013 or regular interest payments to investors \u2013 on a special type of bond. \u201cNot only are clouds over their profitability still above them, but the fine announcement will come as very unwanted news indeed,\u201d said Kinmonth. The bonds are known as AT1s, which are intended to shore up Deutsche in a time of crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-must-pay-14bn-fine-to-settle-us-mortgage-case\">The bank, though, has made clear it has no intention of agreeing to a fine at this level </a>and has stressed it has the resources to keep making payments on the bonds until 2017, at least. However, one analyst told Reuters that any fine topping \u20ac5bn would force it to raise fresh funds in the financial markets by tapping shareholders for cash. </p> <h2><strong>Is this the end of Deutsche Bank\u2019s regulator troubles?</strong></h2> <p>The bank has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for litigation costs but does not spell out exactly what that sum is for. It is battling more than 7,000 legal cases, although the ones gaining most attention are the RMBS case and one relating to activities in Russia, where the bank is facing an investigation into so-called mirror trades, where clients bought shares in Russia and simultaneously sold similar shares abroad in foreign currency. Regulators are investigating whether or not these trades skirted international sanctions against Russia by turning Russia-held roubles into dollars held outside the country. </p> <h2><strong>Why have shares in RBS taken a dive as well?</strong></h2> <p>For at least a year, the bailed-out UK bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/30/royal-bank-of-scotland-expects-further-fines-dividend-delay\">has been warning the City it faces a penalty over RMBS</a>. Only<a href=\"http://investors.rbs.com/~/media/Files/R/RBS-IR/results-center/barclays-conference-slides-12-sep-2016.pdf\"> on Monday</a>, finance director Ewen Stevenson told investors that its $5.6bn provision for various claims relating to these mortgage bonds might not be enough. \u201cThis provision does not include or reflect potential penalties and compensatory damages that may be imposed by US DoJ, which may be substantial,\u201d Stevenson said. The potential scale of the penalty facing Deutsche has raised anxiety about the possible fine facing RBS, which is 73% owned by taxpayers and yet to make an annual profit since its bailout in 2008.</p> <h2><strong>Could other European banks be affected? </strong></h2> <p>Deutsche is the first European bank that appears to have started talks with the DoJ over RMBS. Barclays and the Swiss bank UBS are among others waiting for settlement talks to be concluded. Their shares also fell on Friday.</p>",

The Everglades, deprived of this natural flow, is also threatened by sea level rise and invasive species. </p> <p>Florida lawmakers who were instrumental in pushing for the Everglades restoration hailed Thursday\u2019s development as a major obstacle overcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ba7ea83653d50658d6d7ff6552abba4ca15b11d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba7ea83653d50658d6d7ff6552abba4ca15b11d/0_0_1321_2247/588.jpg\" alt=\"florida everglades\" width=\"588\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of Florida Everglades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Everglades Planning Project</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a huge victory,\u201d said Florida senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat. \u201cThis project will enable us to take a significant step forward in restoring the natural water flow to a water-starved Everglades national park.\u201d</p> <p>Marco Rubio, Florida\u2019s other senator, said the project was \u201cthe single largest thing that\u2019s gotten done\u201d on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been tied up in this long-term morass, and it doesn\u2019t solve every problem, but it\u2019s the single biggest Everglades restoration project that Congress has finally made progress on,\u201d the former Republican presidential candidate told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cYou can start to see where we\u2019ll be in a decade or less, and it\u2019s a much better place than the Everglades and its surrounding communities are today.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson and Rubio were early co-sponsors of legislation to advance the Central Everglades Planning Project and have routinely emphasized the urgency of the issue. Rubio also persuaded Jim Inhofe, the chairman of the environment and public works committee that crafted the overall water bill, to back the project and reverse his longstanding opposition to Everglades restoration.</p> <p>Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma who in 2000 was the lone senator to vote against Everglades funding, explained his change of heart in an <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article100711007.html\">op-ed for the Miami Herald</a> that also cited the degradation caused by algae blooms.</p> <p>More than half of the original Everglades has been destroyed to make way for industry and urban development. Thousands of acres of wetlands have been drained, with more than 1,400 miles of canals snaking through the area in order to divert water.</p> <p>Some environmentalists have welcomed the plan as long overdue assistance for the Everglades. But others have criticized the planning project for not including any restoration of lost habitat.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be more clean water for the Everglades but not nearly enough as most of it will still be discharged into the ocean,\u201d said Matthew Schwartz, executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association.</p> <p>\u201cWith those billions of dollars they should be buying key pieces of agricultural land in order to bring back natural wetlands. That is what true Everglades restoration would be. Rather than just pushing dirt around we need the wetlands back to clean the water.</p> <p>\u201cWe are turning one of the world\u2019s great wetlands into a development. People come here to look at herons and manatees, not reservoirs and housing. You can\u2019t do much once the land has become a Target shopping center, but agricultural land can be converted back.\u201d </p> <p>But Rubio said the sugar industry, as well as other smaller businesses, have been unfairly targeted by green activists.</p> <p>\u201cThey want to turn these communities into ghost towns, and they want to take these people out of business, all for something that isn\u2019t going to in the end solve the problem,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The House of Representatives is expected to take up its own version of the water bill, which similarly includes a $1.95bn authorization toward the Central Everglades, as early as next week. Bill Shuster, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania who chairs the relevant committee in the House, said he was optimistic Congress would send final legislation to Barack Obama\u2019s desk by the end of the year.</p> <p>Backers of the planning project acknowledged the work was only just beginning. But they praised this week\u2019s step as the first major increment toward long-term restoration.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that the Central Everglades Planning Project may be to date the single biggest step we have taken toward Everglades restoration,\u201d said Shannon Estenoz, director of Everglades Restoration for the US Department of Interior.</p> <p>At a time when Congress has become near synonymous with gridlock, Estenoz praised the rare show of bipartisanship that enabled Everglades supporters to cross this hurdle. </p> <p>\u201cThe Florida delegation have been staunch supporters of the Everglades and so they get a lot of credit, particularly the south Florida delegation and both of our senators,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the heart of restoring the River of Grass.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Dante\u2019s Inferno makes little mention of those who profit from the work of others, but cult indie director Abel Ferrara once predicted a special place in the pit of suffering for anyone who dared to remake his classic films.

After selling the rights to the space opera in 2012, he tried his best not to meddle, taking Disney\u2019s decision not to use any of his ideas for a new trilogy good grace and promising instead to return to making \u201cexperimental\u201d movies like his early trifle THX 1138.

I don\u2019t like that.\u201d He pointed out that he had worked constantly to innovate during his six-film run in charge of Star Wars, \u201cwith different planets, with different spaceships \u2013 you know, to make it new\u201d. Lucas later apologised to Disney for the \u201cwhite slavers\u201d comment, saying that he had used a \u201cvery inappropriate analogy\u201d.</p> <h2>Alan Parker on the remake of Fame</h2> <p>Despite the director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/24/fame-review\">the 2009 reworking</a>, Kevin Tancharoen, having claimed that Alan Parker was on board, the Bafta-winning British film-maker behind Bugsy Malone and Mississippi Burning likened the experience of finding out his work was to be revisited to being mugged. \u201cI have never had a single phone call from anyone \u2013 the studio, the producers \u2013 about this remake.

I spent months with the kids at the school then spent a year making the movie. You do the work and make it as good as it can be, and you try to protect it.

The thing we did with the second film is that we reinvented the first film completely; spun it on its ass and made the Terminator the good guy, and came up with a whole new concept for a villain. It felt fresh. I didn\u2019t feel the fourth picture was fresh enough. It also lacked a certain stamp of authenticity because Arnold wasn\u2019t in it. I mean, he was in it briefly, digitally, but that\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was bad,\u201d Cameron continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was embarrassing. I don\u2019t think he let the franchise down in some huge way, but I did feel some sort of unease.\u201d</p> <p>If you think that sounds like damning with faint praise, Cameron, the director of 1986\u2019s brilliant Alien sequel Aliens, was less positive about the first Alien v Predator movie in 2006. \u201cThey\u2019ve really screwed up the whole franchise,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKnS7CGWNmU\">he told the Daily Habit</a>. </p> <p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqgdNVTcRA\">Cameron did quite like recent Terminator effort Genisys</a>, praising its innovation and even <a href=\"http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/terminator/32579/james-cameron-on-arnold-schwarzeneggers-ageing-terminator\">contributing a theory about the cyborg ageing process</a> that allowed Schwarzenegger to return as a really knackered T-800. It\u2019s just unfortunate that no one else felt the same way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/24/global-box-office-terminator-genisys-bride-wars-hitman-agent-47\">Bar the Chinese</a>.<br></p> <h2>George A Romero on the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead</h2> <p>Long before Zack Snyder was handed the keys to the DC expanded universe of superhero movies, the former commercials director began his movie-making career with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping7\">a remake</a> of George Romero\u2019s Dawn of the Dead (1978). But zombie movie guru Romero wondered why Snyder excised all the satirical gravy from the original, in which the undead\u2019s surrounding of a shopping mall is a metaphor for the soulless consumerism of American society.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe first 15, 20 minutes were terrific, but it sort of lost its reason for being,\u201d he told Simon Pegg <a href=\"http://www.eatmybrains.com/shownews.php?id=463\">in an interview for Time Out in 2005</a>. \u201cIt was more of a video game. I\u2019m not terrified of things running at me; it\u2019s like Space Invaders. There was nothing going on underneath.\u201d</p> <p>Continuing his theme, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10436738/George-A-Romero-Why-I-dont-like-The-Walking-Dead.html\">Romero told the Telegraph in 2013</a>: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it very much. Basically, because I was using the idea for satire. My film needed to be done right when it was done, because that sort of shopping mall was completely new. It was the first one in Pennsylvania that we had ever seen. The heart of the story is based in that. And I didn\u2019t think the remake had it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--IIwV_Y6VU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/--IIwV_Y6VU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dawn of the Dead (2004)</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Robin Hardy on the 2006 remake of The Wicker Man</h2> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what they are doing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/13/news1\">Hardy told the Scotland on Sunday newspaper in 2005</a> when confronted with the news of Neil LaBute\u2019s reworking of his 1973 cult horror classic. \u201cIt appears that not only is the lady involved, but there are also attacks by killer bees, which sounds like a really old-style horror film.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the only consolation for the English film-maker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/04/robin-hardy-obituary\">who died in July</a>, is that critics and audiences poured scorn on the remake in equal measure. The film was nominated for five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/13/razzies-golden-raspberry-film-awards-brian-de-palma\">Golden Raspberries</a>, including worst actor for star Nicolas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1GadTfGFvU\">\u201cNot the bees!\u201d</a> Cage, and only \u201clost out\u201d on best film due to the unfortunate existence of Basic Instinct 2.</p>",

It\u2019s in that context that the hype for the original Blair Witch Project should be remembered \u2013 it\u2019s almost inconceivable that a marketing campaign which hinges on suggesting to the public that the events contained in a horror film are real could succeed now, when a simple Google would reveal the actors\u2019 digital footprint for all to see.

Two other photographers are shortlisted: Kovi Konowiecki for his series on Orthodox Jews around the world; and Claudio Rasano for a student in his school uniform.

People generally, acting together through mechanisms such as participatory budgets or citizens' assemblies chosen by lot - are far wiser than elites chosen by elections. Everything stems from this - not least the accepted lunacy mindset that locks us into policies of economic growth versus stable-state economies.</p> <p>Without changing our disastrously dysfunctional governments - and very rapidly too - we are doomed as a species.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <ul> <li>What do you think?

I believe Conservatives already have to win fewer votes per seat anyway, the reason the polling average favours Labour is precisely because they have far too much support in areas where they don't need it and lesser support where they need it.

  "<p>When Mark Hodson gets on his bike in the morning, like many cyclists in the UK, he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/24/cycling-near-miss-close-pass-road-rage\">come to expect a few close calls</a>. Perhaps drivers will whizz past him too close, or someone will even try a \u2018punishment pass\u2019.</p> <p>Luckily, Hodson is a West Midlands Police traffic officer, albeit in plain clothes, and just yards up the road a colleague in a police car is waiting to pull over drivers that give him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/aug/11/how-to-overtake-cyclists-the-video-all-drivers-should-watch\">less than 1.5m space when overtaking</a> (a distance that increases for faster speeds and larger vehicles). </p> <p>That driver will be offered a choice: prosecution, or 15 minutes\u2019 education on how to overtake a cyclist safely. The worst drivers, or repeat offenders, will simply be prosecuted. </p> <p>This tactic is part of a ground breaking new initiative launched by West Midlands Police, in partnership with Birmingham City Council, to tackle cycling safety. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/aug/11/how-to-overtake-cyclists-the-video-all-drivers-should-watch\">How to overtake cyclists \u2013 the video all drivers should watch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Highway Code states drivers should give cyclists at least the same amount of space as they would give a car, but often this is not the case. Over four trial days ahead of the scheme\u2019s launch 80 people were pulled over for close passes. </p> <p>This morning Hodson and his colleagues pulled over eight offenders within an hour \u2013 people who could have been prosecuted for their driving. Among those stopped were lorry drivers, and a pupil under supervision by a driving instructor.</p> <p>In many cases drivers just aren\u2019t looking out for cyclists.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe last two drivers we pulled over, we asked: \u2018do you know how far away you were from the cyclist\u2019, and they said \u2018what cyclist?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One of those was the driver of a 7.5 tonne vehicle. </p> <p>Responding to the 530 cyclists killed or seriously injured on West Midlands roads over four years, Hodson and fellow traffic officer, Steve Hudson, asked the Central Motorway Police Group to analyse collision data from the region.</p> <p>They found about 70% of collisions involving cyclists occur at junctions, most involve a motor vehicle, and in most cases occur because drivers failed to see a cyclist. </p> <p>\u201cWe needed to do something about driver behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cIn about 98% of cases [the collision] was down to driver action, it was nothing to do with the cyclist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are some of the highest trained road users,\u201d he said of himself and his fellow officers. \u201cWe can anticipate anything and everything, but what we can never account for is if someone hits you from behind.\u201d</p> <p>This tactic will now become part of normal police business in the West Midlands and, after an initial three-month blitz, officers will move beyond the education phase to enforcement only, by which point Hodson says people should have got the message to drive safely. Then, if anyone is caught overtaking Hodson or one of his colleagues, they will be prosecuted.</p> <p>As Hodson puts it: \u201cIt is the fear of prosecution that stops drivers committing offences, it is a fact of British driving.\u201d</p> <p>Going forward, close passes will be targeted periodically in the same way drink driving is, across the West Midlands. </p> <p>Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK\u2019s senior road safety and legal campaigner, praised the initiative. \u201cThis is the first time a police force has come forward with a plan to prioritise enforcement against close pass drivers. It is quite simply the best cyclist safety initiative by any police force, ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"683f802c613e8b4d7bc953d05e33b5c87af7757d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/683f802c613e8b4d7bc953d05e33b5c87af7757d/0_4_746_447/500.jpg\" alt=\"Police say that in many cases drivers just aren\u2019t looking out for cyclists\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police say that in many cases drivers just aren\u2019t looking out for cyclists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of WMP Traffic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He called the mix of education and enforcement \u201ca simple but effective way to combat a long-standing concern\u201d. He hopes other police forces around the country will follow their lead and is going to approach five police and crime commissioners looking for cost-effective ways to tackle road danger, with the \u2018blueprint\u2019 from the West Midlands. </p> <p>He says the operation is cheap \u2013 costing \u00a370 for a mat to demonstrate safe overtaking plus a police or community support officer to be the cyclist \u2013 and efficient: based on the West Midlands\u2019 experience, 20 drivers can be prosecuted within two hours. </p> <p>When asked whether it could be rolled out nationwide, a National Police Chiefs Council spokesperson said: \u201cPolice forces are committed to keeping the roads safe. Individual forces are always looking for the best ways to help their local communities, and the West Midlands initiative is a positive step. All forces aim to develop new and effective means of keeping people safe on their roads.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When I tell people that I am in charge of documentary films at the Guardian, it can cause some confusion: it is normally only broadcasters who have documentary departments. </p> <p>This week the Guardian is reaffirming its commitment to documentary with the launch of our new documentary strand. We\u2019ll be releasing monthly films on our website, each lasting about 20 minutes. Online, even five minutes is considered a challenging length for viewers, but we believe there is an audience for these longer, more considered films. </p> <p>News organisations with their roots in print can often approach documentaries as if they are extended news articles. We\u2019re trying to do more than that with these documentaries, which tell complex stories from around the world. They\u2019re not intended to replace text articles or news videos, we just recognise that these stories are best suited to film, where a short scene can tell you as much as thousands of words. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/sep/16/gun-nation-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-americas-gun-culture-video\">Gun nation: a journey to the heart of America's gun culture \u2013 video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first of these documentaries is called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/sep/16/gun-nation-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-americas-gun-culture-video\">Gun Nation</a>. It\u2019s a film about guns in America, and we wanted to get beyond the typical polemic focused on only victims and anti-gun campaigners. Instead, director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zed-nelson\">Zed Nelson</a> captured unguarded interviews with the Americans who use guns every day, as well as one affected by disaster. It starts from a place of an outsider\u2019s bewilderment and asks gun-lovers \u201cDon\u2019t you want a solution too?\u201d</p> <p>As with other Guardian documentaries, Gun Nation is made by an independent film-maker and production company. I receive pitches from all over the world; it\u2019s part of my job to spend time travelling, meeting independent voices. It\u2019s important we don\u2019t just commission the loudest voices, so that sometimes means working with emerging talent and helping them develop their ideas. </p> <p>The Guardian is part of a small movement of print organisations including the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Economist and Der Spiegel that are serious about making documentary and other video content. I admire what these other organisations are doing, but I want the Guardian to offer stories that feel different and really tell you something new.</p> <p>How do we do that? I hope by commissioning film-makers who have spent long periods in communities that are difficult for us to reach and are dedicated to following theese stories from start to end. Working <a href=\"http://www.documentary.org/feature/how-bertha-foundation-has-transformed-global-nonfiction-media-landscape-0\">with Bertha Foundation</a>, a social justice organisation, we want to give a platform to voices that don\u2019t get heard enough and for stories outside the news cycle, which means minimising voiceover and letting characters speak for themselves.</p> <p>Getting a film to screen is a long process. Gun Nation was in planning for a year, shooting lasted for six weeks, and the edit took more than three months. All that to make a documentary of just under 30 minutes. Zed and our editor, Noah, started the edit with hours and hours of footage. As well as the 12 characters featured in the film, we had talked to another 10 from across the country, including survivors of gun violence. </p> <p>Sifting and logging this material so we can work out the structure of the film takes weeks \u2013 it is in the process of trimming, refining and rearranging that the documentary really gets made. The background to Gun Nation was <a href=\"http://www.zednelson.com/?GunNationTheBook\">Zed\u2019s photo project</a> of the same name made at the turn of the millennium and, in our documentary, Zed pays a return visit to the subjects of his portraits. We hoped to balance this with a wider story of America in crisis. </p> <p>I come from a background in the documentary industry, and I am all too aware of how few documentaries reach a broad audience. Some make it to Netflix, Amazon or iTunes, some are screened on the BBC\u2019s Storyville, some find other ways to reach viewers. Unless you go to film festivals or you live in a big city, trust the algorithms or already know what you\u2019re looking for, you can miss many of the great ones.</p> <p>This is frustrating for film-makers, who spend years developing, shooting and editing these films. They want to reach as big an audience as possible but, among the massive diversity of films online, documentaries have to fight for attention and can struggle. We\u2019re trying to do something about that.</p> <p>I probably get pitched more than a thousand documentaries a year. Nearly all of them sound as if they would tell important or entertaining stories, but I can make only a fraction of them. We\u2019ve got documentaries coming from Peru, Hong Kong, Sudan, Italy, Australia and more besides. Some are worrying, some are uplifting, some you won\u2019t know how to feel about, but they\u2019re all united by being stories that could be neglected if we didn\u2019t cover them in depth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04d8d15485a30bea8327009a846a059813ce8698\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04d8d15485a30bea8327009a846a059813ce8698/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside gun shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gun Nation features unguarded interviews with Americans who use guns every day</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zed Nelson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It feels important that the Guardian commits itself to these stories, because documentaries can pull attention to big issues and stories in a way other formats can\u2019t. </p> <p>A one-off documentary such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/26/blackfish-video-review\">Blackfish</a>, or a series like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/07/making-a-murderer-the-netflix-documentary-beating-tv-drama-at-its-own-game\">Netflix\u2019s Making a Murderer</a> shows that documentaries can prompt change and provoke debate on a huge scale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/14/act-of-killing-review\">The Act of Killing</a>, for instance, brought the Indonesian genocide of the 1960s to an international audience who would otherwise remained ignorant, and did it while breaking the boundaries of what a documentary could look like. </p> <p>I love documentary in its ever-evolving shapes, and I think I\u2019m not the only one. Online audiences, particularly younger ones, are watching documentaries that stimulate political thought and action. And the ethos of the documentary industry has a lot in common with the principles of the Guardian \u2013 a commitment to truth, a commitment to rigorous research, a commitment to independence. <br></p> <p>I hope you enjoy our new documentaries as they are lunched on the website in the next year. And I hope also that you will suggest the stories, people and places we should look to for our next commissions.</p>",
  "<p>My partner, Bob Gannicott, who has died of leukaemia aged 69, was an adventurer and prospector who emigrated from the UK to Canada with \u00a3100 in his pocket but made a fortune after he was instrumental in establishing the Canadian diamond industry.</p> <p>Bob was born in Sandford, Somerset, the son of Ida, a teacher, and Ivor, an engineer who had served on submarines during the second world war. Bob passed the 11-plus and went from grammar school to Nottingham University to study mining engineering, but dropped out to go to Canada on a \u00a310 emigration ticket (repayable if he returned).</p> <p>He and I had been together since we were 15, our parents being neighbours. We were two sides of the same coin, spending most weekends caving in the Mendip hills. I agreed to join him in Canada on finishing my degree, but he lost faith that I would do so and he met and married someone else. I also married, had children and subsequently divorced. We had no contact for 30 years.</p> <p>By hitchhiking and riding freight trains, Bob made his way to Yellowknife, in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, initially to work in the area\u2019s goldmines. But he also staked some claims of his own and one of these, made when he was just 19, was 25 years later to become Canada\u2019s first diamond mine, the Diavik.</p> <p>He meanwhile went back to university, Carleton in Ottawa, to obtain a geology degree, and then spent many years mining in Greenland. He loved the isolation of the Arctic wilderness. Returning eventually to the Northwest Territories, he forged a partnership to search for diamonds and ultimately struck lucky on his old claim.</p> <p>With his growing wealth, Bob \u2013 a great visionary and strategist \u2013 saw an opportunity to change the culture of the global diamond industry. He acquired the famous but struggling American jewellery business Harry Winston, and grew the brand. In this way he \u201cbookended\u201d the industry and became ideally placed to challenge the primacy of the De Beers group. He eventually sold Harry Winston to Swatch Group in 2013.</p> <p>Bob had meanwhile moved his new company, Dominion Diamonds, from Toronto to Yellowknife to create employment for local indigenous people, for whose rights he had long campaigned.</p> <p>He had divorced and asked me for a second time to make a life with him, despite my having been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease. I stood down from my role as head of the Charity Commission and we got together, spending half the year in the Northwest Territories and half in Somerset.</p> <p>Canada is now the world\u2019s third largest producer of diamonds. A foundation is to be set up in Bob\u2019s name to continue his work for the indigenous people of the Northwest Territories.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110,000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/14/outgoing-obama-plans-to-increase-refugees-by-twenty-nine-percent-next-year/\">furious</a> reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history.</p> <p>As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the \u201cJacobin\u201d ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than fairer-skinned immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone.</p> <p>Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama\u2019s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10,000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state.</p> <p>Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40,000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy.</p> <p>As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110,000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America\u2019s goal has been 85,000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States. </p> <p>In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25,000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canada\u2019s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups, parent-teacher associations and other non-governmental organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools. </p> <p>Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed. </p> <p>I don\u2019t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the president\u2019s modest proposal.</p>",

When the annual general meeting season started in April, shareholders <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\">voted down pay deals at BP and medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew</a>. Other revolts followed. </p> <p>The BIS committee intends to look at whether this is evidence that shareholders have all the tools they need to rein in pay.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there has been some recent shareholder actions against these ever larger pay packages, can we have any confidence that the current framework for controlling pay is working? As a committee, we will want to look at whether executive pay should take account of companies\u2019 long-term performance and whether the government should intervene further to control executive pay,\u201d said Wright.</p> <p>LGIM is largely building upon the recommendations of a working group, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/executive-pay-city-report-stops-short-of-backing-binding-shareholder-votes\">published its findings in July </a>and in which L&amp;G chief executive Nigel Wilson played a key role. That group rejected May\u2019s ideas for a binding vote on pay deals and did not set out how much directors should be paid.</p> <p>LGIM does not set a level of pay either but told companies: \u201cWe would encourage the reduction of short-term annual bonus levels. Two hundred percent of salary should be reserved for the largest global companies.\u201d </p> <p>Annual bonuses are only part of directors\u2019 pay as many also also receive long-term incentive (LTIPs) awards in the form of shares over three- or five-year periods.</p> <p>The working group in July set out an idea to use restricted shares instead of LTIPs and other bonuses. LGIM gives this a cautious reception and when these are used they should be fewer of them than through traditional LTIPs. \u201cAward levels should be reduced by 50% or more of the normal long term incentive grant to take in to account certainty,\u201d LGIM said.</p> <p>Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory body Manifest, said LGIM was addressing how much the chief executive is paid relative to the rest of the executive directors.</p> <p>Not all investors endorse the idea of pay ratios. Referring to the BIS committee investigation, Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cWhile we support the investigation we are concerned it could lead to support for a \u2018pay ratio\u2019 which we believe is a crude measure that risks tarring well governed firms with the same brush as those with a flagrant disregard for what is acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Data published by the High Pay Centre and Manifest last year showed that the ratio of chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014. The High Pay Centre is setting up a \u201c40 times\u201d club, referring to a specific ratio of executive pay to the wider workforce, of which only a handful of FTSE 100 companies would be members. </p>",
  "<p>Flash flooding, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/16/torrential-rain-travel-chaos-england-floods\">struck a swathe of southern and eastern England</a> on Friday, is a greater threat to homes, roads and railways than river or coastal flooding. Yet it was completely excluded from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/flooding-uk-government-plans-for-more-extreme-rainfall\">National Flood Resilience Review, published last week</a>.</p> <p>Worse, the risk of flash flooding is rising, as climate change leads to more intense, more frequent rainstorms: the Met Office has shown that <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2013/2012-weather-statistics\">extremely wet days have become more common</a>. On Friday, half a month\u2019s rain was dumped in one day.</p> <p>The problem is the overloading of Britain\u2019s antiquated drainage and sewer networks, compounded by the continued concreting over of land for development. The surface water can neither be absorbed or quickly drained away, leading to flash floods.</p> <p>Ministers cannot say they were not warned. Flash flooding was the principal cause of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_United_Kingdom_floods\">most damaging floods in UK history</a>, which in 2007 caused over \u00a33bn of damage, caused 13 deaths and was classified by the Environment Agency (EA) as a \u201cnational disaster\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://watermaps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiyby.aspx?topic=ufmfsw#x=357683&amp;y=355134&amp;scale=2\">new maps</a> from the EA showed 3m properties were at risk from flash flooding in England, compared to 2m from river and coastal flooding. Most insurance claims made each year for flood damage are because of flash floods and there are at least 20,000 sewer overflows a year in the UK.</p> <p>Risks to transport have also been identified: <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/publications/weather-and-climate-change-resilience/\">Network Rail is monitoring 200 \u201chigh risk\u201d earthworks</a> \u2013 embankments and cuttings vulnerable to washing away. In April the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/10/57-tube-stations-high-risk-flooding-london-underground-report?CMP=share_btn_tw\">57 tube stations are at high risk of flash flooding</a>, including Manor House which flooded on Friday. The London Underground report said it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before serious flooding strikes.</p> <p>After the 2007 disaster, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/25/flooding.weather2\">Pitt review</a> led to new laws in 2010 to implement the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_drainage_system\">sustainable drainage systems</a>, which provide safe areas for water to pond. But the provisions were never implemented and instead a voluntary system asking developers to follow these practices was put in place.</p> <p>But it has not worked: the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), found that just 15% of planning applications in areas of flood risk incorporate sustainable drainage measures and in 2015 the CCC <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-further-measures-needed-to-promote-sustainable-drainage-in-new-development/\">warned ministers their plans were inadequate</a>. However, in May, the government successfully <a href=\"http://www.hortweek.com/suds-loses-housing-planning-bill-passed-law/landscape/article/1394920\">opposed a plan to make sustainable drainage compulsory</a>, and to make developers increase the capacity of drains to which new homes are connected.</p> <p>\u201cThe National Flood Resilience Review team was told it was a mistake to exclude surface water flooding from consideration on the basis that the last two major flood events had been river flooding,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>\u201cWe know our major cities, including London, are vulnerable to surface water problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the UK remains at risk because the government refuses to confront the problem. The main problem is the inadequacy of the drainage system, which even nine years after the 2007 floods are still not up to the task.\u201d</p> <p>The EA maps shows that one home in particular is at risk of flash flooding: No 10 Downing Street. Perhaps this might spur prime minister Theresa May to finally take meaningful action.</p>",
  "<p>I am late with my contribution to the revitalised grammar school debate, but I\u2019ll continue as I have a relatively unusual perspective for a broadsheet columnist \u2013 in the 70s I went to a working-class grammar. Some of the children there were middle class, but most were from my background \u2013 a few violent skinheads, quite a lot of indifferent yobs, and a small number of bright, ambitious kids. I suppose I was one of them, although I tried to hide my intelligence. \u201cYou swallow a dictionary, or something?\u201d was the customary aggressive challenge to my&#xa0;loquacity.</p> <p>Grammar school did help me into social mobility, but not in the way you might expect. I got two poor A-levels, and did not attend university until 10 years after I left school. But I did get something out of my grammar school, a diluted version of what children who go to private school also get \u2013 a sense that I was capable, even special.</p> <p>I developed the feeling that I was part of a group of which there were certain hopes and expectations. This has been a powerful force in my life. I may have come from a household where no books lined the shelves, where we read the Daily Express and listened to Radio 2, but my school helped me believe I could move beyond these parameters. This had nothing to do with academic ability and everything to do with confidence.</p> <p>Things have changed. Social mobility rates have stagnated or dropped. Grammar schools are unfashionable and I fully understand why \u2013 the implication that you are a failure at the age of 11 is a bitter pill to swallow.</p> <p>However, what isn\u2019t usually mentioned is the other side of the coin \u2013 the positive effect of being told you are (potentially) some kind of success. Something, on the whole, a working-class child, however talented, at even a good comprehensive can find hard to believe despite the mass of egalitarian propaganda to the contrary.</p> <p>If grammar schools are merely colonised by the middle classes looking for a cheap alternative to the even more unfair option of private schools, then there is no point in bringing them back. Also, if they are determined by a crude, culture-laden 11-plus style \u201cintelligence\u201d test, then they are also useless.</p> <p>But given that a large number of working-class children simply don\u2019t have a chance anyway, some kind of leg up might be worthwhile. If grammar schools were established in primarily poor and disadvantaged areas and based on potential rather than ability, they might be the least worst option. My 14-year-old daughter was admitted to her (state) school on a music scholarship not on the grounds of any tutoring \u2013 she had hardly held an instrument \u2013 but because she had perfect pitch.</p> <p>I am not, at heart, an egalitarian, because I believe that while class and environment plays a big part in development, people have different abilities and aptitudes inborn. These aptitudes, however, are unfairly masked by money and power. Grammar schools established largely in working-class areas might make a difference. Yes \u2013 it means that some children might end up feeling bad about themselves at a tender age. Then again, as I know only too well, working-class life is full of shit of one kind or another and selection is just another kind of shit they might have no choice but to put up with. If they are anything like the kids I grew up with, they will be tough and resilient if nothing else.</p> <p>At least then a substantial few will have a real chance of escape \u2013 rather then simply being universally offered the empty rhetoric of future success, which is all they get now. If the price you pay is a certain amount of bad feeling \u2013 possibly temporary \u2013 among a lot of other working-class kids, perhaps it\u2019s a price worth paying.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",

Having the mixed fortune of being a \u201cjazz artist\u201d I have been gifted the opportunity to float above the murky waters of my genre and feast with the fat cats of streaming. So how has this miracle occurred? </p> <p>On first launching Grace and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXRDRg3bAHk\">its accompanying video</a> (a solo piano piece incidentally \u2013 this is important as you\u2019ll see later) my team and I were fairly confident that we could appeal directly to the existing fans of the band and get some encouraging streaming figures on the go. Some radio play and a few posts on social media meant that we got the track to 3,000-odd plays in the first couple of days. We were quite pleased with that. These plays would have come from the people who would most likely go on to buy the accompanying album later on, and it felt like a job well done. Or so I thought.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXRDRg3bAHk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VXRDRg3bAHk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Enter stage left the \u201cSpotify playlist\u201d. Though I far from realised it at the time, this is the holy grail for independent artists such as myself. Overnight I was lifted out of the musty basement section where men with National Health spectacles hang out, and up on to the shiny new rack next to the checkout counter. All because I composed a solo piano piece that Spotify in deemed fit to feature on one of its more popular playlists. \u201c<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/63dDpdoVHvx5RkK87g4LKk\">Peaceful piano</a>\u201d with 1.9m subscribers put me in the company of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/01/classical-superstar-ludovico-einaudi-im-inspired-by-eminem\">Ludovico Einaudi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jun/28/nils-frahm-neo-classical-musician-and-pianist\">Nils Frahm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/oct/30/max-richter-my-classical-for-beginners-playlist-barbican-sound-unbound\">Max Richter</a> and gifted me on average 25,000 plays a day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I defy any artist not to feel glad of the attention two million plays on Spotify brings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The truly liberating thing for me as an aforementioned \u201cjazz\u201d artist was the complete absence of any mention of traditional genre. In a sense, these playlists are their own short-stop, makeshift sub genres that allow artists such as myself to be grouped in with absolutely anyone else, so long as the piece of music ticks the box. </p> <p>So who creates these playlists? Are there machines analysing dynamics and mood? No. In fact, among the ranks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/23/music-streaming-services-playlister-sam-lee-deezer\">Spotify employees there exist \u201cplaylist curators\u201d \u2013 </a>surely a dream job. On pressing my contacts as to the identity of these people, there is a universal lowering of the voice and a glance over the shoulder. Either no one knows who they are, or knows if it is possible to influence them. All the people responsible for promoting my music can do is lay it at the door of Spotify and hope. And so it was that in a darkened room somewhere these Spotify elves listened to my track and tore up the genre rule book on my behalf. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spotify's Peaceful Piano playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:spotify:playlist:63dDpdoVHvx5RkK87g4LKk\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The most obvious advantage to all this is that my track continues to be played thousands of times a day somewhere in the world to someone new, and no one is judging me \u2013 or skipping \u2013 when they see the label jazz. Instead, they are seeing my name, and, if they like what they hear, potentially checking out the other material from the band. This simply has to be doing me some good. In fact, jazz as a whole could potentially benefit from cloaking its identity in this way for just long enough to be heard by unbiased ears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can anticipate how a record industry, hungry to second-guess the consumer, could turn its beady eye to these playlists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thanks to this new way of presenting music, genre may be completely changing its identity, or even losing its meaning. Old labels like \u201cjazz\u201dand \u201cclassical\u201d may begin to feel as dated as county cricket. Frankly I\u2019ve never really considered myself a jazz artist anyway, or at least, not an artist constrained by a single genre. My tastes are too wide. My quest has been to fuse the elements of music that I love from wherever I find them. The seeming lack of improvisation in my music tends to put question marks over its \u201cjazz\u201d credentials \u2013 and that\u2019s fine by me. It is a genre that is often overstudied rather than enjoyed. </p> <p>So what is the aftermath of this new accidental way of acquiring attention? I can only look upon my own mixed feelings of elation and caution. Elation because I defy any artist to not feel glad of the attention two million plays on Spotify brings. Caution, because I can see how this might become a fool\u2019s gold; I am sure the record industry, ever hungry to second-guess the consumer and without the power of the charts to monitor popular taste, are turning its beady-eyed attention to these playlists.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh5WYBT0rs0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rh5WYBT0rs0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh5WYBT0rs0\">Watch the video for The City and the Stars by the Neil Cowley Trio</a> from new album Spacebound Apes</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I can see how tempting it might be for an artist to make music that fits a certain bill. This is nothing new of course, but do we really need a plethora of music made specifically to suit the more specific pastimes of the average Spotify user? \u201cPeaceful piano\u201d may just be the tip of the iceberg. Might \u201cViolin for gardening\u201d or \u201cGreek folk song for DIY\u201d be adorning the front page? Or even perhaps a \u201cCalming xylophone for when you\u2019re doing your accounts and answering testy Facebook messages at the same time\u201d playlist, since that\u2019s what most us seem to be doing most of the time.</p> <p>However, for now I wallow in this liberation. The record industry has insisted on genre as a way of understanding and controlling consumers\u2019 listening habits right from the point at which music made its way on to our shopping lists. Though we may be jumping from the frying pan into the fire, this momentary period of chaos while the major players catch up is something I welcome.</p> <p>And as for the hot topic of streaming income?

  "<p>Toronto-born singer-songwriter/musician/producer Jane Siberry has never confined herself to rigid genre boundaries. Her vocals evoke an unmistakable tenderness and depth, and her rich catalogue stretches from her 1981 self-titled debut, through the ethereal soul of her 1992 hit Calling All Angels, collaborations with the likes of KD Lang, Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel, international film and TV soundtracks, and a period where she experimented under the name Issa.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/2016/sep/16/discover-torontos-style-vibe-a-peaceful-city-with-a-side-order-of-busy\">Discover Toronto's style vibe: 'A peaceful city with a side order of busy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While she has created highly acclaimed work on major labels, Siberry has seemed naturally in her element as an innovative independent artist. She agrees that her distinct creative spirit was fostered as a young artist on Toronto\u2019s live music circuit. \u201cI was part of the Queen Street scene in the 80s,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe street was jam-packed with small clubs; it was really exciting. I had a band, and I got a bit more punky then. People were looking for original music, and that suited me well.\u201d<br></p> <p>More recently, Siberry\u2019s original approach has extended to her playing \u201cprivate salon\u201d dates, invited by music fans and communities around the world (\u201cI\u2019ll play from Carnegie Hall to living rooms \u2013 it\u2019s just the in-between venues I don\u2019t like!\u201d she laughs).<br></p> <p>Around 2005, with typically Canadian generosity of spirit, she also successfully pioneered an innovative online pricing system for her music: it offered the choice to purchase songs for a standard price, self-priced, or as \u201ca gift from Jane\u201d. She explains: \u201cThere seemed to be a need for all three things. I wasn\u2019t at all surprised by the reaction; goodwill was my guideline, and I wrote back to a lot of the kids that contacted me through it. I often pay more when I buy CDs at a gig, and I don\u2019t like being treated like a thief.\u201d<br></p> <p>While she travels extensively, she still relishes everyday details when she returns to her long-time home of Toronto: \u201cI always appreciate it,\u201d she says. \u201cToronto is a beautiful, mature city. There are a lot of green neighbourhoods with great buildings, and it has enough cultures in it to keep it grounded, including Chinatown with its health shops and fresh vegetable stands, Little Italy, Little Portugal. And the light in Toronto is just beautiful, especially when you look west down the streets at sunset.\u201d</p> <p>The energy of this vibrant city combines with a love of nature in both Siberry\u2019s work and personal life; she also happens to be a committed vegetarian, and makes a point of appreciating the essential space around her. \u201cI also have a log cabin in Northern Ontario,\u201d she says. \u201cI go there just to let my ears open up. I end up watching insects and stuff.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s an environment that has encouraged her to be excitingly headstrong as an artist, though she denies that she\u2019s fearless: \u201cI\u2019m full of fear, but I seem to do it anyway,\u201d she insists, warmly. \u201cI just can\u2019t help it.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Jane Siberry\u2019s insider tips</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.rom.on.ca/en#/gallery/recent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Royal Ontario Museum</a><br></strong>\u201cThe museum is in an old building with a super-modern extension which has proved controversial \u2013 I love it. The museum has great programming, too. There\u2019s a First Nations area with a totem pole, a bat cave, and an ancient Egypt room with a mummy, which has obsessed and terrified generations of kids.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://kalendar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalendar</a><br></strong>\u201cLittle Italy has lots of restaurants and cafes where you can sit and enjoy watching the street go by, and this is my favourite. It has a great outdoor area, so I\u2019ll come here and my dog sits under the table. The staff are great, and the food is fantastic, including pizzas with a super-thin dahl-puri crust, so I can squint and feel that I\u2019m eating something very healthy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Toronto Waterfront<br></strong>\u201cRent a bike, and ride as far as you can along the city\u2019s waterfront. It\u2019s on Lake Ontario, which is one of the five Great Lakes of North America, and a source of water used all over the world.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Autumn Leaves<br></strong>\u201cThe light in Toronto is especially beautiful in the autumn. At this time of year, I\u2019d actually recommend heading north to Haliburton, which is an area in Ontario with a high number of maple trees; the leaves are the brightest colour. It feels like you\u2019ve fallen into a box of tiddlywinks.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://hughsroom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hugh\u2019s Room</a><br></strong>\u201cThis is a club I play a lot, where you can take a table and have dinner, and have a really good night listening to high quality music.

Lowered expectations are generally a decent survival technique, though it\u2019s vital to recognise when everyday crapness becomes untenable: a disappointing course, crushing mental health or hunger for life beyond nursing off Wetherspoons\u2019 midweek drinks deals at 9am lectures. Your parents will freak when you quit, but tell them that companies are increasingly dropping degree requirements for job applicants. And, besides, you can always go back as a mature student (when it\u2019ll be so expensive, you\u2019ll make better choices anyway). </p> <h2><strong>HOW TO</strong><strong> START A REVOLUTION </strong></h2> <p><strong>By Owen Jones, writer</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eef61a217346313a5e93b946653fa945c5d09546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eef61a217346313a5e93b946653fa945c5d09546/0_499_1370_821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Lindsay as Citizen Smith hi000580493.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"41a41294656f0d81385ad563d2181c42bf5e14df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a41294656f0d81385ad563d2181c42bf5e14df/309_145_2392_1434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Jones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting a revolution is both an excellent hangover cure and a convenient distraction from the library. It doesn\u2019t mean spending the afternoon shelling the Palace of Westminster. But joining a living wage campaign for university cleaners, getting involved in a single-issue group on, say, tax justice or racism, or signing up to a political party (cough, except the Tories or Ukip, cough) \u2013 these can all help create a peaceful revolution to change society. A skilfully crafted placard \u2013 featuring such classics as \u201cI wish my boyfriend was as dirty as your policies\u201d or \u201cWhat do we want? Things to be better! When do we want it? Within a reasonable timeframe!\u201d \u2013 is a must. Politicians think they can screw over young people because they won\u2019t fight back, so remember to shout very loudly so that they get the point. Bring a determined scowl and a sage nod.

And check that the society doesn\u2019t already exist. Try to grab people\u2019s attention. At Freshers\u2019 Fair, we have costumes, swords and walk around campus \u201chassling\u201d people.

In 2006 we did a show at the Edinburgh Fringe which one critic described as \u201cnot as bad as I\u2019d expected\u201d. This led me to take up stand-up comedy, which is now my job. Here are five tips on getting started as a student.</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Audition \u2013 if there is a group, then great! Go along to auditions. If you don\u2019t get in, go again. Refuse to take a hint. <br><strong>2. </strong>If there isn\u2019t a group, set one up. My friends started a night at a local pub, which is where I did my first standup gig. So if you hate my comedy it\u2019s their fault.<br><strong>3. </strong>Experiment. Feel free to be terrible. Due to the vast quantities of alcohol students consume, no one will remember.<br><strong>4. </strong>Get yourself to the fringe. It\u2019s the best place to learn. <br><strong>5. </strong>DO IT. <strong><br></strong><em>Nish Kumar\u2019s Actions Speak Louder Than Words, Unless You Shout The Words Real Loud tour starts 1 Oct</em></p> <h2><strong>HOW TO WIN A BATTLE OF THE BANDS</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Tarek and Pete from Spring King</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"867a8e5afa330c7bc036113747d75ea83bf36893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/867a8e5afa330c7bc036113747d75ea83bf36893/0_49_4414_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spring King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spring King</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Always bribe the judges with alcohol.

You\u2019ve got to look the part, so wear tons of leather and be sure to get matching haircuts. If all else fails, learn the arts of distraction and sabotage. Keep puns to a minimum and keep your clothes on. Finish on an Oasis song.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>By Theo from Wolf Alice</strong></p> <p>Solely rely on your bands look. In our Instagram reliant age, your \u201cswag\u201d is elementary. Skechers are a great starting point as they\u2019re a timeless shoe. Some spray on skinnies are another \u201cindie essential\u201dessential. Yellow or red are my legging of choice. Your torso should always be adorned by either a draping faux retro shirt and or band t-shirt (doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t listen to the band you\u2019re representing). Finish the look with a classique Jack Sparrow fedora. This will signify you as a musical era crossing vagabond. If you follow these effective and concise style tips you will be snapped up by every indie A&amp;R for at least a three-month contract. </p> <h2><strong>HOW TO GET ON WITH THE NEIGHBOURS</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Tom Rosenthal, comedian</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f526c24a39d1fe111da81b30fa569c52a7ba0ab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f526c24a39d1fe111da81b30fa569c52a7ba0ab3/0_163_2263_1356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"G\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cbc2e0bd7ef9803742988d702af9a0c39893c74e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbc2e0bd7ef9803742988d702af9a0c39893c74e/0_188_3280_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Rosenthal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Rosenthal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idil Sukan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Make sure to turn up any music or television you are listening to so your neighbours can enjoy it, too.

If they have pets, take them and house them for a fortnight or so: after grieving over their assumed deaths, they\u2019ll get a wonderful feeling when you give them back. This ideal neighbourly system of entertainment, inspiration and surprise has left many of mine desperate to share it with others by moving out immediately. </p> <p><em>Tom performs at Knock2Bag at Rich Mix, Saturday.

Be as niche as you want to be and think small. Work on getting an amazing poster rather than a finding a DJ who can mix. If you make something that is true to you then like-minded people will naturally find it.

Don\u2019t rely on dating apps<br></strong>Tinder, Happn, Grindr: all great ways to avoid your dissertation, sure, but don\u2019t forget The Real World. You\u2019ve only got a few years to make the most of uni, so save the apps for later. Think of campus as one giant Tinder!</p> <p><strong>2. Do date someone who cooks <br></strong>\u2026because date night may be the best meal you get all week. And don\u2019t forget to demonstrate your own value. Throw parties. Decorate your communal space with vibrant colours (and if you take that to mean dyeing your pubic hair lavender, so be it). Basically, be a person that people want to be around, and you\u2019ll never want for admirers.</p> <p><strong>3. Do be aware of proximity<br></strong>If you live in a shared house, it\u2019s best not to fall for the person in the room directly beneath yours. If things go wrong between you, you\u2019ll have to spend the next few terms playing Adele to drown out the sound of them having sex with better-looking people. No one wants a year of Adele on full blast. See also: don\u2019t date your housemate\u2019s exes. Seriously, what are you, a masochist?</p> <p><strong>4. Do be careful sharing photos on phone apps<br></strong>There isn\u2019t a Snapchat filter on Earth that\u2019ll make you feel better when your private parts end up the subject of a WhatsApp group discussion with the bellends from media studies. You may not care that much now, but spare a thought for future you. Spoiler: Future you is not impressed.</p> <p><strong>5. Don\u2019t settle down too quickly<br></strong>Love is lovely, but don\u2019t stress about meeting The One. If you\u2019re ever going to have a wild phase, this is it. Uni is for experimenting and having fun and finding yourself, sometimes in other people\u2019s beds. Just try not to get a disease?

The lower they think of you, the better you are.</p> <p><strong>Establish a common source of villainy</strong> This will encourage people to step beyond the tepid narrative of constructive argument: listening, dialogue, tolerance, etc. These things are old hat. What folks are after now is somewhere convenient to store all of the hatred they can\u2019t quite take out on their families and \u201cloved ones\u201d. </p> <p><strong>Find a suitably despicable location </strong>You\u2019ve spent enough time banging on about the evils of gentrification to know how it works. For those with limited means but cumbersome levels of social ambition, the only option is the colonisation of <br> some misspent part of town where folks will let you plough your crappy wares for nothing out of sheer boredom. Affordability and integrity walk hand in hand. </p> <p><strong>Recruit followers</strong> For a scene to work, you need a \u201cgroup\u201d or \u201cteam\u201d or \u201cgang\u201d. Should you have the requisite intelligence to bother embarking on this quest in the first place then have faith in your abilities, and that those around you will soak up your vision. You need the hopeless, the washed-up or the utterly naive to be your pawns. The more putty-like their minds, the easier their loyalty is to inspire.</p> <p><strong>Spread the word</strong> Even if your message is rooted in nothing but self-aggrandisement and nihilism, your \u201cscene\u201d must make those who partake in it feel \u201cactive\u2019\u201d If that involves throwing a spontaneous street party to celebrate the death of an old woman [as the Fat Whites were pictured doing in 2013 when Margaret Thatcher died], so be it.

There seem to be a few things at work: gastric irritation; the effects of the acetaldehyde (the main breakdown product of alcohol), which is extremely toxic; tiredness. Perhaps least understood is how much alcohol is lovely and soothing for your brain \u2013 like it\u2019s having a soak in a nice hot bath with candles and rose petals. Because it\u2019s relaxing in the booze, your brain seems to make a lot less of the chemicals that it usually makes to help soothe itself. This is a problem, because when the alcohol goes away, it\u2019s like you\u2019re suddenly taken out of a hot bath and plunged into a freezing lake of sewage. There\u2019s none of those nice calming neurotransmitters around. They\u2019re taking a break. All the sweaty, anxious, paranoid, palpitations, dry mouth dry eyes stuff \u2013 that\u2019s probably all happening in your brain. It\u2019s not dehydration. Unless you did a lot of dancing. So by all means have a pint of squash and take some painkillers, but what you really need for your jangled brain is pleasure. Sex, food, TV, or ideally a combination of all three. Ideally in large quantities. <strong><br></strong><em>The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs\u2019 Fronted by Chris van Tulleken airs Thursday, 9pm BBC1</em></p> <h2><strong>HOW TO </strong><strong>WRITE THE PERFECT PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE FRIDGE NOTE</strong></h2> <p><strong>By a selection of top UK standups</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a32fe1524955464f44c6bc60fe24559ca00d4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a32fe1524955464f44c6bc60fe24559ca00d4a/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fridge note\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blank TO DO post-it note on a red fridge door<br>http://www.primarypicture.com/iStock/IS_Fridge.jpg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mrPliskin/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elis James<br></strong>Hey!!!

  "<p>Following the UK\u2019s decision to exit the European Union, more people than ever are wondering if the grass is a little greener elsewhere in Europe, or perhaps even further afield. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/hold-off-applying-for-passport-ireland-tells-britons\">surge in applications for Irish</a> and other EU passports suggests many Britons are keen to carry on enjoying unfettered access to work opportunities within Europe.</p> <p>With so many varied and interesting countries to choose from, deciding where to pack up and move to can be hard. Thanks to open data on what it is like to live in different cities, some of the guesswork has already been done. After combining a range of publicly available datasets, for example, it turns out the UK rates as pretty average when it comes to good work-life balance and the amount of money a typical worker loses as a result of traffic congestion. It will come as no surprise to discover that compared with the rest of the world, London is one of the most expensive places to study.</p> <p>These insights are made possible by analytics companies combining datasets and adding a human element to typically economic figures. Through this they can gain insight into what it is actually like to work in different cities.</p> <p>For budding tech leaders, a useful case study comes from Bobbi Brant, a researcher at <a href=\"http://www.expertmarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExpertMarket.com</a>. She decided to see if the assumption that Silicon Valley is the only tech hub to head for stands up to scrutiny. She combined each major tech hub\u2019s reputation for launching startups, the level of finance raised, salary levels and time taken to launch a company, information available from startup researchers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.compass.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Compass</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The World Bank\u2019s</a> open data service. She then cross-referenced lifestyle data from living index <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbeo</a> for the cost of living, rent levels, holiday entitlement and commute times. With the four economic and four personal datasets given even weighting, it was a surprise to find that San Francisco was not the number one tech hub in the world. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.expertmarket.com/focus/research/top-tech-hubs\" rel=\"nofollow\">That honour fell to Berlin</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of reports into tech hubs are based on economic data but that\u2019s of more use to investors than young people starting out on a career,\u201d she points out. \u201cIt\u2019s no good looking to work in the hub with most investment if you can\u2019t afford to live there or the work-life balance is wrong for you. So, when you add data on affordability and lifestyle, Berlin comes out top with Silicon Valley in fourth spot. London\u2019s way down the table at 16th because of the high cost of living.\u201d</p> <h2>Better balance</h2> <p>Similar recent studies from ExpertMarket.com have also named the city where workers can expect the best work-life balance and parents will lose the least sleep fretting about paying university fees. For each study the site\u2019s content manager, Jessica Laporte, started with open data on average earnings from Swiss bank UBS. For the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/work-life-balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">education project</a> they were correlated with average university fees and college rankings from researchers at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">QS</a>. For the work-life balance <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.expertmarket.co.uk/work-life-balance\" rel=\"nofollow\">project</a>, the amount of holiday people take was combined with average earnings figures. In both studies, France won.</p> <p>\u201cParis is obviously the place to work and study because the French work more than a thousand hours fewer than Hong Kong, which provided the worst work-life balance,\u201d Brant says.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is 17th out of 70 countries and so not nearly as bad as some people who feel overworked might suspect. France is also the most affordable country, where fees apply, for parents to fund their children through university, with the Scandinavian countries all in good positions just behind it.\u201d</p> <h2>Stuck in traffic</h2> <p>Combining extra datasets gives an extra understanding around commute times, or rather the implications behind congestion. Josh Frisby, content manager at vehicle tracking company Global Positioning Specialists, combined average salaries around the world with data on commuting distance at Numbeo alongside congestion levels published by TomTom. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gps.com.au/earnings-lost-to-congestion-around-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">result</a> was a table for the cities where workers driving to the office waste the most amount of time, in terms of wages lost to traffic jams. Mexico City was way out ahead as the worst but, surprisingly, British and American cities did not perform as badly as Frisby had expected.</p> <p>\u201cIn Mexico City the average person could earn nearly 10% more if they weren\u2019t stuck in traffic jams,\u201d says Frisby. \u201cWe were really surprised that Los Angeles and New York only came out 19th and 26th respectively and that London is only the 16th worst city for the cost of traffic jams. It was also surprising to see that Manchester was just behind the capital in 20th place, meaning people lose more money in Manchester driving to work in heavy traffic than they do in cities you would presume would be much worse, such as New York, San Francisco, Paris and Singapore.\u201d</p> <h2>Apac cost of living</h2> <p>Anyone considering moving further afield, as far as Australia or the wider Asia Pacific area, might want to check out a new, free online service which compares the cost of living in eight of the region\u2019s major cities. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://webapps.qlik.com/costofliving-apac/index.html#/\" rel=\"nofollow\">comparison website</a> has been launched by data analyst company Qlik. Senior solution architect Stephen Street explains the service uses a combination of data services, such as Numbeo and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PropertyGuru</a> to enable a like-for-like comparison between the region\u2019s top business destinations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want the service to be truly useful to anyone comparing Apac cities,\u201d Street says. \u201cSo we have a general, average comparison, where Tokyo is the most expensive city and Mumbai is far and away the cheapest. However, we also allow people to tailor the data to their lifestyle. You can compare the cost of living for someone who likes to eat out and drink, or perhaps buy designer clothes. Then Singapore and Sydney become more expensive to live in than Tokyo. As you change the settings the table changes so you can match your lifestyle to the city that appeals the most.\u201d</p> <p>Before the era of open data, comparing what it is like to live and work in different cities was largely a case of testimonials from locals and expats. However, now, anyone wondering if they could have a better standard of living abroad can find out online from a combination of data sources. Ironically, the open data projects may well persuade many that the UK is not such a bad place after all. </p> <p>However, for those who are determined to have it all \u2013 low-cost education, low congestion and a good work-life balance \u2013 it may well be time to dust off the French phrasebook and head for the Eurostar.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

  "<p>The first duty of a Roman Catholic cardinal, when elected pope, is to choose the name by which he wants to be known. Among the 266 holders of the papacy to date, the current incumbent is the first to take Francis, a flash of re-baptismal originality in a line of succession in which the Johns reach 23, there have been a dozen men called Pius and 13 took the name Innocent.</p> <p>This autumn, though, Pope Francis will co-exist with Pope Innocent XIV, the title eventually taken by the winner among the cardinals competing for the throne of St Peter in Robert Harris\u2019s thriller, <em>Conclave</em>, and Pius XIII, the identity selected by Jude Law as the first American pontiff in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/the-young-pope-review-jude-laws-sleek-pontiff-shines-in-sorrentinos-twin-peaks\"><em>The Young Pope</em></a>, a TV drama that starts its UK run on Sky Atlantic next month.</p> <p>In fiction, there has already been an Innocent XIV, in <em>The Fourth K</em>, a 1990 novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/mario-puzo\">Mario Puzo</a>, and a previous Pius XIII, in <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em>, the 1963 novel by Morris West that can be seen as the rock on which all modern pontifical fictions are based, although the genre of fake papacies has a long tradition: Christopher Marlowe gives the real Pope Adrian IV a schismatic rival, Pope Bruno, in his late 16th century tragedy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marlowe\"><em>Doctor Faustus</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba92f60b6c1d7af53407689cb8e5409020d9d61d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba92f60b6c1d7af53407689cb8e5409020d9d61d/306_420_4769_2861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Ryan Doctor Faustus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Ryan as Mephistophilis in the RSC\u2019s <em>Doctor Faustus.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Maybanks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marlowe\u2019s warring Catholic leaders were intended to amuse audiences in Protestant England, and it is suspicion of the papacy \u2013 as foreign, strange, potentially treacherous \u2013 that has made it such a profitable subject for fiction. One of the oddest and most enduring Vatican novels was written directly as revenge on the church. Rejected as a candidate for the priesthood, the English author Frederick Rolfe wrote, under the pseudonym \u201cBaron Corvo\u201d, a novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/02/100-best-novels-hadrian-seventh-frederick-rolfe\"><em>Hadrian the Seventh </em></a>(1904), in which a failed priest is later made pope by a repentant Vatican. In 1967, it was adapted by Peter Luke into a successful play, with Alec McCowen as the surprise leader of the faithful.</p> <p>Whereas Marlowe and Rolfe were personally motivated to take on the pope, most writers in the genre are attracted by the external drama. Head of the only church that is also a nation state, the pope fascinates because of a doubly unusual lifestyle. He is denied sex, one of the most powerful human desires. Harris\u2019s <em>Conclave</em> and West\u2019s <em>The Clowns of God</em> (1980) both turn, as did <em>Holy Father</em>, a play I wrote for BBC Radio 4 last year, on ways in which the ecclesiastical rules of sexuality might be tested without sin. However, those priests who become cardinals are tantalised by the prospect of another Darwinian driving motivation \u2013 power \u2013 at a level perhaps only matched by the American presidency.</p> <p>As a result, ecclesiastical politics clearly have a resonance beyond religion. Vatican fictions tend to have the same main plotline: a contest between reforming and orthodox candidates. This reflects the narrative of most actual papal elections \u2013 these stories tend to be a serious exploration of what is supposed to be a famously apocryphal question: is the pope a Catholic? \u2013 but such testing for heresy is also common in political parties, such as, at the moment, Labour in the UK and the Republicans in the US.</p> <p>It feels logical that Harris should have turned to the papacy after having written thrillers about a Blairite prime minister in <em>The Ghost</em> and the politics of ancient Rome in his Cicero trilogy. The incense-filled rooms of a conclave (the name by which the heavily sequestered papal election assembly is known) have an obvious parallel with the smoke-filled rooms of the traditional political procedural. And, as in presidential and prime ministerial fictions, a key decision for papal narratives is whether the made-up characters should be seen in succession to real-life figures.</p> <p>In an author\u2019s note to <em>Conclave</em>, Harris insists that the man whose death kicks off his plot \u201cis not the current pope\u201d. This disclaimer is probably necessary because the late pontiff is revealed to have made some eccentric decisions but, as Harris\u2019s \u201clate Holy Father\u201d shares most of the biography of Pope Francis and has also made identical speeches, it is in practice impossible not to impose his face on the character. Even more baldly, Piers Paul Read\u2019s thriller <em>The Death of a Pope</em> (2009) superimposes the crisis of a fictional priest on a documentary account of the death of John Paul II and the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Benedict XVI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07326109007b6daebbc3e63a7ec84c86802834f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07326109007b6daebbc3e63a7ec84c86802834f2/2112_111_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Harris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Harris\u2019s forthcoming book, <em>Conclave,</em> focuses on the election of a new pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contrastingly, Morris West, the Australian novelist who is commonly considered the pope of the Vatican thriller, created an elaborate alternative progression. Pope Kiril I in <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> is succeeded by Gregory XVII in <em>The Clowns of God</em>, who gives way to Leo XIV in <em>Lazarus</em> (1990).</p> <p>West\u2019s novels have an astonishing record of prophecy. <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> was published on the day that John XXIII died, and imagined an eastern European anti-Soviet cardinal ending the long line of Italian popes, which duly happened in 1978, when Cardinal Wotyla of Krak\u00f3w became John Paul II. The unlikely plot of <em>The Clowns of God</em> (1981), in which a pope resigns because he can no longer face the burdens of office, was validated in February 2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/11/pope-benedict-xvi-resigns-age\">the retirement of Benedict XVI</a>. In West\u2019s final conclave novel, <em>Eminence</em> (1998), the leading candidate to become pope, a Latin American radical called Cardinal Luca Rossini, now reads as a spooky preview of the Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio becoming Pope Francis.</p> <p>Whether or not Bergoglio knew it, fiction had got to his papal name before he did: a cardinal takes it at the end of the conclave imagined in <em>The Vicar of Christ</em> (1979) by the American writer, Walter F Murphy. Most novelists, though, extend one of the existing nominal lists, with some more popular than others.</p> <p>The year before West annointed a Gregory XVII, another one had appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonyburgess\">Anthony Burgess</a>\u2019s <em>Earthly Powers</em> (1980). The book\u2019s gay, atheist narrator, Kenneth Toomey, is the brother in law of Carlo Campanati, an Italian cleric who rose to become Gregory XVII, and has become a candidate for sainthood after a miracle that Toomey witnessed.</p> <p>In Burgess\u2019s alternative version of the 20th century, Cardinal Campanati takes the post-1958 papacy occupied in reality by John XXIII. There has in fact been no 24th John \u2013 as the former Cardinal Roncalli of Venice was identified as the most reforming pope of modern times, direct identification by a successor would have risked a schism in the Vatican \u2013 although two have appeared in very contrasting works of fantasy fiction.</p> <p>In Kingsley Amis\u2019s <em>The Alteration</em> (1976), the Reformation has not happened and England remains a Roman Catholic country, obedient to the religious rule from Rome of a Yorkshire-born pontiff, who seems to be a caricature of Harold Wilson, British prime minister at the time Amis was writing. The John XXIV of the <a href=\"http://leftbehind.com/\">Left Behind</a> series \u2013 16 books by the Christian evangelists Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins \u2013 was also contentiously presented. Having become too close to Protestantism, he is taken by God and replaced by the more orthodox Peter II, a designation that no real occupant of the post has ever been arrogant enough to adopt.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>\u2019s late short story, \u201cThe Last Word\u201d, published in 1988, the line of Johns reaches XXIX, although also stops there, with the last pontiff having become a prisoner of an anti-Christian government. As Greene\u2019s new world order in some way resembles the global caliphate envisaged by Islamic State, a notable political novelist had once again spotted a future trend. West, Dan Brown, Read and now Harris all have plot lines that turn on a perceived Islamist terrorist threat to the office of the papacy.</p> <p>One reason that the role has attracted so many thriller writers is that it is attended by many persistent conspiracy theories. The so-called \u201cSiri thesis\u201d alleges that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa was elected pope in 1958, but that, as a conservative, his accession was blocked by liberals who replaced him with John XXIII.</p> <p>Hardcore conspiracists, known as sedevacantists (roughly translating as empty throners) have refused to recognise any of the last six popes, whom they regard as invalid. The fact that Siri himself always denied the claims was explained away, as these things often are, by his being in fear of his life. A more benign version of the thesis \u2013 that Siri might have changed his own mind \u2013 can be glimpsed, in comedic form, behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/19/nanni-moretti-pope-film-habemus-papam\"><em>Habemus Papam</em></a><em> </em>(<em>We Have a Pope </em>in the UK), the 2011 film by Nanni Moretti, in which a pontiff goes on the run post-election to avoid taking up office.</p> <p>Better known matters of Vatican contention are the allegation that John Paul I, who died suddenly after only 33 days in office in 1978, was murdered; repeated scandals involving the Vatican Bank, which has been accused of corruption including money laundering; and the belief that a secret document in a Vatican safe (known as \u201cThe Third Secret of F\u00e1tima\u201d), supposedly revealed by a vision of the Virgin Mary to Portuguese children in 1917, contains an apocalyptic secret such as the date of the end of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"113055e281f8c7195f004d65785ef2231f811cd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/113055e281f8c7195f004d65785ef2231f811cd6/0_0_2696_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angels Demons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willing to kill \u2026 Armin Mueller-Stahl and Ewan McGregor in the 2009 film of Dan Brown\u2019s <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although John Paul II released the text of the \u201cthird secret\u201d \u2013 which turned out to be a sub-Nostradamus allegory that can be made to represent either the destruction or triumph of Catholicism \u2013 true disbelievers continue to insist that the Vatican publication was a fake in place of a true prophecy considered too terrifying to publicise.</p> <p>Shadows from these various controversies can be spotted in most pontifical fiction. The F\u00e1tima-related belief that Catholicism is withholding terrible information underlies Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/angels-and-demons\"><em>Angels and Demons</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/the-da-vinci-code\"><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></a>, both of which have popes willing to kill to hide the true story of Christianity. Suspicions about the death of John Paul I mean that deaths and elections of fictional pontiffs are almost always suspicious. Even Burgess, though not operating in the mystery genre, contrives a sudden death during the conclave described in <em>Earthly Powers</em>. These presentations of the devious ease with which the Vatican dissembles also clearly serve as a metaphor for the Catholic church\u2019s unwillingness to address the scandals of priestly paedophilia.</p> <p>Despite papal fiction being such a crowded church, Harris, in <em>Conclave</em>, contrives a twist involving the number of cardinal-electors that seems to me completely new, showing that the genre still has possibilities. Some people claim that the Third Secret of F\u00e1tima warns that the current pope is the last but, if so, the line should continue in fiction.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conclave.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Conclave</a></em> is published on 22 September; <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-young-pope\">The Young Pope</a></em> starts on Sky Atlantic on 27 October; <em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?id=19605\">Doctor Faustus</a></em> is at the Barbican, London EC2, until 1 October.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 September 2016.

  "<p>In August it looked like game over. The National Videogame Arcade, a fascinating institution that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/28/national-videogame-arcade-nottingham-opens\">opened in March 2015</a> to promote the cultural and economic significance of games, was facing closure. Although the large building in Nottingham\u2019s creative quarter attracted plenty of visitors with its mix of classic arcade machines, specialist interactive installations and events, it was not turning a profit. Meanwhile there were 40 staff to pay and a large rented building in central Nottingham to maintain. Over the summer, directors Iain Simons and Jonathan Smith made the decision to call in an insolvency firm.</p> <p>\u201cIt became horribly clear, horribly suddenly, that we weren\u2019t going to be able to pay salaries,\u201d says Simons, who has been creative director of the GameCity festival, which spawned the NVA, since it began a decade ago. \u201cWe sat down with everyone individually and told them. We asked everyone if they would work for deferred payment in order for us to get a plan together. This was in the middle of the summer season, our busiest time \u2013 and every single member of staff came back to work. We stayed open seamlessly while this all took place; the only reason we\u2019ve been able to survive is because the staff cared about it so much.\u201d</p> <p>With the time available, Simons set about finding investors to keep the NVA afloat. They weren\u2019t sure what to expect, primarily because with its mix of archive, event space, museum and industry networking centre, there\u2019s nothing like the NVA anywhere else in the UK. There are small-scale festivals; there have been major installations such as the Barbican\u2019s excellent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/03/barbican-video-games-global-tour-art\">Game On</a> exhibition in 2002, and there are several video game hubs and shared working collectives dotted around the country. But nothing offering a permanent home to the idea of video games as a sociocultural and educational endeavour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b8817dc71e305293e8dd8c6eaab83df4170bcae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b8817dc71e305293e8dd8c6eaab83df4170bcae/0_0_2160_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A games enthusiast at the Barbican\u2019s Game On exhibition in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A games enthusiast at the Barbican\u2019s Game On exhibition in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But help came. Ian Livingstone, founder of Domark and Games Workshop, a longtime advocate of games as an artistic and creative force, came aboard as an investor, as did Sumo Digital and PlayGround Games, two highly successful British development studios. Several independent game makers who have found success after first exhibiting their games at the NVA\u2019s annual GameCity festival, have also invested, including Rami Ismail of Dutch studio Vlambeer, a regular attendee of the festival, and William Pugh, award-winning co-creator of the Stanley Parable.</p> <p>\u201cThe NVA is incredibly valuable,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cIt is the only UK institution of its size that\u2019s consistently championed the cultural and experimental work going on in the games space.\u201d</p> <p>The result is the formation of the National Videogame Foundation, which will run both the NVA and the GameCity festival, but will also expand its remit to take on education and public advocacy work. Later this year, the foundation is collaborating with the Times Educational Supplement, to stage a series of \u201csubject summits\u201d, \u201cbringing together educators with experts to explore ways in which video games can be used to enhance learning\u201d. </p> <p>Simons hopes the events will help to create school resources that can be applied to various curriculum areas. \u201cThe Foundation aims to inspire new people to make video games, start new conversations about them, and find new ways in which they can contribute to culture, society and education,\u201d states the press release.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time,\u201d says Simons. \u201cWe\u2019re already working on new exhibitions and outreach for the next year and onwards and in particular we\u2019re ramping a lot on international collaborations. We participate actively in an international curatorial group, helping to develop strategies for interpreting and touring games around the world. It\u2019s great to see the kinds of things that we\u2019ve been thinking about for years start to become shared conversations. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be doing a lot more work advocating for video games in culture more broadly. The \u2018Continue\u2019 conference we did earlier this year with the Arts Council is something we\u2019re going to be building on a lot. We really want to make the NVA <em>for</em> something, turn the cultural capital that we\u2019ve managed to generate into cultural confidence for video games themselves. That means working hard to inspire new people, to make new games about new things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea84b56199a8e729c1c6c8bbd337b2c393968095\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea84b56199a8e729c1c6c8bbd337b2c393968095/0_48_1805_1083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The GameCity festival, which will now run as part of the National Videogame Foundation, has always shown games in a different light.

Here developer Robin Hunickie gives a liver performance of the game Flower in a Nottingham shopping mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Videogame Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simons is also promising to rejuvenate the GameCity festival which has been an important annual highlight of the UK games calendar for10 years, with developers coming from all over the world to put on often offbeat and ambitious events around Nottingham. A Harry Potter concert in St Mary\u2019s Church, a molecular gastronomy evening with developer \u00c9ric Chahi, a live Resident Evil experience; while most game events focus on banks of demo units playing the latest triple A titles, GameCity has always taken a more thoughtful, inclusive and idiosyncratic look at what a gaming festival should be. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe truth is, last year we didn\u2019t deliver the thing we wanted to and disappointed some people.\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d just started a company, designed, built and opened a National Videogame Arcade and survived our first summer season \u2013 then we went directly into trying to deliver a GameCity and we just couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not offering that as an excuse, because we let people down and we\u2019re really sorry, but it was through exhaustion rather than laziness.\u201d<br></p> <p>The National Videogame Arcade and GameCity live on, with what looks like sound financial backing from many in the industry that have attended the building and festival in the past. Simons say revenue will come via a restructured commercial plan, from patrons and sponsors, and from new research projects. But the arcade also needs to attract more visitors, and that will involve building on the idea that games are a worthwhile cultural day trip.

  "<p>An inhaler that protects the lungs against air pollution has been developed by scientists and could help the many millions of people affected by toxic air to avoid its worst effects. </p> <p>The inhaler delivers a molecule, first found in bacteria in the Egyptian desert, which stabilises water on the surface of the lung cells to form a protective layer. It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.</p> <p>Outdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/16/more-people-die-from-air-pollution-than-malaria-and-hivaids-new-study-shows\">kills over 3 million people a year</a> and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/toxic-air-pollution-particles-found-in-human-brains-links-alzheimers\">such as Alzheimer\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/air-pollution-linked-to-increased-mental-illness-in-children?CMP=share_btn_tw\">mental illness</a> and, this week, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27605624\">diabetes</a>.</p> <p>The impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/08/air-pollution-costs-trillions-holds-back-poor-countries-world-bank\">air pollution costs $5tn a year</a>, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/22/indoor-and-outdoor-air-pollution-claiming-at-least-40000-uk-lives-a-year\">40,000 people a year die prematurely</a> from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">public health emergency</a>\u201d. </p> <p>But the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/13/campaigners-criticise-uk-governments-response-to-air-pollution-warning\">heavily criticised this week</a>, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/londoners-overwhelmingly-back-sadiq-khans-air-pollution-crackdown\">overwhelmingly backed by the public</a>. </p> <p>Vehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/emissions-new-diesel-cars-far-higher-than-official-limit\">new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides</a> on the road than the official lab-based limit. </p> <p>Action to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company <a href=\"http://www.bitop.de/cms/website.php?id=/en/index/startseite.htm\">Bitop</a> and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat. </p> <p>\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d</p> <p>When inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d</p> <p>The inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.</p> <p>Ectoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief <a href=\"https://www.benadryl.co.uk/allergy-relief-products/benadryl-allergy-naturease-nasal-spray\">is already available</a>. </p> <p>Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d</p> <p>The protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111485\">published</a> in <a href=\"http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.200812-1911OC#.V9q0oCorKL1\">prominent</a> <a href=\"http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/41/2/433\">scientific journals</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d</p> <p>Krutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a long slog, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">we got there in the end</a>. After years of planning, work can now finally begin on the country\u2019s first nuclear power station for a generation.</p> <p>While for some this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/absurd-hinkley-point-c-cheaper-cleaner\" title=\"\">a controversial decision</a>, I welcome the government\u2019s go-ahead. At the TUC\u2019s annual congress last week, our theme was \u201cjobs, rights and investment\u201d. Hinkley Point delivers all three.</p> <p>It will be the largest construction project in the UK, creating 25,000 high-quality jobs and 500 apprenticeships. It will bring in billions of pounds of foreign investment. At a time when our economy is facing uncertainty, it is good for business confidence and proof that Britain is still open for business. And a deal that\u2019s been signed by trade unions and EDF energy will ensure working conditions at Hinkley are among the best and safest in the construction industry.</p> <p>Now that Hinkley finally has the green light, our message to ministers is: \u201cDon\u2019t stop there!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/07/hs2-the-zombie-train-that-refuses-to-die\" title=\"\">HS2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/08/heathrow-expansion-say-goodbye-to-emissions-targets-and-budget-flying\" title=\"\">Heathrow expansion</a> are both shovel-ready, and a new programme of affordable housebuilding is decades overdue. The slow progress on major infrastructure projects is reflected in the UK\u2019s investment gap with other advanced economies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/aggregator/categories/2?page=1\" title=\"\">TUC analysis</a> shows that between 2010 and 2014 the UK was fifth from bottom among 29 OECD countries for public investment, and third from bottom for private investment. So the challenge here is for both government and the private sector. But let\u2019s be clear \u2013 the lead has to come from the government.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/535y2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2720468\"            data-video-name=\"Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57da6ff2e4b0e813b694d401\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915hinkley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Businesses want to locate where there is high-quality infrastructure, decent housing for employees, good public services, and a highly skilled and healthy workforce. Far from crowding out the private sector, government investment encourages business to invest and base operations in the UK.</p> <p>The slow and torturous saga of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/heathrow-third-runway\" title=\"\">Heathrow expansion</a> highlights another problem: poor government decision-making. Tens of billions of pounds are ready to be spent by private investors. The expansion will support 180,000 new jobs and provide a buyer for 10% of UK steel production. But the government is still dithering.</p> <p>With Brexit ahead of us, we can\u2019t go on like this, or working people will be left to pay the price. One of the big Brexit risks is the loss of foreign investment. This would increase both the UK\u2019s investment gap and our trade deficit.</p> <p>The TUC has been clear that the best way of addressing this risk is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/workers-rights-brexit-negotiations-unions\" title=\"\">maintain our access to the single market</a>. But the government must also boost public investment, and improve the speed and quality of its decision-making on major projects. There\u2019s no shortage of them in the public and private sector crying out for more investment. Businesses and families need high-speed broadband, high-speed rail and new council homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/absurd-hinkley-point-c-cheaper-cleaner\">It\u2019s absurd that Hinkley is going ahead while cheaper, cleaner options are blocked | Caroline Lucas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While nuclear is an important part of meeting our future energy needs, renewable energy projects need more investment too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\" title=\"\">Cuts to support for solar power</a> in the last few years have led to the loss of half the 35,000 jobs in the sector. We need sustained investment across the renewable energy sector if we are to achieve our ambition of a carbon-free future, and seize the chance to deliver more high-quality jobs.</p> <p>That infrastructure spending should be part of a national industrial strategy to make sure that the UK economy has the capacity for strong growth, and delivers decent jobs. As well as investment in infrastructure and technology, it must include more investment in people, and the skills they need for an advanced economy with high-quality work.</p> <p>But our industrial strategy can\u2019t just focus on manufacturing. Too many jobs in the UK, many of them in service industries like hotels and retail, are already low-paid, insecure and low-productivity. We need action to improve jobs in these industries too, to make sure that people right across the country have the chance of a decent job with decent pay.</p> <p>So now that ministers have finally made the right decision on Hinkley Point, they must go further, creating more jobs with the pay and security needed to buy homes, raise families and enjoy a good quality of life.</p>",

Pulses and beans etc are a really inexpensive way to get protein. Nuts and seeds on the other hand can be quite pricey.

That is a perception vegans should counter, in the hope of making this choice more widely acceptable.</p> <p>On the issue of soya, paradoxically, if you want to eat less of it, you should eat soya. The reason is that the great majority of soya is fed to livestock, in order to produce milk, eggs and meat. And that production process is highly inefficient by comparison to eating it yourself.

But there was no hiatus in warming.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3ed0d67c976214202fbdf013dca98b64bd95bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3ed0d67c976214202fbdf013dca98b64bd95bb6/0_78_1580_948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two polar bears on a chunk of ice in the arctic off Nothern Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two polar bears on a chunk of ice in the arctic off Nothern Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Crosbie/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57dbb987e4b05caf65ecdc34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/georgemonbiot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-16T09:22:40.432Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16693770\">LesterUK</a> says:<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16693770\"><br></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We, as a population, absolutely will not change our behavior if it involves any form of sacrifice on our part.

  "<p>Following Paddy Ashdown up the stairs of his Kennington home (I tell him: \u201cI love your house\u201d \u2013 because that\u2019s what I do when I go to people\u2019s houses \u2013 and he returns smartly: \u201cIt\u2019s a flat\u201d), I mistake his publisher for his co-author, Sylvie Young. \u201cShe\u2019s not my co-author.\u201d \u201cSorry, researcher?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s my collaborator.\u201d I say he should shave her head for the book launch. He gives me a look that says, \u201cNow, why would I shave a person\u2019s head?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s quite easy to make a mistake with Lord Ashdown, but he is also a very equable, forgiving man. \u201cI just regard myself as being an exceptionally fortunate person,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to have adventures in circumstances that are no longer possible. Britain was just coming out of empire. But I\u2019m also able to live the life that I live now.\u201d It has by any lights been fulfilling: a military career, leadership of the Lib Dems, on to the House of Lords, smattered with the memoirs and books that he writes, he says, \u201cin the corners of my life, on trains, waiting for planes\u201d.</p> <p>His latest, Game of Spies, is the true story of a fascinating wartime triad: a spy, a traitor and a disarmingly human member of the Gestapo. It is an insistent and sometimes mesmerising read, tugging at your attention when you put it down, based on an extraordinary cache of documents sent to him by a reader of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/23/paddy-ashdown-spoils-afternoon-prime-minister\">a previous book of his, A Brilliant Little Operation</a>. However, despite this proposed subject matter, most exchanges either begin or end \u2013 or both \u2013 with Brexit, an event about which he felt, \u201clike everybody else, bereft; a sense of personal bereavement. I knew this was coming, a month before. You entertain hopes at the last moment, it\u2019s always a shock. But we drove back to London over Salisbury Plain, it was one of those lovely June mornings. I turned to [his wife] Jane and I think there were probably tears in my eyes, and said, \u2018It\u2019s not our country any more.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So begins the prologue of his book, in which he writes that it seems to him \u201cextraordinary that our besieged little country committed so many of its young men and women and so much of its resources to secret and extremely hazardous operations to free the countries of Europe, which we have now chosen not to be part of\u201d. So return his thoughts, to the fact that he is \u201cvery, very, very frightened about where we are. There is something really nasty here: I remember saying about three years ago, there is a monster below the placid surface of British politics, and it has bloody well emerged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"593d6f55eaf0d14dbcf3a5c9f192d4c82ae73767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/593d6f55eaf0d14dbcf3a5c9f192d4c82ae73767/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashdown, centre, with David Cameron and former Labour party leader Neil Kinnock, make campaign calls during the EU referendum campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashdown, centre, with David Cameron and former Labour party leader Neil Kinnock, make campaign calls during the EU referendum campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are times when his misery could not be more trenchant: \u201cLeave aside the fact \u2013 which is good \u2013 that we don\u2019t have mad militarists who want to go to war, everything else about our age reminds me of the 1930s. The fracture, the disrespect for the business of government, the hatred of the establishment. You see a retreat into isolationism, you see the rise of ugly forces, you see those who lie and make a pattern of lying ... As Goebbels said, if you\u2019re going to tell a lie, tell a big one and tell it often. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">It\u2019s hard not to think of the [\u00a3350m for the NHS] bus</a>. I\u2019m not calling Boris Johnson Goebbels.\u201d Well, except you are. He shakes his head sadly \u2013 hyperbole would diminish the seriousness of the situation: \u201cRespect for our country has fallen so much,\u201d he modifies, \u201cand putting Boris Johnson in that position is not best calculated to improve that.\u201d<br></p> <p>He isn\u2019t the only person to liken political movements across Europe today to the rise of fascism in the interwar years \u2013 sociologists do it all the time, and Andrew Marr said something similar last weekend in the Sunday Times \u2013 but Ashdown might be the greatest vexation to the leave side. Especially on Twitter, he pulls no punches (arguably, it is not possible to pull a punch on Twitter), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paddyashdown/status/772678098345160704\">likening the Tory Brexiteers to brownshirts last week</a>, which caused <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3778989/Why-Paddy-Ashdown-clown-s-wrong-QUENTIN-LETTS.html\">the Daily Mail to call him a \u201cclown who\u2019s wrong about everything\u201d</a>. He waves off this sort of stuff: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you should ever allow yourself to be frightened into timidity for using a metaphor. I\u2019m a writer, I\u2019m not going to be frightened off a metaphor.\u201d He pronounces it \u201cmetafer\u201d, like the name of a gun or a private. He still sounds incredibly military, and says that it informs his writing. \u201cHave I been involved in the business of intelligence, one way or another? Yes. Have I been in the special forces? Yes. Have I been in politics? Yes. That gives you certain insights, much as a woman\u201d \u2013 a look of discomfort crosses his face, which I must admit I enjoy \u2013 \u201cbecause she\u2019s a woman, could write a piece, and know what a woman\u2019s view of these events would be. I don\u2019t say men can\u2019t do it, but you\u2019re better equipped.\u201d Cheers, dude.</p> <p>However, he insists that the military is the least interesting thing about his past. \u201cIt\u2019s the bit where people love to pigeonhole me \u2013 \u2018He was in the Royal Marines and the special services.\u2019 Let me ask you this one question: did you know that I\u2019m the only member of parliament elected from the unemployed register? Well, I was.\u201d In 1983, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paddy-ashdown-speaks-of-his-life-on-the-dole-1150327.html\">he was on a community programme for the long-term unemployed</a>, working voluntarily as a youth worker, having applied unsuccessfully for 150 jobs. Five years later, he was leader of the Lib Dems. He is not without pride, but he\u2019s generally proud about the right things.</p> <p>That said, he has a bit of a blindspot about the Lib Dems, against whom he will not hear a word. Nick Clegg is \u201ca vastly underappreciated figure in British politics\u201d, he says, although doesn\u2019t deny calling him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/nick-clegg-did-not-cater-tories-brazen-ruthlessness\">\u201cfat, pale and unhealthy\u201d, as Clegg recalled in his recent memoirs</a>. \u201cYeah, absolutely. He was the person at the front of the campaign. We get on very well together, I like him very much, but I wasn\u2019t about to not tell him something that I felt he ought to know.\u201d He thinks the Lib Dem \u201cresurgence is happening, take a look at the byelection results\u201d and that the party will, long-term, see a \u201cdividend\u201d from having been in the coalition: \u201cWe will have a reputation for being able to bear the burdens of government, I never expected that in the short run.\u201d And finally \u2013 this is the bit that makes me boggle: \u201cI think history will judge it [2010 to 2015] one of the best periods of government we\u2019ve had in my lifetime, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see another as good for some considerable time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7efab327649947c3e762bd53fe748704deffe178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7efab327649947c3e762bd53fe748704deffe178/0_0_4256_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Charles Kennedy, centre, and Nick Clegg in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Charles Kennedy, centre, and Nick Clegg in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seriously? \u201cI think it did a number of things that were really important.\u201d Like what? \u201cFirst of all, it restrained the Tories; secondly, it helped the country through a very, very difficult passage by providing a majority government who took some sensible decisions.\u201d Like what? \u201cThirdly, it was serious about its environmental targets. Most people say that the green deal did a huge amount. Speak to environmentalists.\u201d (I did so at the time, as luck would have it: the deal started off with some ambition, but ended up as a programme of market-driven loans \u2013 at 7%, not even that cheap \u2013 for people to insulate their homes. A poor household couldn\u2019t afford one, and a richer household would get a much better rate sticking it on their mortgage. Three years into the scheme, only 2,000-3,000 households had taken it up. I don\u2019t want to bore on, but in the interests of a pre-post-truth politics, I feel bound to point out that this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/18/green-deal-green-disaster\">one of the limpest, most pathetic policies in the history of government.</a>)</p> <p>\u201cFourthly, did we do everything to close the gap between the rich and the poor? No, but we did some very important things, such as the pupil premium. It was good, sensible, solid government. It didn\u2019t do all the things I would have wanted, but I\u2019m very clear that it was the right thing to do for the country.\u201d His loyalty to the party is absolutely unswerving, but he will, finally, admit: \u201cDo I want to see them recover? Yes. Will I help them recover? Yes. Do I see signs of recovery? Yes. But that isn\u2019t going to be in time to help the people I want to help.\u201d</p> <p>This is the thinking behind <a href=\"http://www.moreunited.uk\">More United, a joint venture with others broadly of his mind</a> such as Martha Lane Fox \u2013 which attempts to connect people to politics by some route other than a party. \u201cIt has 35,000 members in five weeks, which is not bad, half the size of the Lib Dems.\u201d It has five very broad principles \u2013 fair markets, rebooted democracy, a green economy, openness and tolerance, pro-immigration \u2013 and its members campaign, with money and by any other means they can think of, to give support to the candidate they think best embodies the ideas. It\u2019s neutral in a party political sense, anyone can join, has <a href=\"https://www.crowdpac.co.uk\">a lot in common with Steve Hilton\u2019s Crowdpac</a> and relies ultimately on open primaries, in which non-affiliated voters can choose a candidate.</p> <p>There are politicians who remain profoundly opposed to this idea, most of them in the Labour party, and whose furthest concession to a possible progressive alliance is that the Greens, the Lib Dems and Labour might cut some electoral deals between constituencies. \u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d says Ashdown. \u201cIt turns friends into enemies, it exhausts and uses up vast amounts of political capital. And by the way, politicians aren\u2019t even believed. If the centre-left says, \u2018Do this\u2019, the people will say, \u2018Fuck off\u2019.\u201d He thinks, and he\u2019s by no means alone in this, that political parties have come unshackled from the movements that gave them legitimacy and energy. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a public that doesn\u2019t feel represented by the political parties, they will react. So they either take over, Trump or Corbyn, a political party, move in and occupy it. Or they form their own political parties, Ukip is an example, Marine Le Pen, the Greens in a way.\u201d</p> <p>The question he\u2019s trying to answer now is: \u201cWhy do movements always have to be for horrible things?\u201d and, on the heels of that, how to organise those on the left \u2013 environmentalists, liberals, \u201csensible Labour\u201d, in his winning phrase. \u201cIn the past, if you wanted to get the left together you had to accept the single dominant polarity, which was Labour.

I said: \u2018Listen, the only way that we\u2019re going to win this is if the heavyweights get together and tell them that they\u2019re going to lose.

It\u2019s a mass-scale intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Pakistan has some of the worst rates of child malnutrition in the world, with more than <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/pakistan_pakistan_statistics.html\">40% of children suffering from stunting and 30% underweight.</a> Stunting is a result of malnutrition in the first two years of a child\u2019s life, and limits height as well as emotional, social and cognitive development.</p> <p>The programme is aimed mainly at changing the health of women and children. Palmer says this is because of the disastrous long-term impact of poor health in mothers. \u201cStunting is inter-generational. If you are poor and your mother is stunted, it could take a few generations to iron out, which perpetuates inequalities. </p> <p>\u201cRecurrent and early childbearing reduces a woman\u2019s nutritional status and there are taboos around women eating certain food. For example, they might be told they can\u2019t eat much eggs or meat in pregnancy, which are foods that are rich in protein and iron that they need. Women may eat less nutritious food than other family members and they often can\u2019t access healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>Joel Spicer, president of Micronutrient Initiative, which is working with Mott MacDonald, says the high levels of malnutrition are having a devastating impact on Pakistan\u2019s development.</p> <p>\u201cOur work is taking place in the context of a malnutrition crisis in Pakistan, where nearly half of children are stunted and won\u2019t be able to participate in the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cStunted kids are at a disadvantage cognitively as well as often being the height of a child two or even four years younger. If a child doesn\u2019t get [enough] nutrition in the first 1,000 days, their brain and immune system don\u2019t develop. </p> <p>\u201cWhen these children become adults they are more susceptible to communicable diseases, they are generating less money for their families \u2013 and the overall net effect on GDP is 3% a year for Pakistan. So it is a much cheaper problem to fix than to allow to continue.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/26/southern-africa-appeals-for-billions-el-nino-devastation-drought\">Southern Africa appeals for billions to cope with El Ni\u00f1o devastation</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/24/16-ways-maximise-potential-food-fortification\">Fortification of cereals directly at source</a>, where they are produced, <a href=\"http://www.ffinetwork.org/global_progress/\">is done in almost 90 countries worldwide</a>.

But the world spends $14.5bn a day on energy subsidies, so you have to conclude that malnutrition is a political choice.\u201d</p> <p>In June, Save the Children warned that little progress has been made on curbing malnutrition, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/05/malnutrition-will-not-end-by-2030-warn-campaigners-save-the-children-rio-nutrition-summit\">Rates have actually increased since 2000 in 13 countries, including Papua New Guinea and Eritrea.</a></p> <p>Launching the project, the head of DfID Pakistan, Joanna Reid, said: \u201cFood fortification is a safe, cost-effective way of decreasing micronutrient deficiencies.

With few possessions and just the clothes he stood up in, he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what had happened to him. \u201cThe way we were trafficked, we didn\u2019t see much,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Zazai had no choice but to leave his home in Kabul. \u201cOur neighbours were murdered, my family home was bombed and my beautiful city was reduced to rubble when the mujahideen came in 1979. The firing was indiscriminate and my family had no choice but to escape to Jalalabad. </p> <p>\u201cThe journey was terrifying. Civil war has a domino effect. When you start dividing people over religion, the next step is to pick on those from a different tribe or who speak differently. On our journey out of Kabul, with bullets chaotically fired from outside, passing through our car, we were stopped at least 10 times and questioned. Each one of those times, a small mistake could have led to us all being killed. It was a nightmare. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we arrived in Jalalabad, we lived in a tent in a refugee camp. There were 15 of us. There was no water, sanitation and almost no food. It was appalling, but the situation has got worse since then. There are now 1.2 million people internally displaced in Afghanistan. </p> <p>\u201cBut even under such dreadful conditions, we didn\u2019t want to leave our country. We wanted to return to Kabul, but the violence there just kept getting worse. Then in 2001, after the September 11 attacks, the Americans attacked and the Taliban began forcing all the young men to fight. </p> <p>\u201cMy family risked everything to smuggle me to Pakistan but even there, I risked being sent back so I flew to a central Asian country, possibly Uzbekistan \u2013 I\u2019m not sure \u2013 then walked and hid in cars and lorries, for 12 months to get to Belgium, where I was smuggled into Dover. </p> <p>\u201cThe whole journey was horrendous. The traffickers gave us drugs to keep us quiet. When children cried, their parents were beaten as punishment, and we were often left by the smugglers, hiding in boarded up houses, for weeks at a time.</p> <p>\u201cI had thought the conflict in Afghanistan was bad, but the escape from it was absolutely terrible. Then once I arrived in the UK, the treatment by the Home Office was torturous all over again, the disbelief, the stigmatising, the waiting.\u201d</p> <p>After he arrived in the UK, Zazai was sent to Coventry. He studied for a degree and in 2008 was given British citizenship. Now director of the city\u2019s<a href=\"http://covrefugee.org/\"> Refugee and Migrant centre</a>, he is also a key player in <a href=\"https://coventry.cityofsanctuary.org/\">City of Sanctuary</a>, a nationwide support network for refugees. </p> <p> \u201cThe march is important because we need to put a human face on the refugee crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to understand that refugees are just like them, that anyone living in torment and violence will strive to get their family and children to safety.\u201d</p> <h2>Sara\u2019s story</h2> <p>The student of a spiritual leader in Iran who was imprisoned for his beliefs, Sara Saei, was arrested in 2015 during protests for his release.

If you go into prison in Iran, you don\u2019t necessarily come out alive,\u201d she says. \u201cI fled to the UK. I arrived illegally without a passport. It was very stressful, especially in Turkey where the government cooperates with Iran. It took one and a half months before I landed at Gatwick and could claim asylum.\u201d</p> <p> While Saei applies for refugee status, she volunteers at Amnesty and studies for her maths and English GCSEs. She shares an eight-bedroom flat with 10 people in east London. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not being allowed to work,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to do a masters at university and contribute to this country. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a wonderful country.

Police estimate 100 hectares of land in the municipality are dedicated to growing weed; local farmers reckon the real number could be twice that. </p> <p>So when Colombia recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/22/colombia-president-legalise-medical-marijuana\">legalised marijuana for medical and scientific purposes</a>, farmers in Corinto figured they had a corner on the cultivation market. </p> <p>A group of farmers came together in July to create Caucannabis, a cooperative that aims to be a prime supplier to companies hoping to cash in on Colombia\u2019s new legal marijuana business. </p> <p>\u201cIn this region we have been deeply affected by illegal drugs and terrorism.

The licences granted so far are solely to extract the oils and resin from the marijuana, not to grow it. </p> <p>The three companies who have won the licences plan to grow their own marijuana but farmers in Corinto say that for the new industry to have any real impact in the country, traditional marijuana growers should be the suppliers. </p> <p>\u201cWe are the ones who know the most about growing marijuana in Colombia, so we want to be involved,\u201d says Edward Garc\u00eda, mayor of Corinto, who encouraged the growers in his municipality and four other nearby towns to form the cannabis cooperative. </p> <p>The government has yet to grant anyone a licence to grow marijuana legally and Caucannabis wants to be the first.

Contestants are ordered to \u201csnarl like a dog, look savage, distort the countenance\u201d and are banned from wearing make-up, though as with competitors in similar disciplines such as boxing, diving and gymnastics, they cannot legislate for the impressionistic scoring that decides their fate.

Standing in front of a panel of judges, participants compete to see who can withstand the pain of the subsequent escape attempts the longest. While the one-minute mark was long considered a milestone for \u201ckeeping \u2019em down\u201d, the world record for ferret legging is an astonishing five hours and 26 minutes and is held by the late Reg Mellor, a native of Barnsley who pulled off his heroic feat in 1981, in front of 5,000 witnesses at the Annual Pennine Show in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/05/the-joy-of-six-sporting-pitch-fiascos\">The Joy of Six: sporting pitch fiascos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The history of ferret legging is unclear but the sport is believed to have originated in Britain, at a time when poachers who used to send their animals down rabbit warrens to scare out the occupants were obliged to smuggle their furry assistants past gamekeepers by hiding them in their trousers.

Each competitor must wear baggy trousers to allow free movement of the ferrets from one leg to the other with a minimum of fuss.

Literally translated as \u201cgoat grabbing\u201d, the sport has two variations: Quarajai, and Tudabarai, with both having similar objectives even if the rules of the former are more complicated. To take part in this extremely violent game, the horses, bred specially for the sport, and riders must undergo years of intensive training. Games could often last up to five days but are now restricted to two halves of 45 minutes by rules introduced by the Afghan Olympic Federation. These rules, which also dictate that each team has 10 members, are only adhered to in matches staged in Kabul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ea6e724cce5fcd5edbf97a69b2353ea9733447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ea6e724cce5fcd5edbf97a69b2353ea9733447/0_32_2632_1579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buzkashi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afghan horsemen compete during a Buzkashi game in Panjshir province, north of Kabul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Masood/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as footballers tend to reach their peak in their mid to late 20s, the best Buzkashi riders tend to be men in their 40s, while the importance of their horses cannot be understated. \u201cBetter a poor rider on a good horse than a good rider on a poor horse,\u201d say the Afghans. The most successful Buzkashi competitors are sponsored by wealthy patrons, while the prizes on offer include money or expensive clothes. Arguably the most famous practitioner of the sport is Sylvester Stallone, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp5sbOZRT0\">took to it like a duck to water in Rambo III</a>. Injuries are common, but players are expected to continue with broken ribs, head injuries and assorted other ailments as quitting is considered a sign of weakness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/welcome-to-the-world-nomad-games-if-genghis-khan-was-alive-hed-be-here\">Welcome to the World Nomad Games\u200b: 'If Genghis Khan were alive, he\u2019d be here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because spectators like to gamble on Buzkashi, the sport was banned for the duration of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, on the grounds that the rulers found it immoral.

There are seven players on each team with rolling substitutes. They are made up of chasers (who pass and score with the quaffle), keepers (self-explanatory), beaters (tasked with attacking the chasers with balls called bludgers) and seekers (whose sole objective is to catch the snitch, entering the field after 18 minutes of action).

  "<p>On a beautiful sunny day in Amboseli National Park, against the backdrop of snow-capped Mount Kilimanjaro, a small group of cars was gathered at a safe distance around the prostrate bull elephant. The elephant lay still in the dust, head on the ground, his enormous tusks and trunk stretched out in front of him. Tension rose among the onlookers as the minutes passed.</p> <p>Then the huge elephant flapped his ear, got up gently, shook his head vigorously in a vain attempt to dislodge the strange object around his neck, and walked off. We all breathed a sigh of relief. The operation to attach a tracking collar to Tim had gone perfectly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4596a17eaf40bad23bab275e9477e2ddc1f8371c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4596a17eaf40bad23bab275e9477e2ddc1f8371c/361_414_3171_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant Tim tries to shake off his newly fitted tracking collar in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant Tim tries to shake off his newly fitted tracking collar in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Obuna/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We gathered around as, Kitili Mbathi, Director General of Kenya Wildlife Service, thanked veterinary staff and KWS rangers for their professionalism in conducting the operation, and the NGOs present for their support: WildlifeDirect for initiating the plan and providing the finance, Save The Elephants (STE) for donating the collar, and Big Life Foundation and the Amboseli Trust for Elephants for their logistic and scientific back-up.</p> <p>Addressing members of local Maasai communities present, Mr. Mbathi said: \u201cWe are committed to exploring effective methods to keep our communities safe while securing all of our elephants, especially valuable individuals like Tim.\u201d The collar would keep Tim safe\u2014and away from farmers\u2019 crops.</p> <p>But how does it work, one of the Maasai women asked. Frank Pope of STE explained the technology (click <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/project/tracking-real-time-monitoring/\">here </a>for more information): once an hour the collar lets out a beep, inaudible to humans, that sends details of his location to a satellite. This information can be picked up by rangers on their mobile phones so they know where he is. Fascinated, the women crowded around his phone to see how the information was displayed. \u201cI get it,\u201d one lady said. \u201cIt\u2019s works just the same way as my cow bells.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1af1d7d4a53c20ffac752dca0495cedb27cc8aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1af1d7d4a53c20ffac752dca0495cedb27cc8aa/161_0_3625_2175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Pope of Save The Elephants explains to Maasai women how a mobile phone is used to see the location of an elephant fitted with a tracking collar, in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, 10 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Pope of Save The Elephants explains to Maasai women how a mobile phone is used to see the location of an elephant fitted with a tracking collar, in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, 10 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Obuna/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A security team tracks Tim\u2019s position on a map on the cell phone.

This is the term used to describe African elephants\u2014usually males\u2014whose tusks are so long that they reach the ground. The great tuskers are an irreplaceable symbol of our continent\u2019s unique natural heritage. But their magnificent tusks act like a magnet for poachers (and in some countries still for trophy hunters) and mean that these elephants are constantly at risk. <br></p> <p>Over the years, the systematic extermination by hunters and poachers of big tuskers\u2014and their gene pool\u2014has acted as a form of \u201cunnatural selection\u201d that is the reverse of Darwin\u2019s theory: as a result most elephants in Africa today have smaller tusks that they did 100 years ago.</p> <p>2014 was a black year, when two of Kenya\u2019s most iconic great tuskers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/jun/13/kenyas-biggest-elephant-killed-by-poachers\">Satao </a>and Mountain Bull, were killed by poachers.Thankfully, Tim is still alive and known to be a prolific father. He is much sought after by females in oestrus and has spent his adult life passing on his genes to elephant population in Amboseli. Now 47 years old, Tim was named by Cynthia Moss, founder of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, as part of what has become the world\u2019s longest running scientific study of the species. His name indicates that he is a member of the \u201cT family\u201d, like his mother Trista (click <a href=\"https://www.elephanttrust.org/index.php/family-histories-2\">here </a>to read the fascinating histories of the T family and other elephant families in Amboseli).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"087d08d7ecd370303c7ce34f3ddc9c2ed6ab865f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/087d08d7ecd370303c7ce34f3ddc9c2ed6ab865f/652_253_3305_1983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant Tim in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant Tim in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Obuna/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have interacted with Tim several times and his name matches his feisty personality. He is friendly, smart and charismatic, popular among tourists and looked up to by younger bull elephants. Unfortunately he is also, on occasion, a crop raider. As he enters late middle age, he seems to be getting more brazen. Moreover the younger males in his entourage are learning from his example.</p> <p>This means that Tim is less popular among local farmers. The Maasai traditionally revere elephants. However the expansion of commercial agricultural in areas once dedicated to livestock production is increasingly brining people into conflict with elephants. Although Amboseli elephants are not usually aggressive, they can be bad-tempered and their large size makes them dangerous. In 2016 alone, 8 people have been killed by elephants in the area and 6 more have been seriously injured.</p> <p>An elephant raid on a crop plantation can have a devastating impact on family livelihoods. When farmers find elephants in their crops at night, tempers quickly get inflamed. In Amboseli, farmers often take matters into their own hands and try to scare the elephants away with flares and noises as well as spears. Tim has survived more than one spear attack, and has the scars to prove it.</p> <h2><strong>A narrow escape</strong></h2> <p>It was following one of these occasions, almost two years ago, that the idea of attaching the collar arose. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/nov/09/keep-tim-alive\">previous blog post</a>, I described how we discovered Tim, injured, during a board meeting of WildlifeDirect that was held in Amboseli:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is 4.50 pm and the sun is gleaming on his ivory. An audible \u201caaaaaahhh\u201d emanates from all of us. Tim is truly spectacular. Then Tim notices us and turns. It is as if he is hiding that which we find so beautiful, which too many Chinese are addicted to, and which translates to dollar signs for greedy poachers.</p> <p>We sit quietly contemplating the giant Tim. I am acutely aware that it is very strange for this elephant I know so well to be so shy. He is usually proud and confident, and loves attention and cameras. And then the bombshell, as we see the sore his left flank, where blood and white clumps of puss are oozing out. This is why Tim is acting so strangely. He is in great pain.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully prompt veterinary attention by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust was able to treat the wound. And since then he has been monitored 24/7 by rangers from the local community employed by Big Life Foundation. But WildlifeDirect board member Scott Asen wanted to explore a more effective solution. The problem, he argued is that Tim raid farms. We have to find a way to keep him out of farms. That way, saving an elephant is also a way to help local communities.</p> <p>Scott personally put up the money to finance the collaring and subsequent monitoring operations. Save The Elephants then donated the collar allowing us to allocate even more funds for monitoring. After months of planning, and one aborted attempt, the team met in Amboseli on Friday 9 September to get it done.</p> <p>Collaring an elephant like Tim is a big operation and everyone was assigned their roles: one team of vets, led by Dr. Isaac Lekolol was in charge of the collaring, another was assigned the task of collecting biometric data, Big Life monitored the entire operation from a light airplane and a helicopter was on standby. KWS rangers were in charge of keeping order, and the rest of us were there to observe and assist.</p> <h2><strong>The big day</strong></h2> <p>Early on Saturday morning we met up to get the latest on Tim\u2019s movements in the night. Big Life rangers had stayed awake all night to monitor him. Tim, together with two other bull elephants, Craig and his nephew Townsend, were grazing in area of scrubland near the National Park boundary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d1edb77a9bc08022061f8096bdc0d9ad0cf5f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d1edb77a9bc08022061f8096bdc0d9ad0cf5f3/139_140_3271_1962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants Tim (left), his nephew Townsend (centre) and Craig in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016, during operations to fit a tracking collar to Tim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephants Tim (left), his nephew Townsend (centre) and Craig in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016, during operations to fit a tracking collar to Tim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Obuna/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rangers ordered most of the cars, and the local people who had turned up to see what was going on, to pull up and wait a safe distance away. Three cars with the vets and other key personnel moved slowly over the bumpy bushy terrain towards the elephants. The elephants looked up and, with no sign of panic, started to move away. A tense game of cat and mouse\u2014played out in slow motion\u2014followed. As we drove towards them, the elephants moved away. We couldn\u2019t get close enough for the vet to get a clear shot. Once the dart had delivered the sedative we had to make sure that Tim remained in an open area. <br></p> <p>With the assistance of a couple more cars we nudged Tim towards an open area and away from his two companions, who went off in a huff. They knew something was up, and they didn\u2019t like it! Then we slowly circled around closer to Tim, cutting off his escape route when he tried to follow them. </p> <p>I was in a car about 100 meters away when I saw the vets get out of another car and start to walk towards him. That\u2019s when I knew that the dart had been fired and found its mark. Soon the vets were at his side, tiny black figures silhouetted against his huge grey bulk. Tim stood motionless for more than 7 minutes, while we watched and waited. Then his back legs gave way and he slowly crumpled backwards into a seated position. It was essential to get Tim on his side for the collaring operation and the vets rushed in to push him over. Only then could we start putting on the collar. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"416a1a5ef939b2a374e9c8b73c494bb251448c72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/416a1a5ef939b2a374e9c8b73c494bb251448c72/131_51_1415_849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenya Wildlife Service vets push elephant Tim to the ground as he collapses from the effect of a tranquiliser dart, during operations to fit a tracking collar to the elephant in Amboseli, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenya Wildlife Service vets push elephant Tim to the ground as he collapses from the effect of a tranquiliser dart, during operations to fit a tracking collar to the elephant in Amboseli, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Kahumbu/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luckily STE had realised that none of the collars they had were going to be big enough to go round Tim\u2019s neck, and they had joined two together to get it to fit.

However, there were concerns, because of his age whether he would be able to resuscitate after we put him down but as you can see he is up and gone and it\u2019s been very successful.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response Riana Lemalon the Chairlady of Oltome Nadupo said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today is a joyful day and I am excited and thank God for getting the opportunity to be this up close with an elephant. We care for them from a distance but today on behalf of Oltome Nadupo [the company name means \u2018successful elephant\u2019 in the Maasai language], we have been fortunate to be involved in the collaring exercise.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Sitat Sukare, another company representative expressed the hope that the collar would help reduce human\u2013elephant conflict in the area:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is now easy for communities to identify Tim and I expect that we will be forewarned of Tim\u2019s whereabouts and be trained in how the app and collar works. We value elephants just as much as we value our cows and, in our tradition long ago, elephants were considered women\u2019s cows.</p> </blockquote> <p>Backing up these sentiments, Richard Bonham of Big Life Foundation said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m just so happy that it turned out so well because there were a few people who said that it was dangerous. For us in Big Life the main thing now is that we\u2019ve got an extra tool to monitor Tim and address human wildlife conflict in a more advanced and technological way.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5df33f397d1da2d6a42661f2b47e1d7301c299eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5df33f397d1da2d6a42661f2b47e1d7301c299eb/0_237_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Maasai women look on during operations to fit a tracking collar to elephant Tim in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Maasai women look on during operations to fit a tracking collar to elephant Tim in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Obuna/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Later that day\u2026</strong></h2> <p>In the afternoon, Katito Sayiale of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants and I went out to find him after a tour guide told us that he had just spotted Tim in the Park. We asked if he noticed anything different, and the guide replied: \u201cNo, not really. He was calm. Oh, and he had a radio collar. We knew about the plan but we didn\u2019t know that it had happened\u201d. </p> <p>Afterwards, when I spoke to the tourists he was with and told them about Tim, they were thrilled to learn that they were first people to have seen him with his new shanga (necklace).</p> <p>On our way towards where Tim had been seen, we came across the two other bulls, Craig and Townsend, who we had pushed away from him during the darting. They were walking purposefully and we were sure they were looking for their companion. So we followed, and there Tim was, standing quietly in the shade of an acacia tree. Townsend went quickly to his uncle, whom he clearly adores, and reached out with his trunk to greet him affectionately and then, cautiously, inspect the new collar.</p> <p>Townsend was clearly ill at ease, but Tim seemed to reassure him. \u201cI can live with it\u201d, he seemed say, \u201clet\u2019s get on with life\u201d. Then the three elephants moved away. We heard that later on they turned up at the Amboseli Trust research camp. The researchers were worried that their old friend Tim would hate them for the part they played in the collaring. But Tim was magnanimous, and acted as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>Our long day was over. Tim was none the worse for his experience and, we hope, safer than before. But this is not the end. In fact it\u2019s just the beginning for teams assigned to make use of the technology to keep Tim out of farms, and safe from poachers. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"373b9655124c73065e9c872cc33dec27f8a0c03f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/373b9655124c73065e9c872cc33dec27f8a0c03f/0_113_3515_2109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant Tim walks off after having a tracking collar fitted in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant Tim walks off after having a tracking collar fitted in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, on 10 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Obuna/WildifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Summing up</strong></h2> <p>Our aim in collaring Tim was not just to protect an individual elephant. We wanted to shine a light on the big tuckers. These iconic animals play a key role our ongoing campaign to win over hearts and minds of people all over the world, and local people on the ground, in support of elephant and wildlife conservation.</p> <p>The urgency of our campaign was thrown into stark relief the next day when it was reported that another bull had been discovered dead in a nearby ranch, killed by poachers for his tusks. The bull could not be identified because of the state of the carcass. He died anonymously without much grieving. I couldn\u2019t help feeling acutely aware that this could have been Tim. Gone without us even knowing it was him.</p> <p>We know we can\u2019t collar all our elephants, but hope that by keeping Tim alive he will serve as an inspiration in the search for sustainable solutions to the multiple threats facing elephants: poaching, human wildlife conflict and lack of space caused by habitat destruction.</p> <p>I will leave the last words to Scott Asen, the benefactor who made it all possible:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To collar a majestic wild animal so that he can live out his life in peace and safety is an unnatural act. To build fences where farms have been allowed to encroach on historic migration paths in order to protect the lives of both settlers and animals\u2014those, too, are unnatural acts. But if that\u2019s what it takes to protect our wildlife, I support and encourage all of it.</p> <p>Human population growth along with wholesale abuse of the environment have put us at war with wildlife. And it is a war that, if humanity isn\u2019t careful, we will win. But it will be a tragic and Pyrrhic victory of epic proportion. Very simply, I worry that a world without animals will be a world we won\u2019t want to\u2014or be able to\u2014live in. The last stop on the road to our own extinction.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Postscript, 16 September:</strong> Since being collared, Tim has rejoined his friends and has been observed peacefully in Amboseli National Park<br></p>",

  "<p>The BBC discussion show Question Time descended into a heated row on Thursday, as former New Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell traded insults with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s right-hand man John McDonnell.

The false allegations that Obama was born in Kenya were widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle.</p> <p>Obama was born in Honolulu on 4 August 1961.</p> <p>In a 2014 interview, Trump\u2019s oldest son Donald Jr, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-jr-in-2014-praised-his-dads-moral-conviction-on-obama?utm_term=.ohLMe1Dxy#.tc8qA2orM\">praised</a> the New York real estate developer\u2019s birtherism as a sign of his father\u2019s integrity. \u201cDon\u2019t we want politicians to have strong opinions about things that aren\u2019t swayed by public opinion,\u201d asked the younger Trump.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Clinton was quick to cite Trump\u2019s initial refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division.</p> <p>Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push conspiracy theories surrounding Obama\u2019s birthplace.</p> <p>\u201cHe still wouldn\u2019t say Hawaii. He still wouldn\u2019t say America,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said.</p> <p>\u201cThis man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\u201d</p> <p>In her remarks before the gathering of prominent Hispanic leaders, Clinton reiterated her support for comprehensive immigration reform while decrying Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims alike.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no innuendo or dog whistles any more,\u201d Clinton said of the Republican nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s all right out there in the open now.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day Trump reiterated his economic vision, pledging to voters that he would \u201clower your taxes beyond any number you thought possible\u201d at a rally in New Hampshire.<br></p> <p>The promise came just hours after Trump unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-jobs-vision-25-million-economic-policy\">the latest iteration</a> of his fiscal policy at the New York Economic Club in a speech where he said he outlined the ambitious goal of creating 25 million jobs over the next 10 years. The Republican nominee promised to drastically slash taxes with savings coming from reducing federal bureaucrats whom his campaign has derided with phrases like \u201cthe FDA Food Police\u201d. Trump pledged that the result would increase economic growth from 2% to 3.5% and \u201cturn America into a magnet for new jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s remarks came after her four-day absence due to pneumonia. Before the Washington event, she first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">returned to the campaign trail</a> with a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. Taking stage to James Brown\u2019s I Feel Good, the former secretary of state said she took sick days to \u201creflect\u201d. </p> <p>Clinton told the crowd: \u201cBeing on the trail does not encourage reflection. It\u2019s important to sit with your thoughts every now and again and this helped me to reflect on what this campaign is all about.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton, who has been reluctant to take questions from reporters on the campaign trail, later held a brief press conference after her speech where she dodged repeated questions about when she told running mate Tim Kaine about her diagnosis. </p> <p>The subject of health was relevant for both candidates as an interview of Trump with television personality Dr Mehmet Oz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/donald-trump-dr-oz-medical-report\">aired on Thursday.</a> There, Trump brandished a doctor\u2019s letter and insisted that, although he could lose a few pounds, he was in peak health. In December, Trump\u2019s doctor, Harold Bornstein previously published a letter that said Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. The Republican nominee is a septuagenarian fond of fast food who doesn\u2019t exercise. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also continued his hostility towards reporters. Trump bragged at his New Hampshire speech that his travelling press pool wasn\u2019t able to attend, which he called \u201creally good news\u201d and proclaimed to a cheering crowd: \u201cI love it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, he called for the New York Times to fire their respected national political correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmartnyt?lang=en\">Jonathan Martin</a> while also railing against CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, a debate moderator, because Cooper was \u201cvery biased\u201d and worked for \u201cthe Clinton News Network\u201d.</p> <p>Donald Jr joined in on the act when he told a Philadelphia radio station that \u201cthe media has been [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] number one surrogate in this\u201d. The Trump son added \u201cwithout the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest, but the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic], on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing. If Republicans were doing that, they\u2019d be warming up the gas chamber right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign quickly bashed Donald Jr\u2019s comments as \u201cinsensitive, divisive, and reckless\u201d. In a statement, the campaign added \u201cthe bottom line is this \u2013 offensive references to the Holocaust are never acceptable, especially from a presidential campaign\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have just <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/06/1605782113.abstract\">published a startling analysis</a> of commonly used words in 4298 languages (62% of all those spoken). They wanted to find out if there were associations between particular sounds and meanings that couldn\u2019t be put down to the fact that the languages were related, are used close to one another, or to chance. </p> <p>As it turned out, they detected strong correlations between sounds and meanings that were independent of genetic relationship, borrowing or coincidence. For example, words for \u201csmall\u201d often contained high front vowels (roughly, \u201cee\u201d as in \u201cpeak\u201d or \u201csee\u201d); words for \u201cround\u201d and \u201cred\u201d were linked to \u201cr\u201d sounds; words for \u201cstar\u201d to \u201cz\u201d and words for \u201cfull\u201d to bilabial consonants (\u201cp\u201d and \u201cb\u201d). Associations were found for body parts: \u201ctongue\u201d was correlated with \u201cl\u201d and \u201cnose\u201d with \u201cn\u201d. Remember, these similarities were found in languages as distant from one another as English and Tagalog, Yoruba and Mandarin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Breasts' are associated with 'm', and 'this might be due to the mouth configuration of suckling babies'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why does this matter? One of the first things a student of linguistics learns is that the relationship between the signifier (the sound of a word) and the signified (the concept it represents) is <a href=\"http://personal.bgsu.edu/~dcallen/saussure.html\">arbitrary</a>. We use the word \u201ctree\u201d to signify a plant with a trunk and leaves, but there\u2019s nothing particularly tree-like about the combination \u201ct-r-e-e\u201d. If a law was passed saying we had to call it \u201cfrave\u201d instead, that word would gradually become normal, just like \u201cki\u201d is for Japanese speakers and \u201cumthi\u201d for Xhosa.<br></p> <p>This is part of what gives human language its immense productive power. New words can be coined and they don\u2019t have to be tied in any way to the concept they represent. Just the convention linking that sound and the concept in people\u2019s minds is enough. </p> <p>There are some exceptions: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia\">onomatopoeic</a> words like \u201csmash\u201d or \u201cjudder\u201d have physical qualities which do slightly resemble the things they describe. But the idea that this \u201csound symbolism\u201d extends much further than a few childish curiosities has long been dismissed by most linguists.</p> <p>Damian Blasi and his colleagues focussed on 30 fundamental concepts \u2013 none of which represent loud or distinctive noises, often fertile ground for onomatopoeia. These came from the famous \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list\">Swadesh list</a>\u201d of 100 basic words, and included \u201cbite\u201d, \u201cdrink\u201d, \u201cear\u201d, \u201cleaf\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201ctooth\u201d, \u201cskin\u201d, \u201cone\u201d and \u201cstone\u201d. Incredibly, as well as positive links, they uncovered sets of sounds these words seem to \u201cavoid\u201d \u2013 ones that appear much less often than you would expect if it were down to chance. \u201cWater\u201d (strangely enough for English speakers) seems to avoid the \u201ct\u201d sound. Words for \u201ctooth\u201d avoid \u201cb\u201d and \u201cm\u201d. The \u201ca\u201d \u201ch\u201d and \u201cr\u201d sounds are found less commonly in words for \u201cbreasts\u201d. </p> <p>The study builds on earlier research which hinted at non-arbitrary relationships between sound and meaning. For example, people have been able to successfully <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/223394\">pair up words</a> that have opposite meanings in languages they don\u2019t know. One study showed that English speakers could make better-than-chance <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12361/abstract\">guesses</a> at the concreteness of unfamiliar foreign words \u2013 that\u2019s to say, whether a word might mean something like \u201ccar\u201d versus something like \u201chappiness\u201d. Intimations, if you like, of a universal language of sound. </p> <p>That leaves us with the question: why? In the 19th century, the founder of modern linguistics, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-de-Saussure\">Ferdinand de Saussure</a>, made arbitrariness the central plank of his theory of language. His insights are still pretty powerful. But as the science developed, it seemed to become more and more divorced from the world in which language is used, and the bodies and minds that use it. This trend culminated with ideas about a genetically encoded \u201clanguage module\u201d in the brain, possessed of a language-specific set of rules that determine not just the structure of English, but of Swedish, Burmese, Kazakh, Czech, you name it. </p> <p>Those schools of thought are identified with theorists such as Stephen Pinker and Noam Chomsky. Others believe that language isn\u2019t necessarily hived off, that its structures are determined by an interplay of forces that include general principles of cognition, logical relationships (like cause and effect) and shared environment. </p> <p>Blasi et al, for their part, say that the explanation must lie in \u201cfactors common to our species\u201d, which leaves things fairly open. They point out the association of \u201cnose\u201d with nasal sounds and \u201ctongue\u201d with \u201cl\u201d sounds \u2013 saying that a link between body parts and the sounds they make has been noted before. \u201cBreasts\u201d are associated with \u201cm\u201d and \u201cthis might be due to the mouth configuration of suckling babies or to the sounds babies produce\u201d. </p> <p>So far, so not particularly mysterious \u2013 although the embedding into actual language of these properties is extraordinary if you think about it. But what about \u201cleaf\u201d, \u201cstar\u201d, \u201cround\u201d, \u201cred\u201d \u201cwater\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d? There are clearly some missing pieces of the jigsaw. Synesthesia in both the narrow and broad sense is one possible answer \u2013 \u201cthe ability that humans have for associating stimuli across different modalities\u201d as the authors put it. </p> <p>In other words, translating the \u201cfeel\u201d of a leaf or a stone or a star into sound. That\u2019s pretty much what poets do. And, as it turns out, there could be more poetry woven into language than we ever realised. </p>",
  "<h2>Time running out for Seattle and Vancouver</h2> <p>Seattle and Vancouver sit the wrong side of the red line, and there\u2019s not too long left to change that. The north-west neighbours meet in a big lunchtime kick-off on Saturday, and with Portland looking good for a playoff season spot, that suggests there isn\u2019t room for all three Cascadia Cup rivals in the top six. Saturday\u2019s game could go some way to deciding some things.</p> <p>Seattle have games in hand, but Vancouver have points on the board. Thirty-four of them, to be precise, with Seattle two back on 32. A win for Seattle would keep them right in the mix; defeat for the Sounders could be terminal.</p> <p>The enormity of the Cascadia Cup clash was not lost on Vancouver. \u201cBig rivalry, big game, big everything,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.whitecapsfc.com/post/2016/09/13/waston-were-creating-history?autoplay=true\">said Whitecaps defender Kendall Waston.</a> \u201cAll of us are very excited for that game.\u201d Carl Robinson admitted: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. We\u2019re underdogs and we\u2019ve got a massive game on Saturday. Our season is on Saturday against our rivals.\u201d</p> <p>Vancouver warmed up with a 2-1 Concacaf Champions League win on Wednesday that qualified them for the last eight and eliminated Sporting KC. Seattle didn\u2019t play midweek, but they might have derived an ounce or two of satisfaction from Portland\u2019s 4-2 defeat against Saprissa in Costa Rica.</p> <p>What might save the Sounders is their home form, not least because their away record is so poor. They\u2019ve missed Clint Dempsey, obviously \u2013 they\u2019re winless in the three games since he was sidelined with an irregular heartbeat \u2013 but the club said they were \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that Dempsey would be allowed to play again this season.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a protocol to bring him back and allow him to begin exercising in a safe manner,\u201d GM Garth Lagerwey said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow the protocol. We\u2019ll adjust and consult constantly with the doctors and with Clint. It will be a work in progress. When Clint feels better and when the doctors feel it is safe, then we will consider his return to play.\u201d</p> <p>Saturday might be too soon, however, which means Jordan Morris, with nine goals on the season, and Nicolas Lodeiro, who salvaged a point last week against San Jose, will bear the lion\u2019s share of responsibility. CenturyLink Field should be packed; this game is one not to miss. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Galaxy eye late bid for Supporters\u2019 Shield</h2> <p>It looked for all the world as though FC Dallas were set to coast serenely to the Supporters\u2019 Shield title, with Colorado stuttering, Galaxy and RSL too far back, and the Eastern Conference unable to get its act together. But a surprise home loss against Colorado last week, and a victory for LA, and all of a sudden, the door has opened for Bruce Arena\u2019s side \u2013 and now they\u2019ve got Landon Donovan to call upon. They go to Sporting Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, and with Dallas facing a tough trip to New York, could be up for grabs. </p> <p>LA\u2019s record at Fortress StubHub has been superb, but, like many of the teams in the West, they\u2019re finding things difficult on the road. The quality in their ranks is not in doubt, and in Giovani dos Santos, voted MLS player of the week, they have one of the league\u2019s in-form players. The question for Bruce Arena must be: how to try to Keane, Giovani and Donovan? Of course, Donovan will be used largely as an impact sub, but the Keane-Giovani partnership has failed to fire, for whatever reason. Without Keane, Giovani has 13 goals and four assists in 14 games. With him, he\u2019s scored just once in 11 games. Go figure.</p> <p>Galaxy haven\u2019t swapping SoCal sun for the midwest: they haven\u2019t won in Kansas City since 2007. KC\u2019s record in that time is played eight, won four, drawn four, and their home form this season is good \u2013 it\u2019s away from Sporting Park where problems have arisen. They\u2019re five points above the red line just now, but a loss against LA and the nerves could start to jangle. It\u2019s a crowded house for that final playoff spot.</p> <p>LA will have to do it without Steven Gerrard, who is still about a week away from a return to action. \u201cHe\u2019s coming along,\u201d coach Bruce Arena said. \u201cHe\u2019s almost back.\u201d <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Can the Red Bulls stop Jozy Altidore? Can Toronto stop Wright-Phillips?</h2> <p>Jozy is on a roll. After scoring a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&amp;v=5HyiEC7wEbg\">tidy first-half goal against woeful Chicago Fire</a> last week, the US international has made it now six in the last eight matches. \u201cI know he feels great,\u201d said Toronto\u2019s head coach, Greg Vanney, after the game last week. \u201cHe\u2019s in a good place and it\u2019s up to us to just keep working with him to make sure that he stays there. I think we\u2019ve got the right answers for that now.\u201d Toronto FC\u2019s destiny is now in their hands as they lead the Eastern Conference with 44 points, two more than their New York - red and blue - rivals.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HyiEC7wEbg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5HyiEC7wEbg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Red Bulls, meanwhile, have been enjoying the clinical finishing from their all-time leading scorer and current Golden Boot leader. Bradley Wright-Phillips has scored 18 goals this season, one shy from last year\u2019s total tally, but a far more impressive statistic is the fact that he has <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/12/toronto-fc-vs-new-york-red-bulls-2016-mls-match-preview\">62 goals over the last three seasons, the most in a three-year span in MLS history.</a></p> <p>Sunday\u2019s encounter will be the third time they have met this year, the last time being on May 28 when Wright-Phillips scored a hat-trick in the first 27 minutes of the match. Toronto however, can be happy with their recent home record against Jesse Marsch\u2019s squad as they haven\u2019t won at BMO Field since 2013.</p> <p>One thing is for sure, both defensive units will have to be wary of firepower, and I\u2019m not just talking about the aforementioned strikers. The Red Bulls welcome back Mike Grella from suspension and Toronto\u2019s arsenal is not limited to Altidore. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of this guy called Giovinco\u2026 <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>Patience pays off for FC Dallas and their impressive philosophy</h2> <p>FC Dallas are one of the best stories in MLS, and not just because of what happened last Wednesday when Oscar Pareja\u2019s youthful, energetic side defeated New England Revolution 4-2 to win the US Open Cup - their first trophy in 19 years. FC Dallas don\u2019t just spend money, they heavily invest in youth and development, and it is this mentality that has created a cultivating environment that focuses on chemistry - both on and off the pitch. \u201cWe focused on building the team with young players, and that was a combination of guys that came up through our academy system as well as a handful of foreign players we thought could really add something special,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/09/14/us-open-cup-final-fc-dallas-mauro-diaz-maxi-urruti\">said Clark Hunt, the team\u2019s chairman</a> and brother of Dan Hunt, FC Dallas president. \u201cWe knew it was something that would take several years to play out and we\u2019re seeing it this year all come together.\u201d</p> <p>Not least to mention the influence from Latino players: Carlos Gruezo, Mauro Diaz (a goal and three assists in the final) and Maxi Urruti all have played a major role in exemplifying the Dallas style and turned the team into one of the best in the league. Pareja also became the first ever Latin American head coach to win the cup. The US Open Cup trophy celebrates the hard work that has been implemented but it doesn\u2019t define the team\u2019s ideology - win or lose, Dallas are confident of their system and who they are as a soccer institution. </p> <p>Consequently, NYC FC \u2013 in their second season \u2013 could learn a lot from Dallas as they look to fight Toronto FC and New York Red Bulls all the way to the end for the Eastern title. Patrick Vieira\u2019s men have made significant progress since the beginning of the year, and their passing mentality is often aesthetically pleasing even if it\u2019s sometimes erratic. The team cohesion has improved tremendously as players like Stiven Mendoza, Jack Harrison and Ronald Matarrita have added a fresh level of energy to the squad. The key, however, is chemistry and MLS is a league where you cannot just simply rely on Designated Players for success. So perhaps, the answer for success lies with someone like Kellyn Acosta - the FC Dallas homegrown midfielder/defender who has been with the club since 2009. What a year it has been for the 21-year-old: a US international since January followed by a trophy in September. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>What will Juan Agudelo do next?</h2> <p>New England Revolution\u2019s loss in the US Open Cup final was heartbreaking for their fans but the biggest positive that can be taken away is the emergence of Juan Agudelo and how his recent performances are an indication that they may not need to rely on Kei Kamara after all. In fact, at this point, even a healthy Kamara should be on the bench. Agudelo scored a brace on Wednesday evening, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6aJZJDILk\">including a great first goal </a>which opened the scoring for both teams. The 23-year-old Colombian-born American now has four goals in the last three matches in all competitions and no one is happier than head coach Jay Heaps. \u201cJuan coming back from injury has been a really excellent player for us,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/14/juan-agudelo-heating-new-england-revolution-ahead-stretch-run\">said Heaps on Thursday. </a>\u201cNow you can see he\u2019s fully fit. He really had a lot of energy and a lot of grit to his game because he\u2019s strong, but he also has the ability to turn and create.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6aJZJDILk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rf6aJZJDILk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>New England are currently one point behind Orlando City as they chase the last playoff spot but have played an extra game, so they need to take something away from this weekend.

  "<p>For the first time this year, the big bowl of silver grandstands at the race track that hugs the Tennessee-Virginia state line was packed. Last weekend, nearly 157,000 people flocked to Bristol Motor Speedway, just like the old days \u2013 a spectacle, for sure. The big difference was that they were not there to watch a stock-car race, but a college football game.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/9/9/12838716/bristol-motor-speedway-nascar-track-tennessee-virginia-tech\"> Tennessee raced past Virginia Tech</a> on a field that had been built in the infield of the oval race track. Bristol is so enormous that some fans said that the players were hard to spot, but the complaints were few. They\u2019d been part of a night in which the two teams set an NCAA attendance record for a college football game, and they sounded like they had fun.</p> <p>Bristol used to pack people in for Nascar too, but those days have gone. The first of two annual races in April drew a crowd estimated at 90,000 at a place that once sold out 55 straight races. Three weeks before the football game, a night race at Bristol \u2013 a tough ticket in the old days \u2013 drew an estimated 100,000 before it was rained out.</p> <p> These figures, by the way, were provided by news services and not Nascar, which provided estimates when it was riding high a decade ago. Nascar stopped doing that after the 2012 season, because it had become obvious that crowds were shrinking. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberttuchman/2015/02/23/what-has-happened-to-the-once-high-flying-sport-of-nascar/#76cc04515c0b\">Television ratings have been plummeting</a> as well.</p> <p> Ed Hinton, a Mississippi-born journalist who covered Nascar for Sports Illustrated and ESPN.com before his retirement, told the Guardian this week, \u201cNascar\u2019s nose dive has been a precursor of the Trumpists\u2019 perfect storm,\u201d referring to Donald Trump\u2019s improbable-but-still-kicking presidential campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/28/indianapolis-500-recovered-civil-war-100-years\">How the Indy 500 recovered from civil war to celebrate its 100th running</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe demographics are almost identical: the angry blue-collar masses had their angry blue-collar idol in Dale Earnhardt. Suddenly he was gone, and their venting mechanism broke,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cThey felt left out with the fancy new stars. Then Nascar introduced uniform cars, gutting the brand identity they felt with Ford, Chevrolet, etc.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t like third generation czar Brian France and disapproved his every move. Then, as their personal plights declined \u2013 much like today\u2019s Trumpists \u2013 they exercised the less-educated white-males\u2019 tendency to blame someone or something else. Then Nascar made its racing vastly safer. There was no more edge of danger in it. Finally it actually became what critics have long called it: just a bunch of cars going around in circles.\u201d</p> <p>Hinton then said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it can recover.\u201d</p> <p>Two months after<a href=\"http://fox59.com/2016/06/07/photo-shows-view-from-space-of-record-breaking-crowd-at-100th-indy-500/\"> a sellout crowd estimated at 350,000</a> watched the 100th Indianapolis 500 in May at the hallowed Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a Nascar race drew about 50,000 at the same venue. It was hot that day, but the Nascar race at Indy, even if it was on a track not built for stock-car racing, outdrew the IndyCar race only a few years ago.</p> <p>On the same night as the Virginia Tech-Tennessee game, a Nascar race at Richmond, Virginia, drew 2.7 million television viewers, less than half as many people as watched the football game. TV ratings for the Richmond race were said to be down 12% from the same race in 2015 and 44% from 2014.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, butting right into the NFL, the 10-race Nascar playoffs open with a race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois. You can buy a ticket on the start-finish line with a good view of the entire track on StubHub for $87. A ticket on the 50-yard line for the Bears-Eagles game at Soldier Field a night later will throw you back at least $170.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9d6336c6a9a3b7c0161ebc748cd20e9aeb69a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9d6336c6a9a3b7c0161ebc748cd20e9aeb69a91/0_9_5472_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nearly 157,000 people packed into Bristol Motor Speedway last weekend - but it was for a college football game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nearly 157,000 people packed into Bristol Motor Speedway last weekend - but it was for a college football game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nascar does have a 10-year, $8.2bn television deal with Fox and NBC that will run through 2024. But it does not yet have a title sponsor after this year. Sprint announced almost two years ago that it is ditching Nascar after the 2016 season because the company said it could spend its advertising money better somewhere else.</p> <p>The 36-race season is at least 12 races too long. The playoffs, originally known as the \u201cChase for the Championship,\u201d was contrived in 2004 to generate interest in the homestretch, which collides with football season, but the Nascar playoff structure, with races within races, has been expanded and tweaked to the point where it looks more like a gimmick.</p> <p>The 16-driver field for the \u201cChase for the Sprint Cup\u201d does not include Dale Earnhardt Jr, by far the most popular driver among fans, because Earnhardt <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/general/news/dale-earnhardt-jr-to-miss-remainder-of-nascar-season-with-concussions/\">has been sidelined with a concussion</a>, perhaps permanently. Drivers with sorta-household names like Tony Stewart, Jimmie Johnson and Kyle Busch are in the Chase, but so are guys like Chris Buescher, Chase Elliott and Austin Dillon. (Elliott is the 20-year-old son of former series champion Bill Elliott.)</p> <p>Earlier this week, Nascar announced that a poll of fans at Daytona International Speedway had decided on the four faces to adorn a fictitious Mount Rushmore at the track: Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt Sr, Jeff Gordon and Cale Yarborough. Gordon is the only active driver, and he returned for six races this year only to fill in for Earnhardt Jr, a former team-mate.</p> <p>The death of Earnhardt Sr, a seven-time champion, in an accident in the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, put more focus on stock-car racing, and Nascar wisely capitalized, expanding rapidly from its colorful Southern roots, which had featured races with fields of souped-up cars used during the week to run moonshine past tax revenuers.</p> <p>But traditional fans felt abandoned, even alienated. Tickets were too expensive. Drivers were bland; on-track disputes in the old days often were settled with fisticuffs. Rules seemed to be constantly changed to promote close racing. As Hinton mentioned, it is hard to tell the difference between a Chevy and a Ford \u2013 or, for that matter, a Toyota, a series newcomer.</p> <p>The capacity at Daytona, one of the sport\u2019s hubs, was reduced by 58,000 fans. At the Brickyard race in Indianapolis, large portions of empty stands were covered with advertising banners. The first stock-car race had been held there in 1994, and even though the track was not banked enough for good racing, it became a hit. This year, people said it was too hot to go.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the actor and educator Bill Nye, the \u201cScience Guy\u201d on television, suggested, and not facetiously, Nascar get ahead of technology and begin to race electric-powered cars instead of fossil-fuel-chuggers.</p> <p>\u201cJust think what an electric race would be like,\u201d <a href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/if-nascar-embraced-electric-cars-it-could-change-the-world\">he wrote on Aeon.co</a>. \u201cIt would be faster, and quiet. You could talk to the person next to you. The drivers could probably hear the roar of the crowd rather than having to imagine it as they do now. And most significant from my point of view, everyone in the crowd, every race fan, would want an electric car!\u201d</p> <p>The purists harrumphed: Why in the world should they pay attention to a dorky scientist? Nye, who has many relatives from the South, was merely offering his opinion. Nascar, he wrote, was, \u201ccelebrating a very old transportation technology of yesterday.\u201d</p> <p> As result of many other factors, it seems as if Nascar has become a competition of yesterday anyway. The football field at Bristol was kept in place for another college game this weekend, between two smaller schools, Eastern Tennessee and Western Carolina. There won\u2019t be 157,000 there, but a supermarket chain is sponsoring the game. And they could get 30,000.</p>",
  "<p>Fears that Deutsche Bank could face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-must-pay-14bn-fine-to-settle-us-mortgage-case\">$14bn (\u00a310.5bn) </a>penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis prompted an 8% plunge in its shares and raised fears about the potential bills for rival lenders involved in similar investigations.</p> <p>Even as Deutsche insisted it had no intention of agreeing to such a settlement with the Department of Justice, questions were raised about the possible impact on Germany\u2019s lender from activities which allegedly took place a decade ago. Berlin called for its biggest bank \u2013 run by Briton John Cryan \u2013 to be treated fairly.</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s plight led to a sell-off in shares on Friday in other banks facing potential penalties from the DoJ, including Royal Bank of Scotland, which fell more than 4% \u2013 the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. The focus also turned on Barclays as well as major Swiss banks.</p> <p> The DoJ action <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/marketturmoil.lehmanbrothers\">comes almost eight years to the day that Lehman Brothers collapsed</a>, catapulting the global economy into a deep and prolonged crisis, and demonstrated that the clean-up of the financial sector is still ongoing. The matter relates to the way banks packaged up mortgage bonds before the crisis \u2013 between 2005 and 2007 \u2013 and sold these so-called residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) to investors, who later suffered losses. </p> <p>It would be one of the largest penalties levied on a bank, but Deutsche insisted it did not expect the $14bn to be the final figure. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets said that the mooted penalty represented around 80% of the stock market value of Deutsche, which has been already been pummelled amid fears for its growth prospects in a low interest rate environment across the major global economies.</p> <p>After the possible penalty was reported late on Thursday night by the Wall Street Journal, the <a href=\"https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2016/medien/deutsche-bank-confirms-negotiations-with-doj-regarding-rmbs-en-11684.htm\">bank issued an urgent statemen</a>t in which it described the price as the \u201copening position\u201d by the DoJ. \u201cThe DoJ has invited the bank as the next step to submit a counter proposal,\u201d Deutsche said. </p> <p>\u201cDeutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.\u201d</p> <p>Until now, the DoJ has focused its RMBS investigations on US banks. The DoJ asked Citigroup to pay $12bn initially but the fine was eventually set at $7bn while Goldman reportedly faced a $15bn bill before agreeing to pay $5bn earlier this year. In 2014, Bank of America paid $16.7bn to US authorities to settle similar charges. </p> <p>Germany\u2019s finance ministry spokeswoman, Friederike von Tiesenhausen, also indicated that the matter was not over. \u201cThe government is aware that the US authorities have agreed similar settlement payments with other credit institutions. The government expects that at the end of this process a fair result will be achieved on the basis of equal treatment,\u201d she told Reuters.</p> <p> The potential penalty was described by German newspaper Handelsblatt as a \u201cminor catastrophe\u201d. It said: \u201cFor a bank of this calibre and complexity, this would be unacceptable and would practically force a capital increase.\u201d</p> <p>Deutsche has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for a string of legal claims and Ingo Frommen, banking analyst at German bank LBBW told Reuters: \u201cIf the final bill is at \u20ac5bn or more Deutsche Bank will not be able to avoid a capital hike anymore\u201d .</p> <p>There was some speculation that the scale of the fine had been prompted by the European commission\u2019s demand that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Apple pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland</a> and the possible impact of the looming US election. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-shares-plunge-14bn-fine-doj-business-live\">Deutsche Bank shares plunge 8% as $14bn fine rattles markets \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the City, the focus quickly turned to RBS, which as recently as Monday was warning analysts that it would need to put more money aside to deal with any penalty from the DoJ for RMBS settlements.

  "<p>Concerns that a light festival in central Australia could affect a vulnerable population of rock wallaby has led to more than a thousand people signing a petition calling for it to be stopped, and to the federal Department of the Environment and Energy examining the festival\u2019s plans.</p> <p>Parrtjima \u2013 A Festival in Light is planned to go for 10 days at the end of September. Each night a four-hour light show will project Indigenous art onto a 2.5km stretch of cliff in the MacDonnell Ranges.</p> <p>The festival is run by the Northern Territory Major Events Company, which is owned by the NT government. It describes the light show as one of the biggest ever.</p> <p>\u201cThe sheer scale of the lighting on the MacDonnell Ranges makes Parrtjima Australia\u2019s longest-ever light show installation,\u201d the <a href=\"http://parrtjimaaustralia.com.au/experience/\">official website for the festival says</a>. </p> <p>The MacDonnell Ranges are home to a distinct \u201crace\u201d of the black-footed rock wallaby \u2013 the MacDonnell Ranges race, which is listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d under federal law, with \u201cdisturbance by tourists\u201d listed as <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/a707e585-3f05-4540-bf3d-1b28ff57d455/files/rock-wallabies-recovery-plan.pdf\">one of its main threats</a>.</p> <p>A federal recovery plan has been in place since 2013, which aims to increase the increase its population.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nt-chief-minister-hon-michael-gunner-mla-nt-government-stop-the-parrtjima-light-show-blasting-endangered-rock-wallabies-with-lasers\">A petition on the site Change.org</a> has called for the light show to be stopped. At the time of writing, it had just over 1,000 signatures.</p> <p>Mark Eldridge, a mammalogist at the Australian Museum who has researched the rock wallabies, said the description of the festival\u2019s action sounded like it could have a serious impact on the populations of rock wallabies that live there.<br></p> <p>\u201cI imagine it would certainly be a disturbance to the wallabies,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty much the entire home range of some of these animals.\u201d</p> <p>He said these wallabies had very tight home ranges, which they defend aggressively. They move out of them if scared, but can then encounter aggression from other wallabies.</p> <p>However, he said it was impossible to fully judge whether the festival would have a serious impact without investigating properly. \u201cThey do tolerate some disturbance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut what we do know is the MacDonnell Ranges are a really important habitat for this species. It was formerly very widespread, but has now collapsed back. It\u2019s really only common around Alice Springs and in the MacDonnell Ranges.\u201d </p> <p>If a project is likely to have a significant impact on a species listed as vulnerable under federal law, it needs to be referred to the Department of the Environment and Energy.</p> <p>When asked, the department said it had not been contacted by the festival.</p> <p>\u201cThe department will examine the festival\u2019s plans against any obligations it may have under national environmental law,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Andrew Hopper, general manager, Northern Territory Major Events Company said: \u201cWildlife scientists from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources have provided advice that there is a very low risk that the light show will have a significant impact on the population of black-footed rock wallabies in the MacDonnell Ranges. This is due to the fact that a very small proportion of their habitat will be potentially disturbed for a limited period of time.\u201d</p> <p>He said they had not referred the matter to the federal Department of the Environment and Energy because \u201cthe festival is not likely to have a significant environmental impact\u201d.</p> <p>He said there was strong evidence the animal\u2019s range in the NT was similar to what it was \u201cat the time of European settlement\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Just over 400 miles west of Chile, in an otherwise barren stretch of the southern Pacific, lie three islands, together totalling some 100&#xa0;sq km. Volcanic, vertiginously mountainous, swept by chill currents and buffeted by wind, this former penal colony is not a place where one would want to&#xa0;spend much time, still less be marooned; nowadays there are fewer than 800 people living there, and they work chiefly in the lobster industry. The islands take their name from Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, the Spanish mariner who first put them on the map in 1563 (prior to this, they were almost certainly uninhabited). But although Britannia never ruled these particular waves, one of the group has a homelier name. It is known as Robinson Crusoe Island.</p> <p>In truth, the Crusoe connection is more tattered even than the garments Daniel Defoe\u2019s hero wanders around in for the best part of three decades. The title page to the first edition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/17/classics.danieldefoe\" title=\"\"><em>The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner</em></a><em> </em>(1719) declares the island in question incontrovertibly to be \u201cnear the Mouth of the Great River Oroonoque\u201d. This is not&#xa0;merely on the wrong end of South America, about 3,100 miles to the north east, but on completely the wrong side, near Venezuela and other former colonial British territories. So much for map reading.</p> <p>Even so, as Andrew Lambert shows, generation after generation of readers and visitors have been only too keen to pursue the link. Buoyed by the fact that Juan Fern\u00e1ndez is the place where the real Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk lived for four years from 1704, having fallen out with his captain and abandoned ship, and that Defoe was perhaps inspired by Selkirk\u2019s tale, visitors have&#xa0;scoured the island for traces of literature\u2019s most famous castaway.</p> <p>Stationed on Juan Fern\u00e1ndez as a boat keeper in the 1820s, the English sailor William Clark made sure to have with him \u201ca fine bound copy of Crusoe\u2019s adventures\u201d in order to regale visitors about his semi-fictional predecessor. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">Herman Melville</a> perhaps cruised past in 1841, on the whaler Acushnet, and pondered the connection. Even less fanciful naval types have fallen under Defoe\u2019s spell: in 1872, the sloop HMS Reindeer called by, its captain being \u201cdesirous of visiting the spot associated with the story of \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019\u201d. More recently, members of the Chilean government have been zealous converts \u2013 in 1966 they rechristened the island, previously known by the less appealing name of M\u00e1s a Tierra (\u201cCloser to Land\u201d), hoping that tourists might be a better source of income than crustaceans.</p> <p>Much of this history is interesting, and Lambert \u2013 whose previous books include biographies of Nelson and a colourful study of the British-American war of 1812 \u2013 pilots us nimbly through the seafaring portions of the story. There are yo ho ho tales of 17th-century pirates and 18th-century buccaneers, and a genuinely nauseating section on&#xa0;the doomed sojourn of Commodore George Anson in 1741. Circumnavigating the globe, his crews incapacitated by scurvy, Anson was forced to put in at Juan Fern\u00e1ndez to save his expedition; by the time they sorted themselves out, 254 men were dead and the ships were, in Lambert\u2019s words, \u201cfloating charnel houses with raw sewage slopping across the lower decks\u201d. Even Selkirk \u2013 who was reportedly driven to&#xa0;have sex with goats during his stay \u2013 emerged in better shape than that.</p> <p>Yet when it comes to the precise destination of his own voyage, Lambert\u2019s compass wavers. His credentials as a naval historian are solid; as a reader of more imaginative literature, they are less compelling. It\u2019s never entirely clear what we\u2019re doing here in the chilly South Pacific, and at times it seems we,&#xa0;too, might never escape. Thomas More\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/16/utopias-past-present-thomas-more-terry-eagleton\" title=\"\"><em>Utopia</em></a> \u2013 an island whose imaginary, semi-satirical status makes it an interesting place to begin \u2013 is briskly dismissed, and other voyage narratives never earn a convincing place in Lambert\u2019s hopscotch argument.</p> <p>The one piece of literature that undeniably has close ties to Selkirk \u2013 William Cowper\u2019s 1782 poem \u201cVerses Supposed to be Written by Alexander Selkirk, during His Solitary Abode\u201d \u2013 is&#xa0;an extraordinary work, hallucinogenically intense in its depiction of loneliness and genuinely affecting in its relationship to Cowper\u2019s own life (a&#xa0;landlubber who struggled bitterly with depression, the poet found something terrifying in the romantic solitude mooned over by younger writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/samuel-taylor-coleridge\" title=\"\">Coleridge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/percy-bysshe-shelley\" title=\"\">Shelley</a>). Cowper would have a great deal to offer a serious study of what has elsewhere been called islomania; Lambert doesn\u2019t go much beyond quoting the poem. Instead we get page after page on scurvy, what can only be described as an unhealthy obsession (I&#xa0;counted over 70 separate mentions).</p> <p><em>Robinson Crusoe</em> itself isn\u2019t given quite such short shrift, but the book\u2019s absorbing enigmas are barely probed: is it really a semi-fictionalised response to Selkirk, or to stories of other real-life castaways, of which there were a profusion in the 18th century? What about the barbed questions Defoe proposes about politics and colonialism, or the book\u2019s own insights into the realities of isolation? What are we being asked to make of Crusoe himself, a half-German little Englander, whose response to landing on a desert island is to plant crops, construct himself multiple residences (\u201cmy Country-House and my Sea-Coast-House\u201d) and acquire a&#xa0;black manservant, Friday, whom&#xa0;he attempts to \u201ccivilise\u201d?</p> <p>What Lambert skirts around but doesn\u2019t develop is surely the bigger and more interesting quest \u2013 how Crusoe has become a poetic patriotic metaphor for how some English people see ourselves. Far from being a stern morality tale on the goat-abusing terrors of isolation, Robinson and his island have become reliable folk motifs, referenced everywhere from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/desert-island-discs\" title=\"\"><em>Desert Island Discs</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/17/lord-of-the-flies-golding-centenary\" title=\"\"><em>Lord of the Flies</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/i-m-a-celebrity\" title=\"\"><em>I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 </em></a>At the very least, this must be what impels all those visits to Juan Fern\u00e1ndez. It\u2019s striking how often Englishmen (it is usually men) land on these islands on the other side of the world and see somewhere they are determined to recognise, whether it\u2019s in what one of Anson\u2019s diarists called M\u00e1s a Tierra\u2019s \u201cbeautiful groves of trees, interspersed with many openings and ever-green valleys\u201d, or what a later visitor described as \u201cvistas, glen, and peak\u201d that \u201cseemed placed but to be admired\u201d. Everyone else glances at the place and sees a wind-blasted, cloud-infected dump; the English see somewhere just like home, a shimmering Arden laid out by Capability Brown and policed by Alexander Pope.</p> <p>Then again, given the prevailing weather conditions, perhaps the resemblance isn\u2019t all that surprising. One thinks mournfully of another wind-blasted archipelago, the Falklands, and of Brexit. But then Lambert appears to suffer from a touch of islomania himself. In a disputatious coda, the author fulminates against \u201cfatuous apologies that reflect 21st century values\u201d (for what? Colonial massacres? Boris Johnson\u2019s blooper tapes?), then makes the surreal claim that \u201cmodern Britons are profoundly ignorant of their imperial past, having been systematically fed a&#xa0;very different identity, one of Continental origin\u201d. Lambert\u2019s Australian relatives, we\u2019re told, \u201cface significant barriers to entry into the United Kingdom, while vast populations with whom I share nothing in blood, language, history or&#xa0;culture are free to enter at will\u201d. If&#xa0;the Laughton Professor of Naval History at King\u2019s College London honestly believes he has so little in common with his fellow Europeans, maybe he should consider emigrating.

  "<p>Screaming sirens, overcrowding, traffic; life in the city isn\u2019t always relaxing.</p> <p>These stressors aren\u2019t simply inconvenient or irritating, though; research has suggested that urban living has a significant impact on mental health. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf\">One meta-analysis</a> found that those living in cities were 21% more likely to experience an anxiety disorder \u2013 mood disorders were even higher, at 39%. People who grew up in a city are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those who grew up in the countryside, with a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16150958\">2005 study</a> suggesting this link may even be causal. </p> <p>Urban stressors appear to have a biological impact, too. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jun/22/city-living-afffects-brain\">2011 study</a> from the Central Institute of Mental Health at the University of Heidelberg found that city living was associated with greater stress responses in both the amygdala and the cingulate cortex \u2013 areas linked to emotional regulation, depression and anxiety. This increased activation, the research team said, could have a \u201clasting effect\u201d, both on the brain\u2019s development and its ongoing susceptibility to mental illness.</p> <p>The studies are part of a wider field of environmental psychology that seeks to understand how individuals interact with their environments, and how those environments can affect our social lives, relationships and even our mental health. </p> <p>The issue is hotly debated. For example, it\u2019s often believed that open plan offices promote pro-social working and avoid the drab monotony of cubicle working, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2014/sep/29/open-plan-office-health-productivity\">other studies</a> claim that it can instead be bad for productivity and wellbeing. </p> <p>Co-housing is often promoted as a way of encouraging community spirit. Many people who live in these communities \u2013 usually private bedrooms with communal kitchens or social areas and shared maintenance responsibility \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/21/how-to-create-happy-communities-through-co-housing\">have reported increased happiness</a> and connection with other residents. But <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ala-apa.org/newsletter/2006/10/17/the-good-and-the-bad-of-cohousing/\">other studies</a> have stressed that tenants can lose their sense of individualism and privacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db65daa3618f840eae8c828c798a6bfa599dd0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db65daa3618f840eae8c828c798a6bfa599dd0b/0_85_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lilac Grove in Leeds co-housing project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lilac Grove in Leeds, a co-housing project built on the site of a former school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Layla McCay, director of the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health, says these debates are complex and dependent on a number of nuanced factors. The think tank was set up to encourage more rigorous evaluation on the way we design our cities, and what impact it can have on mental wellbeing. She isolates several elements that she believes have a positive influence: access to nature or green spaces, the design of public spaces that facilitate physical activity and encourage social interaction, and living and working in spaces that feel safe. </p> <p>But what about particular kinds of buildings? Brutalist structures like the Barbican estate in London are not always considered to be so positive for mental health, with many condemning brutalism\u2019s <a href=\"https://theawl.com/the-ugly-beauty-of-brutalism-41ae4f80a683\">depressing aesthetic</a>. Yet despite some calling it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3126946.stm\">London\u2019s \u201cugliest building\u201d</a>, the Barbican is a perfect example of the positive attributes outlined by McCay. Full of greenery, lakes and balconies, the estate also gives pedestrians priority over cars and features mini town squares where residents can socialise, work and relax.</p> <p>The estate is well lit and designed with good sight lines, meaning residents feel safe \u2013 a huge factor in their mental wellbeing. But this can be a difficult line to tread. Though well-lit areas are generally considered to reduce stress by increasing feelings of safety, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/19/darkness-luxury-britains-council-estates-lighting-cctv\">it has been argued</a> that darkness is a luxury not afforded to those living in council housing. If you live in an estate where bright lights shine in your window, you may lose sleep or feel exposed and surveilled; darkness, on the other hand, can be more subtly landscaped to provide a sense of value, safety and beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c43b5293936e5931b7500215edc15343de411d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c43b5293936e5931b7500215edc15343de411d34/0_144_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned shops in north Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It has been suggested that abandoned shops can make people more anxious.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if a so-called ugly building can still be positive for mental health, what role does beauty and aesthetic have to play? Despite beauty being a subjective term, <a href=\"http://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/journal1-beautifulplacesandwellbeing.html\">recent research has found</a> that \u201cinhabitants of more scenic environments report better health\u201d, but again this often comes back to the presence of nature. Indeed, neglected environments can contribute to mental ill-health \u2013 dilapidated neighbourhoods and abandoned shops or houses can make us feel unsafe, with run-down environments <a href=\"http://www.sprawlwatch.org/health.pdf\">found</a> to contribute to anxiety and persistent low mood.</p> <p>Though high-rise housing was initially commended for its views, larger rooms, sense of \u201curban privacy\u201d and efficient use of concrete, it was later suggested that the designs gave rise to various social and mental ills: increased crime, suicide rates and behavioural problems. High-floor dwellers were most at risk when it came to the negative impacts of such living environments because they were apparently most likely to isolate themselves. Such buildings were roundly condemned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jgballard\">JG Ballard</a>, who felt that the \u201crapid turnover of acquaintances, the lack of involvement with others, and the total self-sufficiency of lives\u201d he saw in high-rises would allow \u201cthe psychotics\u201d to take over. </p> <p>Though Ballard\u2019s doom-laden vision of high-rise living may seem compelling \u2013 especially considering the anti-social reputation of such estates \u2013 more recent research suggests that the buildings are not as intrinsically flawed as we might first imagine. Rather, the social ills found in such environments may be more closely related to poor maintenance than anything innate. Reports have <a href=\"http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/461-480/tandi476.html\">found</a> that \u201crisky\u201d facilities such as broken lights and windows, litter, graffiti and non-functioning CCTV may have more to do with increased crime rates \u2013 and anxiety-inducing fear of crime \u2013 than the physical environment itself. So mental ill-health may increase once the physical environment has deteriorated. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907a7faa78b06f31dad8fbe0aa578273713ebac1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907a7faa78b06f31dad8fbe0aa578273713ebac1/0_94_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Costanera Center shopping mall, Santiago de Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If shopping malls are well maintained and safe, they could have a positive impact on mental health.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felipe Trueba/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">Southwark\u2019s Heygate Estate</a> had a reputation for crime, despite crime rates that were <a href=\"http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf\">half the average for the borough</a>. Southwark council\u2019s director of regeneration <a href=\"https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=urban-regional-planning;6d774927.00\">claimed in 1999</a> that \u201csocial housing generates people on low incomes coming in, which generates poor school performances, and middle class people stay away\u201d. With attitudes like this, is it any surprise that tenants felt isolated and abandoned?</p> <p>Shopping centres also appear to refute the physical determinism of much environmental psychology. Often considered to be vast, unhealthy behemoths designed to disorient and dazzle us into spending money we don\u2019t have, shopping malls could, in fact, be beneficial to individual and societal wellbeing. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301595098_The_restorative_potential_of_shopping_malls\">One team of researchers</a> argues shopping centres may possess \u201cmentally restorative qualities\u201d that could rival even natural settings. Again it suggests that healthy factors \u2013 greenery, a focus on safety, good maintenance, a sense of openness \u2013 could significantly reduce stress, no matter how buildings themselves are designed or interpreted.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t always the case; privatised public spaces like shopping malls often limit activity and use design to control behaviour. Though these spaces may feel and seem as if they are public, they are privately owned, meaning that our rights and behaviours are constricted and controlled. This in turn can contribute to a sense of anxiety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bd9943077b7f80302d7c334b448c2a1053885eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bd9943077b7f80302d7c334b448c2a1053885eb/0_150_2000_3804/526.jpg\" alt=\"Sky City in Changsha\" width=\"526\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Would living \u2018Sky City\u2019 in Changsha feel claustrophobic?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Feature China/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about buildings that claim to be cities in themselves? In China, the proposed development of a \u201cSky City\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to combine natural green spaces with homes, hotels, offices, shops, schools and a hospital in one building \u2013<strong> </strong>was an attempt to create a living environment that both encourages tenant wellbeing as well as improving sustainability and providing efficient use of space. Gensler\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/23/inside-shanghai-tower-china-tallest-building-green-skyscrapers\">Shanghai Tower</a>, which is set to open to the public soon, has incorporated restaurants, shops, homes, offices and even parks inside a consciously pro-social spiral glass shell. Visiting a park two floors down from your flat might sound convenient, but can it really replace the health benefits of a stroll in a natural green space? Going to school in the same building you live in could save time, but it also sounds like a limiting, claustrophobic and homogenous experience.</p> <p>In terms of workspaces, McCay describes Coca Cola\u2019s new Tokyo headquarters, designed by Japanese architectural firm JMA, as an impressive example of design that combines good architecture with mindfully positive environmental features. The company has established bike parking so that employees cycle rather than drive to work, the building is full of natural light, and co-working spaces have replaced traditional cube-style office working spaces. </p> <p>Ongoing debates aside, physical environment can only determine so much. Biological and social factors are still major drivers of mental ill-health, whether clinical or not. </p> <p>\u201cGenetics, early experiences, family relationships and social settings can\u2019t be addressed through urban design,\u201d McCay explains. \u201cBut urban design can and should play a role, just as it does for physical disorders, which have equally complex causes.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, buildings and public spaces are being designed \u2013 or at the very least, critically analysed \u2013 with mental wellbeing in mind. A small number of collectives and centres have been established to examine the ways urban spaces intersect with mental health, and architects and policymakers are slowly becoming more mindful of the ways their projects impact on the health and happiness of city-dwellers. </p> <p>With anti-stigma campaigns and increased media visibility bringing mental health to the forefront of the cultural landscape, there\u2019s a clear case for policymakers to take it into consideration when designing public spaces. But experts believe guidelines for healthy urban environments are currently failing to take this growing awareness into consideration. Alan Penn, dean of the Bartlett faculty of the built environment at University College London, believes that policymakers and architects are not dealing with mental health sufficiently because \u201cunderstanding of these issues is not yet mainstream\u201d in the architectural community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/08/where-world-most-stressful-city-urban-life-depression-anxiety\">Where is the world's most stressful city?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McCay is optimistic, and believes that opportunities to improve mental health will become \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and \u201can expected component of the value of any design for buildings and public spaces\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDesigning spaces to promote good mental health \u2013 and to support people with mental health problems \u2013 is an integral part of building a sustainable city,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cGood mental health can improve our enjoyment of life, our coping skills and relationships, our educational achievement, employment, housing and economic potential, help reduce physical health problems, ease the demand for healthcare and social care, build social capital, decrease suicides; and help people to live together in a positive, productive, cost-effective and ultimately happy way.

Luckily for Copenhagen, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/05/story-cities-copenhagen-denmark-modernist-utopia\">narrowly avoided</a> many of the post-war decisions that lead to sprawling, car-dependent places, and continues to invest in attractive, health-promoting urban design today.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to make partnerships with civil society, private workplaces and individuals</p> <footer> <cite>Ninna Thomsen, Copenhagen's mayor for health and care</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAvoid silo working, and think about the place as the starting point in which all city administrations will work together to achieve a better quality of life and health,\u201d says Victoria Pinoncely, research officer at the Royal Town Planning Institute, whose <a href=\"http://rtpi.org.uk/media/1119674/rtpi_promoting_healthy_cities.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">healthy cities report</a> (pdf) highlighted Copenhagen\u2019s approach as exemplary. \u201cBy place, we also mean the communities that are inhabited by individuals \u2013 we need to think about what the particular place and its inhabitants need.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the latest health strategy, <a href=\"https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/HEALTH%20POLICY%202015-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enjoy life, Copenhageners</a> (pdf) , a number of action plans are being launched across the city to meet health challenges, with initiatives aimed at physical inactivity, alcohol abuse and poor mental health. Alongside the usual healthy eating and smoking cessation programmes, Thomsen\u2019s administration will be improving urban spaces in disadvantaged areas and providing free mindfulness classes. But the mayor can\u2019t do it alone - partnerships are vital.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn order for health to really work, you have to make partnerships with civil society, private workplaces and individuals\u201d, explains Thomsen. \u201cBut we also have to think health policy into other parts of the municipality.\u201d One example is the way the mayor\u2019s office is working with the technical and environmental administration responsible for the city\u2019s leading cycling infrastructure. The two teams are working together to make riding a bike the easy option, not just the healthy one, through widening paths and promoting active transport.<br></p> <p>The same can be said for the education administration, with whom Thomsen is working to bring sexual and mental health courses and other youth-focused initiatives into schools, to embed a healthy lifestyle balance into school life, rather than making it an additional responsibility for educators. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/02/app-oslo-children-traffic-road-safety\">The app that gives Oslo's children a direct say over their own road safety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But one of the most important partnerships for the Copenhagen municipality is with its citizens. \u201cIn order to get equal opportunities, you have to treat people differently\u201d, says Thomsen. \u201cInvolvement at an individual level is very important\u201d.<br></p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/edoc/0e147196-7f69-4b1d-88d8-3c22a49b677c/ccb83816-ce5f-44f7-a825-1324f9e18b6f/Attachments/14223678-16474820-1.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\">2015 research from the University of Copenhagen</a> (pdf), citizens with a non-Danish background are at higher risk of developing lifestyle diseases such as diabetes. One of the main barriers to improving the health of these individuals is language, and so the city has launched the <a href=\"https://www.information.dk/indland/2016/05/boen-kan-sagtens-lige-lave-maveboejninger-paa-bedetaeppet\" rel=\"nofollow\">health in your language</a> initiative, which involves training up a group of women to understand health themes and disseminate this information in their local area. Across the city, 16 different courses are led in mosques, women\u2019s centres and recreation halls, with themes chosen by the leaders, based on how relevant they are to their own community. The topics range from puberty and sexual health, to slimming tips and how to stay healthy during Ramadan.<br></p> <p>A similar peer-to-peer project for the male population is also underway, seeking to build bridges between citizens and the municipality, as men are typically less likely to use the city\u2019s health services. But rather than mosques and recreation centres, the <a href=\"http://sundhed.kk.dk/artikel/m%C3%A6nd-i-k%C3%B8benhavn\" rel=\"nofollow\">men in Copenhagen</a> initiative reaches out to people in pubs, on the streets and in job centres, with a goal to promote a healthier lifestyle for 200 men through social activities, cooking classes and sports events.<br></p> <p>Previously, Copenhagen\u2019s policies have focused primarily on physical health \u2013 the idea that healthy eating and regular exercise will solve your problems. But in the latest strategy, equal weight is being given to mental health. The city is offering free help for its <a href=\"http://www.kk.dk/nyheder/koebenhavns-stressklinikker-er-en-succes\" rel=\"nofollow\">100,000 citizens suffering with stress </a> through a series of clinics and classes consisting of meditation, yoga and conversations with a health professional.<br></p> <p>When the clinics began in autumn 2015, 150 people signed up to the service.

It\u2019s also important to quantify the value of the efforts being made. </p> <p>Alongside monitoring how many people are being reached and what changes are being seen in the short-term, many of Copenhagen\u2019s efforts are generating economic value. When it comes to cycling, society enjoys a 23 cent (16p) profit for every kilometre ridden, compared to a net loss of 16 cents (10p) for the same distance made by car. And a recent assessment of a popular green space \u2013 S\u00f8nder Boulevard \u2013 estimated that the value of park activities for visitors is about \u00a314m (125m Danish kronor) a year.<br></p> <p>Copenhagen\u2019s approach shows that if health isn\u2019t seen as a standalone goal for one administration, but is embedded in the actions of the municipality as a whole, then a \u201chealthy city\u201d will be the natural outcome of an ongoing drive to enhance the quality of life for its residents. </p> <p>\u201cIn 2050, seven in 10 of us will be urban residents.

This is worth considering as we approach the first-year review of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">sustainable development goals</a>. Among them is <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16\">SDG 16, which aims to reduce bribery and corruption</a>, develop accountable institutions, cut the flow of illicit money and weapons, and strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets.</p> <p>More can be done at a global level to support these ambitions. Bilateral trade agreements should be based on commitments to end corruption and protect human rights, and protocols to prevent corruption should be built into development aid and loans.</p> <p>There are some encouraging signs on the continent. When leaders from countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria and Tanzania highlight corruption as a major threat to their countries, then we might just be seeing the final days of impunity. The test now is whether they deliver on these fresh anti-corruption promises in credible ways that take account of human rights. </p> <p>Human rights are enforced by international treaties, backed by judicial bodies with teeth such as the international criminal court, the international court of justice and regional bodies such as the African court on human and people\u2019s rights. The UN security council and the African Union\u2019s peace and security council can impose sanctions in response to violations of political, economic, social or cultural rights, or to deal with torture, genocide and war crimes.

International agreements define various corrupt practices as a crime, but not corruption itself. Instead, it is passively defined as a technical flaw in governance, its horrors disguised in legalese. Corruption\u2019s victims get little mention.</p> <p>That\u2019s why so little progress has been made by the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html\">UN convention against corruption</a> (Uncac). This global agreement elevated anti-corruption action to the world stage. But Uncac relies on states for implementation, and \u2013 unlike global protocols governing human rights \u2013 there is no effective sanction for those in breach. An absence of enforcement creates space for corrupt officials and businesspeople to hide without fear of pursuit or prosecution. And there is little political will to change things.</p> <p>We need to give Uncac muscle by joining the moral and legal dots between corruption, human rights abuses and international crimes. Acknowledging the negative human rights impact of corruption makes it imperative for African states to provide better protection to their citizens. Africans have the most at stake in getting anti-corruption efforts to work, because corruption disproportionately affects poor people.</p> <p>A more rights-based approach to corruption is a good strategy for both African and European governments. It would mean greater political stability, and provide an environment for sustained social and economic development. This, in turn, would have a positive effect on the drivers of conflict, terrorism and migration. </p> <p>The human rights community built an arsenal to protect people.

  "<p>Pub culture, long hours, after-work drinks and too many tea breaks: Britain is a unique place to work. But what else sets the UK apart?

By this I mean that people are more dedicated to their professions. They\u2019re more motivated than people working in Sweden, where the work pace is slower and people do not feel as devoted to their job.</p> <p>In the UK there\u2019s also no real summer break \u2013 like we have in Sweden \u2013 where basically the whole country shuts down for two months. The summer break in Sweden usually starts in the second week of July and ends in the second week of August and it\u2019s incredibly funny, as the subway in Stockholm is almost empty for four weeks. There\u2019s no similar period in the UK, so work continues all year round except for the short Christmas holidays.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The thing I miss most about Sweden is the non-hectic lifestyle and how everyone is relaxed and a lot more laid back. London in particular has an edgy and rushed feel to it, and you can\u2019t seem to unwind until you actually leave the city.<br></p> <p>The UK pub lunch culture is also bigger and better than in other countries. In Sweden, pub culture just does not exist. The after-work pub culture seems to be the only way to meet new people in London. Old friends usually live at least 30 minutes away, so even if they are free, it\u2019s hard to meet after work. </p> <p>Generally, Swedish people hang out with the same friends they met in school and don\u2019t really interact with other groups at after-work events like in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8bc4d4d1c4e31535c1e80ee0538247db5b543154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc4d4d1c4e31535c1e80ee0538247db5b543154/110_29_718_897/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Roach\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I never had to make my boss tea before, it\u2019s a very British thing</strong><strong>\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p><em>Jonathan Roach, personal trainer at Inner Wolf Fitness, moved from Canada </em><em>to Barton-under-Needwood, a village on the border of Staffordshire and Derbyshire</em></p> <p>The first thing I noticed about working in the UK was the level of stress. British employees are put under pressure to deliver exceptional work constantly. Many UK employees are often expected to work well past their shift without much appreciation. It\u2019s as if their jobs are meant to become their lives. In Canada, your work ends at the end of your shift. There\u2019s a time and place for work in Canada, whereas the UK seems to have a 24-hour-a-day work mentality.</p> <p>Workers in the UK also all seem to be specialists. There\u2019s someone to: clean your clothes, clean your house, wash your windows, cut your grass, even someone to walk your dog. In rural Canada, those jobs don\u2019t exist and we do those things ourselves.<br></p> <p>If I were to choose one thing I miss most about Canada, I\u2019d have to choose the nature. I miss working outside and being under the sun. Many jobs I\u2019ve held in my part of Canada involve some sort of outdoor activity. Even the jobs that are predominantly indoors will recommend taking short breaks throughout the day to exit the building and get some fresh air. In the UK, I feel like most work shifts involve staying within the same building or around a desk for the majority of the day. I feel far more contained than I did in Canada.<br></p> <p>Also, I never had to make my boss a cup of tea in Canada, it\u2019s a very British thing.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"736199b88455246aea3aa9ed881614fb6877c594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/736199b88455246aea3aa9ed881614fb6877c594/21_5_267_334/267.png\" alt=\"Hanisa North\" width=\"267\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>\u2018There\u2019s a lot of pressure to drink after work \u2013 it\u2019s part of British culture\u2019</h2> <p><em>Hanisa North, a marketing manager at ClubApp, grew up in Malaysia, worked in Singapore and moved to London in 2014</em></p> <p>The biggest difference between working in the UK and Asia is the after-work socialising. In Asia I found that most colleagues just saw work as work and would not be keen to socialise with colleagues outside of the office. My colleagues worked very long hours and were hesitant to take leave, whereas there is a much better work-life balance in the UK \u2013 people aren\u2019t afraid to take a holiday (and rightly so). </p> <p>But I do find sometimes that admin systems are better equipped in Singapore \u2013 it is more efficient whereas the UK has a very traditional system; they can\u2019t seem to get away from the paperwork.</p> <p>After being overseas, I found it hard to re-adjust to the English culture. I had been to London a couple times on holiday, but the city is completely overwhelming and I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to handle it, especially having lived in a small city like Singapore for the past four years. I felt London was far too big and unsafe. I was in such a sheltered environment that coming to London really brought you back down to the real world.

  "<p><strong>Anne Perkins, p</strong><strong>olitical commentator and leader writer for the Guardian</strong><br></p> <p>I always thought serious fashion was about beautiful clothes for beautiful people and took place mainly on the pages of Vogue. This week I realised it in fact lies in the uncertain territory somewhere between art and politics.</p> <p>It was reading interviews with the two leading young designers Demna Gvasalia (from Georgia) and Gosha Rubchinskiy (from Russia) that did it. Their stories read as if they are straight out of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/398112/\">Second-Hand Time</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/oct/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-svetlana-alexievich-winner-of-the-nobel-prize-in-literature\">Svetlana Alexievich</a> \u2013 the book about the transformation of Soviet to consumerist Russia by which I am completely absorbed at the moment \u2013 and I am entranced by the idea that the unprecedented peacetime dislocation should be reflected in fashion designed by people who lived through it. I will never get dressed in quite the same way again. Nor will I be spending \u00a3700 on one of their hoodies, but I will understand that the price is part of the absurdity of the world that the designers are creating.</p> <p>There was a time when I thought clothes were probably more important than food. I had a wild optimism about the transformational power of a new dress. I also had no money and there were no charity shops, although there were dress agencies where, if you were lucky, you could find Chanel or Dior for a fraction of their original price. But labels did not belong in my world, and it didn\u2019t occur to me to mix them with the high street.</p> <p>Also, I was rubbish with money. My early shopping career ended up with the threat of court action, a memorably unpleasant negotiation with a bank manager, and a lasting overdraft phobia.</p> <p>That\u2019s my excuse for wearing, for years and years, the dullest and most invisible clothes anyone could imagine. Not that I stood out: by then, in the late 80s, I was working as a reporter in the House of Commons, and female journalists, like female MPs, were so uncommon, it seemed preferable to be unobserved than leered at by male MPs in the corridors of power which we thought of as the Reeperbahn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f149ccca372c724229db8131dab6d6529e593e19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f149ccca372c724229db8131dab6d6529e593e19/262_781_3242_4144/782.jpg\" alt=\"Switching it: Anne in Balenciaga dress, Gosha Rubchinskiy sweatshirt, Vetements jacket and Chiara Ferragni boots\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne switches to Balenciaga dress, Gosha Rubchinskiy sweatshirt, Vetements jacket and Chiara Ferragni boots</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mainly I bought intensely conservative suits, usually from somewhere like Jaeger. Occasionally I could afford Margaret Howell, and some of her clothes still hang in my wardrobe. To satisfy my money paranoia, I wanted everything to last for ever. I recognise something of myself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\">Angela Merkel</a>\u2019s familiar trouser suit.</p> <p>When I did break out, it usually had catastrophic consequences. In the same way that people trying to give up alcohol never fall off the wagon discreetly, I would opt for terrifying colour combinations (\u201cYou look like the flag of a newly independent country,\u201d a colleague once observed) or heels so high I couldn\u2019t actually walk home from the tube.</p> <p>But then I started working from home. For a couple of years I wore nothing but sweaters and jeans. It was a kind of detox. When I started working at the Guardian, where some colleagues are extremely creative about the limits of office dress, it was a kind of liberation.</p> <p>I hung on to the things I really loved, though, and they became the base of my new style. It still leans towards the conservative and classic, but it is much more considered, and it is about how I want to look rather than how I think I ought to look.</p> <p>I rarely pass Cos or Whistles without stopping to look. It is easy to combine their distinctive shapes with stuff I already have. It is also practical: shoes I can walk in \u2013 brogues and trainers \u2013 and cashmere because I love its feel and the air conditioning in the office is icy. I do occasionally buy expensive clothes, most recently an Erdem dress. I love the way the heavy fabric falls and the sleekness of the cut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e78a67a56876abf2e7cdb86104199005ef42630f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e78a67a56876abf2e7cdb86104199005ef42630f/0_0_3446_5039/684.jpg\" alt=\"Morwenna as Anne, in head-to-toe Marni\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morwenna as Anne, in head-to-toe Marni</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Erdem\u2019s family may, like Gosha Rubchinskiy or Demna Gvasalia, be part of the great eastern bloc diaspora, but he grew up in Canada. \u201cModest\u201d and \u201cpolite\u201d are the kind of words people use about him. These are not words that occur in any description of either the eponymous Gosha or Demna Gvasalia, who is the inspiration behind Vetements, Morwenna\u2019s favourite designers.</p> <p>On the hanger, though, I thought the punkish Vetements tunic look was great. The wearing experience wasn\u2019t. (Apart from the Chiara Ferragni cowboy boots which I could have worn with almost anything in my wardrobe.) Reading about the designers, I understand that this fashion is not really about the wearer, it\u2019s about the designer. If you buy it, you probably hang out with people who speak the same cultural language.</p> <p>So obviously when I put on these clothes for a work visit to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the American-football shoulder pads made me feel as if the clothes were wearing me. Now I know it as a reference back to the dark ages of pre-consumerist Georgia, that is at least interesting. But I am not sure that I want to go out in clothes that make the people I pass in the street look scared.</p> <p>The outfit I felt most comfortable in was also Vetements: I loved the silhouette, the wide shoulders and nipped-in waist of the maroon jersey hoodie and the long, narrow skirt. It felt stately and, with the skirt sweeping along the ground, grandly elegant (maybe this is a compromise between Demna and his brother Guram who manages the commercial side of the business).</p> <p>On the other hand, when I see hoodies on other people, it always looks to me as if they\u2019re trying not to be there, and the hood on this outfit had that effect on me, blotting out personality and reducing me to a shape.</p> <p>The Balenciaga dress was definitely something I might wear. But adding the Gosha Rubchinskiy sweatshirt, then layering on another outsize Vetements sweatshirt and a sheepskin jacket in a working environment was about as enjoyable as if a great weight had fallen out of the sky, suppressing all capacity for independent movement. I could only shuffle along like a prisoner on the way to the electric chair.</p> <p>I like clothes to underline freedom and independence; these had the absolute reverse effect, making me feel trapped and disempowered. Not so much clothes, then, as political commentary.</p> <p><strong>Morwenna Ferrier, o</strong><strong>nline fashion editor for the Guardian</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve always noticed Anne\u2019s style. She might be surprised to know that, but she has a confidence and consistency in the way she dresses that is hard to ignore. She\u2019s stylish because she owns her look, a hashtag that smacks of Beyonc\u00e9, but still rings true. Plus it\u2019s hard to distance the woman from the myth.</p> <p>During the decade that I\u2019ve worked as a journalist, I\u2019ve been anything but consistent. As someone who is fairly introverted, I have often seen clothes as a surrogate. Or perhaps a crutch. After a prolonged period of green army jackets, heavy boots and piercings when I moved to Italy after university \u2013 it worked for the politics of the time and the place, especially the anti-Berlusconi riots \u2013 I settled into something a little less extreme but also more confusing: going sorority one day and streetwear tracksuit the next. The only constants are my tattoos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a139059a4693e384752170baeae32d5bd493790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a139059a4693e384752170baeae32d5bd493790/0_820_3744_4471/837.jpg\" alt=\"Anne \u00e0 la Morwenna, in Vetements hoodie and skirt\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne \u00e0 la Morwenna, in Vetements hoodie and skirt<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not just the result of my own style tics: the pace at which fashion has changed during the period of my working life is absurd, and I\u2019ve mirrored each shift. I\u2019ve revised my style repeatedly without spending much money (would that I could look after an investment piece long enough to actually warrant the initial investment). Shaving half my hair off and wearing Breton tops. Growing a fringe and going regrettably twee. Bleached hair with tracksuits. The whole gamut, none of it especially successful.</p> <p>I sometimes change clothes halfway through the day, mostly due to boredom. My attitude is extremely nonchalant, which in itself, perhaps, suggests more consideration than I care to admit.</p> <p>There are many misconceptions surrounding the fashion industry. I know this because I\u2019ve only been working in fashion for a few years and before that I, too, judged. I thought it was all fluff and embellishments, or encyclopedic referencing. So when people ask what I do, then immediately ask for shirt recommendations, I always balk, though I\u2019ve got better at hiding it. My experience of working in fashion has been, conversely, that there is little pressure to dress well. You can wear what you want because people will assume that it is in fashion. I often wear a tracksuit to the office and no one asks why. I might get the side-eye in the corridor but if challenged, I simply direct them towards the label Cottweiler and the British designer Caitlin Price, and walk away.</p> <p>The world that I inhabit is quieter, less public and more guarded than Anne\u2019s life in political journalism, where she has appeared on television and blazed a trail in the male-dominated Houses of Parliament. There are fashion shows, of course, and you make an effort with your appearance at the twice-yearly circuit of New York, London, Milan and Paris. But, a handful of bloggers and high-profile editors aside, the majority of journalists still dress in a variation of the industry uniform that won them the description of \u201cblack crows\u201d back in the 80s. Dark colours, minimalist, functional. The shows are not about you \u2013 plus if you\u2019re running around all day, you err towards practicality.</p> <p>The fashion parties are also surprisingly tolerant towards eveningwear dissenters like me. Though latterly my night-time look has appropriated fetish (which, admittedly, is a little Rodarte).</p> <p>Contrary to what you might think, fashion journalists don\u2019t get much free stuff \u2013 we have the bribery act to thank for that \u2013 so I can only mimic the clothes by many of the brands that I write about. Helpfully, though, the high street is very effective at planting spies at shows and spinning up catwalk designs at broadband speed. I also habitually browse charity shops and eBay. At the moment I like 90s leitmotifs \u2013 particularly overt branding and big logos \u2013 as well as sportswear and androgyny. Think Adidas Originals Firebird tracksuits, leather and crop tops.</p> <p>I also love the new eastern European designers such as Gosha Rubchinskiy and Demna Gvasalia. Vetements is my spirit animal. I like their irreverant take on fashion and the ideas that run through the clothes they design. I even like the use of a hammer and sickle on Gosha\u2019s T-shirts which means they can only be worn outside former Soviet countries. (I\u2019m told, by friends, that this is true. Not surprisingly, peers from the former eastern bloc have a different relationship with the insignia.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ee21bc97f791a201323286cb13bf18eed515bc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee21bc97f791a201323286cb13bf18eed515bc2/0_0_3479_5165/674.jpg\" alt=\"Morwenna dressed by Anne, in a 1205 tunic and skirt, and Urban Outfitters shoes.Stylist: Billie Brand.

The Milanese fashion label founded by Consuelo Castiglioni in the 90s is great for vivid colour and eclectic prints, and its bohemian style is individual and chic. Its reputation as the label worn by women to impress other women is certainly well deserved.</p> <p>It was, of course, a treat to dress up in Marni. How could it not be, it\u2019s Marni. Hackney, where I live, hasn\u2019t seen Marni before. I haven\u2019t seen Marni either, at least not off a catwalk, where it whistles past me each season, all boxy, colourful and out-of-reach. I certainly haven\u2019t tried to navigate Bethnal Green market, where I do my food shopping, wearing Marni before. The knee-high boots get stuck in the numerous potholes. My giant sleeves dragged across the okra on the veg stalls.</p> <p>The whole outing became a bit of an ordeal, punctuated by immobility and the sort of heckling I imagine Anne may have experienced when she worked at the House of Commons. But I felt up to it. Dressing like a grown-up gave me confidence.</p> <p>Would I wear it? Unlikely. I enjoyed the feeling of status, briefly, but I can\u2019t imagine wearing something with such a sombre cut and refined style every day. Anne knows her mind when it comes to clothes. She has clearly thought about what complements her life and her style, and it really works for her. My clothes reflect my ambivalence. I like not knowing what I\u2019m going to wear tomorrow, but having tried these clothes I can say, given the option, it will probably be a tracksuit.</p>",
  "<p>Only when the tide goes right out can you finally see what\u2019s left on the beach.

(It\u2019s a feeling some Corbyn supporters, furious at being told their heartfelt beliefs are naive or electorally unpopular, may recognise.)

The referendum wasn\u2019t just about Europe, she argued, but a more widespread feeling of people being \u201cfed up with being ignored or told that their priorities were somehow invalid, based on ignorance and misunderstanding\u201d.

She couldn\u2019t name a convincing expert supporting the return of grammars, resorting instead to arguing that they\u2019d worked for her and Corbyn.</p> <p>At Westminster, that still looks like an intellectual admission of failure, the equivalent of arguing that cigarettes don\u2019t really kill because your dad smoked and lived to be 100. But outside, where facts increasingly bounce off voters enraged by the very word \u201cexperts\u201d, things can be very different. Personal experiences count. What May seems to be doing is responding to this changing mood as unsentimentally as she confronted the very different electoral challenges facing the Tories 15 years ago.</p> <p>What\u2019s often forgotten about her infamous \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\" title=\"\">nasty party</a>\u201d speech is that she never told the party it was nasty; she merely observed that voters thought so, and therefore the party had to knuckle down and accept it. As the old saying goes, \u201cThe people have spoken, the bastards\u201d; it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re right or wrong. She appears now to be applying the same brutally simple logic \u2013 call it populist or nobly democratic, depending on whether you like the results \u2013 to bigger and more dangerous&#xa0;questions.</p> <p>What makes education a particularly interesting example of knuckling under and accepting the popular verdict, however, is the particular people whose verdict is being accepted. It\u2019s a good indicator of how far the electoral ground is shifting quietly under all our feet, and not just because of this week\u2019s threatened boundary changes.</p> <p>The strongest advocates now of new grammars are not parents seeking good schools, but older people for whom school is a distant memory. Only 39% of people aged 35 to 44, the age group most likely to have children, support new grammars compared to 66% of over-65s, <a href=\"http://www.comresglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Independent-Sunday-Mirror_Political-Poll_August-2016-3215.pdf\" title=\"\">according to a recent ComRes poll</a>.

Hanson did, after all, dedicate a large majority of her address to Muslims and Islam, so it appears to be rather logical to seek a response from said community.</p> <p>Unfortunately for them, journalists and news presenters are usually met with a seemingly inexplicable wall of silence from the Muslim community. It may seem frustrating to some who are seeking a \u201cbalanced\u201d discussion, but it disguises much larger issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Pauline Hanson calls for immigration ban: 'Go back to where you came from'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firstly, seeking comment from any representative on Hanson\u2019s speech on Wednesday night ignores the fact that she doesn\u2019t actually make any sense.</p> <p>It\u2019s one issue to try to respond to a thin veneer of logic, veiling a racist agenda, and another entirely to respond to an illogical rant. It would be challenging just to know where to start.</p> <p>Furthermore, in requesting a Muslim response on Hanson, there are implications that one single person can actually represent the entire Muslim community. Very often, comment will be sought from people like the Grand Mufti or the Head of the Australian National Imam\u2019s Council (ANIC), as though representation mimics a hierarchy.</p> <p>There is no hierarchy in the Muslim community, and there is no peak body or individual who can adequately speak on behalf of the entire community. Our community is made up of a complex web of ethnicities, backgrounds, sects, cultures, generations and political groups, with constant cross-pollination. There are no clear divides between these lines, and no one uniting factor.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.unisa.edu.au/Global/EASS/MnM/Publications/Australian_Muslims_Report_2015.pdf\">report by the University of South Australia in 2015</a> indicated there were 31 different nationalities that make up the community, with over a third were born in Australia. Similar research recently undertaken by the Scanlon Foundation has indicated that Muslims are just as diverse in piety and cultural expression. Less than 20% of Australian Muslims were born in the Middle East or Arab countries. Most Australians Muslims are Sunni but there is a significant minority of Shia and smaller numbers of Bektashis, Ahmadis, Alawis and Druze.</p> <p>It thus becomes inherently reductionist to request comment from one person on such a broad matter. It assumes a reduction of all these differing elements, squishing this broad community into one homogenous blob.</p> <p>This reductionism also largely characterises the narrative that currently surrounds Muslims. It is one that continues to reduce Muslims to caricatures, a narrative rooted in ways in which privilege shapes our society and our communities.</p> <p>It leaves a 1400-year-old intellectual tradition as nothing more than motivation for murder, reinforcing the already dangerous assumption that Muslims are to account for the violence enacted in the name of Islam and that Muslims have something to answer for.</p> <p>It would ignore the many complex root causes of such violence, ignoring the socio-economic, political and cultural factors at play, reducing it to a problem with Islam as a religion and not a societal one.</p> <p>This, in turn, divorces the government and the wider Australian society of any responsibility in actually addressing any of those root causes. It enables demands to be made of the Muslim community without any effort put into addressing the deeper issues. </p> <p>And it is here we find the biggest reason Muslims will not speak out in certain discussions of Islam and Muslims. Considering the utterly embarrassing lack of nuance and fact around the discussions of Islam, this position can be very frustrating. Why should Muslim leaders be complicit in reducing a far larger problem to one defined by one or two outlying senators? </p> <p>It would merely enable the continued demonisation of Muslims, allowing the conversation to be had on Hanson\u2019s parameters. Muslims, as a community, are left to respond to her every scrap, whether it be on a <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/08/16/its-just-toilet-multicultural-chief-questions-hansons-squat-toilet-outrage\">toilet bowl</a> or on welfare payments.</p> <p>This perpetual enforcement of a defensive position, this stripping of Muslim agency in a discussion of Muslims, leaves any Muslim representative a pawn in a rightwing race to the bottom of the xenophobia barrel.</p> <p>Navigating these spaces has proven nearly impossible. Journalists want a story that will gain traction, traction is often wholly reliant on the narrative, and so will ask relatively leading questions to get their quotes and their story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/agenda-21-is-conspiracy-theory-but-dont-dismiss-malcolm-roberts-as-a-harmless-kook\">Agenda 21 is conspiracy theory. But don't dismiss Malcolm Roberts as a harmless kook | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Often this is not a reflection on individual journalists or presenters. Ultimately, they are all just in service of this narrative, and it dwarfs everyone involved, leaving the Muslim community with a catch-22.</p> <p>Either concede, and speak solely in response, thus reinforcing both the dehumanisation and the narrative above it, or stand defiant and have no one listen. In her speech, Hanson referred to an apparent \u201csilence\u201d from the Mufti, saying, \u201cThe Grand Mufti and other Muslim leaders are deafening with their silence, or lack of sympathy.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, we need only take a quick glimpse at the Mufti\u2019s Facebook page for his long list of responses to violence, whether it be in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dribrahimsalem/photos/a.406289879480757.1073741825.161934833916264/902403183202755/?type=3&amp;theater\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dribrahimsalem/photos/a.406289879480757.1073741825.161934833916264/887560978020309/?type=3&amp;theater\">Istanbul</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dribrahimsalem/photos/a.406289879480757.1073741825.161934833916264/764218850354523/?type=3&amp;theater\">Parramatta</a>. The lack of coverage of these responses, when the opposite causes mass outrage, is difficult to understand but unsurprising. It comes down to that very same reductionist narrative that fuels which stories are picked up and which are ignored.</p> <p>The problem with standing defiant, though, is that maintaining silence often leaves ravenous voices to take over the conversation and shred what little humanity Muslims can still demand. .</p> <p>True change in this area requires the media and the government to genuinely listen to the Muslim community. Understanding the Muslim experience is key to a better relationship between government, media and Muslims. Both in silence and speech, there are important expressions of that experience. This is a first step towards having the complexities of minority communities represented accurately to the mainstream.</p>",

Bornstein later admitted that the note had been \u201crushed\u201d, while a limo from the campaign waited outside his office.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Guardian reported that according to court papers, in April 2002 Bornstein agreed to pay $86,250 to the family of a patient, Janet Levin, who died allegedly after falling when she took \u201cunhealthy amounts\u201d of prescription drugs Bornstein had given her unnecessarily</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s report, based on an examination conducted on Friday 9 September, was less hyperbolic but still glowing.</p> <p>\u201cMr Trump is in excellent physical health,\u201d Bornstein wrote, adding that Trump\u2019s liver and thyroid function were within the normal range and a cardiac evaluation was normal.
