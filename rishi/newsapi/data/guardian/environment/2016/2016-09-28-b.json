  "<p>Shell and BP\u2019s pay plans encourage their bosses to dig for oil instead of investing in low-carbon energy and should be overhauled by shareholders, according to the campaign group ShareAction.</p> <p>Investors in the oil companies should use binding votes on pay policies next year to scrap short-term targets and reward chief executives for working towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">target set in Paris last December</a> to limit global temperature increases to 2C or less, the responsible investment group says in a report. </p> <p>ShareAction said international pressure to reduce the impact of climate change was an existential threat to companies whose business depends on extracting fossil fuels. Persisting with pay plans that reward old measures of success risk Shell and BP becoming obsolete and ultimately going bust, the report says.</p> <p>Large companies face binding shareholder votes on three-year pay policies at next year\u2019s annual general meetings under rules introduced in 2013. Shell and BP\u2019s policies will take them up to 2020 when pledges under the Paris treaty could be strengthened, making the votes important, ShareAction said.</p> <p>Shareholders voted against the \u00a314m pay package for Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, and ShareAction said the pay policy votes would be a test of investors\u2019 resolve. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was paid \u20ac5.85m (\u00a35m) last year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e242a0c3cf896c89315bfc124768a943ee423966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e242a0c3cf896c89315bfc124768a943ee423966/431_112_3315_4141/801.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Howarth, ShareAction chief executive.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Howarth has called for BP and Shell investors to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 next year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catherine Howarth, ShareAction\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cResponsible investors who are serious about climate risk have a crucial opportunity to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 at BP and Shell next year by pushing for remuneration policies designed make these companies commercially resilient in a low carbon world \u2013 and voting down policies which fail that test.\u201d<br></p> <p>ShareAction said bonuses were largely tied to shareholder returns, project delivery, replacement of reserves and measures that encourage oil extraction. Long-term bonuses were paid after a few years yet the effects of Van Beurden and Dudley\u2019s decisions lasted for decades, ShareAction said.<br></p> <p>ShareAction called on investors to push BP and Shell to develop low-carbon energy, remove outdated performance measures and reward bosses for working towards the Paris targets. </p> <p>Van Beurden and Dudley have said they support a shift to renewable energy but have resisted pressure to make a radical switch to their companies\u2019 activities, which have attracted increasing opposition.

I think we\u2019ll move towards a lot more scrutiny of the commercial arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce, speaking for the first time since he lost his job over his comments to undercover reporters, said \u201centrapment had won\u201d but Clarke said he did not have a problem with the way the story came out.</p> <p>\u201cMy view of these things is that if you think there is actually something going on, go after it. If you hear something and you want to run it down, then run it down,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause transparency and a strong media is vital to our society.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was unable to comment on Allardyce\u2019s payoff, citing confidentiality clauses, but said the terms were reached following a \u201csensible discussion\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke reiterated the view of Glenn that it was important for FA staff, including the England manager, to be held to high standards. \u201cAppearances do matter. The image of the FA is important. If we have to dispense discipline and justice, we have to be credible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continually look at whether we\u2019re living up to our own standards.

With the support of the government, the professional game, the national game, the police, what can we do that could make things better. It needs thought and it needs to be very clear about the problems we\u2019re trying to solve and what processes and powers we need to solve them.\u201d</p> <p>Questions have been asked over whether the FA should have appointed Allardycegiven the outstanding questions from the Quest review in 2006, which failed to clear three transfers in which he was involved while at Bolton. Allardyce strenuously denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing I don\u2019t try to do is to second guess decisions made in good faith when I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf I had been part of the decision and understood the facts, I would take accountability. I have never run away from accountability. The guys did their best.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint statement with the Premier League and the EFL, the FA also responded to the allegations in the Telegraph that alleged eight current and former managers had been said to take bungs.</p> <p>\u201cAny substantive allegations will be investigated with the full force of the rules at our disposal, which are wide-ranging and well-developed. In addition, should we find any evidence of criminality we would inform and seek the support of the appropriate statutory authorities,\u201d it said.</p> <p>On the appointment of a new England manager, Clarke said he would not rule out waiting until the end of the season for the right candidate. The England Under-21 coach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/gareth-southgate-england-caretaker-manager-sam-allardyce\">Gareth Southgate, will take charge of the next four matches</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe will look at what have we learned from the Sam hiring process and how do we apply that to the next hiring process. The most important thing is we\u2019ve got Gareth focused on the next four games. That buys us time to really give some thought to how we do it this time round,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is that you need someone who really understands English football. That could be an English person or someone who has worked in England and managed at a senior level. But to parachute someone in who has never managed in this country would be a big ask.\u201d</p>",

The one exception was at a Santos AGM, where three of the 12 super funds voted against the bonus. That occurred at Satos\u2019 2016 AGM where there was significant investor concern about remunerations being awarded while oil prices were so low.</p> <p>The report noted that in response to a global campaign calling on investors \u2013 including super funds \u2013 to divest from fossil fuels, several super funds have said they would prefer to maintain their investment and \u201cactively engage\u201d with the companies.</p> <p>\u201cIf claims of active ownership are to be taken seriously, funds need to actively engage on fossil-fuel companies\u2019 operational strategies and how they are achieved through executive remuneration,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Market Forces analyst and report author Daniel Gocher said: \u201cWith the Paris agreement being ratified by the world\u2019s biggest economies and aiming to keep the world under two degrees warming, we know that a large proportion of current fossil fuel reserves cannot be consumed.</p> <p>\u201cExecutive bonuses predicated on unearthing more fossil fuels when the world needs less shows the extent to which these companies\u2019 business model is broken.

They just didn\u2019t hold on to any of their leads for long enough. But a point against Pep Guardiola\u2019s City is not to be sniffed at and, with Borussia Monchengladbach losing 2-1 to Barcelona, it\u2019s enough to take Celtic third. They\u2019ve only gone and ended City\u2019s winning streak as well, showing the way forward for other sides with their pressing game. City are second, while Barcelona are top. Thanks for reading.

The ball was headed on to the unwitting Dembele by Sviatchenko, as Celtic players queued up to score, and deflected past the helpless Bravo!

Ten wins and counting for City under Pep so far and it\u2019s fair to say that they\u2019re looking a mite more focused than they did under Manuel Pellegrini last season. Amazing what one managerial change and another \u00a3100m or so in the transfer market can do for a side\u2019s prospects.</p> <p>Poor Brendan Rodgers. His team\u2019s looking good in the league, spanking Rangers 5-1 the other week and clobbering Kilmarnock 6-1 on Saturday, but if it\u2019s not Messi, Suarez and Neymar in the Champions League, it\u2019s Aguero, Silva and Sterling (although no De Bruyne, he\u2019s hamstrung). Already it seems that Celtic are fighting for third place and entry into the Europa League with Borussia Monchengladbach, who were beaten 4-0 by City last time out.</p> <p>Nothing\u2019s ever certain in football, of course. After all, if you\u2019d told me at the start of the week that Gareth Southgate would be the England manager and Phil Brown would be on ITV news likening Sam Allardyce\u2019s sacking to a bereavement come Wednesday night, well, I\u2019d have said \u201cGareth, let\u2019s talk about the Pizza Hut ad instead\u201d.

  "<p>Researchers are still trying to unravel the complex interactions between wind, waves and currents. One of the most visible results of these interactions is Langmuir circulation, which produces a pattern on the water surface like parallel furrows in a field. These lines are known as wind streaks or windrows, and occur only in steady winds of more than 7mph.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/oceans-heating-big-problem-blue-planet-iucn-report\">The oceans are heating up.

They were first noted by the American physicist Irving Langmuir, who saw seaweed lined up in the Sargasso Sea in 1927. Windrows are caused by tubes of rotating water, typically about eight to 10 metres across and hundreds of metres long. Some may stretch for several kilometres. These tubes counter-rotate, so if one tube is going clockwise its neighbours will move anticlockwise. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/plastic-new-epoch-human-damage\">Floating material</a> in the boundaries between tubes is forced upwards by the combined effect, forming a windrow. </p> <p>The rotating tubes always form roughly in the direction of the wind and are caused by interaction between wind, waves and sea currents, but the exact process or formation is still not well understood.</p> <p>Langmuir circulation may be affected by any undersea currents, so the topography of mountains and valleys on the sea bed may be visible in the pattern of windrows on the surface. These can be seen from the air and even from space. Underwater outfalls, ship\u2019s wakes and even wakes from submarines beneath the surface may also become visible by Langmuir circulation when the wind blows.</p>",
  "<p>Canada\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change has been questioned after the Liberal government, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a>, announced conditional approval for a C$36bn liquefied natural gas project in northern British Columbia.<br></p> <p>The decision \u2013 the Trudeau government\u2019s first on a major energy project \u2013 was announced late on Tuesday. \u201cThe government approved the Pacific NorthWest LNG project,\u201d Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, told reporters in a Vancouver suburb. </p> <p>Backed by Malaysia\u2019s energy giant Petronas, the project would ship 19m tonnes a year of frozen, liquefied natural gas to markets in Asia. The government promised the project, one of Canada\u2019s largest resource development projects, would create thousands of jobs \u2013 as many as 630 direct and spin-off jobs and 4,500 construction jobs \u2013 and add nearly C$2.4bn per year to the country\u2019s GDP. </p> <p>The government\u2019s approval was contingent on the project meeting 190 conditions, including keeping greenhouse gas emissions capped at 4.3m tonnes per year, a drop of about 20% from the project\u2019s initial proposal. Upstream emissions are not included in this cap and could add as much as 8.7m tonnes of carbon emissions to the project, according to estimates from a draft report released by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in February. </p> <p>McKenna said the decision had been informed by rigorous environmental assessment as well as meaningful consultations with First Nations groups. \u201cThe only way to get resources to market in the 21st century is if it is done in a responsible and sustainable manner. This decision reflects this objective.\u201d </p> <p>But despite claims by the British Columbia government that the exported fuel would offer an alternative to coal-fired plants in Asia, environmentalists warned the approval of the project would undermine Canada\u2019s climate change commitments.</p> <p>\u201cHow can Prime Minister Trudeau claim to be a climate leader on the international stage, while approving this new project that will become the single largest source of climate pollution in the country?\u201d Karen Mahon of Stand Earth asked in a statement after the decision was announced. \u201cHonestly we expected better.\u201d</p> <p>Since taking the reins of Canada\u2019s government last year, Trudeau has sought to position himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/08/barack-obama-and-justin-trudeau-to-join-forces-on-climate-change\">as a climate change leader on the world stage</a> while assuring Canadians that the government would strike a balance between caring for the environment and bolstering the country\u2019s struggling energy industry. </p> <p>The Pacific NorthWest LNG project, which includes a nearly 600-mile (900km) natural gas pipeline and an LNG facility near Prince Rupert in British Columbia, was widely seen as one of the government\u2019s first tests of this commitment. </p> <p>During last year\u2019s federal election campaign, Trudeau courted environmentalists with promises to invest millions of dollars in clean tech and confront climate change.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s approval was a betrayal to the many who voted for action on climate change, said Caitlyn Vernon of the Sierra Club of British Columbia. \u201cThe Trudeau government\u2019s lofty rhetoric on climate has been proven nothing more than sunny ways talking points.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/pipelines-alberta-oil-sands-aboriginal-tribes\">Canadian and US tribes band together to fight Alberta oil sands pipelines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In May, 90 scientists and climate experts from Canada, the US and Australia urged Trudeau and his government to reject the Pacific NorthWest LNG project <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/314292821/Climate-Scientists-Letter-to-Federal-Government\">in an open letter</a>. The 190 conditions set out by the government provided a chance to meaningfully address some of the concerns, said Merran Smith of Clean Energy Canada. Instead, the bar was set too low. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking about this approval is that other LNG projects are proposing much cleaner operations,\u201d she said. \u201cOttawa should have required Pacific NorthWest to run on clean electricity and use available technology to reduce its carbon pollution by more than 40%.\u201d </p> <p>Even before the government announced its decision, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/mar/20/by-rejecting-1-billion-for-a-pipeline-a-first-nation-has-put-justin-trudeaus-climate-plan-on-trial\">six First Nations affected by the project said</a> the project had so far failed to meet their expectations for respecting indigenous rights. \u201cProviding a green light for this project at this time will only lead to protracted litigation which benefits no one,\u201d the Skeena Corridor Nations said in a statement. </p> <p>In the wake of Tuesday\u2019s announcement, analysts pointed out there was little guarantee that the project would be built. The government\u2019s decision comes amid weakening demand and oversupply in the global natural gas market. While those behind the project welcomed the approval and described it as a significant milestone, the company said a total review of the project would be carried out by the company and shareholders before any final decision is taken.</p>",
  "<p>Over the years, Iran has sometimes played a disproportionately large part in US politics. Jimmy Carter blamed the 1979-81 embassy hostage crisis for his failure to secure a second term, and Reagan\u2019s second term was damaged significantly by the Iran-Contra revelations. </p> <p>The deal secured by the Obama administration with Iran over the nuclear question in July 2015 has proved violently divisive between Democrats and Republicans. So it was no surprise that Iran surfaced again in the debate between the presidential candidates on 26 September. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Iranians have not forgotten Clinton's 2008 statement that America could \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump\u2019s maverick tendency by referring to his apparent willingness to open fire on Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf if they threw insults at US sailors. Trump hit back at Clinton for going along with Obama\u2019s Iran policy, complaining \u201cwe lose on everything\u201d \u2013 referring back to his theme of a US diminished by Obama\u2019s presidency. The exchange thus summed up what each candidate saw as one of the other\u2019s main weak points.</p> <p>President Rouhani of Iran can scarcely be enthusiastic about the prospects for the US presidential election. Trump has said directly that the 2015 nuclear deal was \u201cdisastrous\u201d and he would repudiate it, doubling and tripling sanctions (quite how, he doesn\u2019t specify) to force the Iranians to renegotiate. Clinton has supported the nuclear deal and is more likely to follow in Obama\u2019s footsteps, but she has consistently been more hawkish on Iran than Obama. She was enthusiastic in the drive to harden sanctions on Iran in the latter part of Obama\u2019s first term, and Iranians have not forgotten her statement during the presidential nomination contest in 2008 that the US could \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran if it were to attack Israel with a nuclear weapon \u2013 widely reported at the time as \u201cClinton wants to obliterate Iran\u201d.</p> <p>Rouhani himself is engaged in an election campaign (the election will take place in May 2017) and, though still popular, is under increasing pressure because economic benefits from the nuclear deal have yet to reach ordinary Iranians. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has suggested that the US has failed to honour its commitment to lift sanctions. It is an unwritten rule of Iranian politics that Iranian presidents always get a second term, but Rouhani cannot be complacent. He has to appease hardliners, which is why he avoided meeting Obama at the UN general assembly earlier in September. Since the nuclear deal, Iran has drawn closer to Russia over Syria and the US has seemed keener to mollify its ally Saudi Arabia than to explore new opportunities for a better relationship with the Iranians. Depressingly, both Iran and the US have retreated to their familiar comfort zones of mutual hostility.</p> <p>If Trump were elected and really were to follow an America-first policy, retreating from global commitments, conciliating Putin and allowing Russia a larger role (as he has hinted, bizarrely) then relations between states would shift in the Middle East. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia would be isolated (the folly of the UK\u2019s support for Saudi Arabia in its sectarian cold war with Iran would be even more exposed) and the Iranian regime might rejoice. But Trump has also said those things about renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal, and has run an ad campaign saying he would \u201ccut the head off Isis and take their oil\u201d, which, though hard to construe, sounds like more intervention rather than less. If he were elected, a lot would depend on Trump\u2019s advisers, but that is no cause for reassurance. John Bolton, whom Trump has spoken of as a possible secretary of state, said in March 2015 in the last weeks before the nuclear deal that the US could still bomb Iran, and that bombing was the only way to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon. Another figure close to Trump, Lt Gen Michael Flynn, made a statement in July 2016 that seemed to suggest he thought Ali Khamenei\u2019s predecessor, Ayatollah Khomeini, was still alive and in office.</p> <p>As many around the world look on at this election with alarm and some despondency, I remember Henry Kissinger\u2019s infamous comment on the Iran-Iraq war \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a pity they can\u2019t both lose\u201d. It seems to be a choice between a man whose daddy bought him a route to the top and a woman whose path was smoothed by the charm of her less intelligent husband. </p> <p>Broadly, in assessing the likely direction of policy under either of the two candidates, one has to expect that Trump would follow through on his rhetoric and take a hard line on Iran. Trump is plainly populist and unpredictable \u2013 an American version of Iran\u2019s former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But even to him, a US policy initiative to tear up the nuclear deal must look like only adding to the problems of a murderously chaotic region.</p> <p>Clinton by contrast appears a relatively safe choice \u2013 but would that mean following the unimaginative anti-Iranian groupthink in Washington rather than exploring the opportunities that the Iran nuclear deal should have opened up? In a statement earlier in the year she spoke in all-too-familiar terms of Iran as continuing to threaten the peace and security of the Middle East, of \u201cIran\u2019s negative actions in the region\u201d and standing \u201cside-by-side with our ally Israel and our Arab partners\u201d. We know from Wikileaks that she believed privately in the past that Saudi Arabia was the largest source for terrorist funding worldwide, and that the Saudi government was not doing enough to stop that funding. But a more balanced view of the Saudi-Iranian confrontation has not emerged in her public utterances.</p> <p>Perhaps if, as the polls still indicate, Clinton wins the US presidential contest, greater political freedom of action will permit her to be more imaginative, bold and judicious in the Iran context. Let\u2019s hope so.</p>",

  "<p><strong>UPDATE. September 2017: lawyers for Sam Allardyce have contacted us to say that he disputes the allegation that he gave advice on how to circumvent the FA\u2019s rules on third party ownership. </strong></p> <p>The fall of \u201cBig Sam\u201d Allardyce, the manager of the English national football team who resigned after 67 days in the job, is a tragedy in the sense that it is a human drama of hubris, followed by nemesis. Allardyce is a man who, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/26/exclusive-how-sam-allardyce-tried-to-make-as-much-money-as-possi/\">as the recordings obtained by subterfuge show</a>, can be lured by promises of cash into making unguarded jibes about his peers and colleagues. For a potential \u00a3400,000 he was prepared to say the unsayable. Pride fuelled by greed saw him brag of ways around banned financial schemes where players become the property of speculators. Over the next few days more tales of football\u2019s dirty deals are promised. The beautiful game will be besmirched. There was no need for Big Sam to sit down with the fake businessmen. He was already being paid \u00a33m a year to be manager. The flower of English football is being eaten by canker worms of money and avarice.</p> <p>Since television money flowed into the sport in the early 1990s, the Premier League has become less a local English affair and more a global one. That has some benefits: better facilities and bigger names on the pitch. However, with top-flight clubs owned by foreign investors and <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/shocking-study-shows-less-third-2356565\">English players making up a third of Premier League teams</a>, there is a feeling that English football is becoming detached from its roots. Such is the concern that Andy Burnham, the Labour mayoral candidate for football-mad Manchester, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/09/26/english-football-should-consider-a-quota-on-foreign-players-in-t/\">thinks a quota on foreign players</a> is needed.</p> <p>While England\u2019s top flight has become the richest league in the world, it is not the best. On <a href=\"http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/\">Uefa rankings</a> the Premier League is behind both\u2019s Spain\u2019s La Liga and Germany\u2019s Bundesliga. It\u2019s been five years since an English club \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Cup_and_UEFA_Champions_League_finals\">Chelsea</a> \u2013 won the European championship. There\u2019s simply not enough bang for the television big bucks. Last year the Premier League sold television rights to its live games for a record \u00a35.14bn. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31379128\">That\u2019s more than \u00a310m a match, up 70% from the last time</a>. Yet there is no evidence that the quality of the basic product \u2013 football matches \u2013 has improved. Coaches too often put results ahead of entertainment, in part because of the enormous sums at stake. Packed stadiums are more to do with clever marketing than better football. The television cash is largely swallowed up by players\u2019 wages, managers\u2019 contracts and agents\u2019 fees. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3664446/118-5m-vs-16-4m-England-s-millionaire-flops-beaten-Iceland-team-entire-cost-substitute-Jordan-Henderson.html\">England\u2019s team of millionaires being beaten by Iceland, whose top division is a part-time league</a>, shows how little money is related to talent.</p> <p>To correct this market failure, politicians should restrict the number of games broadcast on pay-TV and set aside some top matches for free-to-air TV. More people will watch the games. The BBC would be able to showcase an expression of national cultural identity. Commercial free-to-air channels could benefit from advertising. Highlights on the BBC draw millions more than a single match on pay-TV. With competition from free matches, TV deals will shrink. Clubs will reduce player salaries. The wealth of club owners and media tycoons will drop. There is an argument that there will be less money available for the grassroots. Yet the dearth of homegrown English players shows that not enough is being done. True, today\u2019s stars are undoubtedly fitter and better trained. But what counts is people\u2019s enjoyment. Players will still emulate their heroes: Zidane, Schmeichel and Platini. All of whom pleased fans without being paid the sort of sums that are now morally and financially bankrupting football.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/30/architecture.artsfeatures\">Mies van der Rohe</a> was born first, in 1886, in Aachen, Germany. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/11/le-corbusier-india-architecture-1965\">Le Corbusier </a>arrived the following year, and 250 miles to the south, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Mies went on to become the godfather of the steel-and-glass <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/International-Style-architecture\">international style</a>; Corbu, enamored with the possibilities of concrete, essentially created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/raw-concrete-beauty-of-barbarism-barnabas-calder-review\">brutalism</a>. Which means that not only were the two architects great builders in their own right; they were also responsible for creating the greatest sibling rivalry in the history of architecture.</p> <p>Le Corbusier\u2019s brutalism took an early lead, not least because of concrete\u2019s cost advantage: it is cheap and abundant, the second most consumed material in the world, after water. Brutalism also had the art-historical advantage of fitting easily into a centuries-long narrative. The monumental brutalist vaulting of the Washington Metro, for instance, is uncannily similar to that found in largest concrete dome in the world \u2013 the 2,000-year-old Pantheon, in Rome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e613bcf786b96a23c390b91d7b8f00432ceff672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e613bcf786b96a23c390b91d7b8f00432ceff672/0_262_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mass Donna Summer roller disco tribute takes palce outside Boston City Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mass Donna Summer roller disco tribute takes palce outside Boston City Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet by the 1960s, when both movements really hit their stride, it was the international style that was in the ascendant. Mies had given New York City the Seagram Building, \u201cthe millennium\u2019s most important building\u201d, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/magazine/best-building-opposites-attract.html\">according to Herbert Muschamp</a> of the New York Times. Citizens of modern cities on every continent started looking up and seeing shimmering sheets of glass, as their formerly parochial towns were transformed into something resembling the Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz. A new international phenomenon emerged: the modern skyline, comprising buildings that aspired to float \u2013 effortlessly, impossibly \u2013 upwards, in a reverie of light and transparency. This, surely, was the golden future. The lucky few were part of it already, and everybody else wanted in. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the 99% (although they didn\u2019t call themselves that at the time) found themselves raising families in suburban concrete housing estates that were direct descendants of <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/85971/ad-classics-unite-d-habitation-le-corbusier\">Corbusier\u2019s Unit\u00e9 d\u2019habitation</a>, or housing unit, in Marseille. The impetus behind such buildings was just as idealistic as any Miesian tower, but concrete architecture is unforgiving, and budgets were tight, and no one ever bothered to consult the people whose lives were ostensibly being improved. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee630e93064fb19dfe0f703ee4aa49f3cd40659f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee630e93064fb19dfe0f703ee4aa49f3cd40659f/0_0_1368_2000/684.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians cross New York\u2019s Park Avenue in front of the landmark Seagram Building.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians cross New York\u2019s Park Avenue in front of the landmark Seagram Building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result was that brutalism, in the public mind, became the architecture of a forgotten underclass: windswept plazas, crumbling concrete, ugly dystopian soullessness. Far from being something to aspire to, it was something to escape from. The name didn\u2019t help: even though it derives from the French <em>b\u00e9ton brut</em>, for raw concrete, it still connotes brutality. The architecture could be pretty brutal too: hulking, massive, monumental. Certainly by 1981, when Tom Wolfe published <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/08/specials/wolfe-bauhaus.html\">From Bauhaus to Our House</a>, brutalism had become something to hate, a symbol of everything that was wrong with modern architecture.</p> <p>The story, however, does not end there. The international style evolved, and not well. What used to be aspirational started becoming an in-your-face statement of conspicuous consumption. The gauche gaudiness of was embraced not only where you might expect it (the Wynn towers of Las Vegas, say), but also in places with real history, such as New York City. Go to Columbus Circle today, for instance, and you\u2019ll see Christian de Portzamparc\u2019s billionaire condos at One57 face off against \u201ca 1950s international style glass skyscraper in a 1980s gold lame party dress,\u201d as Muschamp <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/nyregion/trump-tries-convert-50-s-style-into-90-s-gold-makeover-starts-columbus-circle.html\">described</a> the Trump International Hotel. Such erections generate almost as much hatred today as the worst mistakes of brutalism did in the 1960s, and understandably so: they represent a world in which the more obtrusive and ostentatious you are, the more profit you make.</p> <p>The international style, deservedly or not, is bearing the brunt of the global backlash against rising inequality at all levels of society. Gentrification has become a dirty word, and nothing exemplifies gentrification more than some new steel-and-glass tower going up in the middle of a tight-knit middle-income community. The openness and transparency ostensibly espoused by the architectural vernacular fool no one: these \u201cresidences\u201d are sealed off from their neighborhoods, shiny bubbles of wealth and privilege invariably protected from their less salubrious neighbors by multiple layers of security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec2532e19c625715e698e81a12f2e79dfec092d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec2532e19c625715e698e81a12f2e79dfec092d/0_0_4168_3173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An exterior view of the Met Breuer, named after Marcel Breuer, who designed it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An exterior view of the Met Breuer, named after Marcel Breuer, who designed it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thus was the stage set for the resurgence of brutalism. You can\u2019t put a brutalist building in a gold lame party dress: raw concrete is raw concrete. It\u2019s down-to-earth, honest, unpretentious, egalitarian, and creates buildings rooted in place: <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/117442/ad-classics-boston-city-hall-kallmann-mckinnell-knowles\">Boston City Hall</a>, New York\u2019s Whitney Museum (now the Met Breuer), the city of Bras\u00edlia. </p> <p>Unlike steel and glass, concrete has terroir: the reddish concrete of Boston, for instance, looks and feels very different from the fine-grained concrete of Japan. You take the local rock, bind it with cement and water, and there you have your concrete. Its very nature is local rather than blandly international.</p> <p>When they\u2019re treated with care and respect, brutalist buildings can become treasured by a city in a way that glass-and-steel towers very rarely are. In London, for instance, locals and tourists alike swarm to the concrete cultural buildings on the south bank of the Thames at Waterloo Bridge. These masterpieces \u2013 the Royal Festival Hall, the Hayward Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2014/10/06/brutalist-buildings-national-theatre-london-denys-lasdun/\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre</a> \u2013 are a beloved part of the capital, a destination even for people with no particular reason to go there.</p> <p>A similar possessiveness can be found in residential architecture. Consider Rupert Murdoch, a man who seemingly buys and sells New York homes as a hobby, never staying in one too long, and sometimes never moving in at all. In London, by contrast, he has lived in a Lasdun-designed brutalist apartment block overlooking Green Park for decades, which I very much doubt he will ever sell. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e02941a1e5d53c96e05513a92978d6dd8604f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e02941a1e5d53c96e05513a92978d6dd8604f39/0_763_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, built in 1975 on London\u2019s South Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denys Lasdun\u2019s National Theatre, built in 1975 on London\u2019s South Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Great brutalist buildings, it turns out, have soul, in a way that antiseptic glass curtain walls never will. And they have undeniable power, too. Consider<a href=\"http://architecture.about.com/od/greatbuildings/ss/holocaust.htm\"> Peter Eisenman\u2019s haunting holocaust memorial</a> in Berlin: it would be unthinkable in anything but concrete. </p> <p>Brutalism is protean, as well. With concrete, anything is possible, and astonishing new ideas can emerge at any time: consider <a href=\"http://www.studiootherspaces.net/\">Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Studio Other Spaces</a>, which has developed a technique to cast huge chunks of glacial ice in concrete. When the ice melts, it leaves a series of gorgeously textured irregular spaces. The raw-concrete interiors formed using this technique are like nothing the world has ever seen.</p> <p>Most subversively, brutalism is old. If you move into a brutalist building today, there\u2019s a very good chance that it was built 50 years ago. Certainly contemporary architects such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/jun/19/architecture-serpentine-pavilion\">Peter Zumthor </a>continue to do wonderful work in the same vein, alongside greats like <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/tag/tadao-ando/\">Tadao Ando</a>. But venture to the heart of brutalism and you won\u2019t find brand names and <em>starchitects</em> and buildings of preternatural beauty. Instead you\u2019ll find thousands of much humbler structures, characterized by simplicity, functionality and what-you-see-is-what-you-get directness.</p> <p>Brutalism today has developed a unique ability to cut across class divides. Blue-collar workers and billionaires alike appreciate its charms even if they are sometimes frustrated by its inflexibility; are attracted to its plainness while being inspired by its palpable integrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a70928c2094acf911b7279a1d16c2c6329af2817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a70928c2094acf911b7279a1d16c2c6329af2817/0_0_2717_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston in High Rise: the organic and the concrete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hiddleston in High Rise: the organic and the concrete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StudioCanal/Planet Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see, then, how brutalism is flourishing in the age of Occupy. But there\u2019s another force driving the brutalist resurgence, which is maybe less austere and selfless: photography, in general, and Instagram, in particular.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/17/high-rise-review-tom-hiddleston-ben-wheatley-jb-ballard\">High-Rise</a>, the 2015 Ben Wheatley adaptation of JG Ballard\u2019s novel, you will surely remember the vision of Tom Hiddleston\u2019s smooth yet chiseled naked body as seen from above, framed by a raw-concrete balcony. The intersection of the organic with concrete makes for striking visuals, and even concrete on its own has stunning visual power. Something as simple as a shadow packs a much harder punch when it falls across a beautifully textured grey background.</p> <p>Say what you like about brutalist buildings, you have to admit they look gorgeous in photographs and in coffee-table books such as <a href=\"http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/this-brutal-world-architecture-book-phaidon\">This Brutal World</a>, recently published by Phaidon. Brutalism might still be a bit austere for many people\u2019s taste. But when you live in something that good looking, you can\u2019t help but feel a little bit of glamor by association.</p>",

Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u2019s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u2019t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: You know, this is something that they\u2019re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u2019t see...</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Would you recommend it?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: I don\u2019t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player. Let\u2019s face it. Because it has a lot of relationship with many other banks around the world. And it is an international player as well. So it\u2019s important that it be consolidated and, you know, it has a solid base. Let\u2019s also be realistic.

Those who blame ECB policy for the mixed performance of certain German financial firms have been very vocal. But what has been forgotten is that many banks have been able to more than offset declining interest revenues with higher lending volumes, improved loan performance and lower interest expenses, all of which are beneficial to both the banks and their customers.</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s monetary policy is not the main factor for the low profitability of banks. While some banks\u2019 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions. Let us be clear, however, there is no one size fits all banking model and we have different types of banks that are successfully operating in Germany and in the euro area. </p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi has previously commented that he thinks there are too many banks in Europe. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T14:31:44.075Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc74de4b0757c5291929d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:36:26.637Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Draghi:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We should also not forget that people in your constituencies are affected in different ways by our measures.

What a household may lose in terms of little interest on their bank account, it might save in lower mortgage payments for their home. And it might benefit from rising bond and stock prices in their retirement fund. In fact, evidence shows that between 2008 and 2015 interest <em>payments</em> by households in Germany, as a percentage of gross disposable income, fell more sharply than interest <em>earnings</em>.</p> <p>And the low financing costs for government bonds help to balance the budget and reduce debt at a considerable speed.

This has also been the case in Germany according to another recent Bundesbank study. But most importantly, whatever financial assets savers hold, they will benefit from a recovery of the economy.

Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.</p> <p>Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u2013 and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u2013 and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u2013 loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/past-mortgage-fines-give-deutsche-room-for-hope/\">Another fine mess</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I calculate range of &quot;fair&quot; U.S. Justice Department fine for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeutscheBank\">@DeutscheBank</a> based on what other banks have paid as between $200m and $5.5bn <a href=\"https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1\">https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1</a></p>&mdash; Dominic Elliott (@DominicElliott) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc07be4b049b74e4caf0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:22:54.257Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deutsche Bank logo adorns a wall at the company\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated.</strong></p> <p>Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-14bn-dollar-fine-doj-q-and-a\">rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities</a> would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed.</p> <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong>, analyst at <strong>ETX Capital,</strong> explains how Deutsche has some firepower left:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers.</p> <p>Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u2013 this would hit the share price but it\u2019s not the end of the world. And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required.

Banks are generally better capitalised and able to cope with adverse shocks. And Deutsche\u2019s derivatives exposure can be overstated. These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u2019s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t in a fix:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche\u2019s problem is not capitalisation \u2013 it\u2019s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u2019s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u2019s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement. Deutsche has to face down the short hedgies first and then look to raise capital.

According to Die Zeit\u2019s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u201d of the bank.</p> <p>One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned.</p> <p>However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u201cashamed\u201d to take money from the state \u2013 as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe.</p> <p>The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u201cbail-in\u201d regime.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb9337e4b01b56deffc2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T10:15:59.209Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the Die Zeit story on Deutsche Bank here</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Die Zeit\u2019s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-09/deutsche-bank-rettungsplan-finanzaufsichtsbehoerde?utm_campaign=Zeit.de-Wirtschaft&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00fcr Deutsche Bank vor</a></h2> <p>I\u2019ve skimmed through it, and....</p> <p><strong>It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u2019s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt.</strong></p> <p>It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u2019t raise it from the markets.</p> <p>Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached.</p> <p>And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche.

  "<p>Humans are predisposed to murder each other, new research suggests, although it remains unclear if it\u2019s down to genetics or other factors.</p> <p>Researchers from Spain have found that a tendency to bump off members of the same species is particularly common among primates, and have estimated that around 2% of human deaths at the origin of our species were down to such lethal spats. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat it is saying, in the broadest terms, is that humans have evolved strategies for solving problems with violence,\u201d said Mark Pagel, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>But, the authors add, the impact of society can greatly modify how aggressive humans are, with the proportion of human deaths due to people fighting between themselves fluctuating over mankind\u2019s history.</p> <p>\u201cLethal violence is part of our evolutionary history but not carved in stone in \u2018our genes\u2019,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda G\u00f3mez, first author of the study from the <a href=\"http://www.eeza.csic.es/en/personal.aspx\">Estaci\u00f3n Experimental de Zonas \u00c1ridas </a>(EEZA) in Spain. \u201cAt least to some extent, the way humans organise in societies influences our levels of lethal violence.\u201d</p> <p>The question of human violence has puzzled thinkers for centuries, from Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century, to contemporary psychologists such as Jared Diamond and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/20/wars-john-gray-conflict-peace\">Steven Pinker, </a>the Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>.</p> <p>Pinker has previously argued that humans engage in lethal violence as a \u201cnatural condition,\u201d but that deaths from such violence have decreased with the rise of modern societies with sophisticated institutions and laws. But the idea has proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/13/john-gray-steven-pinker-wrong-violence-war-declining\">controversial</a>. <br></p> <p>The new research is likely to add further fuel to the debate.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19758\">Nature</a>, the team of researchers from four Spanish institutions sought to unpick the evolutionary contribution to lethal human violence by looking at how commonly a range of different mammals kill members of the same species. </p> <p>To do so, they examined the evolutionary family tree of mammals, looking at data from more than 1,020 species, as well as 600 human populations stretching as far back in time as the Stone Age, drawing on evidence from human remains found in archaeological excavations. </p> <p>For each species of mammal, the team looked at the proportion of deaths that were down to violence between members of the same species. The findings showed that such lethal violence is more common in some mammals, such as primates, than in others, such as bats or whales, and is more common among mammals that exhibit social and territorial behaviour that those that go it alone. </p> <p>Using statistical models, the researchers then estimated the likely levels of such lethal violence for evolutionary ancestors at various points in the family tree of mammals.</p> <p>The results revealed that for the ancestor of all mammals, around 1 in every 300 deaths was down to lethal violence between members of the same species. But, the authors note, for evolutionary ancestors of the primates and apes, the figures were higher. </p> <p>Around 1.8% of deaths are thought to have been down to lethal violence for the ancestor of the great apes, and around 2% for the first humans - a figure more than six times higher than at the origin of mammals. </p> <p>\u201cWe cannot tell that 2% of violence is due to genetic factors,\u201d said G\u00f3mez. \u201cNot only genes are inherited from ancestors, also environmental conditions and ecological constraints. Those are also probably influencing the human lethal violence in our evolutionary past.\u201d</p> <p>But Pagel believes it is important to emphasise that genetic adaptations could be at play. \u201cHumans emerged from a very long lineage of species - great apes and before them the primates - that all expressed relatively high levels of lethal violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you immerse an animal in a particular environment, it evolves genetic-based strategies for dealing with that environment. There is good reason to believe this reflects a real genetic or innate tendency to solve problems with violence.\u201d</p> <p>The research also shows that, according to observed evidence, levels of lethal violence among humans have fluctuated over time. While the figure was around 2% for prehistoric man, matching the expected level from the calculations, the proportion of deaths down to such violence rose during other eras such as the iron age and the post-classic period (around 800-500 years ago), falling in contemporary times to below 2%.</p> <p> \u201cFrom the empirical figure of 2% of deaths by lethal violence in primitive hunter-gatherers, different historical times have had different levels of lethal violence,\u201d said G\u00f3mez.</p> <p>Pinker told the Guardian the new research is impressive and supports his views that humans have a natural tendency to engage in lethal violence, that rates of such violence were high in prehistoric societies and are higher in tribes and chiefdoms than hunter-gatherer bands, and that such impulses are dampened in modern societies. \u201cThough I made all these points in The Better Angels of Our Nature in 2011, [the authors] have demonstrated them with much greater precision, rigour, and depth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Douglas Fry of the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the US, disagreed, saying that: \u201cG\u00f3mez and colleagues demonstrate that recent assertions by Steven Pinker and others that violent death in the Paleolithic was shockingly high are greatly exaggerated. To the contrary, the findings show that social organization is critically important in affecting human violence.\u201d</p> <p>G\u00f3mez says the research highlights the control humans have over their situation in life and death. \u201cThe main message of our study is that no matter how violent or pacific we were in the origin, we can modulate the level of interpersonal violence by changing our social environment,\u201dhe said. \u201cWe can build a more pacific society if we wish.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Birth weight of babies is influenced by genes that are also linked to the risk of developing a range of diseases later in life, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes, research has revealed.</p> <p>Scientists say that around a sixth of the variation in birth weight between babies is down to the baby\u2019s genetics, with many of the genetic regions matching those linked to adult diseases and traits from high blood pressure to adult height.</p> <p>The findings, say researchers, strengthen the notion that it is not only environmental factors, such as nutrition of the foetus, that can affect a baby\u2019s size and risk of developing conditions later in life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have been able to show is that genetics are playing an important role here,\u201d said Mark McCarthy, co-author of the research from the University of Oxford. \u201cWhat is going on here is a very intricate mix of genetic and environmental factors playing through both the mother and the offspring which are connecting events in early life to events 50, 60 or 70 years later in the same individual.\u201d </p> <p>The research could help scientists to understand how diseases such as type 2 diabetes arise and find ways to prevent and treat such conditions,says McCarthy,.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature19806\">Nature</a>, researchers from 117 institutions across 17 countries describe how they analysed genetic data from more than 153,000 individuals, including those of European, African American, Chinese and Moroccan ancestries, collected in 37 studies..</p> <p>The new work builds on previous research that identified a handful of genes linked to birth weight, greatly expanding the number of known genetic regions and clarifying their link to a host of later life conditions. </p> <p>The researchers found 60 regions in the genome that affect birth weight, accounting for around 2% of the variation in birth weight between babies. That, they say, is around the same level of variation as is linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/28/working-eight-months-pregnancy-smoking\">factors such as whether the mother smokes during pregnancy</a>.</p> <p>Further analysis, however, revealed a greater number of genetic variations that affect birth weight, but to a smaller degree than those within the 60 key regions. The upshot, the researchers say, is that around 15% of birth weight variation is down to the baby\u2019s genes. </p> <p>With birth weight linked to the risk of developing diseases such as heart disease later in life, the researchers mapped the genetic variations found to affect birth weight to those linked to a variety of traits and health issues. </p> <p>\u201cWe see a pretty substantial overlap which tells us that some of that link that people are observing in populations across the world must be mediated through shared genetic variants that are having an impact both on early life and then 60,70 years later the same genetic differences impact on whether you are likely to get diabetes or not,\u201d said McCarthy. </p> <p>The results revealed that the risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease were genetically linked to a low birth weight, whereas a higher birth weight was linked to traits including birth length, greater waist circumference and adult height.</p> <p>While foetal genes appear to play a large role in the link between birth weight and the risk of later life diseases, maternal genes also need to be considered. That, says McCarthy, means that it could be the same genes, but in the mother, that are at play by influencing the environment inside the uterus. \u201cWe see a bit of that for diabetes,\u201d said McCarthy. </p> <p>Gudrun Moore, professor of clinical and molecular genetics at University College, London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, welcomed the findings but said more needed to be done to uncover just how the genetic regions affect birth weight and disease risk.</p> <p>\u201cThis an important step towards understanding how foetal growth in the womb, driven by variation in key foetal growth genes, can through the same genetic variation affect long term adult health,\u201d she said.</p> <p> \u201cThe next step must include analysis of these gene pathways in tissues from pregnancy cohorts and biosamples from adults with and without metabolic diseases to work out exactly how these genes are involved in producing these effects.\u201d</p>",

However, he said, he wanted to see business play its part in return, by paying more tax to fund a proposed \u201cnational education service\u201d \u2013 a lifelong service from preschools to adult education.</li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebf487e4b01b56deffc520\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:53:36.044Z\">5.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s Comment is free panel verdict on Corbyn\u2019s speech, with contributions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hughmuir\">Hugh Muir</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\">Jonathan Freedland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ellie-mae-o-hagan\">Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adityachakrabortty\">Aditya Chakrabortty</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\">Polly Toynbee</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-party-conference-panel-views\">Did Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s conference speech win over the party? Our writers\u2019 verdict | The panel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here\u2019s an extract, from Aditya\u2019s article.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the heart of today\u2019s speech Corbyn was making a big new argument, one I haven\u2019t heard from a Labour leader\u2019s speech in my entire working life. In just over a year, the Labour party has gone from a being desiccated husk of worn-down old leftists and elbows-out young Blairites to being a mass movement. At half a million members, it is the biggest party in Europe \u2013 at a time when other political parties are dying. To use business terminology, we have witnessed something akin to a reverse takeover of the Labour party. It is incomplete and it is certainly contested, but it is real.</p> <p>And what the head of this new movement \u2013 confirmed as its leader twice in 12 months \u2013 was sketching out today was the potential for a social movement in electoral politics. By invoking the victories of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/sadiq-khans-first-100-days-as-london-mayor-how-is-he-doing\">Sadiq Khan in London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes\">Marvin Rees in Bristol</a>, he was showing that a social movement can yield victory at the ballot box.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebf092e4b01b56deffc50c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:45:10.037Z\">5.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business groups express doubts about Corbyn's vision</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some business reaction to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech.</p> <p>From Josh Hardie, the<strong> CBI</strong>\u2019s director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The CBI shares much of Labour\u2019s vision for a fairer society underpinned by good business. But without an open dialogue there is a risk that some of their policies could take us backwards. </p> <p>With such significant economic challenges ahead, the UK needs a strong opposition firing on all cylinders and providing progressive, practical new ideas.</p> <p>The focus on research and development, infrastructure and education is encouraging, but artificially hiking wages and changing corporation tax could be investment dampeners, not drivers. </p> <p>Labour is certainly laying out a new way forward and we urge them to iron out inconsistent messages - especially the relationship between state and industry - and clarify policies that are sometimes hard to see delivered and paid for.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Simon Walker</strong>, the Institute of Directors\u2019 director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A credible opposition is crucial in keeping the Government on its toes. We will need an effective Labour party challenging the Conservatives during Brexit negotiations to get a deal in the best interests of the country. While Jeremy Corbyn did touch upon important areas for future economic success, like skills and infrastructure, he is not yet putting forward a plan which looks like a platform for government. The basic question is, how will he pay for these mammoth spending plans?</p> <p>The problem for business is that it simply does not see the world in the same way as the Labour leader. The IoD does not think companies are beyond reproach, we have been publically critical of Mike Ashley and Philip Green, but in this speech business was presented as a comic-book villain. Over 80% of people work in the private sector and there are more than five million businesses in the UK. They are the source of the nation\u2019s prosperity, the generators of employment and the funders of our public services. They are not a problem to be solved.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Terry Scuoler, chief executive of <strong>EEF,</strong> the manufacturers\u2019 organisation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst it is welcome to hear the leader of the Opposition talking about the importance of industrial strategy and, the importance of manufacturing, his credentials are far from established in terms of demonstrating an understanding of the overwhelming benefits of liberal capitalism and the society he claims to support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebf0c4e4b049b74e4cb048\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:35:59.247Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn's speech in numbers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association has filed some statistics about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were a total of five mentions of either \u201csocialism\u201d or \u201csocialist\u201d.

He has smartened up (literally), his media performances have been noticeably better this week than they were at last year\u2019s conference and that speech was probably the best he\u2019s ever given on a national platform like this.</p> <p>Corbyn will never be a racy orator, but he did not try for that here and there was nothing that sounded dud or phoney. There was relatively little of the ritual opponent-bashing you get in these speeches (a blessing), no jokes that misfired (in fact, only one joke \u2013 but a good one), and instead just a serious policy manifesto. It did go on a bit, but dull and earnest is not necessarily bad, particularly if as a politician you have yet to establish your credentials as credible future prime minister.</p> <p>Corbyn did not indulge in any recriminations. Perhaps he could have made more of an effort to reach out beyond his natural constituency, but his speech focused on topics like housing, transport and education that do matter to people who read the Daily Mail. It is often said that Corbyn is a politician who gets most animated talking about human rights and world peace. But in this speech he restrained himself, and the Iraq/Saudia Arabia references were rather brief. It was noticeable that the loudest cheers came when he mentioned the Chilcot report. The Corbynites in the audience may have preferred 50 minutes of Blair-bashing, and 10 minutes of domestic policy. But Corbyn wisely did not give them what they wanted.</p> <p>Blair fought the 1997 general election with a five-point pledge card that eventually became very well known. At the moment Corbyn\u2019s 10 pledges have made zero dent on the public consciousness. But today he put them firmly on the table. Some seem little more than vague aspirations (a national education service), though not necessarily bad ones. Some are surprisingly similar to what the government is doing (like getting business to pay for training \u2013 or the apprenticeship levy, as George Osborne called it.)</p> <p>But his headline announcement, about giving councils new powers to borrow to build homes, seems a good one. Why? Because proposals like this have in the past had the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25205623\">backing of credible organisations like the Local Government Association</a>. And even <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/08/why-wont-osborne-let-councils-borrow-build-housing-even-tories-want-him\">Boris Johnson came out in favour of a proposal like this</a> when he was London mayor.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T15:22:05.288Z\">at 4.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebd69fe4b049b74e4cafa4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T14:42:26.012Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn is on his peroration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Everyone here \u2026 and every one of our hundreds of thousands of members \u2026. has something to contribute to our cause.

Given the fact that he is expected to leave parliament and become mayor of Greater Manchester next year (it would take a spectacular upset Labour to lose that contest), this was almost certainly Burnham\u2019s last speech to the conference as a frontbencher. He seemed quite emotional at the end, and he received a warm standing ovation.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Burnham said that he was leaving the shadow cabinet.</strong> A reshuffle is due next week, and Burnham will probably be replaced then. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is my tenth conference speaking to you as a cabinet or shadow cabinet minister.</p> <p>And it will be my last.</p> <p>It is time for me to turn my full focus to Greater Manchester. </p> <p>That\u2019s why I can tell you all first today that I have asked Jeremy to plan a new shadow cabinet without me, although I will of course stay until it is in place.<br></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour had failed so far to respond to people\u2019s concerns about immigration.</strong> It had to show that it understood why people voted for Brexit, he said. Jeremy Corbyn is proposing various measures, including bringing back the migration impact fund, to deal with immigration concerns and Burnham did not directly contradict anything Corbyn has said. But his tone suggested that his stance on the subject is quite different from his leader\u2019s. Burnham said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, this party must fully face up to this fact: millions of lifelong Labour supporters voted to leave the EU and - let\u2019s be honest - voted for change on immigration.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t yet even begun to show to them that we understand why.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to hear this party make the patronising argument that people didn\u2019t understand their referendum vote. They understood it very well.</p> <p>The truth is the EU was working better for some parts of our country than it was for others.</p> <p>For some of our country\u2019s least affluent areas, it wasn\u2019t working well at all ...</p> <p>Labour voters in constituencies like mine are not narrow-minded, nor xenophobic, as some would say. </p> <p>They are warm and giving. Their parents and grandparents welcomed thousands of Ukrainians and Poles to Leigh after the Second World War.</p> <p>And today they continue to welcome refugees from all over the world. They have no problem with people coming here to work.</p> <p>But they do have a problem with people taking them for granted and with unlimited, unfunded, unskilled migration which damages their own living standards. </p> <p>And they have an even bigger problem with an out-of-touch elite who don\u2019t seem to care about it.</p> <p>If Labour now argues for the status quo, it will look like we have abandoned them too.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he favoured a \u201cfair\u201d Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So let\u2019s develop a plan for fair Brexit that deals with their concerns but supports our economy and keeps the Britain we have known - open, welcoming, playing its part in the world.</p> <p>Because the truth is, a hard Brexit would hit these Labour areas hardest of all.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Ironically Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, also used the phrase \u201cfair\u201d Brexit on the Today programme this morning when asked what sort of Brexi he wanted.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn criticised those in the party who have been attacking the record of the Blair/Brown governments.</strong> He said he was \u201csad to hear the achievements of our Labour government, in which I was proud to serve, being dismissed as if they were nothing.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He appealed for unity.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have given my all to this party and always put its interests above those of factions and personalities.</p> <p>And I have given exactly the same loyalty to all four of the Labour leaders I have served.</p> <p>Some say that makes me inconsistent.</p> <p>But, you know what conference? I have an old-fashioned belief - that a Labour government of any kind is a million times better for my constituents in Leigh than any Tory government and that is more likely to happen if Labour is united.</p> <p>So let us unite - let\u2019s have an end to divisive talk about deselections but, in return, let\u2019s have more respect for the democratic will of you, our members.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for a full inquiry into Orgreave.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Doesn\u2019t it make you angry, conference, that, thirty years on, former miners are still struggling for the truth? Ordinary people who were fighting for their jobs, their communities, their future.</p> <p>Whose own country tried to put them on trial. It\u2019s why, even today, Britain still feels like two countries. Norman Tebbitt, remember him, well he says an inquiry would be a waste of money. Well, he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? Let me tell him why it\u2019s not. </p> <p>Kevin Thorne, a former miner at Orgeave, came to Westminster recently to lobby the Home Secretary for an inquiry. He was asked why, after all these years, he is still campaigning. He said this: \u201cI want my grandchildren to be able to trust the Police as I was brought up to do.\u201d</p> <p>That is why Orgreave matters, Conference. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would continue to campaign for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/12/andy-burnham-hillsborough-law-policing-and-crime-bill\"> a \u201cHillsborough law\u201d,</a> giving bereaved families being represented at inquests the same legal support as the police. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the rest of my time in parliament, I will fight for the proposed Hillsborough Law.</p> <p>A law to rebalance the justice system, away from the Establishment and decisively in favour of ordinary people. And I ask you to get fully behind that campaign.</p> <p>A Law that says no public bodies can distort or withhold the truth at inquests; that guarantees all bereaved families a level playing field and equal legal funding - and that Home Secretary should include those Birmingham families.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He accused Theresa May of \u201cpositioning herself to the right of the leave campaign\u201d.</strong> He justified that on the grounds that May has refused to guarantee that EU nationals living in the UK will be able to stay after Brexit. Even Vote Leave said they should stay, he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour should champion devolution and the northern powerhouse.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s seize this moment, put our stamp on devolution and make it a Labour campaign: for a more equal England. Conference, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support you have given to me over the last ten years.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eef840b268d15ab3c85c5ae96f3418113874e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eef840b268d15ab3c85c5ae96f3418113874e67/0_122_3649_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:04:20.177Z\">at 1.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eba45fe4b01b56deffc325\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T11:13:09.600Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In here speech during the home affairs debate <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, said that France and Britain should agree to each take half of the 1,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Calais.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election has strengthened his position in the party \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t decisively altered the balance of power.</strong> Normally the moment after an election victory is when a leader is constrained the least. But for Corbyn there is no one left to sack, any frontbench promotions will be determined by who offers to serve, not who Corbyn picks, and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">as the struggle over the national executive rule changes showed,</a> Corbyn cannot depend on getting Labour\u2019s key decision-making body to do what he wants. Significantly, within two days of his re-election, Corbyn effectively conceded that,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident\"> for now, at least, he is giving up trying to change party policy on Trident. </a>This is a significant retreat on an issue on which Corbyn has campaigned all his life.<br></p> <p><strong>2 \u2013 Labour now feels like two parties that don\u2019t even like each other anymore but that cannot afford to get divorced. </strong>There has been no serious talk at all about a split, because the mechanics of the electoral system make that suicidal and both sides are emotionally attached to the Labour brand, but there is a vast gulf between the two camps, pro-Corbyn and anti-Corbyn. Superficially the divide is about policy, but much more it is about whether people are prepared to make an emotional investment in Corbyn\u2019s purist, poll-defying idealism. Labour has become a coalition and, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/a-strategy-for-jeremy-corbyns-leadership-to-succeed-9ffe4c27149b#.1hw5xd6ia\">as Owen Jones suggested in a recent essay</a>, one way forward might be a proper coalition agreement. And perhaps a quad, with Corbyn, John McDonnell, Tom Watson and Hilary Benn? They could ask David Cameron and Nick Clegg for some advice.</p> <p><strong>3 \u2013 Corbyn has made little progress over the last year in fleshing out a policy platform.</strong> The Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, who resigned from the shadow cabinet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/21/kerry-mccarthy-im-angry-some-people-dont-care-about-being-in-power-bristol-labour-corbyn\">told the Guardian recently</a> that she had never seen Corbyn \u201cmove beyond things you could fit on a T-shirt\u201d in his policy thinking and this conference seems to bear that out. A year ago, after his surprise election as leader, Corbyn could be forgiven for only having an outline view as to what he would do. This year he has barely moved on and conference has been relatively policy-lite. McDonnell did give a speech with a speech with a clear set of economic proposals but almost none of them have been worked up in any detail and his headline announcement (a \u00a310 minimum wage) was something he promised last year. Corbyn is also proposing a \u00a3500bn investment plan but the party has released no detail about this and at the moment the plan seems to amount to nothing more than a figure on a press release. On economic policy, and even more so in other areas like education and welfare, there is little evidence that the party has started taking difficult choices, or started engaging seriously with outside bodies on legislative proposals.<br></p> <p><strong>4 \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s critics are not united. </strong>At the time of the \u201ccoup\u201d shadow ministers announced their resignations on an hour by hour basis in a move that was clearly coordinated. But since Corbyn\u2019s re-election on Saturday there has been no agreed, group response from the MPs who left the front bench in the hope of forcing him out. A few have said publicly that they would be willing to go back, a few more may have been speaking to Corbyn privately, and Corbyn seems confident to have enough names to be able to announce a reshuffle next week. Another group may be willing to go back, but want to delay so that they can use the offer of going back as a bargaining tool to try to Corbyn to accept some form of shadow cabinet elections. A third group seem determined to remain on the back benches for good.</p> <p><strong>5 \u2013 Corbyn is probably safe at least until 2018.</strong> There is now a general recognition on the part of Corbyn\u2019s critics that this summer\u2019s leadership challenge achieved nothing and speculation about another leadership contest next year seems to have vanished. At the very least Corbyn should be safe until 2018, although there is also a widespread view that he will be able to remain leader until the general election if he wants to. After the EU referendum the prospect of an early election was used by MPs as an argument for challenging Corbyn immediately. But, now that he has won, it is Corbyn who is exploiting the \u201cearly election\u201d threat and he is citing it as a reason why MPs should back him.</p> <p><strong>6 \u2013 Labour is split over how to interpret the Brexit vote. </strong>Many MPs believe that immigration was a key factor and increasingly there are calls for the party to abandon its commitment to the free movement of labour. But Corbyn sees the Brexit vote as primarily a vote against the economic status quo and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\">as he confirmed this morning, </a>he is opposed to immigration controls. Interestingly, this is one issue where Labour\u2019s old right, which is sceptical about immigration, disagrees with the pro-free movement Blairite right. On this topic Corbyn is a Blairite.</p> <p><strong>7 - Labour\u2019s leaders outside Westminster are more important to the party than ever.</strong> Devolution and the creation of elected mayors have created a new powerbase within British politics and Corbyn\u2019s opponents see it as offering the party a lifeline. Sadiq Khan openly paraded his credentials as an alternative leader this week. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, is being encouraged to develop a UK profile so that he can show English voters what a pragmatic Labour government can achieve. Mayoral elections next May should see other Labour figures taking executive office and in his speech yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-says-party-must-prepare-for-fourth-industrial-revolution?page=with:block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82#block-57ea9feae4b08ca277ca0c82\">Tom Watson said these figures, and Labour councillors, would be the ones who led Labour back to power.</a> Not Corbyn, he implied.</p> <p><strong>8 - In person Labour members are much more civil to each other than anyone would guess from reading the papers.</strong> In the run-up to conference some people were predicting 1980s-style fights and blood on the floor, and <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/labour-mp-ruth-smeeth-to-take-24hour-minder-to-party-conference-after-flood-of-threats-a3350021.html\">one MP even said she was coming to the conference with a minder. </a>In practice it has been very peaceful. The level of heckling is not much worse than at an average conference, there have barely been any raised voices and the only punch thrown occurred when Clive Lewis (reportedly) hit a wall because he was angry with Corbyn\u2019s office interfering with his speech. That is not to say that the social media abuse has not been real. But Twitter is a real world, not <em>the</em> real world, and in realspace, if not cyberspace, Labour members seem to get on.</p> <p><strong>9 - Momentum is not Militant, and they can run a lively, successful conference. </strong>One of the highlights of Liverpool has been Momentum\u2019s The World Transformed alternative conference (or festival, as they prefer to call it) taking place about half a mile away. Anyone turning up expecting a Militant re-enactment will have been disappointed. Outside there were older, hard-core lefties selling \u201cdeselect your MP\u201d literature. But as journalists like Andrew Grice <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-momentum-world-transformed-critics-will-not-like-it-a7331036.html\">(here)</a> and Paul Mason<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/the-real-lesson-from-corbyns-victory-you-cant-hold-back-history\"> (here) </a>report, inside it was full of young, earnest, welcoming activists seemingly with no interest in becoming the next Derek Hatton. In the long run it is till not clear what impact Momentum will have on Labour, but this week its reputation has gone up.</p> <p><strong>10 - Corbyn has no obvious successor.</strong> Most parties normally have an unofficial leader-in-waiting. Often they never get the job (Yvette Cooper filled this role for Labour for much of the last parliament), but nevertheless the ULIW carries some clout. At Liverpool the position is vacant. Clive Lewis\u2019s standing as a potential, Corbyn-lite alternative leader is on the rise (for reasons Stephen Bush explains <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/09/what-will-labours-new-awkward-squad-do-next\">here),</a> and some Corbyn-sceptics, like Chuka Umunna and Lisa Nandy, have been prominent on the fringe.

It hasn\u2019t received much attention, but potentially it is significant. </p> <p>Delegates were voting on a package of changes to Labour party, the most important of which was one to give Scotland and Wales a seat each on the NEC. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-expected-to-lose-majority-support-of-labour-nec\">As Jessica Elgot reports,</a> that resulted in Jeremy Corbyn losing his majority on the NEC. Labour has published the exact voting figures this morning and the motion was carried by 80% to 20%. Only 8% of union votes were against, but 32% of constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates were.</p> <p>But the conference also voted on various alternative changes proposed by CLPs.

With other family members including a young son, the Kanes own just over 50% of the business between them.</p> <p>The deal is likely to intensify competition in Britain\u2019s postal market, putting further pressure on Royal Mail by allowing UK Mail to capitalise on the German group\u2019s greater financial and operational firepower.</p> <p> News of the bid sent UK Mail\u2019s shares up by 43%, as investors welcomed the deal. . </p> <p>It comes after a difficult period for UK Mail, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/18/uk-mail-first-half-profits-more-than-halve-delays-delivery-centre-coventry\">problems at its automated sorting facility</a> led to two profit warnings last year and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/uk-mail-boss-guy-buswell-departs-second-profits-warning\">departure of the then chief executive</a>, Guy Buswell.</p> <p> </p> <p>Peter Kane said the offer from Deutsche Post, which is listed publicly and also owns logistics company DHL, gave shareholders the opportunity to cash in at a significant premium to the levels at which the share price had traded in recent months.</p> <p>\u201cThe board believes that UK Mail will benefit significantly from becoming part of Deutsche Post DHL, and will be better positioned to continue to develop our parcels and mail businesses with the benefit of Deutsche Post DHL\u2019s greater financial and operational resources,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201dThere will be significant synergies including additional volumes flowing through our network from Deutsche Post DHL\u2019s global operations.\u201d UK Mail delivers parcels and mail from 50 sites, using 2,440 vehicles.</p> <p>J\u00fcrgen Gerdes, a board member at Deutsche Post DHL, said the deal would help the company satisfy increasing demand for cross-border parcel deliveries, driven by growth in e-commerce.<br></p> <p>\u201cWith this acquisition, we will further extend our network and have a strong foothold in Europe\u2019s three largest e-commerce markets \u2013 the UK, Germany and France \u2013 which account for more than 60% of online retail in the continent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The postal market is undergoing a period of change, with declining volumes of letters and an increase in parcels as shopping moves online. This has led to fierce competition in the UK market, threatening the dominance of Royal Mail.<br></p> <p>The now privatised Royal Mail is the biggest parcel operator, but UK Mail, says it is the next largest group in the market, delivering for businesses such as O2 and TalkTalk.</p> <p>George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIf competition weren\u2019t already tough enough in the UK postal market, the big boy of European mail has just dived into the mix. </p> <p>\u201cDeutsche Post\u2019s decision to buy struggling UK Mail adds a new player to the market with a meaningful UK footprint and lots of fire power. That has hit Royal Mail today, on fears that pricing pressure, that looked to be easing, might be about to enter a second round.\u201d</p> <p>Royal Mail shares were down 3.3%. </p>",

  "<p>Pangolins, the world\u2019s most illegally trafficked mammal, were thrown a lifeline at a global wildlife summit on Wednesday with a total trade ban in all species. </p> <p>More than a million wild pangolins have been killed in the last decade, to feed the huge and rising appetite in China and Vietnam for its meat and its scales, a supposed medicine. The unique scaly anteaters are fast heading for extinction in Asia and poachers are now plundering Africa. </p> <p>But the 182 nations of the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) unanimously agreed a total ban on international trade on all species at the summit in Johannesburg, prompting cheers and applause from delegates. </p> <p>Cites works to crack down on wildlife trafficking, currently a $20bn-a-year criminal enterprise, and to ensure the legal trade in food, skins, pets and traditional remedies does not threaten the survival of species. The summit also boosted protection for the barbary ape on Wednesday, Europe\u2019s only wild primate, and a spectacular-horned mountain goat.</p> <p>The four Asian species of pangolin \u2013 Indian, Philippine, Sunda and Chinese - have been decimated by illegal poaching. The animals breed slowly and are easy to catch \u2013 they simply roll up when threatened. \u201cIt is an effective strategy against a hungry lion, but a disadvantage when approached by a human collector,\u201d said Nigeria\u2019s delegate, who added that the price of pangolin scales has risen tenfold in last five years.</p> <p>The rampant scale of the black market has been revealed by frequent huge seizures: Indonesian authorities confiscated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/picture/2015/apr/30/thousands-of-frozen-pangolins-lie-in-a-pit-in-indonesia\">burned thousands of frozen pangolins</a> in 2015, while a Chinese ship which ran aground in the Philippines in 2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/15/chinese-vessel-philippine-reef-illegal-pangolin-meat\">carrying 10 tonnes of pangolin</a>. But traffickers have increasingly targeted the four African species: giant, South African, long-tailed and white-bellied. In June, more than 11 tonnes of pangolin scales were seized in Hong Kong in just two shipments from Africa.</p> <p>Vietnam\u2019s delegate said the upgrading of pangolins to Cites appendix 1 on Wednesday \u2013 the strictest protection possible \u2013 was critical for the survival of the Sunda and Chinese pangolins in particular, which are critically endangered. The move will pressure affected nations into tougher law enforcement and higher penalties for criminals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca767de98bdbe90cbd51dab496f9f7ff75934fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca767de98bdbe90cbd51dab496f9f7ff75934fd6/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burned after a seizure in Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burned after a seizure in Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/WCS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indonesia was the only nation to oppose the new protection for Sunda and Chinese pangolins, while China abstained, noting that pangolins are also caught for bushmeat in many countries and that habitat loss is also a factor. Laos supported the Asian pangolin proposals, but the Guardian revealed on Tuesday how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/27/revealed-how-senior-laos-officials-cut-deals-with-animal-traffickers\">senior Laos officials have cut deals with wildlife traffickers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a huge win and rare piece of good news for some of the world\u2019s most trafficked and endangered animals,\u201d said Ginette Hemley, head of the WWF delegation to Cites. \u201cThis eliminates any question about legality of trade, making it harder for criminals to traffic them and increasing the consequences for those who do.\u201d She said efforts to reduce the demand in China and Vietnam were vital too.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision will help give pangolins a fighting chance,\u201d said Dr Susan Lieberman, at the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThe world is standing up for the little guy with this pivotal decision. These species need extra protection and now they will get it.\u201d</p> <p>Like pangolins, the protection for the endangered <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12561/0\">barbary ape</a> \u2013 the only wild primate in Europe \u2013 was increased to the highest level. The population of the ape, found in Gibraltar, Morocco and Algeria, has at least halved in the last 30 years, to as few as 6,500.</p> <p>Many barbary apes, mostly infants, are illegally captured each year, largely for the European exotic pet trade and to be used as props for tourist photos. Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, MEP and head of the European parliament delegation to Cites, said: \u201cThis is a key next step in protecting a species for which the EU is unfortunately a key destination market.\u201d </p> <p>Some of the Cites decisions on Wednesday removed existing protection from species where conservation efforts have been successful. South Africa won unanimous support for the removal of the strictest protection from the Cape mountain Zebra. Its population is now growing at 9% a year, with 4,800 living in the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6977cd6f15359f9014384ed2225aef8954fbfe0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6977cd6f15359f9014384ed2225aef8954fbfe0a/0_0_3631_2421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The protection for the endangered barbary ape - the only wild primate in Europe - was increased to the highest level.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The protection for the endangered barbary ape - the only wild primate in Europe - was increased to the highest level.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno D'Amicis/NPL/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is one of the success stories of large mammals in South Africa\u201d said South Africa\u2019s environment minister, Edna Molewa. \u201cIt is no longer at risk of extinction.\u201d The looser protection will allow more trophy hunting, which South Africa says provides incentives for conservation efforts on private land.</p> <p>The wood bison, one of the two subspecies of American bison, was completely removed from the Cites protective list on Wednesday, as its population has grown to 9,000 and is not threatened by poaching. There are about 500,000 American bison in total, far fewer than the 20 million or more that once roamed the continent.</p> <p>Also on Wednesday, Georgia and the EU gained some protection for the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3794/0\">western tur</a>, a mountain goat with spectacular horns found only in the Caucasus mountains. The population of the goat, hunted as trophies, has fallen from 12,000 to 4,000 in Georgia in the last 30 years. Russia, which hosts 20,000 of the goats, had opposed the proposal, arguing the goat was already well protected and that trophy hunting encouraged gave conservation and helped prevent poaching.</p>",

The time has come for the key stakeholders in this country to genuinely come together to establish a new framework for the future and we would be happy to progress those discussions with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, changes to the current set-up should also be enforceable globally and this must involve UEFA and FIFA to help spread best practice around the world and re-introduce a system of licensing and regulation which works and is meaningful.

But beyond these aggrandised, constructed caricatures were people trying to understand what had happened to them so they could try and move past it. That\u2019s what we were trying to explore.\u201d</p> <p>Kercher\u2019s murder and Knox\u2019s supposedly rampant sexual appetite were linked by Mignini\u2019s prosecution. Knox\u2019s motive for the murder of a girl she scarcely knew, the prosecutor explains in the film, was her \u201clack of morality\u201d, her desire for \u201cpleasure at any cost\u201d, which compelled her to wield a knife \u201cthat teases then plunges\u201d into Kercher\u2019s neck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50bed0569ce57f8a587bb8c9237fbaed04ddd1a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50bed0569ce57f8a587bb8c9237fbaed04ddd1a6/0_0_1920_812/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from the documentary, showing police evidence in the case.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still from the documentary, showing police evidence in the case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But of particular focus is how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/07/face-of-an-angel-meredith-kerchner\">mass media took this material and ran with it</a>. \u201cWe realised this story was about the changing landscape of journalism itself,\u201d Blackhurst says. \u201cIn 2007, we saw the beginning of Facebook and the rise of digital media, alongside the takeover of the 24-hour news cycle. That gave rise to clickbait, of stories being driven by headlines rather than reporting in the traditional sense of the word.\u201d</p> <p>When the film premiered at the Toronto film festival, the crowd were audibly repulsed by Pisa, the journalist happy to liken his front-page exclusives \u2013 about a young girl raped and tortured to death \u2013 to the sensation of having sex. \u201cA murder always gets people going,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cGruesome murder, throat slit, semi-naked, blood everywhere. What more do you want in a story?\u201d</p> <p>With swarms of journalists competing with Pisa on the ground in Perugia, it\u2019s easy to see why the legal proceedings became a trial by media. Yet the directors are keen to defend Pisa. \u201cNick stands for a new generation of freelance journalists who, in the absence of dedicated correspondents from traditional news organisations, can report on stories for a large number of outlets \u2013 from tabloid news to traditional papers to television networks,\u201d says McGinn.</p> <p>\u201cBut the film is also an indictment of the culture that wants to consume these stories,\u201d says Blackhurst. \u201cThe people who want to cast the stone at Nick are often the same people logging on every morning, keen to read the latest, grisliest titbits from the case.\u201d</p> <p>Pisa was happy to feed the beast. He got hold of a copy of Knox\u2019s diary, leaked from the prison in which she was being held, in which she detailed her sexual history after being told, erroneously, that she was HIV-positive. \u201cI think the photocopying places in Perugia must have made a fortune,\u201d Pisa jokes in the film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78ab22acf7cf1ab01e401bed3e46a373fc9e2ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ab22acf7cf1ab01e401bed3e46a373fc9e2ff5/0_0_2962_4064/729.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Blackhurst and Brian McGinn.\" width=\"729\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Blackhurst and Brian McGinn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walker/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNick is extremely good at what he\u2019s asked to do, which is to find headlines every six hours for a news cycle that rolls on 24 hours a day,\u201d says Blackhurst. \u201cJust look at the comments thread that follows any story about Amanda. It says a lot.\u201d</p> <p>The coverage marks a turning point, the directors say: the mingling of tabloid and broadsheet newspapers in the wild west of the internet, all in pursuit of traffic and eyeballs. \u201cThe story became driven by headlines,\u201d McGinn says. \u201cIt was one of the first great examples of this post-truth age we now live in, where people respond to something primarily by how it makes them feel.\u201d</p> <p>Knox is now a global celebrity. At the airport on her way to the premiere, paparazzi swarmed round her and her new fiance, although she gave no interviews. In 2012, she agreed to a $4m (\u00a33m) book deal with HarperCollins about her trial and imprisonment in Italy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/28/amanda-knox-free-rich-american-patrick-lumumba-meredith-kercher-murder\">and her eventual acquittal and release</a>.</p> <p>She claims, in the film, to hate the attention and the impact it has had on her life. \u201cThe whole world knew who I had sex with \u2013 seven men!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd yet I was some heinous whore \u2013 bestial, sex-obsessed and unnatural.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that Knox was the victim of what is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/08/slut-shaming-shames-us-all\">now called \u201cslut-shaming\u201d</a>; her sexual desire as a young woman was used to implicate her in the brutal murder. \u201cWere you into deviant sex?\u201d she was asked in a primetime interview with a middle-aged man playing lay preacher. \u201cInsensitive question, but hey, we\u2019ve got to get to where this is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Amanda\u2019s sexual history something we should consider as part of the case, or is it a judgment based on how we perceive female sexuality, the question of whether a woman is allowed to have multiple lovers?\u201d Blackhurst asks.</p> <p>\u201cPeople look into Amanda\u2019s eyes as if that\u2019s going to be reveal something about the physical evidence of the crime scene,\u201d McGinn says. \u201cShe is talked of as this cipher who can accidentally reveal something about the case, based on whether or not she swallows, or blinks her eyes, or looks away at a certain moment.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, at the heart of this film, there remains a glaring absence.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/28/meredith-kercher-amanda-knox-raffaele-sollecito-italy-case\">Meredith Kercher was a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon, south London</a>.

The Conservatives would have been able to pass these policies had it not been for dissent on their own backbenches.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/len-mccluskey-labour-deputy-leader-tom-watson-unite-union\">Len McCluskey launches withering attack on Tom Watson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>6) The Labour leader says his election has grown out of a thirst for different politics and people being \u201cfed up with the free-market system\u201d. He promises economic solutions for the future, not the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn is in effect tackling the arguments of some of his critics that he is harking back to socialist policies of the 1970s. Instead, he is linking his purpose to a new wave of anti-establishment movements across the world in which people disillusioned with the effects of globalisation are demanding change.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>7) Corbyn attacks the Tories for \u201cgerrymandering\u201d by trying to change parliamentary boundaries for the next election.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: The Labour leader strongly opposes the boundary review. But it may also be helpful to him because it will pit a number of Labour MPs against each other when their seats are abolished or changed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>8) An attack on Sir Philip Green, the former BHS boss, goes down well in the hall.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn points out that Green was hired by the Tories to do an efficiency review and links this to the government being wedded to a failed economic model of the past. It is part of casting himself as a candidate for change.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>9) Corbyn promises everybody a decent home, a proper living wage, secure employment rights and an end to zero-hour contracts.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: It is quite hard for anyone in Labour to disagree with this and part of Corbyn\u2019s strategy will be to unite his party on matters of domestic policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>10) Corbyn explains his 10 policy proposals, from not taking the country into unnecessary wars to an end to inequality. He jokes that they are not the Ten Commandments.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is a little bit of self-deprecating humour aimed at those who claim he is treated as the messiah by his followers. The serious point is that he is on the way to successfully enshrining the points of his leadership campaign as policy, allowing him more control over the direction of the party.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11) The Labour leader promises an end to the local authority borrowing cap, which would allow another 12,000 council homes to be built.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An earlier draft of the speech predicted 60,000 more homes, suggesting the estimate is a cautious one. This will be hugely welcomed by councils as local authority housing stock has been depleted by the right-to-buy scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>12) Labour would borrow \u00a3500bn to invest in infrastructure and public services to end \u201cmanaged decline\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Plenty of sensible independent analysts have been calling for these things. Many voters may think it essential for growth and adequate public services but others may worry about Labour again being seen to be proposing borrowing when they are yet to rebuild their reputation on the economy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>13) Corbyn promises a \u201cnew deal for rebuilding Britain\u201d that involves raising corporation tax by 1.5% to help pay for the education of college students.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This may be the start of a new trend of \u201chypothecation\u201d in tax policy, where Labour links a specific tax rise to a specific benefit for society. The theory is that people and businesses are more inclined to stomach a tax rise that is going towards a named social good.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>14) A new \u00a3160m fund will be available to ensure schoolchildren have access to arts and culture through a special \u201cpupil premium\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Getting every child to learn about culture and music is a personal priority for Corbyn. He may have misspoken when talking about England and Wales as education is devolved.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>15) Labour will scrap the work capability assessment.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This will be another unifier for the party. Many MPs were not happy with last year\u2019s decision to abstain on a welfare vote and Corbyn is firmly pitching his leadership as one that will stand up for people\u2019s rights to fair benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>16) Corbyn stuck to his line on defending immigration, saying it was the Labour way to oppose racism, myths and division.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This is one issue of domestic policy on which there is division in the shadow cabinet. A number of frontbenchers think Labour should take from the Brexit vote that people want stronger controls on immigration.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>17) Corbyn defines his own aims of Brexit as including the freedom to intervene in our own industries, no obligation to liberalise or privatise our public services and a new relationship with Europe based on cooperation and internationalism.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: These are all laudable aims for Labour, but Corbyn does not give much detail on the central question of the Brexit negotiations: the trade-off between the single market and free movement. The end to restrictions on state aid would be significant, though, as the government would be better able to rescue struggling industries such as steel.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>18) The Labour leader reiterates his apology for the Iraq war.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: This one is a crowd-pleaser, as Corbyn again takes the opportunity to draw a dividing line between his own leadership and that of the last Labour government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>19) A Corbyn government would end arms sales to Saudi Arabia over its actions in Yemen.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> This is another major policy based on reports that Saudi Arabia has committed war crimes. Corbyn has been a long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, which is an ally of the UK government.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>20) Corbyn acknowledges there is an \u201celectoral mountain to climb\u201d, especially if there is a snap election next year.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: As focus turns from the party battle to the possibility of one against the Tories, Corbyn stresses the \u201cneeds and aspirations of middle- and lower-income voters, of ordinary families\u201d which Labour must address. He again focuses on the need for a \u201csocialism of the 21st century\u201d \u2013 looking forwards rather than backwards.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>21) A rare personal passage describes Corbyn getting his socialism from his parents and working as a teacher and trade union organiser.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: The Labour leader is reluctant to talk about his family, but he refers to his teacher mother and engineer father who instilled in him a love for socialism and peace. It may be the beginnings of a project to introduce the electorate more to Jeremy the man.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>22) There is a big standing ovation as Corbyn finishes on the slogan: \u201cTogether, we can shape the future \u2026 and build a fairer Britain \u2026 in a peaceful world.\u201d A choir sings Jerusalem.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RM: Corbyn looks pleased with his performance, which was more assured and fluent than last year. There was very little of controversy in the speech for Labour critics of Corbyn to oppose. The choice of Jerusalem appears designed to dispel notions that the Labour leader does not do patriotism.<br></p> </blockquote>",

Normally, it\u2019s during a time of transition in the mentee\u2019s life.</p> <p>Birmingham\u2019s Hamstead Hall Academy runs two strands of the scheme: one for more able students, and another for those experiencing personal or family issues. Attendance is voluntary and pupils are encouraged to share experiences and work on specific subject areas. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about making students independent learners,\u201d says Melios Michael, the scheme\u2019s coordinator. \u201cThat\u2019s what every teacher wants.\u201d</p> <p>Tia, who has just started year 8, says the sessions are fun and supportive. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same if they were led by a teacher,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs my confidence grew, I was getting better at maths \u2013 and that then had an effect on my other subjects too.\u201d </p> <p>Another student, Rahul, has gone from mentee to mentor. \u201cYou don\u2019t get everything right, but with a mentor you are more willing to have a second try, compared to in a classroom with loads of people,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/31/great-expectations-how-to-help-your-students-fulfil-their-potential\">Great expectations: how to help your students fulfil their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prospective mentors undergo a careful selection process.

As well as being useful for university applications, students say these schemes help to build their confidence and develop strong presentation skills. </p> <p>For any school that may be considering setting up such a programme, training and support for students is key, according to Melios Michael. \u201cThey have to be given some freedom to take on responsibilities, but within certain boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>At Headlands School in Bridlington, peer mentoring takes a different form, with a focus on year 7 students who are finding school life difficult. They meet in a dedicated mentoring room first thing every morning and are accompanied from lesson to lesson by their mentors. At the end of the day, the pair meet again to debrief and check they\u2019re organised for the next day. </p> <p>It\u2019s proved popular with the students: 49 applied for just 20 mentoring positions last year. </p> <p>\u201cMentors are allowed to wear red hoodies instead of the standard uniform, so they have a high status in the school community,\u201d coordinator Vaughan Hewitt explains. \u201cThey are visible and reassuring for many younger students.\u201d</p> <p> Hewitt says he wants to create an atmosphere where mentees feel they have a big brother or sister to look out for them.</p> <h2>How to make it work</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/14/meditation-made-my-students-calmer-kinder-and-more-focused\">Meditation made my students calmer, kinder and more focused</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But how effective are peer mentoring schemes? A 2008 <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DCSF-RR033-R.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> (pdf) found that the degree of formalisation was a key factor in determining the success of peer mentoring programmes. Schemes with good recruitment, clear aims, embedded procedures for referral, and training of mentors were more likely to work for pupils. It added that mentees can also benefit from coordinator-led training themselves, in order to manage expectations and let them know what they can bring to the scheme. </p> <p>But although pupils say mentoring boosts their confidence, there is a lack of clear evidence about the impact on academic performance or behaviour. It\u2019s something Michael broadly recognises \u2013 although he and his students maintain it can have an influence. </p> <p>\u201cIt definitely builds their confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rest depends on the programme and the training. It doesn\u2019t happen for everyone, but the grades can follow.\u201d </p> <p>Hewitt adds: \u201cYou can see in the faces of the kids \u2013 who, over time, become bouncy and lively \u2013 that this scheme works.\u201d </p> <p>Peer mentoring is not a silver bullet, then.

The number and intensity of the fires varies strongly with climate anomalies such as El Ni\u00f1o and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation.

Fifteen long years after the blasting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/rebuild-bamiyan-buddhas-taliban-afghanistan\">the Bamiyan Buddhas</a>, the ICC ruling on the destruction of the mausoleums of Timbuktu passed with the world still reeling over spectacular acts of devastation in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere. Yet the verdict reinforces previous judgments against Balkan warlords by the UN\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.icty.org/en\">international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a>, which treated crimes against heritage, notably in Dubrovnik, as part of broader charges involving murder and theft.</p> <p>The outcome of Mahdi\u2019s trial is an important contribution towards a comprehensive response to violent extremism, and a strong statement on the role culture should play. The deliberate destruction of heritage has become a weapon of war, part of a broader strategy of cultural cleansing that includes murder and persecution of people in the short term, and the annihilation of identities and destruction of social fabric in the longer term. </p> <p>Monuments are targeted, damaged or looted to fuel illicit trafficking and finance criminal activities. Schools and media are hijacked. Cultural practices, including music and dance, are banned. Intellectuals are silenced. The aim of this brutal strategy is to enslave minds and prohibit free thinking. Mahdi, head of a morality squad called Hesbah, was a linchpin of this heinous strategy.</p> <p>This goes beyond Mali: humanity itself is targeted; we are all concerned. The war against extremism must therefore be fought also on the battlefield of culture, education and the media. No military arsenal is strong enough to defeat an ideology that fuels violence. </p> <p>We must win the battle of ideas. How? By teaching about the history of religions. By fostering dialogue between cultures. By sharing the wealth of knowledge contained in the manuscripts of Timbuktu, which hold the promise of a new humanist renaissance that could change our understanding of Africa and of Islam, strengthening young people\u2019s capacity to resist those who exploit ignorance and hatred.</p> <p>This broader vision of security is gaining ground. In warfare, the destruction of heritage was long considered mere collateral damage. Increasingly, though, culture is recognised as a direct target, part of a strategy intent on disseminating fear and attracting global media coverage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"559ab497adf98cf1f6ada96ecaa1f4947d70a89a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/559ab497adf98cf1f6ada96ecaa1f4947d70a89a/175_0_2280_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from footage of Islamist militants destroying an ancient shrine in Timbuktu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from footage of Islamist militants destroying an ancient shrine in Timbuktu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UN security council has acknowledged the link between culture and security, and the contribution of illicit trafficking to the financing of criminal activities. Member states are seizing dubious objects at their borders, strengthening cooperation among services. Armed forces in France, Italy, the US and Austria are training their soldiers and officers to protect heritage. </p> <p>This is already the case in Mali, where peacekeepers are working with the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Change is under way, to better connect the dots between the cultural, humanitarian and military concerns that are so deeply intertwined in current crises.</p> <p>When I went to Timbuktu in 2012, immediately after the liberation of the city, I promised we would rebuild the mausoleums, and we did. I returned last year to celebrate the completion of this task with the local masons and the imam of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/27/timbuktu-djinguereber-mosque-history-cities-buildings\">Djinguereber mosque</a>. I saw the joy of people reclaiming their heritage, and I am more convinced than ever of the role of culture in healing the wounds of war, and as a building block of sustainable peace.</p> <p>A decade ago, such opinions might have been considered dangerously naive. But when extremists pay so much attention to the harm communities suffer when heritage is destroyed, they show us how much power culture holds to heal and recover when it is preserved.</p> <p>Let us act on this understanding \u2013 and rise to the unprecedented challenges we face \u2013 with stronger programmes and increased resources. We need far closer cooperation at the highest level on education to counter extremism, and far stronger commitment to protect heritage under attack.</p> <p>While we are appalled by the loss of cultural heritage, we must take heart from the judgment of The Hague, which exhorts us to strengthen our resolve and take action to ensure justice prevails \u2013 in Mali and across the world.</p>",

But that need not be a problem. Most of them have always had other jobs, or are married to, or live with, people who make a living. Perhaps only twice in the last years of the 19th century, with the boom in universal literacy, and in the last years of the 20th century with the revolution in bookselling, has it been possible. But that boom is well and truly over. It doesn't make much different to the author whether the book is sold in paper or as an e-book. The problem is that the overall number is down, for the simple reason that there is so much competition for people's attention. For instance, I have at least 30 boxsets which friends of mine have told me are the greatest things ever shown or made. Because I still read books, I will never have the time to see any of them. Other people choose differently. </p> <p>But on the plus side, people can now publish their own books for very little money and call themselves a published writer. I'm sure that in future the market will find a way of distributing and promoting those books if they feel, as in the case of Fifty Shades of Grey, they can make a lot of money out of them. The best way to encourage new writing is to make sure that children and young people are exposed all the time to good old writing. This should happen at school and at home but there are also great enterprises like First Story, which do their best to encourage.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebbc0fe4b0757c5291924b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:49:18.691Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">&quot;The 20th century has proved far bloodier than most of us foresaw&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16766445\">Anna Page</a> asks:</p> <p><em>I have just finished Where My Heart Used to Beat for a book club.

I could see very little myself, but quite a lot of people have said this to me, so perhaps there is something that I am not aware of. I think it may lie in the fact that the main character does at least finally understand who he is and where he has come from. My fear is that many of the wars so far this century are still related to the first world war, and the reordering of the great empires, particularly in the Middle East. My second fear is that some of them have a religious element, and the last thing war needs is an irrational fury. On the other hand there is far greater international communication and co-operation through the UN, Nato and the EU. In the catastrophic months leading up to August 1914, our foreign secretary never left London. That level of non-communication is now unthinkable. But the aftermath of the 20th century has proved so far much bloodier than most of us foresaw.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:50:05.848Z\">at 1.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebbb10e4b01b56deffc3b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:44:54.546Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12761530\">DreamEcho</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Many years ago, I heard you say there was a musical link between Birdsong and Charlotte Gray.

I was only 39 when I wrote the book, and Stephen is almost 30 by the end, so I wasn't quite a different generation. And he is pretty grown up for his age. It is very interesting to revisit young characters in fiction. I have just read The Catcher in the Rye for the fifth time with roughly eight year intervals, and for the fifth time I see Holden and his story completely differently. I had never really noticed how argumentative, difficult and even violent he is. </p> <p>I am currently finding a voice for a 17-year-old boy with a north African background. Apart from double-checking a few cultural and religious references, I am very much enjoying the liberation of writing in the voice of someone with no knowledge of and no interest in history. In the course of the book, he will encounter people with a different understanding of life but it is fun to write in the person of someone who thinks only about sex and food and where he is going to spend the night.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebb9c0e4b01b56deffc3ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T12:38:44.907Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16765200\">OleksandrOK</a> asks:</p> <p><em>What is your favourite movie?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/sep/26/sebastian-faulks-webchat-where-my-heart-used-to-beat#comment-84217146\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16765623\" title=\"View SebastianFaulks\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16765623\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for SebastianFaulks\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16765623\" title=\"View SebastianFaulks\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">SebastianFaulks</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84217146\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 1:36pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I enjoyed Sideways.

We have not yet recovered from the crimes and misdemeanours of the financial sector that led to the crash, but I think the political focus is now simply on trying to make some of these people pay a fair amount of tax. No progress seems yet to have been made. The idea of a society atomised into small sections, many of which depend on a virtual world \u2013 whether of finance, the internet, religion or psychosis \u2013 still seems to me the characteristic problem. I'm afraid it's much easier for novelists to dramatise than to offer practical solutions. But of course, everything begins with education, and that would be a good place to start.</p> <p>One thing that has changed is that people have lost even more trust in the political class. And we are now a country with an unpopular and unelected leadership, and no formal opposition.

And the research itself will often throw up ideas for incident and character, as well as maybe confirming their facts. For instance, in On Green Dolphin Street, I went to a lot of old-fashioned bars and diners in New York trying to find the atmosphere of the late 50s.

A great deal more has come to light in the years since then, and indeed whole tunnel systems have been discovered on the western front.

A multinational brand putting major marketing money into celebrating the sort of women that you don\u2019t often see celebrated onscreen is incredibly powerful.

  "<p>Leicester City are busy making history again. No other English team have managed to win their first two Champions League matches.

The key to success last time was a solid start and managing to stay ahead for most of the campaign. Leicester have looked far from solid in the league and not just in conceding three goals from first-half corners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">at Manchester United last week</a>. It is already being said \u2013 Claudio Ranieri is asked the question on a weekly basis \u2013 that subconsciously or otherwise Leicester are saving their best efforts for Europe this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/27/riyad-mahrez-champions-league-leicester-porto\">Riyad Mahrez passes Champions League test to show he belongs in the elite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naturally the manager denies it. His stock answer runs along the lines of preparing for every game meticulously and separately. Only when Leicester have finished with a Premier League engagement do they permit themselves to look forward to a European fixture, and vice versa. Leicester take one game at a time, in other words, or at least that is what they are trying to do.</p> <p>Yet not only do results and form suggest they are not succeeding in their aim, Ranieri rather gave the game away at Old Trafford on Saturday by taking Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez off at half-time. Fair enough, at 4-0 down the game was beyond them and the Leicester manager was entitled to husband his resources as best he could with a view to the next game but it is going to be hard convincing players and supporters after that double withdrawal that Leicester\u2019s focus remains on the league, and that they are not moving most of their casino chips on to the square marked European adventure.</p> <p>Leicester are getting carried away by the excitement of Europe. Who wouldn\u2019t, in their position? With the best will in the world, they are unlikely to win the Premier League again. Not this season, not next season, perhaps not ever. Even if Ranieri and his players could keep up the dashing hit-and-run tactics of last season, even if they could somehow retain the element of surprise and stealth, the other teams in the race have all improved and strengthened.</p> <p>Many of them have new managers and massively increased budgets, Manchester City have not just won six league games in a row they have won all 10 of their fixtures under Pep Guardiola. Things have moved on. If Leicester\u2019s success last season was possible only because they were consistently brilliant while the other contenders were dozing or rebuilding, the last part of that equation has altered. City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham, to name four, do not look as if they intend to be caught napping again.</p> <p>Maybe the first part of the equation has changed too. If Leicester are not quite the same force it is perhaps because they know they will not be playing for the same prize. Ranieri will continue to talk a good game, his players will continue to run themselves into the ground on his behalf but lightning will not strike twice.</p> <p>Fairytales are ephemeral things, difficult to repeat on demand. Ranieri appears to understand this. When he talked of \u201ccontinuing the fairytale\u201d he was speaking of the Champions League challenge, not a domestic season already in danger of returning to the mundane. In all probability everyone at Leicester knows deep down that last season is likely to prove a one-off and nothing is going to be as phenomenal or exciting again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Europe, just like last season at home, there are no expectations, Leicester can operate under the radar again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With the possible exception of Europe. Here, at least, Leicester are making footsteps on untrodden ground. Here, just like last season at home, there are no expectations, Leicester can operate under the radar again. After the big adventure reality has returned with a bump in the Premier League but the Champions League still permits big dreams and exciting possibilities.</p> <p>This is not to suggest Leicester are capable of winning the thing. Ask Ranieri about that and he will laugh and say no chance. He spent most of last season responding in exactly the same way to questions about the possibility of Leicester winning the Premier League. Leicester becoming champions is clearly no guarantee of European success. English champions have been failing to terrorise the superpowers of Europe for some years but Leicester have not failed their European audition. They have not fallen at the first hurdle. They look confident and purposeful, and have put themselves in a good position to still be around after Christmas.</p> <p>If they make it to the knockout stage, they appear to have a team perfectly suited to the challenge of winning over two legs. Quick-breaking, compact in defending, usually capable of a goal or two even when pinned back or having to be patient. At least that is what it appears Leicester can do based on the evidence of last season. Based on the evidence of the defeat at United reaching the knockout stage may be a dream too far, unless we are in fact watching two different Leicesters this season. There\u2019s the one at home, who understand that after the goodwill earned last season practically anything short of a dalliance with relegation will not attract too much condemnation this time. Then there\u2019s the one in Europe, the one seeing how far they can go in an intoxicating environment no one imagined a club such as Leicester would ever to be able to sample.</p> <p>Ranieri denies Leicester are picking their matches but he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? He has to, though it doesn\u2019t mean he has any real control over the situation. He\u2019s up against human nature here, always assuming the manager himself isn\u2019t as guilty as his players of subconsciously prioritising the European games. Not many of us without degrees in psychology are capable of understanding or influencing the subconscious mind. As Bertie Wooster once said, when Jeeves had broached the subject: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said off-hand that I had a subconscious mind but I suppose I must have without knowing it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Looking around at our streets, it\u2019s startling when you first notice it: like waking from a dream and forgetting where you are. A moment of disorientation as your eyes make sense of the shadows and see the room for what it is. </p> <p>After that, it\u2019s unmistakable: our streets are not our own. From the parked cars that line the roads to the traffic that speeds along them, in many of our cities we are second-class citizens if we\u2019re not inside a motor vehicle. </p> <p>The incident in which TV presenter Jeremy Vine alleged he had been intimidated and assaulted while riding his bike on a west London road is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/jeremy-vine-near-miss-cyclists-bad-drivers-roads\">not uncommon</a> but it is a reminder of just how deeply we are in thrall to the motor car. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.trl.co.uk/umbraco/custom/report_files/TRL549.pdf\">Research on drivers\u2019 attitudes to cyclists</a> has shown that people in car-centric countries such as the UK sometimes don\u2019t view those on bike and on foot as \u201cproper\u201d road users, and at times treat them as if they shouldn\u2019t be on the road at all. </p> <p>This isn\u2019t the case everywhere: some countries, and their cities, prioritise those who walk and cycle when they design their streets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/oct/22/what-i-learnt-from-a-month-cycling-in-the-netherlands\">Cycling or walking in the Netherlands</a> is a joyful experience \u2013 infrastructure caters for walking and cycling, and drivers respect those outside of cars. </p> <p>Cycling UK\u2019s campaigns and communications coordinator, Sam Jones, believes part of the difference is in attitude: that while people grow up cycling in continental Europe, and continue into old age, \u201cin countries with a problem of car dominance it tends to be younger, or middle-aged people, cycling\u201d.</p> <p>In car-centric countries cycling is often viewed as a sport for young-ish, healthy people (often men), rather than a mode of transport for all demographics, so it\u2019s perhaps not such a stretch to conclude a cycling trip is considered less important than a car trip. Shopkeepers\u2019 resistance to bike lanes on the basis only drivers spend money \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/05/bike-lane-blues-london-local-businesses-cycle-enfield-green-lanes\">also untrue</a> \u2013 is another illustration of this. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb4720c8b73904cd893201a3e8bc2c7e8d2b5f58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb4720c8b73904cd893201a3e8bc2c7e8d2b5f58/0_124_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walkers and cyclists cross the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, where many of the city\u2019s car-centric policies were redrawn under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walkers and cyclists cross the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, where many of the city\u2019s car-centric policies were redrawn under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Cycling UK\u2019s road safety and legal campaigns officer, Duncan Dollimore, puts it, people pass their driving test as teens, and don\u2019t always adapt their driving as roads become busier with more cyclists whose behaviour they may not understand.

It gives them cues\u201d.</p> <p>Cues could be anything from guard rails on pavements giving the impression that \u201cthis is a car space, keep off\u201d, to splayed junctions encouraging people to drive into residential roads at speed. </p> <p>A classic example of how these cues affect our behaviour is the school run. A generation ago, 70% of people in England walked to school; now it is less than half. \u201cPeople walk less and cycle less; that gives an indication that they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d says Platt. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/what-we-do/walk-to-school\">Living Streets\u2019 research</a> suggests the aggressive crush of motor vehicles outside the school gates is the main reason people drive their kids, rather than walking or cycling with them, each day. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/aug/30/bbc-jeremy-vine-alleged-road-rage-incident-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjzn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691410\"            data-video-name=\"BBC\u2019s Jeremy Vine in alleged road rage incident \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Jeremy Vine/Facebook\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5b9ade4b0df5f040dbd9b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/30/160830JeremyVine_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/30/160830JeremyVine.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/30/160830JeremyVine_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/aug/30/bbc-jeremy-vine-alleged-road-rage-incident-video\">BBC\u2019s Jeremy Vine in alleged road rage incident</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Edinburgh is one city that has recognised this, trialling car-free streets outside more than 30 schools in a bid to encourage walking and cycling, and reduce congestion and pollution. The results have not yet been published, but if successful it could usher in permanent \u201cschool zones\u201d and encourage other cities to follow suit. The <a href=\"http://www.arup.com/cities_alive/towards_a_walking_world\">benefits of walking</a> are many and far-reaching, from health to business investment in walkable, and therefore desirable, areas.</p> <p>Narrow escapes can be enough to put people off. Participants of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/24/cycling-near-miss-close-pass-road-rage\">Near Miss Project</a> claimed to experience several close calls with cars on a single day cycling, and project author Rachel Aldred reports a feeling of \u201csystematic disregard\u201d for cyclist safety and comfort from motorists, traffic engineers, designers and policymakers.</p> <p>We get what we plan for. A key underlying aim of street schemes is often smooth traffic flow. Even if an engineer wants to prioritise those on foot or bike over motor traffic, it disrupts planners\u2019 computer models, making such change difficult if not impossible. </p> <p>This gives us a walking and cycling infrastructure that is often meaningless. For instance: pavement cycle lanes that are simultaneously inconvenient for cyclists and intimidating for those on foot, or three-stage pedestrian crossings that only suit those quick enough to cross before traffic gets the green light again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0727f4113729613ee8dd59ee46ba592fa00086ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0727f4113729613ee8dd59ee46ba592fa00086ec/0_0_4295_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cyclist in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cyclist in New York.

And pick any street where they have built an actual protected bike lane. If you\u2019re just walking down that street, it makes a huge difference when cars aren\u2019t encroaching on every inch of the space.

In a city where <a href=\"http://www.nycedc.com/blog-entry/new-yorkers-and-cars\">less than 50% of households own a car</a> Bloomberg tried to introduce congestion charging but the idea died in the state capital, Albany, where many more people drive.</p> <p>Much of America\u2019s car-centric thinking goes back to the early days of the motoring in the country, and has much to do with how we view and talk about different road users today. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5155b1776c459e4aa3d955ae6577305c2384b0c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5155b1776c459e4aa3d955ae6577305c2384b0c1/549_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling lane\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Weiss says: \u201cWhen cars started to take over every city in America, people were getting creamed out there. Cities were trying to impose speed limits or ban cars, and the auto industry weren\u2019t having it. </p> <p>\u201cPart of what they did was a <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96088281/1913-09-05/ed-1/seq-3/\">propaganda campaign depicting a \u2018jaywalker\u2019</a>, which I guess back then was slang for idiot. So they came up with this idea of a Jaywalker, this hapless moron who walks into traffic and gets hit, and it\u2019s his or her fault. Now it\u2019s part of our language.\u201d It\u2019s now illegal to \u201cjaywalk\u201d in the US.</p> <p>\u201cNow we have this thing in this country where the road doesn\u2019t belong to you.

I guess we have the auto industry to thank for that, they did a great job making it possible for you to drive at all times with no consequences.\u201d </p> <p>Many believe this language is key when it comes to prosecution of dangerous drivers, or lack thereof. \u201cThere is still the automatic victim blaming and lack of investigation on the part of police when a pedestrian or cyclist gets hit by a driver,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cIt\u2019s enough for the driver to say, \u2018They came out of nowhere\u2019. The police tell reporters, \u2018It looks like the cyclist ran the light\u2019, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not all down to police, though. \u201cThere\u2019s so much working against all of these people. After all these years, the attitude is, \u2018Call it an accident, let the civil courts take care of it\u2019. So your only recourse if you get hit by a driver is to hope that driver has insurance and file a civil suit, get some kind of settlement. </p> <p>\u201cThat is the problem and that is the thing that\u2019s not really changing, that\u2019s why with the advocates there has been this big push to stop using the word \u2018accident\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Attempts to \u201ceducate\u201d or tackle the problem by focusing on the vulnerable road user is another symptom of that bias but, as Living Streets\u2019 Platt puts it: \u201cIf we want to make streets safer we need to tackle the source of the problem.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cPeople will always make mistakes,\u201d says Platt. \u201cWe need to reduce speeds, rather than making campaigns that tell people to be careful.

Toronto is in the early stages, and its growing pains are familiar.

Now, improved bike lanes and bike boxes, which give cyclists a visible refuge at traffic lights, are being introduced. The city is growing fast and, like in London, planners have recognised cycling as an efficient way to relieve pressure on full-capacity infrastructure.</p> <p>Toronto resident Phillip Cates believes the city\u2019s early bike lanes created \u201cdangerous road conditions for cyclists and angered motorists\u201d. Although the later iterations, he says, are improvements, as with most North American cities the car-centric culture, wide, straight roads and big cars are still at odds with safe cycling and walking.

With assets half the size of the German economy it is regarded as the bank that poses the biggest risk to global financial stability.</p> <p>Shares in Deutsche Bank have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/deutsche-bank-shares-fall-to-new-low-after-another-turbulent-day\">plunged to near-30-year lows this week </a>amid reports \u2013 which were then denied \u2013 that it had asked for German government intervention to help reduce the punishment from the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Their decline was arrested on Wednesday, when the bank sold a UK insurance company for \u20ac1bn; they closed 2% higher at \u20ac10.76.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/deutsche-bank-how-did-a-beast-of-the-banking-world-get-into-this-mess\">Deutsche Bank: how did a beast of the banking world get into this mess?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thiam told a Bloomberg conference that Europe\u2019s banks were in a \u201cvery fragile situation\u201d and said there was doubt that European banks still had a viable business model. Concerns about rock-bottom interest rates and how much capital banks should hold meant returns to investors were too low, making banks \u201cnot really investable\u201d.</p> <p>Credit Suisse is among a number of other banks, including Barclays, facing a penalty from the DoJ.</p> <p>Fears that Deutsche Bank might have to tap its investors for cash are among the reasons its shares have plunged, and raised fears that it could present a Lehman Brothers-style moment for the markets. However, top bankers and policymakers all played down the prospects of a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/13/lehman-brothers-collapse-five-years-later-shiver-spine\">collapse of Lehman in 2008</a>.</p> <p>John Cryan, the Briton who has run Deutsche Bank for 15 months, spoke out to insist he had not asked Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, for help in dealing with the DoJ in an attempt to arrest the decline in the bank\u2019s shares.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point did I ask the chancellor for support. Neither did I suggest anything like that,\u201d he said. Such a request would be \u201cout of the question\u201d and he could not understand how \u201canyone could claim that\u201d. The claims were raised last week in a German magazine.</p> <p>Within hours of his remarks to Bild newspaper a report in Die Zeit set out a two-stage plan being prepared by Merkel\u2019s government for the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d, under which the DoJ settlement is not reduced and Germany\u2019s biggest lender fails to raise enough capital.</p> <p>In an article to be published on Thursday, Die Zeit claims that the first stage would involve attempting to find a solution, with Deutsche Bank selling parts of its business to a German or foreign company, and the state issuing guarantees for potential losses.</p> <p>The second stage, which would only apply if such a private solution were to fail, would involve a state-backed bailout. </p> <p>According to Die Zeit, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25%\u201d of the bank. This might facilitate a merger with Commerzbank, which is 15% state owned.</p> <p>The reportwas denied by the German finance ministry and financial regulator. Martin J\u00e4ger, a spokesman for the German finance ministry, said: \u201cThe German government is not preparing a rescue plan and there is no reason for such speculations.\u201d</p> <p>Cryan gave the interview as Deutsche Bank sold its Abbey Life insurance business, with 735,000 UK policyholders, for \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m). This will generate an \u20ac800m loss for the German bank, but improve its financial strength by making it smaller.</p> <p>The bank also told its staff that it was not planning to raise capital or in need of state aid, although speculation about possible options for its future included a bid from a new Turkish national wealth fund. Bloomberg reported that Yi\u011fit Bulut, a chief adviser to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had suggested Germany\u2019s largest lender should be made into a Turkish bank.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund which has ranked Deutsche Bank as the world\u2019s riskiest bank, said state help was not needed. Speaking to CNBC, Lagarde said: \u201cI don\u2019t see that particular institution as ... at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. I would hope that the right measures are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened.\u201d</p> <p>Axel Weber, the chairman of UBS and former president of the German Bundesbank, said fears of a rerun of the 2008 banking collapse were misplaced. He said banks had between seven and 10 times more capital than eight years ago. The deputy Bank of England governor Minouche Shafik also played down any comparison.</p> <p>Weber told Bloomberg TV: \u201cThere is a much more stable system. In my view the system is much more stable now. I think we are very far in how solid banks are now, from where were in 2007 and 2008.\u201d </p> <p></p>",

Young voters historically have low turnout rates and campaign strategists prefer to focus on the people who will show up to the polls. But now, millennials<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/\"> have pushed out</a> baby boomers to become the largest single voting bloc in the US.</p> <p>That\u2019s why you simply can\u2019t keep alienating young Americans if you want to get elected. It might not hurt you this election cycle \u2013 but if you don\u2019t find a way to connect with this demographic, eventually they will run you out of office.</p> <p>Barack Obama benefited from an unprecedented turnout among millennial voters in 2008. Beyond being a history-making candidate, Obama talked about issues young voters care about. Then Senator Obama brought into the forefront things like unemployment (remember how millennials took the brunt of<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-23/four-ways-millennials-are-still-scarred-from-the-recession\"> the recession</a>) and government transparency. His failure to follow through on some of those issues contributed in part to the<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/im-millennial-and-im-disappointed-obama/\"> enthusiasm gap</a> of 2012.<br></p> <p>Who else has resonated strongly with twentysomethings? You don\u2019t have to look farther than this past primary cycle. Senator Bernie Sanders connected with young voters in a way no one else has this year. Sanders spoke about a number of \u201cpain points\u201d that millennials are feeling, including student debt, under-employment and a government they believe serves interests instead of people.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean that politicians need to embrace the democratic socialist solutions that the Vermont senator championed. But it does demonstrate that millennials are just waiting for a politician to speak up about the problems they face on a daily basis. </p> <p>At the very least, candidates need to make an effort to address these very real \u2013 and growing \u2013 issues. The problems with our education system aren\u2019t clearing up any time soon. While employment has improved, many millennials continue to<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/millennials-buying-home-distant-dream-140000668.html\"> lag behind</a> their parents\u2019 prosperity. They are waiting longer for kids, mortgages and even personal purchases, due to under-employment.</p> <p>Yet winning them over doesn\u2019t just mean nailing the big ticket issues. Young voters have a number of defining characteristics that shape their voting habits. These are often missed, as there are a lot of misconceptions about this generation. For example, the media often labels<a href=\"http://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/\"> millennials as selfish</a>.

Across the board young voters overwhelmingly believe in equality for everyone. And guess what kind of politician these young voters want to represent them? Someone who shares those same values.</p> <p>Millennials need a reason to show up to the polls: so give them one. Down-ballot candidates have a genuine opportunity to make inroads with this demographic. You can show commitment to the community you represent, or work for greater transparency in local government or break down hurdles for first-time small business owners. Often times state representatives and city council members have more chances to impact these issues than our presidential candidates.</p> <p>And don\u2019t forget to show up. Be present. Not just in Washington DC, or the state house, or at your party meetings \u2013 go to where these voters are. Visit your local shelters where millennials are<a href=\"http://www.today.com/news/do-you-give-time-or-money-nbc-poll-finds-millennials-t58736\"> helping out</a>.

You won\u2019t find many millennial voters sitting in your office\u2019s waiting room: they\u2019re out there in the community making a difference.</p> <p>It\u2019s way past time to start listening to millennials. Before asking for their vote, why not ask what they care about and begin tailoring your focus to that? It\u2019s a good idea to start now, because every year this generation will become more likely to show up and vote. Don\u2019t you want to make sure it will be for you?</p>",
  "<h2>Myth 1: You can\u2019t predict how slum populations are going to grow<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <p><strong> </strong>\u201cOne thing that is poorly understood is population growth in Africa,\u201d says William Cobbett, director of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.citiesalliance.org/\">Cities Alliance</a> <strong tabindex=\"-1\">.</strong> \u201cIt is thought that populations are growing mainly because of urban migration. That\u2019s not correct. Across the continent, the bulk of population growth comes from natural population growth. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/Key_Findings_WPP_2015.pdf\">Undesa figures</a><strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>from 1950-2050 show that in the case of Uganda \u2013 the outlier \u2013 its population in one century will multiply 20 times. That has never happened in human history.\u201d Tanzania will grow 18 times and Nigeria 10.5.</p> <p>\u201cMost local authorities don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with this, so there is no forward planning to make provisions for this population growth, which we know is going to happen.\u201d </p> <p> His organisation is trying to combat the mindset that you can\u2019t plan for increased slum population, by supporting the creation of municipal development forums in a number of Ugandan cities. These are structured discussions where the local authority, local private sector companies and slum dwellers meet and deliberate about the future of the city. </p> <p>Having the capacity to plan for future slum populations isn\u2019t just a problem limited to Africa though. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09ea536ac455e2e3b35cf4d01d8999d4491d71a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ea536ac455e2e3b35cf4d01d8999d4491d71a3/0_214_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cable cars travel over the Complexo do Alemao slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cable cars travel over the Complexo do Alemao slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Population explosions in many developing countries mean by 2030, 3 billion people \u2013 roughly <a href=\"http://unhabitat.org/urban-themes/housing-slum-upgrading/\">40% of the world\u2019s population</a> \u2013 will need proper housing, according to <a href=\"http://unhabitat.org/\">UN-Habitat</a>.</p> <p>The fact that slums exist in the first place is just evidence of places where urban planners and governments have already failed to keep up with the demand for homes.</p> <h2>Myth 2: Slum residents would always rather live in formal housing <br> </h2> <p>The bulldozing of slums and the eviction of their residents used to be seen as a good thing. Why would people want to live in squalid, overcrowded spaces with no access to municipal services like water or waste collection? These places were a blight on cities so, if offered an alternative, people would jump at the chance to leave them, right?<br></p> <p>Actually, no \u2013 especially as traditionally poor planning has sometimes not only left former slum residents in worse housing situations, but crucially also cut off from their old support network.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef2d173bdabfc06f4cd71cf0b4a3f395b09d6f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef2d173bdabfc06f4cd71cf0b4a3f395b09d6f7a/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of Africa\u2019s largest slum, Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2008\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of Africa\u2019s largest slum, Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2008<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Halden Krog/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The social upheaval that can come with moving people out of improvised housing and into apartment blocks is well documented. Kenyan slum Kibera is a case in point, with reports of locals regretting making the move from <a href=\"https://www.one.org/international/blog/why-residents-of-kibera-slum-are-rejecting-new-housing-plans/\">their shacks to hi-rise blocks</a>. Originally excited about the opportunity of moving to a complex nicknamed The Promised Land, some ended up moving out of the flats following water shortages while others saw a business opportunity renting out their new homes to middle-class Kenyans at several times the subsidised rate. Those who stayed still shop in the slum, where food is cheaper.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The importance of proper planning is a logistical nightmare across Latin America too. Delicate social structures can be torn down faster than the shacks the communities lived in. Claudio Acioly Jr, head of capacity development at UN-Habitat, says many delicate human factors are often overlooked: \u201cFor example, in Brazil, the number of women-headed households is enormous and there is a rich network of informal arrangements. So when you move them, you move the location of the school and remove their arrangements for someone to look after the house and kids while they\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>Poor planning puts extra pressures on residents. \u201cIn Mexico, where the slums were 7km away from the city centre, the housing scheme was 37km away.\u201d Nearly 5m housing units were unoccupied 10 years on, he says. \u201c[Residents moved out] because they found they had to take two methods of transport to get to work and they\u2019re in a housing estate without any shops, in the middle of nowhere.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Myth 3: Slums should be treated differently to the rest of a city<br></strong></h2> <p>Slums are part of the fabric of many cities and many have mighty populations. The informal areas in Cairo are a good example of this. They have among the biggest populations in the region and are given names such as \u2018The City of The Dead\u2019. Out of a population of 90 million people, the Housing and Land Rights Network says at least <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.madamasr.com/news/greater-cairo-40-percent-live-informal-housing\">30% of Greater Cairo\u2019s residents</a> live in slums. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd9fbcc50c6367f57d0993ca6cedc0ccee313cfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd9fbcc50c6367f57d0993ca6cedc0ccee313cfd/0_256_4101_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The City of the Dead\u2019 in Cairo, Egypt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The City of the Dead\u2019 in Cairo, Egypt<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ahmed Mansour of the <a href=\"http://www.hlrn.org/\">Housing and Land Rights Network</a> argues that a holistic approach is needed: \u201cFor decades, Egypt has been facing a housing crisis that governments have mismanaged and the private sector has exploited. </p> <p>\u201cThe problems within slums or informal areas cannot be treated in isolation from the rest of the city since they show structural inequalities that should be tackled integrally.\u201d </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://www.citiesalliance.org/About-slum-upgrading\">slum upgrading</a> could help, as the philosophy behind the urban renewal strategy is to gradually improve informal settlements, formalising and incorporating them into cities so residents have the same rights as everyone else there. Projects vary from place to place but the idea is to provide more durable housing, increase residents\u2019 rights and connect them to infrastructure and services that other citizens have such as access to clean water.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>Myth 4: It\u2019s possible to discourage people from moving into slums<br></strong></h2> <p>Alongside population growth, urbanisation is also driving slum growth \u2013 people moving to cities to find work. Here, India is a good example \u2013 the slum situation there is so vast that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to build <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-23/modi-seeks-to-replace-crowded-india-slums-with-20-million-homes\">20 million homes</a>.

Do its similarities and differences hold clues about how it, and therefore we, were formed?</p> <p>However, this is where the risk and the fear of failure lies. Despite what you might think from the news stories, water is no guarantee of life. Water is certainly a prerequisite on Earth and there are good scientific reasons for believing water may be essential for life of any description, but there is no guarantee that a watery celestial body will automatically play host to microbes.</p> <p>Perhaps this is the reason that Nasa has seemed strangely reluctant to take the next step of actually looking for life.

With their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/curiosity-rover\" title=\"\">Mars Curiosity rover</a> in 2012, they specifically did not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/aug/05/curiosity-rover-nasa-life-mars\" title=\"\">put any life-detecting equipment</a> on board.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/sep/03/nasa-releases-first-close-up-images-jupiter-juno-spacecraft-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xn9q\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2693924\"            data-video-name=\"Nasa releases first close-up images of Jupiter taken by Juno spacecraft  \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Nasa\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57caacc2e4b0456abb93d78e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/03/160903jupiter_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/03/160903jupiter.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/03/160903jupiter_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/sep/03/nasa-releases-first-close-up-images-jupiter-juno-spacecraft-video\">Nasa releases first close-up images of Jupiter taken by Juno spacecraft</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Monday\u2019s Europa announcement offers the potential to really look for life, yet again Nasa seems to be shying away. Scientists said they had seen what looks like geysers shooting water into space from Europa, which has long been known to contain a global ocean. Scientists have repeatedly speculated that microbial life might be found underneath this moon\u2019s ice surface and have spent decades wondering how to get below the ice to look for it. Now that the water is jetting into space, nature is doing all the hard work. A craft could fly through those plumes, sample the water and look for life.</p> <p>By a piece of cosmic good fortune, Nasa is planning a mission to Europa. Yet the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/jupiter-europa-water-plumes-nasa\" title=\"\">using that mission to look for the evidence of life in those plumes was virtually dismissed</a>. \u201cThe Europa flyby is not a life-finding mission,\u201d said programme scientist Curt Niebur. \u201cThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eceaf72def8118c191a9babac3a426b3b057a63b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eceaf72def8118c191a9babac3a426b3b057a63b/162_65_1477_1648/896.jpg\" alt=\"Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.\" width=\"896\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is time for vision and commitment.\u2019 Nasa image of Europa shows suspected plumes of water vapour erupting at the bottom left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA, ESA, W. Sparks (STScI), an/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This makes no sense. What better way is there to determine Europa\u2019s habitability than to look for life?</p> <p>Nasa was not always this timid. In the 1970s it sent two landers to the surface of Mars. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/datablog/2016/jul/23/forty-years-of-missions-to-mars\" title=\"\">Viking missions</a> carried experiments to look for life. The results were deemed inconclusive and then simply not followed up. This could have been a mistake. A recent re-analysis of the data suggested that, while the results fell short of a clear detection of Martian life, there were enough positive indicators to warrant a follow-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/stephen-hawking-light-years-dangerous-aliens\">Why Stephen Hawking is light years from the truth about \u2018dangerous aliens\u2019 | Seth Shostak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps in response, Nasa has now quietly stated that its next Mars rover in 2020 will also look for life. But at least the European Space Agency is proving bolder. In 2020 it plans to launch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/13/exomars-giant-nose-life-on-mars-prepares-launch\" title=\"\">ExoMars rover to Mars</a> that will carry a suite of instruments capable of looking for the evidence of life, either past or present. That search should now be extended to Europa.</p> <p>There is admirable scientific caution, and there is ducking the challenge. To go to Europa now without the ability to look for life is the latter. It is time for vision and commitment: discovering life on another planet would send shockwaves through science and fundamentally transform our understanding of our place in the universe: we must step up the search.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to infrastructure development in developing countries, there are projects that instantly appeal \u2013 like hospitals. Or schools. And then there are those that are a much harder sell; sewers, for example, or prisons. </p> <p>But the world\u2019s prisons are home to an <a href=\"https://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PRI-Prisons-global-trends-report-LR.pdf\">estimated 10 million people globally</a> (pdf) and this number is rising. The world\u2019s prison population has gone up 10% since 2004, and in some countries, such as Indonesia, the increase has been as high as 183%. </p> <p>These people are not necessarily hardened criminals. Around a third of prisoners globally haven\u2019t even been found guilty \u2013 they are on pre-trial detention. They are likely to be drawn disproportionately from the poorest and most marginalised groups in society, and in some places there are even <a href=\"https://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PRI-Prisons-global-trends-report-LR.pdf\">children living in prisons with their parents</a> (pdf) in their thousands. In developing countries, they are typically crammed into buildings that are old and uncared for, neglect that leads to tragedies like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/16/honduras-prison-fire-victims-identified\">fire in 2012</a> that killed over 300 prisoners in Honduras. </p> <p>There are many issues of concern when working with prison populations such as access to legal services, prevention of torture and justice system efficiency. But also key is the design and construction of the buildings where prisoners will spend their time: the prison itself. So what makes a good prison, and why is it is so important to get the design right? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c585f822450926271ddade9c4567a60066313726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c585f822450926271ddade9c4567a60066313726/0_95_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wearing their distinctive pink uniforms, people suspected of involvement in Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide line up before re-entering Kigali\u2019s central prison from a day at work in the fields next to the prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wearing their distinctive pink uniforms, people suspected of involvement in Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide line up before re-entering Kigali\u2019s central prison from a day at work in the fields next to the prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karel Prinsloo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isabel Hight has spent over 35 years advising on prison development and management in East Timor, Liberia, Sudan, Rwanda, Afghanistan and Congo for organisations like the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Having recently retired, below she reflects on her work. </p> <p><strong>Why is the architectural design of prisons so important from a human rights and humane treatment perspective? </strong> </p> <p>Architecture sends a silent message to everyone walking into any place. It tells you what to expect and where the limits of behaviour are. Prisons are the same. In my view, design is crucial to creating an environment in which prisoners can live and not become institutionalised. This means providing spaces for staying in contact with families, work, education, and playing sport. </p> <p><strong>How easy is it to persuade governments in developing countries to build well-designed prisons? </strong> </p> <p>Governments generally recognise the need, but hospitals or schools often take priority. They can be receptive to donor funding of new prisons. But large scale imprisonment is primarily a western concept and donors can be tempted to build prisons similar to those in their own countries. Historically colonial powers such as the Belgians, French and British built prisons that were essentially replicas of what they had back home. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a3c0e8067ff76e58041fad67343283deff05003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3c0e8067ff76e58041fad67343283deff05003/0_150_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prisons, inspired by ninenteenth century prison architecture, can be found around the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prisons, inspired by nineteenth century prison architecture, can be found around the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is this what you see on the ground? Why are these prisons so problematic? </strong> </p> <p>Yes, in Africa, for example, if you are familiar with nineteenth century British prisons you can recognise instantly similar layouts in former British colonies. Large, two to three storey buildings, long corridors, rather like you see on [the BBC series] Porridge. These prisons, designed based on outdated ideas about incarceration and now very decrepit, are still in use \u2013 and their limitations made worse by overcrowding. Living spaces built for 20 but holding two or three times that number are not unusual. </p> <p><strong>Why is it important to take local cultural values into consideration?</strong></p> <p>What it comes back to is the purpose of imprisonment. If you want prisoners to lead a more law abiding life when they leave, for example, then it\u2019s essential to design buildings so they can keep up with social practices and community life. This means factors like eating arrangements \u2013 do you sit and eat communally, do you eat in isolation in your cell? To eat alone is socially unusual in most communities, and can be quite alienating and institutionalising. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ef4ae88f3a6e8dd26228e04dc94ff2796e905cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ef4ae88f3a6e8dd26228e04dc94ff2796e905cc/0_1_3168_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congolese inmate displays her voter card in a detention cell in Geti prison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congolese inmate displays her voter card in a detention cell in Geti prison.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Akena/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is developed countries using a design from home still an issue? </strong></p> <p>Yes, this is still a challenge. A prison I know of in Asia was built based on the design of a European high security prison \u2013 it\u2019s single cell and without heating. You can\u2019t have a prison in that particular place without heating and single cells were alien to staff and prisoners. Prisons like that are under-used or abandoned.</p> <p><strong>What do design teams and architects need to think about initially? </strong> </p> <p>Choosing the location is the first issue. Prisons need to be where people are, near large population centres: prisons need staff; prisoners need to attend courts, lawyers need to see their clients; prisons depend on community services ranging from rubbish collection to health services; families need to visit. </p> <p><strong>What sort of thing typically goes wrong when a prison is badly designed? </strong> </p> <p>Inadequate water supply is a common problem. I know of prisons that have been built where the water is, say, a kilometre away and that wasn\u2019t factored into the costing so the prison is really unusable. It\u2019s a similar story with electricity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"843823951862addad27a0d78e2dabed7c4d2be29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/843823951862addad27a0d78e2dabed7c4d2be29/0_80_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s wing of Pul-e-Charkhi prison on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan.

If the kitchen isn\u2019t working, for example, prisoners will organise supplies from outside, and start cooking in unsuitable places like sleeping areas. This creates problems with hygiene and vermin. And like anything limited in prisons, food can become currency. It will be controlled by prisoners or the staff and that can lead to abuse and corruption.</p> <p><strong>How does architecture impact the mental health of prisoners?</strong></p> <p>It varies. What we do know is that very restricted environments where prisoners are isolated from staff and each other quickly have a negative impact on everyone. It\u2019s really best to design the flow of movement of staff and prisoners so there is contact between them. Providing activities also helps. In some prisons I know of, companies have supported workshops in prisons, and prisoners can then go on to work for them once released. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2371b7250795bc225f32b080e11fc179d50e0a23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2371b7250795bc225f32b080e11fc179d50e0a23/0_31_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colonel Abdull Wahed, logistical director of Pol-i Charkhy\u2019s prison, smokes a cigarette as a prison cook prepares lunch for more than 300 prisoners at the jail in Kabul, Afghanistan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colonel Abdull Wahed, logistical director of Pol-i Charkhy\u2019s prison, smokes a cigarette as a prison cook prepares lunch for more than 300 prisoners at the jail in Kabul, Afghanistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You must have seen some very disturbing things in your career ...</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve seen the very best of conditions, some awful conditions and much in between.

But in most places the staff are doing the best they can. Doing harm is not what drives them. Of course repressive regimes, and prisons designed to do harm, exist. But where repression is not the intent, poor conditions and treatment are usually the result of a lack of know how and resources. Attitudes to prison design have also changed since I started my career because of the greater possibility of travel.

The headset weighs little and is easy to put on, much due to the integrated headphones and software service. <br></p> <p>That said, it doesn\u2019t fit my head. If I tighten it even a little it will hurt after half an hour or so, and without tightening it slides down my nose so things go blurry. I\u2019ve tried adjusting it according to the setup guide but I\u2019m suspecting the hard frame and narrow top band might be giving me issues. The headphones are open backed and don\u2019t close out other audio, I can hear my PC whirring in the background.</p> <p>I think this is a well made product for a first consumer version, very polished in most areas. I would suggest trying to find a demo in a store before purchase though. It might or might not fit your face/head/glasses.

And that must include educating our people, especially our students and young people, about what we all can and must do to implement solutions to the climate crisis, including the deployment of clean energy and the expansion of energy efficiency. The US must demonstrate how people working together can achieve even greater carbon pollution reductions, grow our economies and create jobs.</p> <p>There is a trove of science behind climate change but there is still much more to learn, especially about the consequences of climate change. It is time we began to learn together, as families, as communities and as a country. If only because we are truly in this together.</p>",

Collectors from neighbouring Ecuador or Colombia often use small private aircraft to transport animals out of the country, he alleged. </p> <p>Local traffickers buy animals from ribere\u00f1os, poor riverside dwellers, as they come to market in Bel\u00e9n. In secret locations large numbers of tortoises, terrapins or parrots are stored for potential clients, he said. He alleged police officers can be bribed for a small quantity of animals, and documents permitting animals to be transported out of Peru can be bought from corrupt officials. </p> <p>Airport security makes it harder to traffic animals by plane so most are taken upriver along the Amazon to Pucallpa, capital of the neigbouring Ucayali region, and from there by road to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast.</p> <p>No one has ever been jailed for wildlife trafficking in Peru, confirmed Yovana Murillo of the <a href=\"https://peru.wcs.org/en-us/home.aspx\">Wildlife Conservation Society Peru</a>.</p> <p>Responding to allegations of corruption in the regional government, Rengifo said public servants were very badly paid which \u201csometimes led to criminal acts\u201d. Enforcement in this trafficking hub compared unfavourably with other Amazon regions. Between January and July 2016, Loreto had seized only 447 live animals around a third of the 1,478 live animals confiscated in neighbouring San Martin region in a similar period (January and August 2016), according to Peru\u2019s environmental police records. </p> <p>The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has identified 383 animal species being trafficked in Peru over the last decade on well-run routes from more than 40 markets in 10 cities including the capital Lima. Supplied by Iquitos and other Amazon cities, parrots or monkeys are often seized at border crossings. But an estimated nine out of 10 trafficked animals die en route, says Murillo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83fb82247ead2fbe7f660c5d0d945ab3b93e160f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83fb82247ead2fbe7f660c5d0d945ab3b93e160f/0_351_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bald-headed uakari monkey grooms Gudrun Sperrer, founder of the Pilpintuwasi Animal Orphanage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bald-headed Uakari monkey grooms Gudrun Sperrer, founder of the Pilpintuwasi Animal Orphanage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Collyns/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If they are lucky, rescued monkeys will be taken to <a href=\"http://www.amazonanimalorphanage.org/\">Pilpintuwasi Butterfly Farm and Animal Orphanage</a>. Its Austrian owner Gudrun Sperrer, 55, began rescuing animals in Loreto 35 years ago. It is the first places to successfully breed threatened crimson-faced bald uakaris in captivity. The monkeys only live in a small part of the Amazon basin in Peru and Brazil. </p> <p>Wildlife trafficking has always been rife in Loreto, says Sperrer, but it is getting worse. Traffickers are deliberately encouraging hunters in the village near her refuge to target monkeys with babies, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe idea is \u2018you can eat the mother and sell me the baby\u2019. That will mean future generations are already dead,\u201d she said despondently. Increasing numbers of well-meaning tourists who buy baby animals thinking they can rescue them had worsened the situation, she added.</p> <p>But even the people employed to protect wildlife were involved, she alleged. \u201cIf they\u2019re told: \u2018We\u2019re going to take this monkey to a zoo where it\u2019s being taken care of, where we have the money to study the species\u2019, they make papers, they sign papers that are fake.\u201d</p>",

The suspect transfers were kicked into the longest of Zurich grass.</p> <p>All of which led to the unusual situation of the FA in 2016, off the back of a woeful showing in France and a defeat against Iceland, appointing as manager a man who effectively had those outstanding questions still hanging over his head.</p> <p>Along with Allardyce, others implicated by Panorama also threatened to sue.

As co-author Jessika Trancik noted,</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>One goal of the work is to translate climate mitigation scenarios to the level of individual decision-makers who will ultimately be the ones to decide whether or not a clean energy transition occurs (in a market economy, at least). In the case of transportation, private citizens are key decision-makers. </em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>How can electric cars already be the cheapest?</strong></h2> <p>The study used average US fuel and electricity prices over the decade of 2004\u20132013 (<em>e.g.</em> $3.14 per gallon of gasoline and 12 cents per kilowatt-hour), and the app allows consumers to test different fuel costs. The lifetime of a car is estimated at 14 years and about 170,000 miles. As co-author Marco Miotti explained,</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>We use parameters that reflect the U.S. consumer experience when going to buy a new car.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As the chart in the lower right corner of the above figure shows, when only accounting for the vehicle purchase cost, gasoline-powered cars are the cheapest. However, hybrid and electric vehicles have lower fuel and regular maintenance costs. In the US, there are also federal rebates that bring the consumer costs down further yet, so the cheapest electric cars (in cost per distance driven) cost less than the cheapest gasoline cars. When including state tax rebates like in California, electric cars are by far the best deal available.</p> <p>Some might object that it\u2019s unfair to include tax rebates, and the MIT app allows for a comparison with or without those rebates. However, as Trancik noted, the app is aimed at consumers, and for them the rebates are a reality. Moreover, the cost of gasoline in the USA does not reflect the costs inflicted by its carbon pollution via climate change. Over the lifetime of the car, the electric car tax rebates roughly offset the gasoline<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/carbon-the-huge-overlooked-fossil-fuel-subsidy.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/carbon-the-huge-overlooked-fossil-fuel-subsidy.html\">carbon pollution subsidy</a>.

However, if we\u2019re going to stay below the internationally-accepted<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/monckton-myth-5-dangerous-warming.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/monckton-myth-5-dangerous-warming.html\">\u2018danger limit\u2019 of 2\u00b0C</a> global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, the US needs to achieve about an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. As co-author Geoffrey Supran noted,</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The bottom line is that meeting long-term targets requires simultaneous and comprehensive vehicle electrification and grid decarbonization. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>The good news is that we already have the necessary technology available today. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016112\">Another recent study from MIT\u2019s Trancik Lab</a> found that today\u2019s lowest-cost electric vehicles meet the daily range requirements of 87% of cars on the road, even if they can only recharge once a day. And the technology is quickly advancing;<a href=\"http://www.chevrolet.com/bolt-ev-electric-vehicle.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.chevrolet.com/bolt-ev-electric-vehicle.html\">Chevrolet</a> and<a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/model3\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/model3\">Tesla</a> will soon release electric cars with 200 mile-per-charge range and before-rebate prices under $40,000. <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/solar-low-price-record-68db04b796b3#.18q2dcr0a\"> </a><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/solar-low-price-record-68db04b796b3#.18q2dcr0a\">Solar</a> and<a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/18/us-wind-energy-prices-rock-bottom-levels-berkeley-lab/\"> </a><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/18/us-wind-energy-prices-rock-bottom-levels-berkeley-lab/\">wind</a> energy prices continue to fall rapidly as well, as we progress toward a \u201c<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/why-the-renewables-revolution-is-now-unstoppable-698f8d08cf4c#.9i9sjrcue\">renewable energy revolution</a>.\u201d</p> <p>In short, to avoid dangerous climate change we need to transition to electric cars that are fueled by low-carbon electricity sources.

Despite serving as the undercard to two classic finals, the games failed to fire the public imagination \u2013 perhaps understandably, given that the teams\u2019 fans weren\u2019t actually in town.</p> <p>The first play-off winners were Manchester United, who beat second division Watford 2-0 at Highbury the night before Chelsea took on Leeds. Bobby Charlton and George Best both featured, with Brian Kidd scoring both goals for United, who had failed to break down Don Revie\u2019s Leeds in 270 minutes of semi-final action, going down 1-0 in the second replay. A crowd of more than 15,000 turned out \u2013 not a roaring success, but something to work with.</p> <p>The problems really set in the following year, when the FA decided to hold the match between Stoke and Everton at \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Selhurst Park. The Potters won 3-2, but barely 5,000 fans made the long trip to south London. The Stoke Sentinel reported \u201centertainment worthy of a better response than a meagre crowd\u201d as Stoke\u2019s all-time top scorer, John Ritchie, bagged the winner. Technically, this was the club\u2019s highest FA Cup finish until 2011, when they reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/14/manchester-city-stoke-city-fa-cup\">their first final</a>.</p> <p>With interest dwindling, the FA took a bold decision \u2013 moving the match to the following pre-season, some three months after the respective Cup final. The idea of the match serving as a warm-up match in the capital was also knocked on the head, so Stoke \u2013 who had won the League Cup in the interim, but lost to Arsenal for the second consecutive year in the FA Cup semi-finals \u2013 travelled to St Andrew\u2019s to face Birmingham City, newly promoted from Division Two.</p> <p>The Blues became the only second-tier side to claim a third-placed finish, and earned victory in a novel way \u2013 winning the FA Cup\u2019s first penalty shootout. A total of 25,841 fans turned up for the game \u2013 vindicating the FA\u2019s decision to allow one side to host the match. Opinion was divided on the penalty shootout format \u2013 the Sunday Times called it a \u201ccoconut shy ritual\u201d \u2013 and it would not be seen again in the FA Cup for another 20 years.</p> <p>Having reached the Cup final in 1971 and 1972, Arsenal could be forgiven for a lack of interest after being humbled in the 1973 semi-final by the eventual shock winners, Sunderland. They hosted the play-off match, again held in August, but were beaten 3-1 by Wolves, with Derek Dougan scoring twice. Highbury\u2019s second play-off game drew 6,000 more fans than the first, but Arsenal were involved.

  "<p>For every Geoff Cameron in the Premier League there\u2019s a Michael Bradley in Major League Soccer. Two talented players in their prime, one playing in the coveted Premier League and the other trading the heights of Europe with Roma for the expansive suburbs and big money on offer in Toronto. (You mean Bradley went to Canada to win trophies?) What\u2019s less well known is that almost 150 Americans are contracted to professional clubs around the world, from Germany to Israel to Azerbaijan and many other places in between. We spoke to three American players trying to make their name a long way from home:</p> <h2><strong>Mayowa Alli, </strong><strong>KI Klaksvik, Faroe Islands</strong></h2> <p>Let\u2019s get this out of the way early. Mayowa Alli has eaten whale. He\u2019s eaten whale jerky and barbecued whale. When you live on an isolated island in the North Atlantic, it\u2019s what you do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/27/carli-lloyd-memoir-us-women-soccer\">Carli Lloyd's memoir explodes myth that US women's soccer is all fun and friends</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome people would say eating whale is barbaric but I learned to look at it from their perspective,\u201d Alli says. \u201cI only had it once. I can\u2019t give you a sophisticated review \u2013 but it was good.\u201d</p> <p>Alli plays in defence for KI Klaksvik, a team in the Faroe Islands Premier League, and has a track record in adapting to new surroundings. Born in Nigeria, his family moved to the US when he was four, and he grew up in Lanham, a small Maryland town between Washington DC and Baltimore. \u201cI thought eating goat meat was normal until I went to elementary school and everyone else told me it was weird,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A talented high school soccer player, Alli was recruited by Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and named all-American in 2013 by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. His college coach said Major League Soccer teams were interested. The league\u2019s Superdraft, where college players are called up to pro teams, beckoned. But Alli didn\u2019t get a call.</p> <p>\u201cThe draft system is a bit weird,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn the major US sports it has been so successful but MLS is not always like that. They\u2019re picking foreign players and the college system is not the league base.\u201d</p> <p>Alli had a choice. Stay home in America, cool his heels on a pro career, and put his political science degree to use \u2013 or look abroad. Then Bucknell alumni Conor O\u2019Brien, playing professionally in Denmark, joined some dots, and Alli boarded a plane for Copenhagen.</p> <p>On his first day in Denmark, Alli trialed with the reserve team of a third-division club \u2013 a long way from the European glamor portrayed by the Champions League on TV. He was offered a contract, joined first division (second-tier) club Vendsyssel the following season, before he was sent on loan to KI Klaksvik in the Faroe Islands\u2019 10-team Premier League.</p> <p>The Faroe Islands are an archipelago in the Norwegian Sea with a population of around 50,000. Klaksvik is the second-biggest city \u2013 actually, town \u2013 with a population of just over 4,000. The capital, Torshavn (literally \u201cThor\u2019s Harbor\u201d), claims 13,000 inhabitants.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re walking down the street and you see someone\u2019s grandmother, you say hi,\u201d says Alli. \u201cYou don\u2019t buy your fish from the supermarket. You get it from a fisherman. If you need something fixed, you call your uncle. If you need something sewn, you call your grandmother.\u201d</p> <p>Still, while playing pro soccer in the Faroe Islands may appear off the beaten path, Alli says he\u2019s learned things he doubts he would have picked up in the US. \u201cYou get here and learn so much,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are some basic things players get here at a young age that I\u2019m learning when I\u2019m 22 years old. Imagine if I\u2019d learned this when I was 16 or 17?\u201d</p> <p>Mikkjal Thomassen, Klaksvik\u2019s 40-year-old coach, says Alli has worked hard to inject what he calls an \u2018holistic approach\u2019 to his football. \u201cFor us, a central defender is not just a defender,\u201d Thomassen says. \u201cWe put a lot of responsibility to build the play as well. Mayowa is exceptional in his physical capacity \u2013 his ability to jump and strength and courage. That is his force. He is at the international level for that.\u201d</p> <p>Faroe Islands teams can field four foreign players. Many come from Denmark or Eastern Europe and are either starting careers or ending them. A top import can make around $6,000 a month, with a car and housing thrown in. Other players earn closer to $3,000.</p> <p>Game day attracts almost 3,000 people to the team\u2019s stadium which is almost more people than the official population of the town. KI Klaksvik also has a successful women\u2019s team. Imagine Friday Night Lights set on an isolated island between Norway and Iceland.</p> <p>\u201cThe team has a huge impact on daily life, and they say that the factories can that measure people work harder when we win,\u201d says Thomassen, who was the Faroe Islands\u2019 police chief of narcotics for 15 years before becoming a full-time football coach. Last year, Alli also worked part-time as a carpenter. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have one occupation in the Faroes,\u201d adds Thomassen.</p> <p>The league doesn\u2019t just attract international players from Europe. Last season, Alli\u2019s teammates also came from Nigeria, Cameroon, and Senegal.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019d go over to their house and eat west African food,\u201d Alli says. \u201cI was surprised they could get the ingredients but they found some. There was a Nigerian guy who owned a pizza shop here. You\u2019ll never know what you\u2019ll find when you go around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Alli\u2019s loan deal with KI ends in December. If the team finishes in the top four, (they\u2019re currently top of the table) there\u2019s a chance to qualify for the Europa League. Alternatively, Alli, now 24, will return to Denmark.</p> <p>\u201cSome players are maybe afraid of being in a whole new world,\u201d Alli says. \u201cBut you are young and you will never know what\u2019ll happen. It\u2019s worth a shot. If the football doesn\u2019t work out for you, it is still a great experience to have.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Adan Coronado, </strong><strong>AZAL, Baku, Azerbaijan</strong></h2> <p>Adan Coronado grew up in Hawaiian Gardens, California, south of Los Angeles and not far from Huntington Beach. These days, though, Coronado lives in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on the Caspian Sea. Baku and the Caspian Sea are not known for sun and surf. In fact, Baku roughly translates to \u201cwind-pounded city\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was like: \u2018Oh, where\u2019s Azerbaijan?\u2019\u201d Coronado recalls when he learned AZAL, a team in Azerbaijan\u2019s Premier League, was interested in signing him. \u201cI went on Google and said: \u2018Where\u2019s this place at?!\u2019 I saw it was under Turkey: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a little further out from home. It\u2019s <em>way</em> over the pond.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>AZAL is the latest stop on something of a tour of professional soccer\u2019s lesser known leagues for Coronado. Blooded into the game by his Mexican-born father, Coronado (now 26) was an accomplished high school player but shunned the traditional college pathway in favor of, effectively, a talent show.</p> <p>Handing over $300, he entered a combine \u2013 a kind of America\u2019s Got Soccer Talent \u2013 in Los Angeles. Players that made a cut were not invited to Hollywood but offered an expenses-paid trip to Germany as part of an 18-man squad to play matches against local teams. The hope was to be be spotted by a European agent or a scout, or, well, <em>anybody</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI always had a curiosity to play overseas if I had the chance,\u201d Coronado says. \u201cWhen the combine came up I thought, \u2018OK, this is the way I can get there\u2019. I took the chance and left everything \u2013 college, family. I was 21 years old. As a soccer player, if you want to be a professional, that was late. But I thought, I\u2019m not going to lose anything, so why not?\u201d</p> <p>In Germany, the midfielder was subsequently invited to trial with several clubs and offered a contract with Kickers Emden in Germany\u2019s third tier. \u201cIt was a traditional club, well organized, and with a fanbase,\u201d Coronado says. However, it was also a club with serious financial problems and dropped into Germany\u2019s (effectively, amateur) fifth tier.</p> <p>\u201cI was a little surprised,\u201d admits Coronado.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fac7579d2e7284d5761fa9dca20db6a3198d063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fac7579d2e7284d5761fa9dca20db6a3198d063/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Azerbaijan fans show their support in Baku.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Azerbaijan fans show their support in Baku.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not perturbed. Friends of friends of friends put him in contact with clubs in Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where he played for two seasons. The professional dream was still alive. Then came the call from Baku. <br></p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know this guy, so at first it was kind of sketchy,\u201d Coronado says of the sometimes shadowy world of agents and contracts. \u201cThey introduce themselves, but you don\u2019t know who they are, so it is risky. You don\u2019t know who you are talking to, sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Today, almost a year later, Coronado is proudly the only Mexican-American playing in Azerbaijan\u2019s eight-team Premier League. \u201cI was the first one!\u201d he laughs. When he arrived in Baku the club produced a mini-documentary on him. \u201cThey were like, what\u2019s going on?! They filmed me and wanted to know about my culture. Mexican-American is different here.\u201d</p> <p>Coronado\u2019s non-Azerbaijan team-mates are Georgian, Chinese, and Iranian. \u201cNot that many people speak English here \u2013 it\u2019s Turkish and Russian,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As a kid, Coronado\u2019s favorite player was Manchester United\u2019s Eric Cantona. He\u2019d watch games from Europe on TV at home in California. His father would talk about the games and how soccer in Europe was different to America. \u201cI wanted to see that and experience that,\u201d Coronado says.</p> <p>But reality is a little different to the glamor of TV images \u2013 and not just geographically. \u201cAt first I had to just get by with the little salary they provide,\u201d Coronado explains. \u201cThey help you out with housing and the little I earned I\u2019d spend on food, and the rest I\u2019d save for a trip back home. That\u2019s how it starts off in the lower leagues. Everyone who is here in Azerbaijan wants to go to England, Spain, France, or Germany. They are looking to get out.\u201d</p> <p>Away from his family \u2013 \u201cThey haven\u2019t visited yet, they\u2019re always working, you know how it is\u201d \u2013 and his girlfriend, Coronado spends his downtime running a newly-launched fashion label with a teammate. With an eye on his post-soccer career, the label \u2013 called Left1 \u2013 pitches designer T-shirts as the kind of clothes pro soccer players wear.</p> <p>\u201cI will come back home eventually, but I want to explore the world and learn about different cultures,\u201d Coronado says. \u201cMaybe I should be comfortable and have a stable life, but I want to learn and take away things from the world. Every time I go back home they say: \u2018Are you going to stay this time?\u2019 I say: \u2018No, maybe next time\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Shaquell Moore, </strong><strong>Atletico Levante, Valencia, Spain</strong></h2> <p>For Shaquell Moore, the worst part was not getting paid. For five months. And not just the American teenager. The entire team did not get paid for almost half a season. Welcome to life in Europe as a professional player.</p> <p>\u201cThe Spanish guys had family here and had someone to lean on, but I had to stand by myself,\u201d Moore recalls of his first season in Spain. \u201cBut to be honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in a better locker room. Everyone stayed positive and helped each other. It was bad but it was good. It helped me a lot. I know I\u2019m able to tough it out even when I wanted to drop everything and go back home.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, 19, has football in his blood. His father Wendell played for Trinidad &amp; Tobago, representing his country three times during a qualification campaign for the 1986 World Cup. (Canada joined hosts Mexico as Concacaf\u2019s representatives in the finals). Growing up in Florida and Georgia, Shaq Moore was a rising star with US national youth teams, captaining the under-17 side, playing for the under-20s at the 2015 World Cup in New Zealand, and winning a Major League Soccer contract with FC Dallas.</p> <p>\u201cThe traditional pathway is that you go to high school, you go to college and start a career there,\u201d Moore explains. \u201cI thought I had the ability to skip college and test the waters overseas. I have nothing against MLS, the league is growing, but I wanted to try Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Playing with the US under-18 team in the 2014 Copa del Atlantico, a friendly tournament in the Canary Islands, Moore attracted interest from Spanish scouts. A release from Dallas after just four months opened the door wider. Moore tooks trials at Valencia, Levante, and Huracan.</p> <p>\u201cYou enter an environment where you don\u2019t really know anyone and you are basically coming in to take someone\u2019s spot,\u201d Moore explains of trialing at professional clubs. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give you the ball and they don\u2019t want you to shine.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Moore won a contract with Huracan, a team in Spain\u2019s third tier, but the club soon hit financial problems that would ultimately lead to its demise as a professional club in late 2015. Moore then won a deal with Real Oviedo, playing for its reserve team, before he signed with Levante at the end of the recent August transfer window.</p> <p>\u201cHuracan, and not getting paid, was one of the times when I asked, do I really want to be here?\u201d Moore says. \u201cBut those experiences do make you stronger.\u201d</p> <p>Moore as dropped off the national team radar after signing for Huracan and not playing for its first team. Speaking via phone from Valencia (after taking a Spanish lesson), he says he has no regrets about shunning MLS and moving to Europe. His education is not just tied to language classes.</p> <p>\u201cThe culture here is soccer, soccer, and soccer,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe people are crazy about it and everyone is enthusiastic \u2013 even at the reserve team games. Spain is a soccer country.</p> <p>\u201cThe other difference with the US is the technical ability of the players. At home, the focus is on bigger players and who can run the fastest and be the most physical. Here, you can be physical but you also have to have a brain for the game and good technique. It\u2019s more competitive because there are a lot of players and everyone is good. Even in the lower divisions.\u201d</p> <p>Moore has signed a two-year deal with Levante. His plan is to break into the Levante first team (they currently plays in the second tier while the reserve side play in the third) and recapture the attention of the US national team. He jokes that he won\u2019t say he\u2019s taking it one day at a time. Two years at a time? That\u2019s different. By 2018 he\u2019ll be 21. A two-year deal with a professional team in Spain is kind of like college \u2013 but very different.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone here in Spain is fighting to make it to the top,\u201d he says. \u201cHere it\u2019s soccer or nothing.\u201d</p>",

How can feminism challenge this?

The thousands of Momentum supporters who are signing up to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuuLWY06_PAhWmBcAKHQoyBf8QFggeMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftheworldtransformed.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHlGZ8IOTL6Vqybqy7Jo6iAeuO90g&amp;sig2=QRPtkc6bcm6iwzFwCNiE-A\">the World Transformed festival</a> to coincide with the Labour conference in Liverpool are just the tip of the iceberg of an imaginative new politics.</p> <p>The initiatives of generations of women since the early 1970s exemplify the direction of this change and what it could mean in the future. To categorise decades of feminist activities simply as \u201cprotest\u201d is to miss out entirely on how feminism has changed the lives of millions of women in the here and now. They have protested and made demands on government, for sure ... In other words, \u201cnew politics\u201d is about a lot more than politics in its narrow party-political, parliamentary sense. It opens up a new relationship between electoral politics and the mutuality and solidarity in everyday life, in the community and the workplace.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shimon-peres\">Shimon Peres</a>, one of Israel\u2019s defining political figures and a Nobel peace prize laureate, has died at the age of 93, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/shimon-peres-suffers-stroke-former-israeli-president\">two weeks after suffering a stroke</a>.</p> <p>Peres had twice served as prime minister of Israel and later as the country\u2019s ninth president. He had been seriously ill on a respirator in an Israeli hospital near Tel Aviv and died after his condition deteriorated sharply.</p> <p>Among those who have said they will attend his funeral and burial on Jerusalem\u2019s Mount Herzl on Friday are Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, as well as Prince Charles and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>In more than six decades of political life his defining achievement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine\">was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords</a>, for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1994 with the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Those peace agreements \u2013 signed in Washington in 1993 and Taba, Egypt in 1995, \u2013 foresaw the creation of a Palestinian state, and were named after the Norwegian capital where the two sides launched eight months of secret negotiations in which Peres played a key role.</p> <p>With Peres\u2019s death the last of that trio has now gone. </p> <p>Rabin was cut down by a rightwing assassin\u2019s bullet in 1995, with Arafat dying nine years later.

But it is still possible \u2026 I think the tragedy is both people [Palestinians and Israelis] in majorities want to move to a two-state solution. It is not moving because of politics. But his dream will be implemented.\u201d </p> <p>Despite his role in the Oslo accords, Palestinians and the wider Arab world saw the legacy of Peres differently.

  "<p>A virtually unknown ivory poaching crisis is rapidly driving one of the world\u2019s most spectacular birds to extinction, a global wildlife summit has heard.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22682464/0\">helmeted hornbill</a>, found mainly in Indonesia, Borneo and Thailand, has a solid red beak which sells as a \u201cred ivory\u201d on the black market, for several times the price of elephant ivory. The huge birds have been caught for centuries for their tail feathers, prized by local communities, but since 2011 poaching has soared to feed Chinese demand for carving ivory, even though the trade is illegal, sending the hornbill into a death spiral.</p> <p>The bird, which can have a wingspan of 2m, was officially listed as \u201cnear threatened\u201d in 2012 but within three years had plunged three danger levels to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22682464/0\">\u201ccritically endangered\u201d</a>. Over 2,100 heads were seized in Indonesia and China in the two years up to August 2014, according to the Species Survival Network, and some estimates suggest 6,000 a year are killed.</p> <p>The government of Indonesia set out the hornbill\u2019s plight on Tuesday in front of the 182 nations of the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a>, gathered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Cites had already given its highest level protection to the hornbill in 1975 \u2013 all trade is illegal. But Indonesia demanded more international action to break the crime syndicates that smuggle the beak ivory, known as casques.</p> <p>\u201cThe high price reached by the casques motivates hunters to kill all the hornbills they cross, including juvenile birds,\u201d said the Cites delegate from Indonesia, where police have arrested and prosecuted 15 hornbill traffickers since 2015. \u201cThe illegal trade in elephant ivory and rhino horn has been well documented, however, the illegal trade in casques has been little known. If this highly profitable illegal trade is not curbed, the existence of this majestic species is in danger and is likely to lead to extinction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is in huge trouble,\u201d said Elizabeth Bennett, from the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey have this fabulous call, that ends in cackling laughter, which you can hear from a mile away. But they are incredibly easy to hunt because of that call: it must be the most spectacular bird call on the planet.\u201d</p> <p>The Cites nations agreed urgent action was needed and will decide on its precise form in the coming days. \u201cIndonesia is calling on other countries to take hornbill ivory as seriously as the other ivory,\u201d Bennett said. The Cites action is a \u201cbig red flag\u201d, she said, which will be very valuable in pressuring governments, including China, to act.</p> <p>Bennett said the slow-breeding birds were particularly vulnerable to poaching. They mate for life, and when ready to lay their one or two eggs per year, the male uses mud to seal the female into a protective hole in a tree. The male then feeds the female and chicks through a slit, meaning if the male is shot, the whole family starves. The bird\u2019s casque is used to hammer out insects from rotting wood, or to fight.</p> <p>The hornbill has also been harmed by the loss of much of its habitat to palm oil plantations. \u201cIt has not been helped by the vast clearances of lowland forest in Borneo and Sumatra,\u201d said Bennett.</p> <p>\u201cOnly global cooperation can stop the illegal trade in hornbill ivory before it is too late,\u201d said the Cites delegate from the Indonesian Hornbill Conservation Society. \u201cI have witnessed the rampant illegal poaching in the rainforest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5edc34609e024fd2846727f69cee5377ad463718\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5edc34609e024fd2846727f69cee5377ad463718/0_0_3000_2030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Handcuffed suspects hold parts of helmeted hornbills in North Sumatra, Indonesia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Handcuffed suspects hold parts of helmeted hornbills in North Sumatra, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dewantoro/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/revealed-the-criminals-making-millions-from-illegal-wildlife-trafficking\">exposed the central role of international organised crime groups</a> in wildlife trafficking in Asia and linked the illegal trade to corrupt officials at the highest levels.

  "<p>When I was growing up in foster care, my carers were entitled to respite, which they gleefully took. In this time, my brothers and I were sent off for a week or two to stay with people we had never met before, while my foster family went on a fancy holiday. As well as feeling jealous and unloved, all of this made me feel like a burden to society. The message young people receive and internalise is: \u201cYou are just work to us, and you are an inconvenience.\u201d<br></p> <p>Looked after children are some of the most vulnerable people in society and all too often, the system that is supposed to help them to thrive reinforces negative life experiences in earlier childhood, leading to poor outcomes. This is because it isn\u2019t appropriately designed to meet their needs, which is concerning. The system should be supporting vulnerable children to fulfil their potential as happy, resilient and active members of society, not causing them problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/foster-carers-fight-working-rights-trade-unions\">Foster carers vote to unionise in fight for pay and working rights | Anna Bawden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of the rhetoric around setting up a union for foster carers has been about pay, sick leave, holiday entitlement and upskilling carers. I want to consider the question that should always be central to this debate, but in my view has been overlooked: what would the unionisation of foster carers mean for looked after children? Is there a risk that this will make the system even less effective?</p> <p>I believe society must do more to truly value foster carers. The concerns of those trying to join a union are justified. They are the key to providing consistency and a safe environment, which these young people have lacked in their earlier life and so desperately need to flourish. Unionisation offers the prospect of the minimum wage for foster carers and I believe that financially, foster carers should never be out of pocket. </p> <p>But with both the deep challenges and rewards that come with it, fostering is quite simply not a role for someone whose primary intention is an income. Is using a slogan such as \u201cearn a living as a foster carer\u201d (West Dunbartonshire council) attracting the caring people young people need? Or is the phrase \u201ca career without a commute\u201d (Glasgow city council) helping to tackle the challenges these young people face? Worryingly, this is the direction services are moving towards, and I fear that unionisation will intensify this. </p> <p>My experience was different, but I know people choose to become foster carers so they can welcome vulnerable young people into their homes with all the love and support that they can offer. To professionalise fostering to the extent where it is advertised for its financial benefits, respite is enforced and sick leave is promoted is completely contrary to what services claim to do for looked after children. How can a child in care feel a sense of belonging if they feel that they are being fostered to make someone else money, if they are made to stay somewhere else at short notice when their carers have a cold, or if they are periodically dispensed with for respite? </p> <p>Corporate parents often claim to give looked after children the closest thing to a family environment. This should be seamlessly supported by government policy and social services but actually we are doing these children a disservice \u2013 and unionisation threatens to exacerbate this. </p> <p>If we are going to consider the needs of looked after children in this debate, we need to be very careful not to relegate fostering to a contractual arrangement by which vulnerable people can be farmed out when a foster carer has a sniffle. This threatens the all-important authentic relationships between children and foster carers, and both deserve better than unionisation offers.</p> <p>Another anticipated benefit of unionisation is that it may improve the training available for foster carers. My foster carers were extremely well trained \u2013 but this didn\u2019t mean they were able to apply their training to caring for me, and didn\u2019t make them good foster carers. Having training didn\u2019t stop them being emotionally neglectful and physically abusive.

  "<p>Before this year ends, the United Nations general assembly can take a decisive step toward ending one of the most urgent threats to public health and human survival in the world today. UN member states can and must mandate negotiations on a new treaty that prohibits nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The dangers posed by these weapons are utterly unacceptable, and the only sure way to prevent an unthinkable catastrophe is to eliminate them completely. That\u2019s not only possible, it\u2019s essential and long overdue.</p> <p>A single nuclear weapon can destroy a city and kill most of its people, making it impossible to provide meaningful aid to the survivors. A nuclear war could kill many more people in an hour than were killed during the entire second world war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/obama-nuclear-arsenal-disarmament-russia-congress\">Obama to decide on cuts to US nuclear arsenal in October</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nuclear detonations in cities would ignite massive fires with extreme and long-lasting environmental consequences, disrupting the Earth\u2019s climate and agricultural productivity. Less than 1% of the nuclear weapons in the world today could cause a nuclear famine with the potential to put two billion people at risk of starvation. </p> <p>The thousands of nuclear weapons in the countries with the largest arsenals alone could bring about nuclear winter, with the prospect of destroying the essential ecosystems on which life depends and thereby threatening human extinction.</p> <p>Nuclear weapons release intense ionising radiation that jeopardises any immediate survivors; causes acute and long-term illnesses, including cancers, that are often deadly; and leaves a legacy of genetic and intergenerational health harm.</p> <p>A nuclear war has an extremely high likelihood of creating a refugee crisis orders of magnitude larger than the one we seem unable to cope with today. Nuclear weapons eradicate the physical and social infrastructure required for recovery from conflict.</p> <p>Earlier this year, our federations, the main bodies representing millions of physicians, nurses, and public health professionals around the world, presented these facts to a special UN working group on nuclear disarmament. The International Red Cross/Red Crescent and UN agencies charged with responding to humanitarian disasters warned that health professionals and relief workers would be unable to mount any meaningful response to the consequences of a nuclear conflict.</p> <p>One hundred and twenty-seven states have said with common voice that their security is directly threatened by the 15,000 nuclear weapons that exist in the arsenals of nine countries, and they are demanding that these weapons be prohibited and abolished. They have lost patience with the refusal of the nuclear-armed states to fulfill their obligation to disarm. Moreover, they rightly see the massive and expensive nuclear re-armament programs underway in these states as confirming their bad faith and recklessly endangering our collective security.</p> <p>The working group recommended \u2013 by a majority of more than three to one \u2013 that the general assembly mandate negotiations, to start next year, on a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons. A ban treaty will create a new and explicit legal, moral and political norm \u2013 comparable to the treaty prohibitions that already apply to chemical and biological weapons, antipersonnel landmines, and cluster munitions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-must-confront-labours-trident-dilemma\">Jeremy Corbyn must confront Labour\u2019s Trident dilemma | Letters from Caroline Lucas MP and Dr David Lowry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A ban treaty will close a legal gap with regard to nuclear weapons by making it unequivocal that no state has a legitimate claim to possess, build, test, deploy, use, or threaten to use them.</p> <p>A minority \u2013 the nuclear-armed states and those claiming to rely on their nuclear weapons \u2013 object to a ban treaty because they believe that nuclear weapons make them more secure. In fact these weapons, whose use has the potential to destroy human civilisation, are the greatest threat to the security of everyone, including the nations that possess them.</p> <p>An evidence-based understanding of what nuclear weapons actually do invalidates all arguments for continued possession of these weapons by anyone, and requires that they urgently be prohibited and eliminated as the only course of action commensurate with the existential danger they pose. The working group has sent this clear message to the general assembly, where governments must now muster the courage to act on behalf of humanity\u2019s future.</p> <p>Banning and eliminating nuclear weapons is a high global health priority.

  "<p>There is a quiet power to Simon Norfolk\u2019s black-and-white study of what looks like an ordinary staircase in a nondescript house. What strikes you first in this photograph \u2013 which features in a new exhibition called <a href=\"http://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/exhibitions/139/overview\">? The Image as Question</a> \u2013 is how the light plays on each polished surface: the gleaming handrail and pristine skirting board, the gloss-painted wall. It is then you notice that the surface of each stair is not straight but gently curving, worn by the footsteps of those who have walked down them over the years.</p> <p>The French thinker Roland Barthes identified what he called the punctum: the crucial, often accidental, detail of a photograph that reveals something deeper. The curve of the worn stairs is not an accidental detail in Norfolk\u2019s photograph, but the crucial element in the composition that, as Barthes put it, \u201crises from the scene\u201d with a force that makes it suddenly seem like a new photograph. Those who walked down these stairs, leaving the imprint of their vast numbers, were heading towards their deaths in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. It is a photograph that evokes horror in the most subtle and affecting way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"461b7e9e69a93a48eaa2d1cc0172c98e61cf8d91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461b7e9e69a93a48eaa2d1cc0172c98e61cf8d91/0_0_701_1050/668.jpg\" alt=\"September 11th, New York, NY 2001 by Melanie Einzig.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">September 11th, New York, NY 2001 by Melanie Einzig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melanie Einzig. Courtesy Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of the fascination with all photography is that the medium is firmly grounded in the documentary tradition,\u201d Michael Hoppen notes in his introduction to the show. \u201cIt has been used as a record of crime scenes, zoological specimens, lunar and space exploration, phrenology, fashion and importantly, art and science. It has been used as \u2018proof\u2019 of simple things such as family holidays and equally of atrocities taking place on the global stage. Any contemporary artist using photography has to accept the evidential language embedded in the medium.\u201d</p> <p>That last sentence perhaps provides the subtext to the exhibition, which concerns the threatened position of documentary photography in an age of digital profligacy. Photographs are now so ubiquitous and, when shared on social media, often so unmoored from their context as to seem drained of meaning. The images here, Hoppen insists, have \u201ca shared gravitas, a weightiness that emanates from their documentary function\u201d.</p> <p>That is certainly true of Norfolk\u2019s image of the stairs at Auschwitz, but its power also comes from its formal and compositional poetry: the fall of the light, the geometry of curves, horizontals and verticals, the perspective that, as Norfolk has noted, echoes that of an earlier image: <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/photographs/frederick-h-evans-a-sea-of-steps-5717415-details.aspx\">Sea of Steps</a>, a staircase in Wells Cathedral made to appear almost celestial by Frederick Evans in 1903. It is not so much a photograph as evidence, then, rather an evocation of the immeasurable human suffering that took place on this ordinary-looking site.</p> <p>The exhibition roams far and wide, from photography as research material for painters to images made by microscopic and telescopic cameras to the inevitable grisly crime scene shots by accomplished ambulance chasers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/mar/31/the-best-of-weegees-new-york-street-photography-in-pictures\">Arthur \u201cWeegee\u201d Fellig</a> and his Mexican counterpart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/21/enrique-metinides-photography-dead-mexico\">Enrique Metinides</a>. It is an intriguing show enlivened by the fact that the stories behind the photographs \u2013 which all come from Hoppen\u2019s extensive personal collection \u2013 are often as interesting as the images themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f9db218738333b05600aeda566f64fec9bf1833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f9db218738333b05600aeda566f64fec9bf1833/0_0_3678_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two men wrestling, photographed by Francis Bacon in New York in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enlarged contact sheet of two men wrestling, New York, from the studio of Francis Bacon, circa 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A relatively understated, but characteristically voyeuristic, photograph by Metinides taken in Mexico City in 1958 shows a blood-splattered cluster of personal items \u2013 love letters and a golden purse.

Of the 1,300 survey respondents (which included companies of all sizes in 64 countries), 78% said they run at least part of their operations on open source software, which is almost double the figure recorded in 2010. </p> <p>Tim Perry, technical lead at software consultancy <a href=\"http://www.softwire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Softwire</a>, says that without open source software, the business would not be able to operate. \u201cThere\u2019s no realistic way we could have built the same code ourselves from scratch,\u201d he says. It would take up more time and resource than the business can afford. <br></p> <p>As a way to give back to the open source community, Softwire invests time and energy in improving the tools that make its work possible. Last December, it came fourth out of 10,000 teams in a global competition called <a href=\"http://24pullrequests.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">24 Pull Requests</a> (the title is a nod to how a change to open source code is requested \u2013 it is then \u201cpulled\u201d into the project by the community). The winning company was the one that made the most improvements to open source code that were accepted and incorporated into existing projects. </p> <p>Perry says that contributing to open source is a priority for the company. \u201cIt\u2019s taken many years of development by hundreds of people to reach the point where we have sophisticated tools, libraries and languages for anyone to use. So our decision to invest time and skills back into that ultimately means that we have better tools available for our work.\u201d<br></p> <p>The community has also been vital to Chris Perks\u2019s digital marketing company, <a href=\"http://www.blueethos.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blue Ethos</a>, which builds customers websites using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wordpress</a> (itself an open source project).<br></p> <p>The basic features of Wordpress can be used for free and come without a substantial licence fee, a cost that is common for businesses using closed, commercial systems. Blue Ethos tailors its customers\u2019 Wordpress-based websites with its own plug-ins and widgets, built by its team of four software developers.<br></p> <p>For those on a tight budget Wordpress is an easy choice. If the website is hosted by Wordpress itself, there\u2019s no cost. If the business wishes to host the site themselves (with a tailored domain name and design), it is still only \u00a320 per year.<br></p> <p>Because Wordpress is an open source project, it has also been easy to find developers in the community that can work on Blue Ethos\u2019s outsourced projects. Software developers tend to specialise in certain coding languages and open source tools, but Wordpress skills are common among the community. Perks says: \u201cYou can outsource [Wordpress] work all over the world.\u201d The company has used freelance coders in Ukraine, the Philippines and the US, so far.<br></p> <p>There are concerns about the security of open source software, compared to its commercial counterparts. Some say that because the community is constantly working on the code, vulnerabilities are easily spotted and fixed. But the 2014 Coverity <a href=\"http://go.coverity.com/rs/157-LQW-289/images/2014-Coverity-Scan-Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> (pdf) disputes this, saying: \u201cCommercial software [is tackling] security vulnerabilities at a relatively faster pace than compared to open source software.\u201d The findings came from an analysis of more than 10bn lines of open source code from 2,500 open source projects as well as an anonymous sample of commercial projects.<br></p> <p>Scott Wilson is service manager for <a href=\"http://oss-watch.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OSS</a> (open source software) Watch, an independent organisation that offers advice on the use and development of open source software.

But this transparency, and the number of coders who can access and change it, mean that vulnerabilities tend to be fixed. He compares this to commercial software where businesses do not have access to the code itself. Vulnerabilities within it are therefore often not identified until they have already been exploited.<br></p> <p>A downside to open source is the lack of official support \u2013 there\u2019s no helpdesk to call. Wilson says: \u201cWith open source, much more of the due diligence is the onus of the customer. You have to perform more of the analysis yourself. [But] if the software has a good community with a number of people contributing, then it\u2019s going to be improved and maintained over time.\u201d<br></p> <p>Open source may have its problems, but with an active community improving existing code and creating new tools small businesses can easily try out new platforms and drop them if they are unsuitable, without wasting money.

  "<p>In a desperate effort to get relief for excruciating pain caused by osteoarthritis, curvature of the spine, and abdominal discomfort following surgery, Linda Douglas went to A&amp;E twice a day.</p> <p>The chronically ill 48-year-old, who lives near Sunderland, was \u201cat the end of [her] rope\u201d because of the constant pain and frequent hospital visits, and felt life \u201cwas not worth living\u201d. That was until a new team of health and social care professionals took over her case and improved her quality of life from \u201csix to 99%\u201d in early 2016.</p> <p>The team comprising her GP, consultant, community matron, social worker and paramedic worked together to come up with a care plan tailored to her needs. Now, she can largely avoid hospital and live a much more normal life, mainly because John, her husband and carer, has been trained to administer her daily medication. She says: \u201cMy life was driven by fear. I was terrified of being unwell and not being able to get the care I needed to control my pain. I don\u2019t need to worry any more.

This same programme, which was expected to champion ways of providing better, more efficient care for heavy users of NHS services, has not been given as much money as originally hoped. According to Kerry McQuade, head of vanguard delivery in Sunderland, the \u00a34.8m the partnership received in 2016/17 did not match the initial bid, although it received more than similar projects in other parts of the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/21/debt-homelessness-domestic-violence-gp-practice-acting-one-stop-shop\">Debt, homelessness, domestic violence: the GP practice acting as a one-stop shop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sunderland is one of the most deprived cities in England.

Six per cent of the population \u2013 those with long-term, multiple illnesses \u2013 are responsible for half of the city\u2019s health spend. With the pressure on from NHS England to reduce costs by nearly \u00a31bn by 2021 in the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear region as central funding is squeezed, the focus on the most needy patients makes sense.</p> <p>Local GP Dr Fadi Khalil describes Sunderland\u2019s scheme \u2013 one of 14 across England \u2013 as \u201cmassive\u201d in scale. Covering nearly 300,000 patients at 50 GP practices across the city, it is focused on reducing hospital admissions via a series of initiatives designed to offer care that aim to keep patients well and cared for where they live.</p> <p>In the past, despite the \u201cbest intentions in the world\u201d, the most needy patients weren\u2019t getting the best care because of a disjointed and fragmented set of services, says Khalil. Patients had to undergo repeat visits to A&amp;E, repeat crisis admissions to hospital, and had to repeat their stories to a string of frontline primary, community, acute and social care staff.</p> <p>This was not only bad for them but a tremendous waste of precious resources. Finally, under the vanguard programme, local authority and health commissioners and providers are being encouraged to work together with patients.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past when someone [got] a chest infection, they would end up in hospital. Now we\u2019ve got things in place that keep them at home where they\u2019re safer and more familiar with their environment,\u201d Khalil says. Such patients, who have been identified by their GPs as at risk of rapid onset of health problems, have access to their GP, and a nurse or paramedic out of hours who can visit them at home, and who make regular check-ups to prevent urgent, unplanned visits to hospital.</p> <p>Five teams, created late last year, are at the core of Sunderland\u2019s scheme, with community matrons, district nurses and social workers all were moved into the same office.</p> <p>It was a shock to the system at first and \u201cinitially quite daunting\u201d, according to adult social care team manager Rachel Daurat, particularly to the social workers who had to move out of their dedicated offices at Sunderland city council. </p> <p>She says health and social care have traditionally worked to entirely different agendas. However, working together on a patient case has meant they have been able to learn from each other\u2019s perspectives and ensure different providers are working in harmony to improve circumstances for those receiving their care.</p> <p>Sue Hughes, a district nurse taking part in the initiative agrees: \u201cWe are just a team now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe understand the pressures we each face day to day and we support each other.

And because it needed to finance debt, the trust wasn\u2019t eligible for government grants or other types of non-profit funding like the marine coastal communities fund set up by Danny Alexander, then deputy treasurer in the coalition government, to address the desperate plight of declining seaside towns.</p> <p>When Calum Currie, an offshore oil technician born and bred in the village, joined the trust in December 2014, he realised there was no way the community would be able to pay back the loan by the deadline. Currie sent a letter round calling locals to the village hall for an extraordinary general meeting. In January 2015, 160 people gathered to discuss what to do next.</p> <p>Currie contacted Community Shares Scotland (CSS) \u2013 a scheme funded by the Big Lottery Fund Scotland and Carnegie UK Trust. He hoped Portpatrick Trust might be eligible to become Scotland\u2019s first community benefits society, which would allow it to sell shares in the harbour to secure it into community ownership.</p> <p>Since 2009, more than 100,000 people have invested \u00a3120m of share capital into 400 community businesses across the UK. Dozens more schemes are in the pipeline, funding everything from local pubs to huge renewable energy schemes. Hastings, a deprived coastal town in south-east England, recently used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/27/hastings-pier-reopens-after-restoration-project-heritage-lottery-fund-east-sussex\">shares to help give residents a stake in its restored historic pier</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38aaedac609a202ee20c5895225786e422173c45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38aaedac609a202ee20c5895225786e422173c45/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Calum Currie, an offshore oil technician born and bred in the village, led the efforts to buy the harbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Calum Currie: \u2018the finance from the community share sale allowed us to find a future when there were no other avenues open to us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hazel Sheffield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kelly McIntyre, programme director of CSS, advised Currie to mobilise locals to buy shares to save the harbour. Emails were sent to regular visitors. Shops and stores advertised the share sale to tourists. The launch date was set for the annual folk festival in September, when the harbour would likely be full.</p> <p>Robert Erskine, a lifeboat coxswain at Portpatrick since 1984, was among those going between the boats at the festival selling shares in the harbour for a minimum of \u00a325. Each shareholder got one vote, no matter how many shares they bought. This key difference from other kinds of ownership structures prevents large investors from taking over. But few investors buy community shares to make money or wrest control. \u201cA lot of people bought shares for their grandchildren,\u201d Erskine says. \u201cIt made people feel part of the community.\u201d</p> <p>In just three weeks, Portpatrick had raised enough money to save the harbour, with the 554 shareholders coming from as far away as Canada and Bermuda. Currie was elected chair of the Portpatrick Harbour Community Benefit Society. \u201cWithout community shares we would have been dead in the water,\u201d he says. \u201cThe financial benefits of the community share sale allowed us to find a future when there were no other avenues open to us.\u201d</p> <p>In Scotland\u2019s more remote communities, radical action has a rich history. \u201cMany Scottish communities are remote enough that they\u2019ve just got to get on and find a way to make things happen,\u201d says McIntyre. These projects aren\u2019t always in response to budget cuts, but the result of positive changes in the way people look at community ownership, according to Jim Metcalf, head of practice at Carnegie UK. \u201cCommunities are finding ways to fund things that would have never happened without public support,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/27/hastings-pier-reopens-after-restoration-project-heritage-lottery-fund-east-sussex\">Hastings Pier reopens following \u00a314.2m restoration project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The community shares network runs parallel with an active Scottish community land movement, which started not long after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/04/kirstyscott\">Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust</a> was formed in 1997 to save the island from centuries of absentee landlords. The Scottish government got its <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/land-reform\">Community Land Act through Holyrood earlier this year </a>and has recently allocated \u00a310m a year until 2020 to support communities trying to invest in land buyouts.</p> <p>Holyrood has also bolstered asset buyouts with a <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/engage/CommEmpowerBill\">Community Empowerment Act</a>, passed last year, to help people take control of local assets when council resources fall short. Portpatrick wanted to use the act to acquire a strip of overgrown wasteland by the harbour to tidy it up and turn it into a picnic area. But the act was so new that the council didn\u2019t have the paperwork. So Currie negotiated directly with them instead. \u201cWe said that we\u2019re not the kind for hanging around, and \u2013 fair play to them \u2013 they worked with us,\u201d he says.</p> <p>By employing members of the community, the benefits society has turned the wasteland into freshly mown lawn and installed new moorings in the harbour. It is negotiating with the council to take over the running of some communal toilets and to modernise facilities.</p> <p>Currie dreams of fixing up the village hall using the money earned from mooring fees; expected to be \u00a320,000 this financial year. \u201cWhat better way to save your community hall than off the back of your harbour. Together the two of them are stronger, and we could go on to save something else,\u201d he says.</p> <p>With each small improvement, the society must make sure the harbour is running a profit, so shareholders can get their money back if they want it. \u201cNow we know the harbour won\u2019t get spoiled or used for some individual\u2019s private gain,\u201d Currie says.</p> <p>A year on from the share offer, Portpatrick is becoming the poster child for community action. Currie has been invited to give evidence to Scottish parliamentary committees about community ownership models. Kevin Stewart, the SNP minister for local government and housing, sees the harbour as part of a broader movement of local residents doing things for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cPortpatrick shows how a community can take control of its own future,\u201d he says. \u201cHanding decision-making to local people, especially in choosing local spending priorities, is exactly the type of activity we want to see more of.\u201d</p> <p>Not-for-profit organisations are also watching closely. \u201cThe Portpatrick Harbour Community Benefit Society is an inspiration. It is this kind of new political and economic energy that is needed to reverse years of neglect and decline,\u201d says Fernanda Balata, project lead on coastal and marine environment at the New Economics Foundation thinktank. Nef is putting together the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/blue-new-deal\">Blue New Deal</a>, which advises coastal communities across the UK that lack funding and are looking for other means to help themselves.</p> <p>Currie says that for the communities at the heart of the movement, it\u2019s not all about the money. \u201cFor the community to have control of the harbour and for everyone to have a voice, that\u2019s priceless,\u201d he says.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Portpatrick is part of a series of local economies documented at </em><a href=\"http://www.farnearer.org/\"><em>farnearer.org</em></a><em>, with funding from the Friends Provident Foundation <br></em></p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September as Portpatrick was once the main crossing to Donaghadee not Donegal<br></em></p> <p><em><br></em></p>",

He would have still had achieved more to build Israel\u2019s security than nearly anyone else alive.</p> <p>He could have resigned from the Knesset in the mid-1960s, following his mentor and patron David Ben-Gurion. Still in his early 40s, instead of languishing on the backbenchers, a lucrative future in business was open to him, as the man who had negotiated Israel\u2019s most crucial arms and technology deals, and had laid the foundations for its defense industry.</p> <p>In 1977, when he lost the election to Menachem Begin and Likud first came to power, the correct thing would have been to make way for a new generation of Labor Party leaders. But he soldiered on a leader of the opposition, despite another humiliating defeat in 1981.</p> <p>The crushing loss in 1996, by a fraction of a point to Benjamin Netanyahu, should have been another clear signal that his time was up. And again, four years later when he lost in a secret ballot for the presidency against political nonentity Moshe Katzav, he kept on going, even when he seemed pathetic to everyone around.</p> <p>Even when he was pushed by younger prime ministers in to minor cabinet posts way beneath his experience. Even when he twice felt forced to leave the party he had served for over six decades. Even when his last hurrah, a second and finally successful run for president, meant separating from his wife Sonia and leading their last years apart.</p> <p>On the way he broke nearly all the Israeli political records of longevity. He served as Knesset member for over 47 years, no one else comes even close. He is the only man to have ever served in all four top government jobs \u2212 defense, foreign and finance minister, as well as prime minister. He had reached the top again and again, won the Nobel Peace Prize. But it was never enough and he always wanted to keep going.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb52fae4b04cbd30bc3d0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbeaumont\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T05:20:49.400Z\">6.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile Yaakov Katz in the Jerusalem Post has <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Pushing-the-nation-forward-468867\">this take</a> on Peres\u2019s wars and his political disappointments. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In his 93 years, Peres saw it all and was at every major juncture this country went through in its 68 years of statehood.

  "<p>Tomorrow, six hundred policymakers, practitioners and researchers from seventy-two countries will assemble in Brussels for a meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/\">International Network for Government Science Advice</a>. All this week, hundreds more have been participating in the <a href=\"https://www.wwgs2016.org/\">What Works Global Summit</a> in London. If conferences are anything to go by, these are boom times for evidence and expertise in policymaking. But the mood of many participants will be sober rather than celebratory. </p> <p>There\u2019s certainly progress to point to. In the past decade, policymakers from Beijing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/nov/10/european-commission-unveils-its-a-team-of-science-advisers\">Brussels</a>, Prague to Pretoria, and Wellington to Washington D.C., have experimented with new institutions for scientific advice and evidence-informed decision-making. More established advisory bodies \u2013 such as the US Office for Science and Technology Policy, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/11/happy-40th-birthday-ostp\">which recently celebrated its fortieth birthday</a> \u2013 have become increasingly sophisticated and multi-disciplinary. An expanding cohort of scientific academies and learned societies is investing in policy capacity at a national level, and networking to influence global agendas, through new collaborations like the <a href=\"http://www.interacademies.org/\">InterAcademy Partnership</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/fr/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2016)589778\">European SAPEA platform</a>.</p> <p>In the international arena, there are now more regular and intense interactions between <a href=\"http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2016/science-advice-governments\">science advice, foreign policy and science diplomacy</a>. Several governments, including Japan, New Zealand, United States and the UK, have appointed science advisers to their foreign ministries. There has been debate about how to strengthen expert advice across the United Nations system, <a href=\"http://www.icsu.org/science-for-policy/sustainable-development-goals-1\">particularly in support of the sustainable development goals (SDGs)</a>, agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2015. A new UN Scientific Advisory Board was established in 2014, and <a href=\"http://en.unesco.org/un-sab/content/un-report-calls-greater-place-science-international-decision-making\">there have been recent calls for its remit to be expanded</a> by the incoming UN Secretary General.</p> <p>Scientific advice and evidence features prominently in recent UN initiatives, such as the <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework\">Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction</a>. There are moves underway to strengthen advisory mechanisms in support of international treaties, such as the <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/biological-toxin-weapons-convention/biological-toxin-weapons-convention-btwc-april-2016-meeting-summary.pdf\">Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention</a>. New mechanisms for evidence-informed assessments have also been created, drawing on lessons from the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a>, such as the <a href=\"http://www.ipbes.net/\">Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)</a>, formed in 2012 and now involving 125 countries. And the assessment model is being applied elsewhere, for example, through the <a href=\"https://www.ipsp.org/ \">International Panel for Social Progress</a>, through which social scientists aim to develop \u201cresearch-based, multi-disciplinary, non-partisan, action-driven solutions\u201d to pressing social challenges. </p> <p>Yet despite these positive developments, it is easy to feel frustrated by the visible failures of evidence to influence policy in so many areas. On thorny issues like climate change, obesity, biodiversity and migration, the response to overwhelming evidence is often sluggish and incremental. Global actions require domestic policy decisions. These need to be properly informed by national advisory systems, which remain very mixed in their structure, quality and capability to influence policy.</p> <p>New developments in science or novel applications of technology may provoke skepticism or resistance from a public that perceives them as allied to elite interests. And populist politicians, campaigners or social media warriors can tap into the anxieties caused by globalisation and rising inequalities, and channel these towards resentment, as we saw in the claims during the Brexit referendum that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">\u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Such tensions aren\u2019t new, but they are becoming more acute and visible, reflecting what some have called the <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/paradox-scientific-authority\">\u201cparadox of scientific authority\u201d</a>. Expert advice is being sought with growing urgency across a proliferating array of policy and public questions. At the same time, and often on the same issues, the legitimacy of evidence and expertise has rarely been so fiercely contested.</p> <p>Paradox coexists with possibilities. We need to better understand what lies behind the former, and forge alliances to advance the latter. This is why the <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/\">International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA)</a> was set up, following an initial meeting in Auckland in 2014.</p> <p>Operating under the auspices of the <a href=\"http://www.icsu.org/\">International Council for Science</a>, INGSA\u2019s membership now includes over 950 practitioners, academics, knowledge brokers and policymakers. The network\u2019s focus is on assisting the development of effective advisory systems for bringing evidence into policy, and the individual skills and institutional capacities that these require. Through workshops, conferences and a growing catalogue of case studies and guidance, the network aims to improve the potential for evidence-informed policymaking at national and transnational levels.</p> <p>At many levels of government, the ecosystem of institutions and individuals engaged in expert advice and evidence-informed policymaking is more diverse than ever before. Distinct yet overlapping communities of research, policy and practice are congregating around a <a href=\"http://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/evidence-exchange/the-science-of-using-science-evidence/\">core set of questions</a> about how to improve the provision, communication, relevance and application of evidence to policymaking. Perspectives from the natural sciences and engineering are being enriched and complicated by a deeper understanding of public values, cognitive biases and political psychology from the social, political and behavioural sciences. The assumptions of those on the evidence \u201csupply side\u201d are increasingly tempered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/mar/10/the-politics-of-evidence-based-policymaking\">pragmatic insights that come from experience on the \u201cdemand side\u201d of policy institutions.</a></p> <p>If we are to practice what we preach, it is also vital that we build the evidence base in this field, through analysis and evaluation of different systems. This week\u2019s Brussels meeting coincides with the launch of a <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/palcomms/article-collections/scientific-advice\">thematic collection of the open access journal <em>Palgrave Communications</em></a>, which includes new research on the theory, practice and politics of scientific advice from a range of disciplines and countries, including Canada, China, Japan, Netherlands, Nigeria, the US and UK.</p> <p>The insights from this collection, and the outcomes of the Brussels meeting, will inform INGSA\u2019s work and contribute to one of its priorities for the next year: <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/ingsa-news/principles-and-guidelines-of-science-advice/\">to develop a set of principles and guidelines for effective advisory systems</a>. Despite frustrations, obstacles and occasional setbacks, demand for scientific advice continues to grow. We need to reflect more systematically, and learn from one another, about what works, what doesn\u2019t and why. Meetings like those taking place this week are an important step in the right direction.</p> <p><em>Sir Peter Gluckman (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterGluckman\">@PeterGluckman</a>) is</em> <a href=\"http://www.pmcsa.org.nz/\">c</a><em><a href=\"http://www.pmcsa.org.nz/\">hief science advisor to the prime minister of New Zealand</a> and chair of the <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/\">International Network for Government Science Advice</a> </em>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ingsciadvice\">@INGSciAdvice</a>). <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameswilsdon\">James Wilsdon</a> is professor of research policy</em><em> at the <a>University of Sheffield</a>, and vice-chair of <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/\">INGSA</a>.

Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/14/uk-development-minister-challenged-over-wasted-aid-claim\">when challenged in parliament</a> over her claims she couldn\u2019t put a figure on it.</p> <p>All independent audits of the effectiveness of the UK\u2019s aid programme give the Department for International Development (DfID) the highest marks.

  "<p>The world\u2019s largest waste-to-biogas conversion plant is gearing up for a grand opening next spring in Northwich, north-west England, using advanced enzyme technology to handle unsorted domestic waste. </p> <p>Around 15 tonnes of trash per hour \u2013 120,000 tonnes a year \u2013 will be sorted at the <a href=\"http://www.dongenergy.co.uk/uk-business-activities/renescience-northwich-bioresource-project\" rel=\"nofollow\">REnescience</a> plant in a process that will power nearly 10,000 homes, according to Dong Energy, which runs the project. The Danish energy company has invested \u00a360m in the Northwich venture, which will use trash collections by local councils in Chester and Wigan to produce 5MW of renewable energy.</p> <p>Its energy conversion process works by separating organic matter such as paper and foods from other waste streams and then \u201cwashing\u201d it free of contaminants using enzymes in a giant reactor. </p> <p>\u201cThe enzymes take out all the organic compounds in the waste material and liquefy them so that, after washing, they come out as the perfect sludge, full of fats and oils, that can be converted to biogas,\u201d says Thomas Schr\u00f8der, a bio-refining vice-president for Novozymes, which developed the enzymes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97378aca2cf520d791ce307fc192806d2a86d460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97378aca2cf520d791ce307fc192806d2a86d460/0_773_5152_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dong Energy\u2019s Northwich waste-to-biogas project\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction of Dong Energy\u2019s Northwich waste-to-biogas project is underway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The slurry generates a gas byproduct when eaten by naturally-occurring bacteria, which in turn creates heat and energy when burned in the plant\u2019s on-site engines. </p> <p>Other waste streams such as plastics and glass are syphoned off for recycling.

The organic residues from the process cannot be spread safely on land and will just feed incinerators or other combustion processes, and eventually landfills. Burning material remains a failure in a circular economy perspective. There are much better solutions that could be implemented.\u201d</p> <p>Even after incineration, some waste remains \u2013 such as bottom ash \u2013 are landfilled. </p> <p>Dalsgaard argues that Dong is already working on ways to improve the technology\u2019s recycling rates, and expects big improvements in the years ahead. For now, he says, \u201cthe truly new feature of REnescience is the effectiveness by which it captures the organic part of the waste, ensuring much higher green gas yields than from source sorting.\u201d</p> <p>As Dong sees it, the technology\u2019s key advantages also include its convenience for householders and compatibility with current market models. </p> <p>\u201cThe higher the household waste organic content \u2013 food, papers, cards, all contaminated waste \u2013 the higher the gas yield will be,\u201d says Kanstrup. \u201cBut we don\u2019t necessarily see this as a direct competitor [to sorted collections].

The disease was first found in south-east England, but <a href=\"http://www.froglife.org/what-we-do/disease-ranavirus-2/\">has since spread across the UK</a> with recorded outbreaks in Cornwall, Cardiff, Lancashire and Newcastle. </p> <p>While the pathogen spreads with the natural movement of amphibian populations, the expansion of its range appears to have been exacerbated by human-assisted movement of infected animals and contaminated materials between garden ponds and commercial aquatics retailers, the study found. </p> <p>\u201cRanavirus is one of the most serious health threats currently facing the UK\u2019s amphibian population, so our findings that humans seem to have helped move the virus around, facilitating its rapid spread, could be translated into some straightforward ways to manage the risk of disease outbreaks,\u201d said lead author, Dr Stephen Price. </p> <p>Well-meaning homeowners stocking their garden ponds with frogs, fish or spawn translocated from neighbouring ponds or beyond could inadvertently be fuelling the spread of this serious amphibian disease, he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e759a4750ba56ad544f07cf51ef5d9d7a3e97eda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e759a4750ba56ad544f07cf51ef5d9d7a3e97eda/0_0_5100_3405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dead frog in a London garden, possibly from ranavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dead frog in a London garden, possibly from ranavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nic Hamilton Photographic/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want to discourage people from adding ponds to their urban gardens \u2013 this remains one of the most positive steps we can all take to support wildlife \u2013 but equally we would strongly urge people to try to limit how much potentially infectious material they\u2019re moving into and out of their gardens in the process.\u201d</p> <p>All species are susceptible to ranavirus but it mostly affects Britain\u2019s native common frog (<em>Rana temporaria</em>) and common toad species (<em>Bufo bufo</em>). </p> <p>Outbreaks of the disease are characterised by large numbers of dead amphibians in water bodies or individual sick animals that show symptoms including reddening and ulceration of the skin, internal bleeding and loss of digits.</p> <p>The disease is highly infectious and can survive in the environment for more than two months. </p> <p>The study found the risk of disease was higher in areas of higher human density, and that fewer disease outbreaks occurred in less affluent neighbourhoods.</p> <p>The work, which also involved University College London and Herpetofauna Consultants International and was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, was based on two decades of citizen science data recorded by the <a href=\"http://www.gardenwildlifehealth.org/\">Frog Mortality Project</a>.</p>",

For example, Uber reserves the right to deactivate its drivers\u2019 account and restrict them from using the app.</p> <p>And because Uber\u2019s app sets the price of a fare, workers effectively have a cap on how much they earn.</p> <p>An Uber spokesman says that \u201cdriver partners have full control over when, how often and for how long they drive, meaning they can log in and out of the app whenever they choose\u201d.</p> <p>He adds that drivers are free to work across multiple apps, another factor that may make a court less likely to find its drivers are employees.</p> <p>Although he declines to make a prediction on how any cases would turn, Stewart says it is \u201cinherently more plausible that Airtasker is simply connecting people that want to provide work with those that want to use their services\u201d than Uber, which \u201cis a brand associated with transportation services\u201d.</p> <p>A Foodora spokeswoman says it is confident it is not exploiting any loopholes in the way it engages delivery drivers, while a Deliveroo spokeswoman says its drivers are independent contractors.</p> <p>\u201cWe offer work in the form of deliveries.

Although about 1m Australians work as independent contractors in their main job, a stable 10% over the past 10 to 15 years, it remains to be seen whether the gig economy will drive an increase in that number.</p> <p>He says the government would need to consider legislative responses including changes to labour law, tax, superannuation, safety, injury compensation and even welfare, after the Productivity Commission said the rise of the gig economy and automation could require consideration of a universal basic income.</p> <p>For unions the task is clearer \u2013 with the Airtasker case, they hope to exert some industrial pressure so that workers have more choice than merely to work or not to work.</p> <p>And there may be some middle ground. Fung says he is relaxed about increasing recommended pay rates because Airtasker would take a cut of a bigger pie if users responded positively.</p> <p>It\u2019s the tug of war between what users will pay and workers will work for that is barely mediated by the Airtasker platform at all. If Unions NSW and the Maurice Blackburn cases don\u2019t succeed, it will be no business of employment law either. Then the future of work will have arrived.</p>",
  "<p>Last week in Richmond, the Melbourne writer and feminist Clementine Ford was crossing the road when a young man wound down his car window and started shouting at her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best! You\u2019re the best!\u201d it sounded like he was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy immediate thought was, \u2018He\u2019s taking the piss,\u2019 \u201d Ford says. At this point in her public life as a feminist commentator \u2013 a woman who has spent the past few years of her career fielding abuse from all corners of the internet and beyond \u2013 that initial distrust makes a sad kind of sense.</p> <p>But it turned out instead that this guy was a fan. He had contacted her previously to tip her off about \u201csome rumbling in the 4chan forums\u201d, whose users had been attempting a denial of service (DoS) attack against her.</p> <p>That night he emailed her and said: \u201cI saw you in my car today and yelled hello to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I am constantly pleasantly surprised by,\u201d she tells me. \u201cYet at the same time, over the last few years, I\u2019ve developed a much bigger suspicion of men. I\u2019ll meet someone and think, \u2018Are you that person who said those terrible things online? Are you one of those private school boys who is just viciously disgusting about women on my Facebook page?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking at the right spots of the internet, you\u2019ll hear as many passionate arguments from both men and women about why Ford is wrong as you will hear from others who are just as passionately convinced that she\u2019s on to something true; that in her columns, posts and TV spots she\u2019s been able to articulate an injustice that exists in plain sight, but which deep conditioning has blinded us to. </p> <p>Unleashing such conflict would be uncomfortable for many, but Ford, 35, is a flamethrower. Society needs to be shaken up to become more equitable, she argues, and this is just the start \u2013 and if her version of feminism has proved divisive, that\u2019s because it has to be. \u201cThere\u2019s no point placating,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it works.\u201d So she\u2019s led feminism back into the boxing ring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/status/760395927328743428\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Every time someone calls me a &#39;feminazi&#39;, I power up by 5 points.</p>&mdash; Clementine Ford (@clementine_ford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/status/760395927328743428\">August 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Many of the conversations Ford has dived into headfirst first appeared on the Fairfax website Daily Life.

Joyless harpy, jealous of the prettier girls. Dumb fat cow. Ugly femmo.\u201d). Abuse seems to have acted as both a spur and a thorn, and in many ways is inseparable from her work.</p> <p>Ford says: \u201cThe reason it [the abuse] is so prominent [in the book] is because I experience a lot of it, but also because I see other women experience it and they do that silencing thing \u2013 they don\u2019t want to write, they don\u2019t want to speak out. There are women who delete their social media account if some guy they don\u2019t even know comes in and disagrees with something they said in a really vicious way.\u201d </p> <p>Ford, on the other hand, fights back \u2013 naming and shaming men who verbally attack or threaten her, and often replying to them publicly. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/status/772358937874096128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I knew having a baby would confuse the angry scared little men. <a href=\"https://t.co/TcdF5lBs8f\">pic.twitter.com/TcdF5lBs8f</a></p>&mdash; Clementine Ford (@clementine_ford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/status/772358937874096128\">September 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/status/748523730561708034\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Isn&#39;t it great that people like this have easy access to guns? <a href=\"https://t.co/15DOMcUDkq\">pic.twitter.com/15DOMcUDkq</a></p>&mdash; Clementine Ford (@clementine_ford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clementine_ford/status/748523730561708034\">June 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Do a quick Google search of \u201cClementine Ford\u201d and you\u2019ll find feminism hate sites, where men gather to discuss her and upload her tweets, as if compiling a dossier on an enemy.

I think that [this new wave of feminism online] is also what\u2019s scaring men who engage in that behaviour because they have always just experienced us as a group of separate individuals that can be shut down one by one. They don\u2019t know how to deal with women as a bloc, so they\u2019ve ramped up their methods and abuse.

  "<p>Indigenous peoples are part blockading one of the main tributaries of the River Amazon and demanding that Peru\u2019s new president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski visit them - with no positive response to date. The protest is one of the latest instances of social unrest across Peru and in Loreto in particular, which, at 50% larger than the UK, is Peru\u2019s biggest and most difficult-to-access region - as well as one of the poorest.</p> <p>This poverty, together with poor infrastructure and a weak or non-existent state, is particularly outrageous given that some of Peru\u2019s historically most productive oil fields are in Loreto. True, more than 40 years of operations, mostly by foreign companies, have transformed the region to the extent that the economy is now largely dependent on oil, generating wealth through tax revenues and casual employment for many people. But how have such revenues been spent? And what of the fact that the location of the oil fields has meant the systematic invasion and exploitation of huge swathes of indigenous peoples\u2019 territories - allegedly contaminating rivers and local inhabitants, blocking efforts by communities to obtain land title, creating economic dependency, dominating local politics, buying off leaders, misleading community members, dumping trash, wasting staggering amounts of energy and resources, and, in general, leaving precious little behind in terms of infrastructure, basic services, education, beneficial projects and skilled, sustainable employment?<br></p> <p>The problems caused by operations in this region tend to only make Peruvian or international media when there is some kind of \u201cspill\u201d - oil painting black the forest, fish, fauna. None has been recently reported where the protestors are, but not far upriver approximately <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/09/negotiations-and-protests-ongoing-in-wake-of-oil-spills-in-peruvian-amazon/\">4,000 barrels were spilled</a>, by the North Peruvian Pipeline, in mid-August at a community called Nuevo Alianza. Then another spill was reported on 24 September along the River Pastaza near the border with Ecuador, and then yet another was reported the following day upriver from Nuevo Alianza. As of 12 August 2016 Peru\u2019s government agency regulating energy and mining, OSINERGMIN, had registered 190 pipeline spills across the country since 1997 - although it attributes 67 of them to vandalism.<br></p> <p>One indigenous leader involved in this struggle is Kichwa man Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn, currently at the protest. Here, in an interview on 24 September with the Guardian in Loreto\u2019s capital, Iquitos, Fach\u00edn gives his take on what is happening there and in Loreto in general: </p> <p>DH: Where exactly is the protest taking place?</p> <p>JF: It\u2019s on the River Maranon at the oil pumping station at Saramuro [the start of the North Peruvian Pipeline running from Loreto to Peru\u2019s Pacific coast].</p> <p>DH: How many people, more or less?</p> <p>JF: We\u2019re talking about more than 2000 indigenous people. And more keep arriving, gathering there.</p> <p>DH: How long have the protesters been there for?</p> <p>JF: It\u2019s an indefinite protest. It\u2019s been going on 24 days now [as of 24 September] and it will continue until their demands are met. And they\u2019re asking, to resolve those demands, that the country\u2019s leading authorities visit: the president or prime minister and relevant ministers, such as the Minister of Energy and Mining, Health, Education, Agriculture and Economy and Finance. They\u2019re also requesting Loreto\u2019s four congressmen, the regional governor, the president of Perupetro, the president of Petroperu, and Pluspetrol\u2019s general manager. That\u2019s what they\u2019re requesting - to discuss, at a political level, the viability of oil activity in that region. That\u2019s what\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s why they want those people.</p> <p>DH: What are the main problems? That\u2019s to say, why are people there protesting? What are the complaints?</p> <p>JF: Well, this is the result of all the oil spills over the last few years. People can\u2019t take any more. So they\u2019re protesting. The main reason is the contamination over the last 40 years - and the issue of doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2016/jan/14/look-at-the-oil-spilled-in-the-worlds-2nd-best-place-for-wildlife\">remediation in Lot 8</a> [a concession held by state-owned company Petroperu until 1996 and then Pluspetrol since then], Lot 192 [held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/indigenous-peruvians-amazon-pollution-settlement-us-oil-occidental\">US-based company Occidental</a> before 2000, by Pluspetrol from 2000 to August 2015, and now by Canadian-headquartered Pacific Exploration and Production], and along all the pipelines. Another issue is the proposed Law on Environmental Vigilance and Monitoring - for that to be discussed. Another issue is the revision of Pluspetrol\u2019s contract [for Lot 8], given that it\u2019s been working for many years there with total impunity. Another issue is fixing, or replacing, the North Peruvian Pipeline [run by Petroperu].</p> <p>DH: It\u2019s not only the North Peruvian Pipeline where there are spills or leaks, right? There are other pipelines.</p> <p>JF: There\u2019s an entire network. We want to discuss this and have a technical study done to see what has happened to this infrastructure after 40 years.</p> <p>DH: The companies have worked there for 40 years?</p> <p>JF: More than 40 years. 45 years, there or thereabouts. More than four decades. The pipelines are leaking now. Just today there was a leak, in Andoas [on the River Pastaza]. They\u2019re looking into how much was spilt. </p> <p>DH: When was that?</p> <p>JF: Lot 192. It\u2019s just been made public. There are spills in the oil concessions themselves as well as along the transport routes. </p> <p>DH: Is the contamination the result of the spills only, or other oil operations?</p> <p>JF: No. The contamination is the result of many things. One is that for more than 35 years companies have been dumping their production waters into the rivers, directly, into tributaries, lakes, pools. Across the four rivers [Corrientes, Maranon, Pastaza, Tigre]. That stopped in 2009. In addition, there has also been contamination caused by the chemical waste in the oil installations. The other cause has been the spills. So there are many factors. And after 40 years things are the same. People are tired of it. The round-tables we\u2019ve held have come to nothing. We don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to do the clean-up. That\u2019s why now there\u2019s an indefinite protest. We\u2019re tired of discussing it with state functionaries who don\u2019t have the capacity to solve the problem. That\u2019s why we want the ministers to come - and the companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c11ee8be29bd7c9e3ef87145b6a5685c8d21d6a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c11ee8be29bd7c9e3ef87145b6a5685c8d21d6a0/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn at a protest on the River Tigre in the Peruvian Amazon in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Fach\u00edn at a protest on the River Tigre in the Peruvian Amazon in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DH: Has anyone from the state or government turned up yet?</p> <p>JF: The regional governor [Fernando Melendez]. He agreed that he would transmit our message, our demands, to the national government. But he misunderstood. He didn\u2019t listen closely. As a result, they sent a commission [to Iquitos] - more functionaries - but the protesters won\u2019t speak with them. They want to speak to the ministers and the companies.</p> <p>DH: Who\u2019s on the commission [which has since been reported to have returned to Lima]?</p> <p>JF: A Vice-Minister from the Ministry of Culture, which, according to them, is the state institution responsible for this issue. We don\u2019t accept that. It isn\u2019t the state institution responsible. Another is a presidential advisor. We\u2019re fed up of talking to advisers. We continue insisting on wanting to talk to the ministers. </p> <p>DH: About the pipeline spills. . . Sometimes the government, state or Petroperu say they\u2019re caused by \u201ccuts\u201d - a type of sabotage. What would you say to that?</p> <p>JF: We\u2019ve responded to this before. It\u2019s not that it isn\u2019t impossible that sometimes there is sabotage. Sabotage is possible. But linking it to indigenous peoples is a real stretch. You go to an indigenous community and you\u2019ll see no one has the knowledge or technical capacity to do it. What we\u2019ve learnt is that these are overseen by the companies themselves to cover up their own responsibility. It\u2019s a strategy they\u2019re using.</p> <p>DH: Wait. You\u2019re saying sometimes there are cuts but that it\u2019s the company, or someone connected to the company, that\u2019s doing it?</p> <p>JF: There are interests in doing that. Strategically it suits their purposes to blame indigenous peoples and say the spills are caused by them. We have sources, who want to remain anonymous, and they know that this is effectively overseen by the company - and it suits them. You go to a community and you\u2019d see they have no equipment to do this kind of thing. Where would they get it? You can\u2019t use just any piece of equipment to sabotage a pipeline. </p> <p>DH: Sometimes the pipeline is underwater too.</p> <p>JF: Underwater. So how do you think an indigenous man is going to be able to cause a spill? It\u2019s impossible. We\u2019ve responded to this idea and we don\u2019t accept it - but it doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t happen. It could happen. Someone could do it, but it\u2019s not part of indigenous people\u2019s culture to do this sort of thing. </p> <p>DH: What are the impacts of the contamination? </p> <p>JF: The impacts are very visible. A week ago we went to [an installation in Lot 8] and nearby found dead fish. In a lake across which a Pluspetrol pipeline crosses. With Petroperu, it\u2019s exactly the same: the fish are dying where there are spills. And the impacts are worse when the rivers swell.</p> <p>DH: Who are the indigenous peoples participating in the protest? </p> <p>JF: There are the Achuar people, Urarina people, Cocamas, Kichwas. . . And the others are joining. . . We\u2019re in a country where there is no strict protection. What would happen today if indigenous peoples said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want oil operations in this area\u201d and they closed it down? It wouldn\u2019t take much for the state to send in the army or navy. That\u2019s the type of country we\u2019re living in.</p> <p>DH: Are there other things the protestors want? E.g. better services in their communities, health posts, schools, electricity, jobs?</p> <p>JF: Compensation from the state for use of indigenous territories, which would take the form of an investment plan for health, education and alternative projects. Other requests are that land is titled according to [the International Labour Organization\u2019s] Convention 169, that prior consultation is done for Lot 192, and that a truth commission is set up to investigate the impunity with which oil activities have taken place over the last four decades.</p> <p>DH: Last question. Obviously oil is very important for Loreto. Many people work in the industry. How do you see, therefore, the region\u2019s future? </p> <p>JF: Loreto\u2019s oil future, right now, is bleak because of the international context, although the national government\u2019s policy, for more than 30 years, has been oriented towards oil. But that is no longer Loreto\u2019s future. Loreto, strategically, has been made dependent on oil by past governments. As a result of activity declining, Loreto is now in total crisis because the economy depends on oil, and for indigenous peoples it\u2019s even worse because their territories have been impoverished and there have been serious environmental impacts. How can one talk about oil having a future when it has such a past? But to suddenly stop an extractive operation is very difficult - very difficult - because there are many poor people who depend on it for work. What\u2019s the future of oil? That\u2019s now the largest issue being discussed. Diversification of the economy, tourism, the forestry sector - but with very clear laws - environmental services, biodiversity, other alternative activities. . . There are many potential options to explore, but there hasn\u2019t been any interest in doing so because policy is designed from the top - and what the top wants for Loreto is to divide it up into oil concessions so the entire Amazon can be explored and exploited and companies continue operating and contaminating. That\u2019s the strategy for Loreto. For people in Lima, for the rest of the country, Loreto is just a place where you exploit oil. Nothing else. </p> <p>DH: Thank you, Jos\u00e9.</p> <p>JF: Thank you. </p> <p>Petroperu did not provide comment in response to Fach\u00edn\u2019s claims about pipeline sabotage.</p>",
  "<p>Australia should follow the lead of the US in requiring public companies to disclose how much their chief executive makes each year directly compared with an \u201caverage\u201d rank-and file-employee. Ballooning executive pay contributes to <a href=\"http://inequality.org/income-inequality/\">income inequality</a> and the CEO pay ratio provides a measure of the <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102541\">pay gap between the top and bottom income levels in the economy</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/wallstreetreform-cpa.pdf\">US companies will be required to disclose</a> from 1 January 2017 the ratio of pay of a chief executive\u2019s annual total remuneration to the median annual total remuneration of all company employees. UK companies are also subject to a variation of the CEO pay ratio rule, <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2013/9780111100318/schedule\">requiring the disclosure</a> of the boss\u2019s remuneration compared with employees. In Australia companies don\u2019t have to disclose this ratio, although companies do disclose information about remuneration for executives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/18/wages-growth-is-at-record-lows-unless-youre-a-commonwealth-bank-ceo\">Wages growth is at a record low \u2013 unless you're a Commonwealth Bank CEO | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disclosing the ratio provides greater transparency and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pay-ratios-could-curb-excessive-ceo-pay-and-counter-inequality-54496\">places some restraints on escalating remuneration</a>. Chief executives in the US are paid about <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\">300 times</a> the median employee wage, while in the UK the ratio is roughly <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/highpaycentre.org/files/The_Pay_Today_draft.pdf\">183:1</a>.</p> <p>The graphic below shows CEO pay compared with the average annual Australian pretax salary for a selection of large Australian companies. Comparing CEO pay against the median pay of a worker at the same company is the ideal way to compare ratios, given that companies in some sectors pay workers higher across the board. But a comparison with the average worker salary also provides insight into income inequality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"iframed\">  <iframe src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/27t8r/5/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"100%\" height=\"920\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Commonwealth Bank has the highest CEO pay ratio in our sample, with Ian Narev earning more than 100 times the salary of an average worker. Even the lowest paid chief executive in our sample earned 15 times the average Australian annual salary. The figures for many of the corporations were impacted by the inclusion of bonus or equity elements of pay. For example, Fortescue Metals is the second highest ranked when salary and bonus are considered, but falls to sixth place when equity-based remuneration is also considered.</p> <p>There\u2019s quite a debate about what actually makes up CEO pay. Some argue that US pay ratios are more like 70 to one when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/ceo-pay\">only cash remuneration</a> is taken into account. Others include equity claims exercised \u2013 like stock options \u2013 and come up with a much higher ratio of something like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\">300 to one</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iGvSP/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"100%\" height=\"870\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Cash bonuses paid to chief executives are likewise controversial, with some suggestions that observed reductions in CEO pay levels in 2015-16 are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-31/australian-ceo-pay-packets-fall-but-bonuses-rise/7799656\">simply a case of shifting pay into cash bonuses rather than cash salaries</a>. Certainly the ranking of our sample firms change when cash bonuses are included, indicating that bonuses are a significant source of remuneration. A cash bonus is effectively the same as a salary if it\u2019s very likely to be paid and so should logically form part of the pay ratio.</p> <p>The CEO pay ratio is an important measure of income inequality over time and Australian regulators should consider making this information mandatory. This would greatly enhance comparability with US and UK companies.</p> <p>Research evidence describes wide differences in CEO remuneration across the world, with US CEO pay described as an outlier at 23% greater than the UK and 55% greater than continental Europe, thereby contributing to <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102541\">income inequality</a> in that country.</p> <p>Disclosure of the ratio would allow Australian investors to understand better where a particular chief executive lies in terms of pay packet size relative to other firms of similar size and industry.</p> <p>In recent years, Australian corporate boards have been subject to the two-strikes legislation under which shareholders vote on the company\u2019s remuneration report at the annual general meeting. Any company receiving 25% or more of no votes from eligible shareholders at two consecutive meetings must <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/executive-pay-pain-wont-go-away-18696\">put a motion to shareholders to spill the board</a>.</p> <p>The increased accountability around remuneration resulting from the two-strikes rule has provided shareholder and lobby groups with solid evidence about executive pay levels and disclosure. For example, the Australian Shareholders\u2019 Association <a href=\"https://www.australianshareholders.com.au/companies\">actively monitors the remuneration of selected corporations</a> with the intention of influencing remuneration report voting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.corrs.com.au/thinking/insights/proxy-advisers-in-the-interests-of-market-integrity-it-s-time-for-reform/\">Proxy advisers also have an important role to play in lobbying institutional investors</a> on remuneration voting. Disclosure of the Australian CEO pay ratio would be a useful input to that discussion.</p> <p>While the two-strikes legislation has improved corporate accountability around executive pay, disclosure of the CEO pay ratio would provide a useful summary measure to voting investors, independent of location and currency.</p> <p>Historically, executive pay has not always been at the current controversial levels but has steadily increased since the mid-1970s, an increase which has continued after the global financial crisis. Disclosure of CEO pay ratios gives everyone a consistent and meaningful yardstick by which to measure income equality.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australia-should-compare-ceo-and-average-worker-pay-like-the-us-and-uk-65898\">originally published by the Conversation</a>. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/julie-walker-5078\">Julie Walker</a> is an associate professor in accounting at the University of Queensland</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/65898/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>"
