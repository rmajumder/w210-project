[
  "<p>This year, a Fifa football tournament took place that included no superstar players or teams from the global sport; in fact, there was no pitch and no ball.</p> <p>Despite these disadvantages, live coverage of the final was shown in more than 100 countries to an audience of about 5 million and generated 40m comments on Facebook and Twitter. That\u2019s how sporting success is measured nowadays.</p> <p>The event was the Fifa Interactive World Cup, an annual e-sports competition, featuring the world\u2019s best gamers, competing in the multimillion-selling Fifa computer game series. For a growing number of fans, these teen and 20-something cyber athletes are a new kind of star in international football, securing their own lucrative sponsorship deals and attracting huge numbers of viewers to their official channels on YouTube and Twitch, a live streaming service.</p> <p>More than a dozen major clubs around the world, including West Ham and Manchester City, have now employed Fifa players to represent them in e-sports competitions and this blurring of the lines between the real and virtual sports is something publisher Electronic Arts is very keen to foster.</p> <p>Since its inception in 1993, the Fifa series has sought to replicate every facet of the professional game, forging licensing deals with international sides and clubs all over the world to use their player names and stadiums.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/28/how-they-definitely-didnt-make-fifa-17-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55vxh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2755664\"            data-video-name=\"How they definitely didn't make Fifa 17 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ea5f6be4b0f707b26af542\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160928Fifa17_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160928Fifa17_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160928Fifa17.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/28/how-they-definitely-didnt-make-fifa-17-video\">How they definitely didn\u2019t make Fifa 17</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Fifa 17, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/13/fifa-17-new-engine-new-story-mode-and-five-more-key-additions\">which comes out later this month</a>, features more than 650 sides from 30 leagues, and hundreds of key players have been digitally scanned in HD detail to ensure accurate facial likenesses. It is a process that has led to the game\u2019s dominance of the sports sim genre, shifting more than 7 million copies a year. But it is not always smooth.</p> <p>This week, Iceland\u2019s football association, KSI, complained about the small sum of $15,000 (\u00a311,500) it was offered to feature the country\u2019s national side in the latest Fifa title. \u201cThey are the ones buying these rights and they almost want it for free,\u201d KSI president Geir \u00deorsteinsson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37424733\">told the BBC</a>. \u201cThe performance at the Euros show that we are quite a good team and many would like to play with our team.\u201d</p> <p>Electronic Arts will not comment on individual deals, but David Rutter, vice president and executive producer of the Fifa series, concedes that these negotiations are a vital \u2013 and challenging \u2013 element of the development process. \u201cWe have a dedicated team who manage licences with clubs, leagues, and partners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is sometime straightforward. It is sometimes complex.\u201d</p> <p>Things seem to have gone much more smoothly with the English Premier League. In 2010, Electronic Arts inked a deal to become the organisation\u2019s technology partner, with EA Sports branding appearing on all televised matches and EA sponsorship of the league\u2019s player performance index, which gathers stats on all Premier matches. In August, EA Sports <a href=\"https://www.premierleague.com/news/67814\">became the lead partner of the Premier League</a>, giving it even greater access to clubs and players.</p> <p>But in a troubled sector, where corruption scandals and rising ticket prices are alienating fans, the integration between the Fifa franchise and the real sport of football is mutually beneficial. EA gets the official credentials, but Fifa gets to connect with a young demographic that is moving away from viewing mainstream televised sports or attending matches and toward watching YouTubers and e-sports. </p> <p>According to market analyst Super Data, the global e-sports market will be worth $1bn in 2017, the revenue coming from advertising, ticket sales and merchandise, with a global online audience of more than 200 million.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57e557515b18bbab806c78c5ce14962a39f9d772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e557515b18bbab806c78c5ce14962a39f9d772/0_322_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iceland at Euro 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iceland\u2019s performance at Euro 2016 led to a disagreement over the fee paid to the country\u2019s football association for inclusion in this year\u2019s title/</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Langlois/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you look into certain sports in the US \u2013 like baseball where the average viewer is 53 [years old] or to niche sports like Nascar and wrestling \u2013 e-sports can compete,\u201d said Manny Anekal, founder of e-sports media company Versus Sports. \u201cIn fact, just this past week, the Turner Sports eLeague actually drew more viewers in both \u2018total\u2019 and \u201818-34 [years old] demographics than the televised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">[Chelsea v Liverpool Premier League match]</a>. That was pretty impressive to me.\u201d</p> <p>Through the Fifa titles, then, the sport has a chance to reconnect with a young viewer base and thereby maintain its lucrative advertising deals with youth brands such as Coke and Adidas. \u201cA lot of kids are getting priced out of going to matches, especially with the English Premier League,\u201dsays David Bytheway, a pro Fifa player who now represents<strong> <br></strong>German Bundesliga side Wolfsburg in Fifa tournaments.</p> <p>\u201cOne of Wolfsburg\u2019s main strategies in getting involved with Fifa is to connect with their fans in the interactive world. When children get home from school, switching on the TV isn\u2019t the first thing they\u2019re doing anymore \u2013 they\u2019re going onto YouTube watching celebrity gamers. Football clubs need to reach these fans.\u201d</p> <p>Until this year, Fifa was a minor player in an e-sports world dominated by titles such as League of Legends and Call of Duty. In December 2015, however, EA announced the EA Competitive Gaming Division, dedicated to organising official worldwide tournaments with prize pools over more than $1m. It is this formalisation that has attracted real-world clubs to the sector.</p> <p>\u201cE-sports is a market worth of $700m a year, there\u2019s real potential there,\u201d says Bytheway. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for clubs to get involved. There are whole new groups of fans that teams can be attracting.</p> <p>Electronic Arts\u2019 Rutter adds: \u201cThere was some research in the US a little while ago that told us 50% of Fifa fans in the States become interested in football after they play the video game.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I will ever get used to watching the game become increasingly embedded in the sport and culture, like seeing it on TV, or hearing and meeting all of the musicians that play the game, seeing it trend worldwide on Twitter, or hearing from NBA and NFL athletes who want to get their copy early.\u201d</p> <p>Most of all, Electronic Arts has been smart about hijacking the football conversations in playgrounds around the country. Since 2008, the game has included an Ultimate Team mode, which operates like a digital version of the old Panini football sticker album \u2013 fans buy randomised \u2018packets\u2019 of players via an online store and use these cards to build their own fantasy football squads for use within the game. Comparing decks with friends and improving their teams is now a key part of the game; earlier this year, EA CFO Blake Jorgensen revealed to investors that Ultimate Team alone was generating around $650m a year for the company.</p> <p>But it is also the main focus for Fifa YouTubers who make videos about their best cards and teams. One of those YouTubers, KSI, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtFOytbRpEvzLjvqGG5gxQ\">has 15m subscribers</a> and many of his videos follow him as he opens new digital packs. Last year, he was in the top five YouTube highest earners making $4.5m from advertising and sponsorship on his channel.</p> <p>Once again, through Ultimate Team-obsessed YouTube stars, Fifa is creating synergies between different fanbases and bringing football to new audiences. \u201cSomeone doesn\u2019t have to be a massive football fan to be into Fifa,\u201d says YouTuber Jack54HD, who has more than half a million subscribers. \u201cThey may see their favourite YouTuber making videos about the game and get an interest from there. Fifa has opened football up to a whole new market.\u201d</p> <p>For Generation Z, a demographic brought up on the internet, social media and online channels, football the sport has just become another part of their online digital consumption. Jack54HD is certain that if you ask certain teenagers who their football heroes are, they are now just as likely to name a Fifa YouTuber as they are an actual athlete.</p> <p>\u201cTake these big YouTubers like The Sideman, Spencer FC,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re running these charity matches at massive football stadiums and they\u2019re getting 20,000-30,000 fans coming along, purely to see them playing. Your readers might not have heard of them, but for the younger generation, these YouTubers aren\u2019t just celebrities \u2013 they\u2019re becoming role models.\u201d</p>",

Obama cited the potential for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the US, its diplomats and military personnel. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress by voice vote, with final House passage coming just two days before Obama led the country in marking the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001.</li> <li>Billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson plans to donate as much as $25m to a Super Pac supporting Donald Trump \u2013 more than five times what he had been expected to contribute.

Senate minority leader Harry Reid contacted the director of the FBI, asking for the bureau to examine the \u201csignificant and disturbing ties\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, including meetings between Page and high-ranked Kremlin officials, say Yahoo. </p> <p>The news comes as two senior Democrats, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committe, and Representative Adam Schiff, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, released a joint statement on how they believe Russian intelligence agencies are trying to influence the US election.</p> <p>\u201cBased on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\u201d t<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/23/top-democrats-determine-that-russia-behind-spate-cyberattacks.html\">hey said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAt the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election... orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Many in the FBI believe that hacking of the Democratic National Convention emails just days before the DNC began was by Russia. </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-s-intel-officials-probe-ties-between-trump-adviser-and-kremlin-175046002.html\">Yahoo reports</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow \u2014 Igor Diveykin.

He writes on his site The Insurgent, <a href=\"http://theresurgent.com/evan-mcmullin-a-sane-alternative/\">calling McMullin the \u201csane alternative\u201d</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is Evan McMullin\u2019s candidacy is a long shot. His best shot is winning a few states to throw the race to the House of Representatives where, though he may not get the Presidency, he might ensure neither Trump nor Hillary get it. To do this he would have to win a few blue states, which though difficult is not impossible. Surprisingly, he is already beginning to register in polls in red states like Utah and purple states like Virginia.</p> <p>Frankly, Evan McMullin may actually serve a more important role in 2016. Though he may not win, he might at least provide disaffected conservatives an excuse to show up and vote down ballot. Saving the Senate and House of Representatives from the Democrats has to be a priority for conservatives, but many are so disgusted by 2016 that they will not even show up in November.</p> <p>McMullin gives people a reason to show up. He gives conservatives someone they can vote for without holding their nose. He gives people someone to vote for instead of reconciling themselves to voting against someone. McMullin\u2019s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. For many, that will be enough.</p> <p>A lot of people have been writing me, begging me to reconsider Donald Trump. They think this is the last best chance to get this nation right. They think we will turn a corner after which we cannot turn back. In truth, I have concluded we are already past the point of redemption when the best either party can do is offer up Clinton or Trump.

  "<p>Autumn 1992. Tony Pulis is a rookie manager at Bournemouth setting out on the long road that has brought him to the point of his 1,000th match. His first company car, a gift from the chairman, Norman Hayward, has already been to the garage after smoke started pouring out of the dashboard on the M3 and Pulis is getting an early lesson in the economics of lower-division football.</p> <p>\u201cThe chairman has bought me a car that\u2019s about 20 years old,\u201d Pulis recalls. \u201cMoney meant everything to him. We went to watch Grimsby play one night. We drove up in his Mercedes, then all the way back and he dropped me off where my car, this enormous old shack, was parked by the road in Fordingbridge. The windscreen was iced up so I turned on my engine and Norman got out his credit card to try to get the ice off. As he was scraping away, I could suddenly hear him going: \u2018Oh my God, no! I can\u2019t believe it!\u2019 I thought he must have broken his credit card. He\u2019d actually just seen my tax disc. \u2018They\u2019ve given you 12 months,\u2019 he was shouting: \u2018I told them six months.\u2019 I&#xa0;said: \u2018Thanks Norman, that gives me loads of confidence.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Almost a quarter of a century on, Pulis is on the threshold of joining the 1,000 Club, or what Sir Alex Ferguson calls \u201cthe band of brothers\u201d. He will become the 25th manager on the list, meaning a place in the League Managers Association\u2019s hall of fame, and there is a neat symmetry about the West Bromwich Albion manager marking the achievement against Stoke City, the club he found \u201cdrifting nowhere\u201d and took to the Premier League.</p> <p>One of his interviews in the past few days began with a television reporter mischievously asking Pulis what had changed over the past 999 games, then adding: \u201cObviously not your tactics.\u201d Only a joke, perhaps, and Pulis is willing to send himself up on that front. \u201cPreston away, 1-1, August 15, 1992,\u201d he says of his first match in management. \u201cJohn Beck was the Preston manager and the corners of their pitch were filled with sand so the ball would stay in play. I learned from him, you see \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He can see the funny side but, at 58, Pulis has grown wearily accustomed to people denigrating his management style. \u201cYou get pigeonholed. You accept it or you fight it. I\u2019ve accepted it. That\u2019s what people think and it doesn\u2019t bother me. People go on about my style of play. But I tell you what I do \u2013 I go into football clubs, I try to find out what systems suit the players and I try to get the damnedest out of those players. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done everywhere I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve got a load of centre-halves who can\u2019t pass. You want them to pass out from the back, but you have to look at their strengths and work round that.\u201d</p> <p>For the most part, that formula has been successful; otherwise Pulis would not be here looking back on a 24-year career that has taken him from Bournemouth to Gillingham, Bristol City, Portsmouth, Stoke, Plymouth, back to Stoke, Crystal Palace and now West Brom. His current job has looked vulnerable recently in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/west-brom-takeover-yunyi-guokai-sports-development-green-light\" title=\"\">Albion\u2019s takeover</a> but, overall, there has been plenty more good than bad. Even that trip to Grimsby. \u201cWe\u2019d gone to see Joe Parkinson, who was playing up there for Wigan \u2013 we signed him for \u00a320,000 and then sold him to Everton for \u00a3800,000.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Shawcross, the Stoke captain, is another example. \u201cWe took Shawcross from Man United, where he was playing in the third team. He was just a tall streak of nothing when we saw him. He didn\u2019t have great balance, he wasn\u2019t strong. But we brought him in, worked him and worked him and I\u2019m absolutely delighted how well he\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>Shawcross also features in another story that demonstrates how Pulis, like many successful managers, knows how to use his temper to good effect. \u201cWe played at Blackburn and were 2-0 up at half-time, having absolutely murdered them. But the break always worries me when we\u2019ve played well because the flow stops. All the players were patting each other on the back so I went up to Ryan \u2013 who had been different class \u2013 and absolutely slaughtered him. Hammered him. Ryan\u2019s agent came on after the game saying he was down in the dumps and didn\u2019t know what had happened. I pulled Ryan in, told him he was my captain and I thought the world of him but the team needed a jolt because everybody was too comfortable \u2013 and he was the one who got it.\u201d</p> <p>At other times, Pulis has gone even further. He has no appetite to discuss the infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/06/tony-pulis-james-beattie-stoke\" title=\"\">dressing-room encounter with James Beattie</a> (when Pulis is said to have head-butted his player, while completely naked, in a row about a cancelled Christmas party) but he does acknowledge the game has changed and managers can no longer pin players \u2013 \u201cthe film stars\u201d as he calls them \u2013 against the wall to make their point.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time and place for that, but that was years ago. We\u2019ve moved on. There are times when I still lose my temper and go after one or two players but it would never come to that. You could not do it now, but I cannot say I have never lost my temper and I generally go for the senior players, never the young players. When I have lost it, I have lost it.\u201d</p> <p>Equally, there is a pragmatic streak to Pulis whereby he does not mind dealing with difficult characters on a short\u2011term basis. Jermaine Pennant is one he identifies. \u201cWe got a good 12 months out of him,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are players like that \u2013 you know they have been rascals, and that you can bring them in, give them a new environment and get a length of time out of them, but they will always return to type. You can get something out of them, then you have to get rid of them. Jermaine was always a one- or two-window player.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s management. It\u2019s a social job as much as anything else, finding out what people are like, seeing through them. There have been good players and not-so-good players who I have moved along because I thought there would be a clash of character. If someone has been top cock, or whatever you call it, I\u2019ve knocked him down, and he\u2019s responded&#xa0;\u2026 as Cloughie used to say: \u2018There\u2019s no room for two big heads in this club.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At Gillingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/apr/28/newsstory.sport7\" title=\"\">his relationship with the chairman, Paul Scally, ended badly</a>, but his time at Priestfield was an early indication of Pulis\u2019s ability to make the most of what he had. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a training ground so I got the groundsman to get a tractor, I put two goals on the back and we took them up to the park just up from the stadium. For the first month, doing all my shape and pattern for the new season, there were people walking past, old ladies with their shopping, one fella with his dog.\u201d</p> <p>This was in the age when dog-walkers did not bother with poop bags. \u201cI said: \u2018Excuse me\u2019 and he said: \u2018Listen son, I\u2019ve walked this park for 40 years and I don\u2019t care what you are playing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pulis is not entirely comfortable with the way the modern game has \u201cgone Hollywood\u201d. Some of the kids these days drive him crackers. \u201cThe biggest thing is giving them too much too soon. We spoil them before they\u2019ve achieved anything. The Premier League, Sky, BT and everyone else have created this creature and they\u2019re spoilt, all the way through. They [Premier League players] are so far removed from society, and from the crux.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/tony-pulis-west-brom-new-owners\">Embattled Tony Pulis promises to stay at West Brom unless club sack him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compare the modern-day attitudes, he says, with Gary Mabbutt, the player he regards as the most inspirational he has ever known. \u201cAt Bristol Rovers when I started as a 17-year-old, I watched Mabbs at the back of the bus injecting insulin into his thigh because of his diabetes. One Christmas I was injured and had to go in for treatment. He was 16 or 17 years old. He was out with a load of balls on the training pitch, and that was Christmas morning.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that has never changed is the pain of defeat. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little room at home that I go in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is just a television in there. My wife brings in my food and a glass of wine. Then she leaves me until the morning. I don\u2019t sleep much. Losing a game of football, even when you have played well, kills you. It must be a nightmare for football managers\u2019 wives, putting up with us.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, Pulis says the secret of his longevity is his ability to adjust with the times and deal with the modern player. He has, however, always remembered the advice of the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/30/forgotten-story-alec-stock-qpr-manager\" title=\"\">Alec Stock</a>, one of the other members of the 1,000 Club. \u201cHe was in a nursing home in Wimbourne. I sat him with one day and one of the things he said was: \u2018Tony, always believe your eyes, never get away from that.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cPeter Coates [the Stoke chairman] wanted me to move with technology: \u2018You must have this, you must have that.\u2019 We had heart monitors and there was one pre-season when I didn\u2019t use them. Somebody asked me how I could know how the players were doing. I said: \u2018I know, because if they are sweating and moaning, they are fucking working.\u2019 That was my monitor. But I have embraced everything.\u201d</p> <p>Everything, that is, apart from social media (\u201csome of the stuff is crazy\u201d). On that basis, he might be unaware about the fascination with his match-day attire: the baseball cap, the tracksuit, the white trainers. Pulis, as the song goes, wears the club shop. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a shoot with the BBC and they wanted me to put some trainers on. I asked why and they said: \u2018You get new ones every game.\u2019 I said: \u2018What? This is West Bromwich Albion \u2013 they get washed. If they get muddy they get washed. It is a pat on the back for Jacko the kit man that he manages to get them so white. But they honestly thought I had a brand new pair delivered for every game.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond football, Pulis has plans to follow one of Napoleon\u2019s marches across the Italian alps \u201cat the same time of the year to understand what they went through\u201d. A Napoleon obsessive, he has already visited some of the battlegrounds in France and Russia. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more I want to do in life,\u201d he says. But first, it\u2019s back to the Potteries.</p>",
  "<p>You could say it in less than 140 characters: Twitter may be for sale, according to the latest speculation on Wall Street reported by both Reuters and CNBC.</p> <p>Both Alphabet, which is Google\u2019s parent company, and Salesforce were rumored to be possible suitors for Twitter, and the final sale price is likely to be around $22 per share, according to Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi \u2013 putting the value of the company close to $15.5bn.

We\u2019re working every day to make Twitter faster, more intuitive and easier to use,\u201d Dorsey said in a 26 July 2016 call with analysts. \u201cYou\u2019ve already seen us take some big steps here, like the changes to the time line and the announced changes to the character count and reply rules. There\u2019s more changes like these on the way.\u201d</p> <h2>Welcoming new users \u2013 and tackling harassment</h2> <p>Dorsey has conceded the company still has work to do in helping users understand why they should even bother signing up \u2013 and, when they do, having the \u201conboarding\u201d experience make more immediately useful to users. Twitter needs to take account of what its users need from it. </p> <p>\u201cContinued growth also involves educating people about why to use Twitter: for the fastest way to see and share what\u2019s happening and comment on it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been applying a lot more machine learning and deep learning to our onboarding, so we can match people faster to their interest. And we believe that, that interest drive is really important to us and unique to us.\u201d</p> <p>Balancing its much-vaunted principle of supporting global freedom of speech against the obligation to protect users from abuse and harassment has proved an extremely tricky task. \u201cAbuse is not part of civil discourse. It shuts down conversation and prevents us from understanding each other. The freedom of expression means little if we allow voices to be silenced because of fear of harassment if they speak up,\u201d Dorsey said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/30/twitter-jack-dorsey-complex-challenges\">Facing complex challenges, Twitter should focus on its strengths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo one deserves to be the target of abuse online and it has no place on Twitter.

He does suggest, however, that Twitter\u2019s November 2013 IPO did seem to inject some kind of smugness into the ranks of Twitter senior management.</p> <p>\u201cThey seemed to be a bit too satisfied given where they were at when they went public,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a management standpoint, they did not pursue other growth avenues or strategies. So I don\u2018t think it [the IPO] was a mistake. It was just lack of strategy and execution by management.\u201d</p> <p>Acquisition could give Twitter a new lease of life, and some fresh ideas and perspective on how to refine what it can offer users and advertisers.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> has warned Theresa May against pursuing a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that would see the UK drifting away from cooperation with the rest of Europe. The former chancellor made the remarks at a speech in Chicago in a sign that he intends to continue to play a role in the political debate about leaving the EU.</p> <p>Osborne, who campaigned strongly to remain, argued that it was unwise for politicians to claim the UK had a stronger hand in negotiations than the EU. \u201cI find some of the take-it-or-leave-it bravado we hear from those who assume <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> has no option but to give us everything we want more than a little naive,\u201d he told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be realistic that this is a two-way relationship \u2013 that Britain cannot expect to maintain all the benefits that came from EU membership without incurring any of the costs or the obligations.\u201d</p> <p>He urged May\u2019s government to \u201cresist the false logic that leads from exiting the EU to exiting all forms of European cooperation \u2013 and that values the dangerous purity of splendid isolation over the practical necessity of cooperation in the real world\u201d. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit\">Brexit</a> won a majority. Hard Brexit did not,\u201d Osborne said.</p> <p>Osborne also predicted that there would be no serious progress in negotiations with the EU until after the French and German elections next year. \u201cMy experience of six years of European negotiations is that nothing serious happens until the French and, especially, the German governments take a view, and both countries will be preoccupied with their own domestic elections for much of next year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was Osborne\u2019s first major speech since he lost his job when May took over from David Cameron as prime minister in July. Since then she has set about unravelling key aspects of Osborne\u2019s economic policy and overturning central tenets of Cameron\u2019s premiership, such as his opposition to bringing back grammar schools.</p> <p>Osborne indicated in a BBC Radio 4 interview last week that he would stay on the political scene, but gave only a lukewarm endorsement of May\u2019s premiership.</p> <p>May is facing competing pressures in negotiations with the EU. She has said she wants a bespoke deal for Britain that preserves free trade at the same time as curbing the freedom of EU citizens to come to Britain.</p> <p>However, Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, stressed in a speech on Friday that Britain would not be allowed to pick from an \u201c\u00e0 la carte menu\u201d of EU privileges and would get no deal on enhanced single market access without free movement of labour.</p> <p>Schulz, who met May this week, said she should invoke article 50 \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to avoid British voters electing MEPs in the 2019 European elections.</p> <p>\u201cI leave London with a feeling that the government is undecided about how and when they should trigger Article 50,\u201d he said, describing Brexit as \u201ca failure\u201d and \u201close lose\u201d for the UK and the EU. </p> <p>If the UK does manage to leave by 2019, councils and other bodies face the possibility that billions of pounds of funding for regeneration projects could end abruptly, as not all of it has been guaranteed by the Treasury.<br></p> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, has promised that projects signed off before 23 November will continue to receive cash until 2020, at which point the UK may have been out of the EU for two years. Projects signed off after the autumn statement will be approved for guarantees on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Greater Manchester council has <a href=\"https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/1215/11_european_structural_funding\">said that around 90% of its regional development funding from the EU due between 2014 and 2020</a> is still not under contract, including projects worth more than \u00a3150m.</p> <p>Others to sound the alarm about budgetary black holes for major projects include Tees Valley, where only around \u00a327m of \u00a3170m in EU funding is under contract. Cornwall\u2019s chamber of commerce has listed nine projects that might have to be scrapped, including road and rail improvements.</p> <p>Figures from the House of Commons library found by the Labour MP Emma Reynolds suggest that an estimated \u00a34bn would be due from the EU for structural and investment fund projects in 2019 and 2020.</p> <p>A Treasury spokeswoman highlighted a letter from Hammond that set out the terms of the guarantees, and said that it was \u201cworking with departments on future arrangements\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m here until January,\u201d said a man sitting with his arms crossed in the backseat. The six of us had piled into an old Ford Taurus, hitching a ride back to camp from a prayer ceremony at the site in North Dakota where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/dakota-access-pipeline-protests-north-dakota-sioux\">protests</a> against the now infamous pipeline project had been met with riot police and attack dogs only days before. \u201cThe long haul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight on,\u201d said a woman in the front. \u201cThat\u2019s dedication.\u201d</p> <p>He was from the Navajo Nation, where he was studying business management at Din\u00e9 College on the reservation. She was from the Cherokee Nation and had arrived at 3am that morning. Everyone in the car, it turned out, was from a different tribe. That\u2019s not unusual for Red Warrior Camp near Cannonball, North Dakota, where nations and tribes from around the world have united behind a common purpose: stop the Dakota Access pipeline.</p> <p>The campsites, Sacred Stone and Red Warrior, have swelled to well over 2,000 people. A seedling camp has sprung up on the road close to where construction on the pipeline is taking place about an hour south of Bismarck. Together, they constitute a sustainable community, complete with kitchens, donation centers, schools and legal counseling. The scope of the gathering is unprecedented, with over 280 tribes represented at the camps.</p> <p>This combining of forces has been spurred on by the urgent nature of the crisis. For indigenous people, climate change and pollution aren\u2019t the battles of tomorrow. They are very real, very present issues that have already dramatically impacted everyday life. The Inuit residents of Shishmaref, Alaska, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/alaska-town-shishmaref-vote-climate-change-relocation\">voting to relocate</a> their village due to rising sea levels. The Navajo Nation <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/16/politics/navajo-lawsuit-epa-animas-river/\">is suing</a> the EPA over a toxic mine spill that contaminated the San Juan River, which the Navajo depend on to water their crops and livestock. Last March, the Lenka people in Honduras lost civil rights leader and environmentalist Berta C\u00e1ceres, an ardent opponent of the privatization of the river R\u00edo Gualcarqueque, <a href=\"http://wilpf.org/honduran-indigenous-leader-berta-caceres-murdered/\">to assassination</a>.</p> <p>Historically, oil transportation has been bad news for indigenous populations. Last June, a train carrying tens of thousands of gallons of crude oil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/protest-oil-sheen-columbia-river-oregon-train-derailment\">derailed and caught fire</a> near Mosier, Oregon, contaminating the Columbia River, which the Yakama Nation in Washington depends on. In South Dakota, the Lakota, Nakota and Dakota peoples fought off the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/the-final-indian-war-in-a_b_6167640.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> that bisected treaty lands and, the tribes said, would lead to more pollution.</p> <p>So when pipeline construction began on land just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, and sacred burial sites were bulldozed in the process, it became a lightning rod for a broader struggle. \u201cWater is life\u201d is a rallying cry of the protests, and it\u2019s a message that resonates as much with the Inca in South America as it does the Ojibwa in Canada.</p> <p>\u201cCut the heads from the snakes!\u201d said a man speaking at the prayer ceremony at the protest site, referring to oil pipelines everywhere. He wore camouflage pants and a feathered headdress. \u201cToday, we hear about the Colonial pipeline.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s a good name for it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He was referencing a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fuel-supplies-in-at-least-5-states-threatened-by-alabama-gasoline-pipeline-spill/\">recent eruption</a> in the Colonial pipeline in Alabama that resulted in a massive oil spill.</p> <p>The indigenous way of life is more immediately dependent on the natural world, and when nature is damaged, indigenous people are damaged. When the rivers are poisoned, indigenous people are poisoned. This immediacy is what has drawn so many indigenous people together to fight. But it\u2019s time for non-indigenous people to understand that this is their fight too. Their livelihoods also depend on the success of the battle indigenous people are fighting right now.</p> <p>This was the hottest summer on record, and global temperatures continue to rise. Earth\u2019s biodiversity is under threat and so long as corporate profits continue to be prioritized over the planet, we will continue to slide into conditions that are increasingly inhospitable to life.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lesson indigenous people have already learned.</p> <p>\u201cThe world needs us right now,\u201d Nina Gualinga, an activist from the Sarayaku tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon said when her tribe arrived at Red Warrior Camp. The Sarayaku have fought Big Oil <a href=\"https://www.greengrants.org/2012/12/14/how-ecuadors-sarayaku-people-kept-big-oil-out/\">and won</a>, and they hope to lend their strength to the protestors at Standing Rock. \u201cThe statistics say we are 4% of the population,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut we are protecting more than 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Andrew Veitch, who has died aged 70, was one of those journalists with a sustained talent for self-invention: a talent driven by enthusiasm, curiosity and a generous sense of responsibility. It took him to Channel 4 News as science correspondent, covering health and environment stories, as well as the occasional international crisis, and then from 2003 to BBC World, working as a freelance producer, writer and presenter of documentaries made by Rockhopper Productions.</p> <p>However, Andy started in print, joining the Guardian in 1971. He became a subeditor in the features department \u2013 taking the reporter\u2019s typewritten prose and the photographer\u2019s printed pictures and composing them into finished newspaper pages to be steered through a complex process of hot metal production \u2013 but metamorphosed into a medical correspondent.</p> <p>He did so in a single unilateral act, after being awarded the role of assistant technology correspondent to write about the then new technology of personal computing. Instead, he found a story about genital herpes \u2013 not a subject at the time high on the national news agenda \u2013 wrote about it, and slapped on the first page the words \u201cAndrew Veitch, medical correspondent\u201d. At the time, the paper had no medical correspondent, and had not thought it needed one.</p> <p>In vitro fertilisation was a new and advancing field, with much to be explained. The arrival, very swiftly, of a then mystifying source of sickness and death that was later to be called HIV/Aids settled the matter. Andy became a distinguished medical correspondent, and reported with energy, intelligence and forthrightness on a swiftly changing, and politically charged, field of research.</p> <p>At the time, a bewildered government balked at confronting what would become an international epidemic of devastating proportions. A shared understanding between research scientists and journalists helped to change attitudes and educate a nation, and Andy was one of those who led the way. Words and phrases once rarely used in mainstream newspapers \u2013 semen, rectum, retrovirus, shared hypodermic needle and so on \u2013 became part of the language of public debate, and he used them as always with good humour and gusto. Throughout a lifetime career he sustained the same enjoyable mix of self-deprecation and colossal enthusiasm for the story in hand.</p> <p>Born in Wrexham, north Wales, Andy was the son of Andrew, an engineer, and May (nee Silver), a primary school teacher. As his father was working on contracts abroad, he spent his early childhood in Guyana, an experience that he claimed led to a passion for travel and adventure. At the age of 11, he returned to England to board at Reading school, and went on to Trinity College Dublin. It was there, at 18, that he met his wife-to-be, Liz. They married in 1968. He claimed that he scraped through a social science degree, and he may have devoted more enthusiasm to the student newspaper, which in his last year he edited.</p> <p>He began as a journalist on the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette and then joined the Manchester office of the Guardian, as a subeditor on the then separate northern edition. In 1976 the two editions merged, and Andy moved to the newspaper\u2019s new Farringdon Road headquarters in London. Like most subeditors, he could write well, and could have been a brilliant theatre critic: at the time, however, the newspaper already had a brilliant theatre critic in Michael Billington, so Andy\u2019s reviews were occasional.</p> <p>He became a subeditor on the Guardian\u2019s women\u2019s pages, at a time when columnists including Jill Tweedie and Polly Toynbee set the social agenda, and worked closely with two women\u2019s editors, Liz Forgan and Frances Cairncross. He also edited a gloriously funny anthology of sexism called The Naked Ape (1981), based on a women\u2019s page column of the time.</p> <p>Forgan went to the newly founded Channel 4, and after 17 years at the Guardian Andy followed her in 1988. HIV/Aids remained a powerful story. At the time there was no treatment, still only limited understanding of the infection, and diagnosis was understood to be a slow sentence of death. But the 1980s also saw the first ominous reports of climate change, the beginning of the politically embarrassing and economically devastating decade-long drama of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease), a nationwide epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease and a consortium of scientists pushing through a programme to sequence the entire human genome, a project at the time so huge that it was called \u201cbiology\u2019s Apollo\u201d.</p> <p>Andy\u2019s to-camera reporting career \u2013 often in a navy blue blazer, sometimes topped by a big red waterproof anorak \u2013 took him to the Arctic, the Antarctic, the tropics, Russia and the Kurdish refugee camps after the first Gulf war. He was awarded honours by the Royal Television Society for his work in exposing a Russian nuclear weapons disaster; by the Terrence Higgins Trust for his reporting on Aids; and by the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Wildscreen and One World film and TV festivals. He also won a record seven British Environment and Media awards, mostly for his films from Russia and the polar regions.</p> <p>He maintained a sharp sense of integrity, but was never sententious. Throughout he remained the generous, zestful and sometimes turbulent colleague he had always been, with a huge appetite for life and work. \u201cHe could drink you under the table and still beat you to the story,\u201d said one television colleague.</p> <p>Andy lived in Hackney, in the East End of London, and there became a force behind the hugely successful Broadway Market initiative, raising sums for local charities. He developed the bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, needing care first at Bart\u2019s hospital and then at St Joseph\u2019s hospice in Hackney, but he carried on, being who he was and doing what he could for as long as he could.</p> <p>He is survived by Liz, their sons, Joel and Alexander, and five grandchildren, Abigail, Zachariah, Bliss, Toby and Tallulah.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Andrew Veitch, journalist, born 15 July 1946; died 4 September 2016</p>",
  "<p>It is 15 years since the US declared the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/21/september11.usa13\" title=\"\">war on terror</a>\u201d and, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\" title=\"\">the rise of Islamic State</a> has ensured western governments remain preoccupied with non-state armed groups, the international policy agenda has shifted towards a broader focus on countering \u201cextremism\u201d. But one problem with this is that there is no agreement on what \u201cextremism\u201d is, let alone its causes or solutions.</p> <p>The question of what constitutes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/there-is-less-of-a-terrorism-threat-now-experts-put-europes-summer-of-violence-in-context\" title=\"\">a terrorist</a> has always been contentious; the definition of \u201cextremism\u201d is even&#xa0;more so. Just as countries around the world leapt to label their dissidents&#xa0;terrorists after 9/11, the UK\u2019s growing emphasis on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/19/new-counter-extremism-strategy-revealed-theresa-may\" title=\"\">nonviolent extremism</a>\u201d is ripe for exploitation by authoritarian governments.</p> <p>Britain has gone further than most countries in defining extremism specifically as a problem of undesirable beliefs. When the coalition government came to power in 2010, it revised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/29/cameron-backing-theresa-may-counter-extremism-strategy-fundamental-shift\" title=\"\">the Prevent strategy</a> to define extremism as \u201cvocal or active opposition to fundamental British values\u201d including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.</p> <p>This change in policy was partly a reaction against some of the counter-terrorism work done by the previous Labour government in conjunction with Muslim faith groups. Critics claimed some of the faith groups that had been selected actually contributed to underlying problems of intolerance and division, because they reinforced the idea of separation between Muslim and other British communities. Moreover the new definition of nonviolent extremism was intended to be wider than Islamist groups, and to include the far right.</p> <p>The definition, however, is not based on any clear theoretical or practical link to violence. Clearly, \u201cnonviolent extremists\u201d don\u2019t have to be in favour of violence. The latest counter-extremism strategy, from 2015, states that extremist ideology is the core problem, with terrorism merely a symptom. By contrast, the research on terrorism, radicalisation and extremism suggests that, though beliefs matter to people and organisations who adopt violence, a more complex mix of social, psychological, political and strategic factors plays a part.</p> <p>The idea of \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d has critics ranging from academics defending freedom of thought \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-says-prevent-strategy-wrong-headed-a7323916.html\" title=\"\">Oxford University\u2019s vice-chancellor</a> this week \u2013 to police officers questioning how this concept could realistically be controlled.</p> <p>But much less attention has been paid&#xa0;to the fact that Britain is also exporting its definition. Few people have analysed the implications for foreign policy of the UK promoting this concept of \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d among its global allies, through training programmes as well as high-level security dialogues. The concept hasn\u2019t caught on with most western democracies, which remain focused on countering violent extremism; but it has been warmly received by non-democratic states, including some in the Gulf, which favour the sort of broad definitions that tar nonviolent dissidents with the same brush as violent ones.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the UK\u2019s definition of extremism is intended to reinforce liberal democratic values. But this is lost in translation when non-democracies embrace it. They are not amending their definitions to promote liberal values: rather, they tend to see Britain\u2019s approach as validating their view that it is legitimate to criminalise dissident beliefs as a threat to national security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/31/combat-terror-end-support-saudi-arabia-dictatorships-fundamentalism\">To really combat terror, end support for Saudi Arabia | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to counter-terrorism cooperation with the Middle East, there is a clear common interest in fighting a recognised, common threat such as Isis or al-Qaida. By contrast, the understandings of what constitutes \u201cextremism\u201d are so far apart that proponents of democratic change \u2013 or of liberal social values, such as the freedom to be an atheist or to advocate LGBT or abortion rights \u2013 are viewed as extremists in the Gulf context.</p> <p>Nor are Gulf states themselves united over what extremism means. The UAE and Qatar have opposite views on whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/qatar-orders-expulsion-exiled-egyptian-muslim-brotherhood-leaders\" title=\"\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> is an extremist organisation, while Saudi Arabia\u2019s grand mufti <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-grand-mufti-iran-sunni-muslims-hajj-a7229416.html\" title=\"\">says Iran\u2019s leaders are not Muslims</a>. By contrast, the UAE has made it illegal to declare other Muslims to be apostates, as it sees this \u201ctakfirism\u201d as deeply interlinked with extremists.</p> <p>The UK, keen to strengthen its counter-terrorism partnerships, seems content to gloss over these differences. But if we don\u2019t deal with the consequences of our loose definitions, including human rights abuses and the stoking of popular discontent in response, we could be storing up problems that come back to haunt us.</p>",

His fingerprints, melodies and chord progressions are all over some of the biggest hits of recent years for acts such as One Direction, Justin Bieber, Little Mix and Jessie Ware. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/how-to-write-a-banger-for-beyonce\">How to write a banger for Beyonc\u00e9</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just love to write songs that will connect,\u201d he says. \u201cFor anyone who\u2019s not trying to write number ones, I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d His is a story of why endurance and persistence are essential in the music business \u2013 even if your career seems only to consist of blind alleys at the start.</p> <p>He says his mother was \u201can amazing singer\u201d who also got him started on guitar while the only radio in his house was local radio station Capital Gold, which goes some way to explaining his formative influences. He says he was 12 before he heard a contemporary song \u2013 Crossroads by Bon Jovi \u2013 and that awoke him to modern music just as Britpop was exploding. At that time, he was also facing a career crossroads, having to pick between tennis \u2013 he was so good he was playing at national and county level \u2013 and music, with him spending his lunchtimes in the music room working out songs on piano. </p> <p>\u201cWith the tennis playing, I was at quite a high level,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was just too much hard work.\u201d</p> <p>At 17, he walked out of school to try to make it as a performer as part of a duo with a friend (key influence: Turin Brakes). \u201cI went to my parents and I just broke down,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and I had been playing the piano every day when everyone else was out playing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His dad gave him a deadline of 18 months to make it; if he didn\u2019t, he would have to get a job. A few near misses with record labels followed but he was eventually signed to publisher Windswept Pacific in 2001 when he was 19, off the back of one song. But labels were only interested in him as a solo act and so he had to split the group with his friend. </p> <p>He has the look and style of a pop singer \u2013 lantern jaw, tidy beard, black T-shirt \u2013 but it was behind the scenes rather than on stage where he would make his name. After a difficult period signed to Sony in the UK, he asked them to let him go and he switched to Polydor to release a new album he had written. Fame and fortune did not follow. \u201cIt feels like to me in my own artist career that I have been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of that time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as a writer I have been in the right place at the right time.\u201d</p> <p>Writing for others is where he was to really find his feet. \u201cI would like to think that I am one of the main writers in the UK that labels look to send up-and-coming artists to help break their careers,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is hopefully a given with my track record and who I am working with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b96dca66a8564a60c23c0059750e09f84e7cb9e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b96dca66a8564a60c23c0059750e09f84e7cb9e7/0_97_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Scott performs in concert at Austin360.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Scott performs in concert at Austin360.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Kern/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes he has to explain to acts that writing with an eye on the charts is nothing to be ashamed of. \u201cWhy? Why don\u2019t you want to? Don\u2019t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month? Don\u2019t you want that? Isn\u2019t that what you want to do? I\u2019m not saying that they should write a bad song, but we should get to something that they think is amazing and that I think is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>It is refreshing in an age of faux-humility and humblebragging in pop to hear someone speak so bluntly about wanting to write huge songs that go to number one. There is no sense of arrogance or entitlement with Scott; he just long ago realised that he wants to write number ones and that he has an innate knack for it. So, rather than tie himself in knots searching for some nebulous sense of credibility, he just gets on with it. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the endgame for when I go into the studio with someone,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever happens, we need to state that this is on the global level and that we need to write the best music of next year. It\u2019s not just about what\u2019s cool. I want to write classic modern pop songs.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of which, he was one of the many writers that Adele tried out for her most recent album. She approached him and they worked on \u201cfour or five\u201d songs in his studio. \u201cShe opens her mouth and you understand why everything is what it is,\u201d he says. \u201cJust an amazing artist. Five or six years ago I would have gone into that session and I would have been scared. \u2018Oh my God I need to make this count.\u2019 But you suddenly wake up, maybe with a bit of success under your belt or maybe your first number one, and you feel pretty relaxed in who you are as a writer. I do my thing and if it doesn\u2019t work out, it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p> <p>Did he feel under pressure to write what people would presume was an Adele-type song? \u201cNot at all. I just wrote exactly how I would normally. I just got on the piano and she started singing. And when she\u2019s singing it becomes an Adele song. It was like a normal session.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what song of his he is most proud of, he instantly says One Direction\u2019s Story of My Life. \u201cBecause we changed the game for them,\u201d he argues. \u201cIn the history of all boybands, they are usually on the way down [by the third album]. With that song I feel like we lifted them to another level.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2016/aug/30/millennial-whoop-pop-music\">The Millennial Whoop: the melodic hook that\u2019s taken over pop music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says almost all of his songs are written with the artists that will record it, but in the case of Cold Water it sat collecting dust for months before they were approached to have Major Lazer, Justin Bieber and M\u00d8 record it. It was written by chance when he was in New York with American producer Benny Blanco, who invited Ed Sheeran to the studio. </p> <p>\u201cIt was really hot and his air conditioning wasn\u2019t working,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were there sweating. Ed came and we had a bit of food and he suggested we try and write something. He came up with these chords and we wrote this song called Cold Water,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there was another artist that we had in mind to write it for but we just ended up writing it anyway. A year later I got a call from my manager saying that [producer] Diplo had heard it and loved it and they maybe wanted to get Justin Bieber on it.\u201d</p> <p>He says he tries to limit the people he writes with and cannot work in the style, as outlined in John Seabrook\u2019s book The Song Machine, where huge teams of writers are assigned parts of songs \u2013 the bridge, the pre-chorus, the topline \u2013 and they are snapped together after the fact like the toy inside a Kinder egg. \u201cI am basically the complete opposite of that,\u201d he says. \u201cI have no problem with it, but I just don\u2019t work very well like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fool the public,\u201d he stresses. \u201cThat is one thing you can\u2019t do now. You can\u2019t fool the public into making something a hit. The public will make great pop songs hits. They will do it themselves.\u201d</p>",

The Labour party is in a much more uncertain position: seemingly largely united as far as its newly inflated membership is concerned, but also troubled further towards the top. Some MPs are taking minders with them to the party conference. The party\u2019s national executive thinks online abuse is such a toxic issue that it will now require members to sign up to a new code of conduct. There are voices on all sides of the party talking about \u201cunity and taking the fight to the Tories\u201d (it\u2019s a cliche already), but the chances of all those MPs dutifully settling down and accepting Corbyn\u2019s pre-eminence seem slim.

Do they even think that\u2019s even possible?

  "<p>This week, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Dr Priscilla Chan pledged $3bn to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/21/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-end-disease\">cure, manage and prevent all diseases</a>\u201d by the end of the century. While $3bn sounds like a lot of money, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/here-s-reality-check-mark-zuckerberg-s-3b-plan-end-n652301\">more than 10 times as much</a> on biomedical research per year. Since 2003, the US has spent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for/\">more than 20 times as much</a> through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief to end HIV/Aids worldwide. Bill Gates, whose foundation has donated <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/HIV\">well over $3bn</a> to the fight against HIV alone, recently acknowledged that despite all that\u2019s been done to date, \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Turning-the-Corner-on-AIDS\">we have not turned the corner on Aids</a>\u201d. It seems like tremendous hubris for Chan and Zuckerberg to set such a lofty goal.</p> <p>Zuckerberg made his first major foray into philanthropy in 2010, when he gave <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Mark-Zuckerbergs-Big-Announcement-Video\">$100m</a> to help reform failing schools in Newark, NJ, hoping this would become a model for the nation. But because he didn\u2019t understand the challenges posed by the regulatory environment and culture of the city\u2019s public schools, his gift as well as an additional $100m in matching funds didn\u2019t have the desired <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442183080/assessing-the-100-million-upheaval-of-newarks-public-schools\">impact</a>. But Zuckerberg says he\u2019s learned from some of his initial mistakes. More recently, he invested another <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/05/30/mark-zuckerberg-is-giving-120-million-to-bay-area-schools-after-his-last-education-reform-effort-didnt-go-so-well/\">$120m</a> in schools in his own backyard where he\u2019s better able to engage with the community and understand the urban education crisis.</p> <p>I hope Zuckerberg and Chan have learned from their Newark experience, because it\u2019s precisely by changing the culture of biomedical research that they could make good on their pledge.</p> <p>Success rates for NIH grant applications are at the <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/displayreport.aspx?rid=665\">lowest</a> they\u2019ve been going as far back as the 1970s. When the money for science is this tight, <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/37/currents/why-is-biomedical-research-so-conservative\">researchers don\u2019t take big risks</a>. Instead of making innovative leaps in science, researchers early in their careers are typically among the most risk averse, taking on bits of studies designed by their senior mentors. Writing a successful grant application often requires preliminary data \u2013 in other words, you need to have already done a chunk of the research you\u2019re proposing to do. Even then, about 20-25% of academic biomedical researchers\u2019 time (in my experience) is spent applying for grants to support their projects. Much of their mental effort goes into <a href=\"http://postdoc.hms.harvard.edu/slides/Part3_strategies_for_success_Coelho.pdf\">grantsmanship</a>, which is not at all the same thing as creativity.</p> <p>Academic researchers are promoted on the basis of \u201cachievement\u201d \u2013 grants won and papers published. Volume is what matters here, not necessarily impact. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers?language=en\">Adam Grant</a>, a professor of organizational psychology at the Wharton School of Business, \u201cThe greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they\u2019re the ones who try the most.\u201d But biomedical researchers can\u2019t afford to have failed experiments because they\u2019re not publishable. Furthermore, they need to take as much of the credit as possible for that \u201cproductivity\u201d to count towards their advancement, so there\u2019s an incentive against working with too many other people. Biomedical research is highly siloed in parallel with the grants funding it. An added challenge is that the gold standard for medical research \u2013 the randomized clinical trial, ideally conducted in multiple sites and settings \u2013 is very expensive.</p> <p>With their $3bn commitment, Chan and Zuckerberg could bring about a cross-cutting revolution in the tools used to conduct biomedical research. Of this funding $600m will support the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/09/404286/joe-derisi-how-biohub-will-create-opportunities-research-collaboration\">Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</a> in San Francisco, which will encourage collaboration among biomedical researchers, computer scientists and engineers at UCSF, UC Berkeley and Stanford University.</p> <p>The Biohub\u2019s initial projects will include the Cell Atlas Initiative to map all the many types of cells that make up the human body \u2013 a task similar in some ways to the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/12011238/an-overview-of-the-human-genome-project/\">Human Genome Project</a>, but exponentially more complicated. The Biohub will also launch an Infectious Disease Initiative to develop new diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines for infectious diseases including HIV, Ebola and Zika. Both initiatives will be test cases for Zuckerberg\u2019s theory that together biomedical researchers, computer scientists and engineers can develop new tools to automate and accelerate biomedical research, ideally also driving down costs and reducing the risk of conducting such research.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://profiles.ucsf.edu/joe.derisi\">Dr Joe DeRisi</a>, who will co-direct the Biohub, they are \u201choping to attract investigators who have bold new ideas that normal grant-giving organizations might not have an appetite for, because the ideas may be at too exploratory a stage\u201d. But it remains unclear how they plan to do this, especially when you consider that the current system selects for more conservative scientists. I worry that too many scientific originals will be weeded out by the system before they can hope to get funding from the likes of Chan and Zuckerberg.</p>",
  "<p>A global wildlife summit opening on Saturday is a \u201cdo or die\u201d moment for endangered animals around the world, say conservationists, from iconic species such as elephants and lions to lesser known, but equally troubled, creatures such as devil rays and the psychedelic rock gecko.</p> <p>The summit in Johannesburg brings together 181 nations to crack down on wildlife trafficking, currently a $20bn-a-year criminal enterprise, and to ensure the legal trade in food, skins, pets and traditional remedies does not threaten the survival of species. The member nations of the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) will vote on proposals to toughen or loosen trade bans and regulations for over 500 species.</p> <p>A total trade ban is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/29/pangolins-being-eaten-to-extinction-conservationists-warn-anteaters\">sought for pangolins</a>, an exotic scaled creature, which is now the world\u2019s most trafficked mammal, while more protection for sharks, parrots and frogs are also on the table. The most controversial proposals are for elephants: some southern African nations want to overturn the ban on selling ivory while a rival proposal from 29 other African countries aims to make protections even tougher.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/mar/16/pangolins-worlds-most-illegally-traded-mammal-in-pictures\">Pangolins: the world's most illegally traded mammal \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWith so many of our wild animal and plant species facing serious threats from rapacious poaching and commercial trade, this Cites meeting represents a \u2018do or die\u2019 moment,\u201d said Teresa Telecky, wildlife director of the Humane Society International. \u201cEither countries do the right thing and give these imperilled species the highest level of protection possible against unsustainable exploitation, or we risk seeing them die out altogether in the wild.\u201d</p> <p>The proposals are based on scientific evidence, but national political agendas loom large too. \u201cThe stakes are high for so many species and we must make certain that sound science and the precautionary principle are deciding factors and not short-term political or economic interests,\u201d said Azzedine Downes, president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).</p> <p>Others are concerned that high-profile rows over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/11/ivory-trade-international-agreement\">elephant</a> proposals, which could all fail to pass, will distract from work on enforcement to end the scourge of poaching. Over 140,000 of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts\">killed for their ivory</a> between 2007 and 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/poaching-drives-huge-30-decline-in-africas-savannah-elephants\">wiping out almost a third of their population</a>. Elephants are still being killed every 15 minutes on average. </p> <p>Nations where poaching, trafficking or illegal sales take place should have submitted action plans but Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon and Nigeria have not, and could face sanctions on all their wildlife-related trade. </p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that the summit is likely to be a rerun of the old pattern, with proposals and counter-proposals on legal international ivory trade diverting attention from the real issues,\u201d said WWF in statement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/28/swaziland-unveils-plan-to-legalise-rhino-horn-to-pay-for-anti-poaching-efforts\">Swaziland has also proposed to legalise the sale of horn from rhino</a>, whose populations have plummeted, but will face fierce opposition.</p> <p>The species being evaluated for protection at Cites span the land, ocean and skies. African lions ought to get the strongest protection, according to scientists at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) while Jan Creamer, president of Animal Defenders International, said the big cat\u2019s survival was at stake: \u201cIt is clear that we are at risk of being the generation that allowed a magnificent species to disappear from the wild.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/wildlife-trade/protecting-pangolin\">Pangolins</a>, whose scales are sold in China and Vietnam as a supposed medicine, could also get stronger protection.

As a result, poaching has also ramped up in Africa and in June over 11 tonnes of pangolin scales were seized in Hong Kong in just two shipments from Africa. \u201cWe could very soon see this amazing species disappear, if the unsustainable trade continues,\u201d says Mark Hofberg, IFAW\u2019s pangolin expert. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46fdfef6f7303a00edaf8bb462101447c058a3ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fdfef6f7303a00edaf8bb462101447c058a3ab/0_147_5048_3029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silky shark populations have been hit by the fishing trade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silky shark populations have been hit by the fishing trade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgette Douwma/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the seas, stricter protection is on the table for silky and thresher sharks, both heavily hit by the fin trade, and for devil rays, whose gills are sold in China. \u201cDevil rays grow very slowly and produce just one pup about every two years, making them intrinsically susceptible to overfishing,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Pardo, at Simon Fraser University in Canada.</p> <p>The nautilus could also get its first trade protections, as it is being overfished for its beautiful shells which are used for jewellery and ornaments. Many turtle species are eaten in Asia and have suffered heavily as a result, and flapshell and softshell turtle proposals will be voted on during the two-week summit.</p> <p>In the air, African grey parrots, which are extraordinary vocal mimics, may get the highest level of protection. Scientists estimate that two to three million African greys were captured from the wild between 1975 and 2013, and despite successful captive breeding, populations have decreased by between 50% and 90% and in some places they are locally extinct.</p> <p>There are many proposals for better protection for reptiles and amphibians. \u201cA lot of lizards and frogs are traded illegally,\u201d said John Scanlon, secretary general of Cites. \u201cThey are being taken primarily for the illegal pet trade, and primarily to Europe. We need to get this under control, as these animals are also a critical part of the ecosystem.\u201d </p> <p>The psychedelic rock gecko, found only in Vietnam, is in line for better protection along with others including the Hong Kong warty newt and both the tomato frog and the false tomato frog.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/lizard-traffickers-exploit-legal-loopholes-to-trade-at-worlds-biggest-fair\">Lizard traffickers exploit legal loopholes to trade at world's biggest fair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cites, which began in 1975, is increasingly regulating the timber trade too and could introduce protection for the entire genus of rosewood species.

With Asian rosewood numbers crashing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/16/rosewood-madagascar-china-illegal-rainforest\">focus of loggers has increasingly moved to Africa</a> and central America, where they \u201ccapitalise on unstable situations in fragile states, moving swiftly from country to country creating devastating \u2018boom-and-bust cycles\u2019,\u201d according the Forest Trends group.</p> <p>A minority of the Cites proposals are to loosen restrictions on the international trade in species that have recovered from previously precarious positions. The total bans protecting the peregrine falcon and the Cape mountain zebra may be lifted.</p> <p>\u201cThe recovery of species like the peregrine falcon shows that Cites can work and that populations can bounce back thanks to trade bans and conservation efforts,\u201d said Ginette Hemley, head of WWF\u2019s delegation to Cites. \u201cIf the world takes decisive action in Johannesburg, we can look forward to more success stories in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Scanlon said: \u201cWe have made significant progress since the last Cites summit in 2013, politically, financially and technically.

A year after he oversaw the signing of the constitution, 15 million Congolese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/16/congo.chrismcgreal1\">voted for a government for the first time in more than 40 years</a>.</p> <p>Though it was far from a perfect or peaceful election, it was a landmark moment.

Emily\u2019s parents are getting a divorce and, one morning, Emily wakes up and discovers that her feet no longer touch the ground. She soars higher and higher, until she can barely make contact with her family, her school or her friends below.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaNURK_RsDM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QaNURK_RsDM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dan Rebellato talks about Emily Rising</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Children\u2019s shows can often be quite vague, but Rebellato\u2019s play (co-produced by <a href=\"https://littleangeltheatre.com/\">Little Angel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goblintheatre.co.uk/\">Goblin</a>) is poetic and precise. The characters are played by puppets \u2013 but the actors\u2019 hands, arms or legs are incorporated into the design so that there\u2019s always a bit of the puppeteers (David Emmings, Yana Penrose and Peyvand Sadeghian), poking around the edges.

Emily\u2019s mum has a wooden face, huge, jangling earrings and a dress that tapers down to nothing. She is all head, just as Emily might see her from above while floating. The puppets\u2019 bodies reflect the environment in which they live \u2013 such a clever touch from designer Alison Alexander. Emily\u2019s teacher has black binders for hair and a yellow-pencil scarf. The doctor has two stethoscopes for eyes (yet cannot see what is wrong with Emily), and the nosey neighbour\u2019s head is made of fussy flowers. The social worker is constructed from piles of paperwork, with a clipboard for a face. </p> <p>Rachel Champion\u2019s set shows us the world through Emily\u2019s eyes and includes a warped fence that stretches out towards us and a spindly house. Emily is initially attached to the house by string but \u2013 eventually \u2013 floats off. Emily drifts away from her family and, the further she drifts, the \u201cmore beautiful\u201d the world becomes.

  "<p>You didn\u2019t really join the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2004/02/oxford-university-dangerous-sports-club\">Dangerous Sports Club</a>; it was more a loose affiliation of people at Oxford University who enjoyed doing&nbsp;silly, slightly illegal things. They invented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping\">bungee jumping</a>, with the world\u2019s first jump off the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol on 1 April 1979. And they famously held a cocktail party on the island of Rockall. The first thing I&nbsp;got involved in was an attempt to do something with balloons at Beachy Head \u2013 I\u2019ve forgotten what. I&nbsp;didn\u2019t do anything dangerous until my first bungee jump, off a crane at a county fair in&nbsp;Winchester.</p> <p>One of the most fun times we had was our first skiing event at St Moritz. I cooked up an idea with a DSC member, Tommy Leigh-Pemberton: to go down the Matterhorn on bicycles attached to&nbsp;skis, with parachutes on our backs, which we\u2019d engage on&nbsp;the&nbsp;steeper bits.</p> <p>But the club\u2019s founder, David Kirke, wanted to expand it into an event with all sorts of things on skis.&nbsp;The most memorable was a&nbsp;rowing eight. I\u2019d hired the boat from&nbsp;my college club for \u00a325, with a&nbsp;\u00a375 deposit \u2013 the chap knew he wasn\u2019t going to get it back. It was mounted on skis, and stood three feet off the ground: eight rowers and&nbsp;me, the cox. It didn\u2019t get far before it turned over, but I righted it, jumped back in and made it to the bottom of the slope, travelling backwards. We also went down seated at a <a href=\"http://dafjones.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/The-Last-Hurrah/G0000h6nMRA9RkNU/I0000s_pC5DsZ_B0\">grand piano</a>; I had seen&nbsp;Elton John in concert and spent&nbsp;the evening working out how I&nbsp;could attach skis to a piano\u2019s legs.</p> <p>This photograph was taken at a DSC tea party held at the Gloucestershire home of the Dutch ambassador Robbert Fack; his twin sons, Jerome and Jack, were good friends. By our standards, it was pretty tame, although we did catapult people across the lawn in a&nbsp;wheelchair, using a bungee rope strung between trees. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/nigellalawson\">Nigella Lawson</a> is playing croquet; her boyfriend at the time was Hubie Gibbs, who is next to me at the back.</p> <p>We always wore formal dress, because it added to the spectacle. And&nbsp;we had quite a riotous time. But&nbsp;there was a distance between us&nbsp;and other Oxford clubs, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/bright-young-things-revisited-how-camerons-generation-made-oxford-their-playground\">Piers Gaveston</a> and the Bullingdon: our people never overlapped. We were once referred to as \u201crenegade bluebloods\u201d, and I&nbsp;suppose most of&nbsp;us were from public schools (I&nbsp;went to Eton) but almost nobody was 100% British; I\u2019m half Australian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/02/thats-me-in-the-picture-toronto-cn-tower\">\u2018It was the world\u2019s tallest freestanding building for more than 30 years\u2019: I helped build Toronto\u2019s CN Tower</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was studying engineering at Oriel&nbsp;College, and the appeal of the&nbsp;club for me was dreaming up stunts&nbsp;that were beautiful, challenging and theoretically possible. We never tested anything, so the calculations I did beforehand were key. It was a formative experience: under those circumstances, there is huge pressure on you to keep a cool head when your gut instinct says you\u2019re going to die. So you work everything out, and check everything before you set out. I did get scared, but I&nbsp;never thought I\u2019d get hurt.</p> <p>After I left university, I designed and&nbsp;built racing cars, mostly as a way of improving the efficiency of engines. But my passion has always been the environment, and I now build cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells. I don\u2019t miss the adrenaline of those days, because it was never about that for me; it was about pushing boundaries a bit further.

After a lifetime of wondering, I am helping to lead a new global effort to find out. The Breakthrough Listen project will scan the nearest million stars for signs of life, but I know just the place to start looking. One day we might receive a signal from a planet like Gliese 832c, but we should be wary of answering back.\u201d</p> <p>It is not the first time Hawking has warned about the prospect of hostile aliens. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/20/breakthrough-listen-massive-radio-wave-project-scan-far-regions-for-alien-life\">Launching the Breakthrough Listen project</a>, which will scan the nearest million stars for signs of life, last year he suggested that any civilisation reading our messages could be billions of years ahead of humans. \u201cIf so they will be vastly more powerful and may not see us as any more valuable than we see bacteria,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d4a297c7313a47691f394ecba6fa6689394548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d4a297c7313a47691f394ecba6fa6689394548/143_35_2604_1563/1000.png\" alt=\"Stephen Hawking\u2019s CGI spacecraft, the SS Hawking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Hawking\u2019s CGI spacecraft, the SS Hawking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: From Stephen Hawking\u2019s Favorite Places</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 25-minute film, which appears on the platform <a href=\"https://app.curiositystream.com/video/1697\">CuriosityStream</a>, starts at the Big Bang, which has been the focus of much of Hawking\u2019s career.

  "<p>Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man suspected of placing bombs in New York and New Jersey last weekend, spent time in a religious seminary in Pakistan closely associated with the Afghan Taliban, according to a government official.</p> <p>The 28-year-old, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-terrorist-suspect-new-york-area-bombings\">was born in Afghanistan but became a US citizen</a>, spent time at the Kaan Kuwa Naqshbandi madrasa on his two visits to Pakistan, a security official working for the government of Balochistan province told the Guardian.</p> <p>Rahami spent three weeks in 2011 receiving \u201clectures and Islamic education\u201d at the school in Kuchlak, a dusty cluster of villages 20km north of Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, he said.</p> <p>Kuchlak is a well-known hub for the Taliban, the Islamist movement that has waged a 15-year insurgency against local and Nato forces in nearby Afghanistan. It is home to many madrasas, the seminaries intimately linked with the Taliban, originally a movement of religious students.</p> <p>US officials have revealed basic details about Rahami\u2019s two visits to Pakistan, the first in 2011 when he spent a couple of months in Quetta and got married and almost a year in 2013 when he also made a car journey to Afghanistan.</p> <p>But very little information has emerged from inside Pakistan about what Rahami did during his visits.</p> <p>The government official, who did not wish to be named because he was speaking about a highly sensitive subject, said Pakistani security agencies have tried to \u201chide all the details of his visits to Quetta\u201d and keep as much information as possible out of the media.</p> <p>Rahami, he said, also visited other sensitive areas in the province, including Surkhab and Nushki, where former Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/family-of-driver-mohammad-azam-killed-in-us-strike-on-taliban-leader-mullah-mansoor-file-criminal-case\">killed by a US drone</a> in May. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/who-is-ahmad-khan-rahami-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53q63\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2735373\"            data-video-name=\"Who is Ahmad Khan Rahami? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters, Anthony Genaro, William Shardinksi, AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e1668de4b05714d0da2b67\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/21/160920Profile1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/21/160920Profile1_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/21/160920Profile1.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/who-is-ahmad-khan-rahami-video\">\u2018He got more religious\u2019: neighbors share their views on Ahmad Khan Rahami</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Pakistan has long been accused of playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d with the US, both supporting the Nato counterinsurgency in Afghanistan and allowing the Taliban to use its territory a vital rear base.</p> <p>A western expert on the Taliban said Abdul Samad, the Afghan owner of the Kuchlack madrasa, was an important local figure.</p> <p>\u201cThe madrasa is a place where you have multiple Afghan Taliban going there and hanging out in [Samad\u2019s] court, as well as active ISI officers,\u201d he said, referring to the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, an army-run spy agency.</p> <p>\u201cSamad is the kind of person who should have been shut down long ago but enjoys a high degree of protection,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite being part of the mystical, Sufi strain of Islam, which many hardliners abhor, Samad is highly respected by the movement, he said.</p> <p>A Karachi-based cleric told the Guardian the school was a sizeable operation, with more than 200 students.</p> <p>Despite several attempts to reach Samad for comment, the Guardian was unable to make contact with the madrasa.</p> <p>Although the Taliban\u2019s leadership is often described as the \u201cQuetta Shura\u201d many analysts consider Kuchlak to be the actual command centre for many senior members of the movement.</p> <p>The Taliban\u2019s white flags have been reportedly seen flying in the town\u2019s graveyards and Shahbaz Taseer, a Pakistani kidnapped by militants in Lahore in 2011 and held for more than four years, was released in Kuchlak in March by the Taliban.</p> <p>Rahami\u2019s father Mohammad Rahami has said his son had grown increasingly interested in Islamist movements, watching Taliban and al-Qaida videos, and listening to their poetry. Rahami had also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/ahmad-khan-rahami-father-fbi-terrorism-bombing\">shown sympathy towards the Taliban</a>, a former employer said.</p> <p>Given the Taliban has long avoided entanglement in international jihad, insisting it is interested only in forcing foreign troops out of Afghanistan, it is unlikely Rahami was operating under instruction when he planted his bombs. A notebook found on Rahami when he was captured after a shootout on Monday suggests he may have been inspired by the Islamic State group.</p> <p>But the claim Rahami attended an important Taliban-sympathising madrasa could be embarrassing for Pakistan at a time the country is under intense international criticism, not least from India, which accused Pakistan this week of hosting \u201cthe Ivy League of terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar, a spokesman for the Balochistan government, said that because more than 1 million Afghan refugees lived in the province it was \u201cdifficult to know what sort of activity is being conducted by some individuals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFiltering out the terrorist influences in such a huge community is a very difficult task,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nor could the government be expected to be aware of a US traveller such as Rahami, who has \u201cdeep links in the host community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf he was not spotted by the CIA and FBI or Homeland Security, then this shows that it is really global problem,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/jim-oneill-resigns-treasury-minister-conservative-whip-theresa-may-tensions\">Jim O\u2019Neill\u2019s abrupt, if hardly unexpected, resignation </a>from Theresa May\u2019s Treasury team is merely the latest example of how the marriage of business and politics can be a rocky affair that ends in divorce.<br></p> <p>Prime ministers and chancellors often see the attraction of inviting big hitters from the world of commerce to join their administrations. Gordon Brown made Digby Jones, the former head of the CBI, a member of his government of all the talents. Archie Norman was the boss of Asda when he was invited to apply for the safe Conservative seat of Tunbridge Wells at the 1997 election. Neither especially enjoyed the experience.</p> <p>It was George Osborne rather than David Cameron who wooed O\u2019Neill away from Goldman Sachs. The diehard Manchester United fan ticked all the right boxes. He was the perfect fit to help with two of Osborne\u2019s pet projects: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-confirms-commitment-northern-powerhouse-george-osborne\">\u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d</a> and developing closer economic ties between Britain and China.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill made his name by identifying the rise of four leading emerging market economies - Brazil, Russia, India and China - as a key feature of the global economy, giving them the title Brics. Like Osborne, he was convinced that the rise of China would be as significant as the emergence of the US as a global economic superpower in the 20th century. Both men thought Britain\u2019s best long-term interests were served in forging close and harmonious links with Beijing.</p> <p>In his resignation letter to the prime minister, O\u2019Neill said the case for the northern powerhouse and closer links with the leading emerging economies was \u201ceven stronger following the referendum, and I am pleased that, despite speculation to the contrary, both appear to be commanding your personal attention\u201d.</p> <p>This is hardly a full-throated endorsement and will do little to quell speculation that O\u2019Neill was unhappy about the review May insisted upon before agreeing to go-ahead with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant</a> earlier this month, and that he suspects plans are afoot to dilute the northern powerhouse project. The announcement that he has resigned the Conservative whip and will sit as a crossbench peer merely adds to the sense that he is the latest business leader to become disillusioned with Westminster politics. <br></p> <p>Much has changed in the past three months. It is not just that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote led to Cameron\u2019s resignation. Starting with Osborne\u2019s brutal sacking, May has been systematically removing traces of the former regime. Her support for grammar schools irked the comprehensively educated O\u2019Neill.</p> <p>Put simply, he had a choice. He could stick around in a government he felt increasingly at odds with, or go off and do something else more rewarding. Given that O\u2019Neill cares more about Jos\u00e9 Mourinho than he does about Theresa May, the decision probably didn\u2019t take all that long. Nor is it one he is likely to regret.<br></p>",

It is a sad manifestation of the great danger humanitarian workers are facing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a> today: caught between the frontlines, constantly on the run from shelling, bombing, kidnapping and arrest.</p> <p>\u201cOur teams had to distribute the aid at night, carrying only two food baskets at a time because there was no fuel for transportation and the shelling made a central distribution too dangerous,\u201d said one of our partners who organised a food distribution in a besieged area some months ago. Such situations have become routine for the aid workers on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/23/enough-is-enough-its-time-to-protect-aid-workers\">Enough is enough. It's time to protect aid workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/humanitarianshumanitarians\" title=\"\">Humanitarian workers</a> and their families share the daily struggles of the people they are serving, including displacement, loss of loved ones, hunger and the lack of basic services. \u201cLast winter when the hunger was unbearable, I ventured out to the farmlands. I ran to take a couple of cabbages back to my family. Every second I expected to be hit by a sniper. Because this plantation of cabbages was directly at the frontline.\u201d This is the experience of just one humanitarian worker in a besieged town in Syria.</p> <p>On top of their struggles, humanitarian workers are facing intense danger, risking their lives to save others. Many of the field staff I work with are crossing the frontlines on a daily basis, venturing out into conflict zones to reach those most in need and try to get aid and services to the most remote locations.</p> <p>\u201cIn Syria today, carrying humanitarian aid puts you in greater danger than carrying a weapon,\u201d according to one aid worker. Humanitarian aid outside the supervision of the government has been forbidden in Syria since 2012, as all aid is channelled through the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other agencies registered with the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the work of grassroots humanitarian groups and NGOs, such as our partners, working in opposition-controlled areas is effectively criminalised. Humanitarian workers who carry project documents or cash can be arrested. Having been involved in the Syria response since the beginning of the crisis, I have seen eight of our partner staff arrested in Syria. While some were lucky enough to escape or to be released after months, others are still in detention or have disappeared without a trace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15aa8a60eb559c555f4edb6c66bff9f67cd07dc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15aa8a60eb559c555f4edb6c66bff9f67cd07dc1/0_36_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UN emergency relief coordinator Stephen O\u2019Brien.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UN emergency relief coordinator Stephen O\u2019Brien has said: \u2018If this week\u2019s callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magali Girardin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People delivering humanitarian assistance face the danger of being put on trial before a military tribunal for \u201cfunding terrorist activities\u201d. Any assistance to civilian populations in opposition-controlled areas, any services provided to areas outside the government control, is considered by the authorities as an act of resistance, as tacit support for the opposition. Humanitarian assistance, which follows the principle of impartiality and neutrality, therefore has to be delivered in great confidentiality, through secret networks bound together by solidarity. Supplies are smuggled through tunnels and along dirt roads, over rivers and on the backs of donkeys through rough mountain terrain, in order to reach those communities that are cut off from all basic support.</p> <p>As the level of violence in Syria increased and the conflict turned into a civil war, an increasing number of armed groups sprang up, marginalising civil institutions in the opposition-held areas and limiting the space for social and humanitarian activities.</p> <p>Some groups exercise complete surveillance over any humanitarian activity in the areas under their control. This way, they aim to influence and shape humanitarian activities in line with their political agenda, setting school curricula, controlling access to health facilities and distribution points. In many of the areas controlled by armed groups, work has become impossible, while in other areas it is a constant struggle. \u201cOur dream was that humanitarian aid workers would enjoy international protection,\u201d said Dana, one of our partners, as if this basic demand that is enshrined in international humanitarian law is a utopian one.</p> <p>Using humanitarian access as a weapon of war, the warring parties do not only restrict people\u2019s access to aid, they also directly target humanitarian operations.

Iranian politicians including President Hassan Rouhani, Iranian parliamentary deputies, and even Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio have made Lake Urmia part of their public advocacy. DiCaprio\u2019s Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFAZvGAKxHi/\">post</a> on the lake in May resulted in 328,000 likes and made him an <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/leonardo-dicaprio-instagram-lake-urmia-raise-awareness.html\">overnight superhero among Iranians</a>, illustrating the way social media can help collaboration on topics that defy borders. </p> <p>Travel to the basin of Lake Urmia and you will find an area facing a high risk of salt storms. The shrinking of the lake has diminished a fragile ecosystem, with the gradual disappearance of native wildlife including the brine shrimp Artemia and migratory birds like flamingos and pelicans. </p> <p>Such degradation threatens dire economic consequences. A once flourishing tourism industry, where visitors bathed in salty water rather like the Dead Sea, is curtailed. Many people living near the lake fear they may be forced to leave due to eye problems, respiratory diseases and other health problems caused by dust and salt particles blowing in the air. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, some local farmers referred to the lake as a tumour, viewing the seeping of its uniquely saline water as a threat to their farmlands. Today, their wish is to revitalise this desiccating lake and prevent salt storms that are diminishing soil fertility and threatening their livelihoods. The shift in perspective highlights the co-dependency we all share with our environment, and shows all too clearly the repercussions of environmental neglect.</p> <p>Iran suffers from <a href=\"http://ulrp.sharif.ir/en/news/news-1655-solve-water-crisis-iran-we-have-develop-both-mitigation-and-adaptation-measures\">\u201chydraulic mission\u201d</a> syndrome, a state of mind in which a country tries to manipulate domestic water resources to meet demand through short-sighted measures based on technology and large-scale engineering. The dream of human dominance over nature has led to a nightmare of unforeseen consequences, reminding us that we must learn to live in tune with nature to sustain ourselves.</p> <p>Dams, in particular, have become idolised as symbols of development, political strength and international prowess. One of the main factors contributing to the state of Lake Urmia is the interference in the natural flow of water into the lake by over 50 dams. The damage has been compounded by unregulated withdrawal of water, water-intensive irrigation and the unsustainable use of fertilisers.</p> <p>President Rouhani made promises about restoring Lake Urmia during his election campaign, and his administration has allocated <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/07/aperture-troubled-waters-iran-lake-urmia-environment-draught-water-preservation/\">$5 billion</a> to improve infrastructure and water conservation in the area. Nevertheless, the major proposals under consideration are still structural. While dam construction is now prohibited, the government\u2019s restoration task force has shown interest in transferring water from other river basins, upstream dredging, and connecting inflowing rivers to maximise the inflow. But without policy reforms and institutional changes - including phasing out <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/saving-iran-s-precious-lake-urmia/\">water intensive crops</a>, conservation methods in irrigation and wider changes in the behaviour of farmers and other water consumers - restoration efforts will be successful only with an unusually wet period in the years to come.</p> <p>Collaborations with international partners to restore water levels in Lake Urmia are limited but underway. Most notably, the United Nations Development Programme, Iran\u2019s Department of Environment and the Japanese government have established joint projects that involve educating local farmers on sustainable agriculture practices and reducing water consumption through improved efficiency; and supplying improved, safer fertilisers and pesticides. Over the past few months, the lake has shown some signs of recovery, but this is due more to more frequent rainfall rather than the restoration efforts.</p> <p>Lake Urmia\u2019s grim destiny unfortunately reflects a wider trend. Several bodies of water in Iran (including Gav-Khuni wetland near Isfahan, the Hamoun wetlands near Afghanistan, Bakhtegan lake in Fars province, and the Shadegan wetland and Hour-Al-Azim in Khuzestan) have been heavily impacted or dried up entirely in light of weak infrastructure, over-reliance on dams, extreme weather patterns, climatic changes, poor irrigation practices and unregulated use of water.</p> <p>In the story of Lake Urmia lie invaluable lessons. Iranians have paid for their unsustainable development and have lost many invaluable ecosystems. On the positive side, however, awareness of our interdependence with nature has been sharpened by air pollution in major cities, dust storms, soil erosion, desertification and land subsidence due to extraction of groundwater.</p> <p>Iran may now be reaching a tipping point. With the better understanding of our interconnectivity worldwide today, preserving the environment is a collective goal that everyone irrespective of age, race, or background can share. No matter where we are, or who we are, we can\u2019t save ourselves if we don\u2019t care for our environment. We are all Lake Urmia. </p> <p><em>Shirin Hakim is a doctoral researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy of Imperial College, London, working on environmental issues in Iran.

  "<p>The post-second world war baby boomers, we know, are the most fortunate of generations: young people struggle to get on the housing ladder while the newly retired are the wealthiest they have ever been. So it should perhaps be no surprise that in cinemas too, this generation is now making its presence felt, but after some neglect. When the UK film industry almost went under in the 70s, it was partly because baby boomers had less time to go the movies when they had babies of their own to look after. And when it was defibrillated in the following decade by the arrival of multiplexes, the same generation, now thirty-somethings, were not the reason for cinemas\u2019 return to life.</p> <p>Yet members of this generation are now turning out in large numbers. In America and Canada, <a href=\"http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MPAA-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-2015_Final.pdf\">15% of over-60s were defined as \u201cfrequent moviegoers\u201d</a> in 2015, up from 14% the year before and 10% the year before that. It is a similar story in the UK, where <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-audiences-2015-2016-08-25.pdf\">between 2008 and 2015 the share of over-55s in the audience increased every year</a> (apart from 2011), hitting a peak of 12.5% last year. As Crispin Lilly, CEO of Everyman Cinemas, says: \u201cThere is a whole generation of people who grew up with good quality cinemas before the 1980s that are now returning in droves.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/revolution-victoria-albert-museum-sixties-usher-neoliberalism\">Did we baby boomers bring about a revolution in the 60s or just usher in neoliberalism? | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Change has been afoot over the last four or five years. In the wake of the success of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, films starring mature actors have been huge hits with older viewers. <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-audiences-2015-2016-08-25.pdf\">Research from the BFI</a> shows that last year The Lady in the Van and The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel were both more than twice as popular as Spectre \u2013 one of the highest grossing films ever in the UK \u2013 with over 55s. Given the longevity of the Bond franchise, this is more than a little surprising.<br></p> <p>More than the actual films though, it is the surrounding experience at the cinema that is pulling this generation through the doors. \u201cEvent cinema\u201d, such as live-streamed ballet and opera, \u201cis particularly valued\u201d by older people, says Phil Clapp of the UK Cinema Association and, while a comfortable experience has always been part of the deal in independent cinema, comfort levels have been rising dramatically as \u201csilver screeners\u201d attend in greater numbers. According to Stefanie Fischer, an architect with a specialism in independent cinemas, the last three or four years have seen much higher standards of comfort in auditoria. She explains how the seat width in one cinema expanded from 550mm to 600mm and up again to 650mm in just a matter of years. Increased seat sizes, Fischer says, are also being implemented in multiplexes, which are seeing the benefits of prioritising \u201ccomfort over capacity\u201d. An increase in depth, as well as the width, of seats means that often you now don\u2019t have to stand up to allow others to get by on their way to the toilet. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"896379689506e794689acb96e2db8bdadcb104f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/896379689506e794689acb96e2db8bdadcb104f1/15_31_3396_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dev Patel and Richard Gere in The Second Best Marigold Hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dev Patel and Richard Gere in The Second Best Marigold Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Fox searchlight pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fischer describes how, unlike in multiplexes, independent cinemas look to create a welcoming environment for older people by making sure sound-absorbent materials are fitted into front of house areas so that customers can \u201chear one another without difficulty\u201d. Outside the auditoria, \u201colder audiences do tend to spend more money\u201d at the concession stand than other demographics, says Lyn Goleby, managing director of Picturehouse Cinemas \u2013 so long as they are offered a wider range of refreshments than just nachos, popcorn and fizzy drinks. It may be just these kind of details that are making an evening out at the movies seem attractive to this age group once again.</p> <p>As well as offering greater levels of comfort in cinemas, cinemas are also increasingly convenient for a mature audience to access. <a href=\"https://www.experianplc.com/media/news/2016/uk-s-ageing-population-experiencing-an-increasingly-ranging-retirement/\">A recent report by the credit-checking company Experian</a> showed that instead of making the traditional move to seaside resorts, a large chunk of well-to-do retirees (whom it described as \u201csmarties\u201d) are instead opting for market towns where they can continue to be active. As wealthy pensioners increasingly live in urban hubs, going to the movies has never been easier for them. No surprise then that Everyman Cinema chain has been buying up high street Odeons, and that almost all of its seven newly acquired cinemas are in market towns or small cities \u2013 exactly the places where more than 1.3 million of these so-called smarties are now living. This could be particularly good news for the film industry, because one of the reasons why cinema attendance plummeted in the post-war years was that young families moved into the suburbs, away from cinemas in town and city centres.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/08/older-viewers-rescuing-cinema\">How older viewers are rescuing cinema</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though they are still a relatively small share of the audience, the steady rise in older cinemagoers over the past few years has coincided with a decline in UK cinema\u2019s most reliable customers, 15 to 24 year olds, who have been heading to the silver screen less and less since 2012. Given these trends, as well as the fact that so many of the older generation still don\u2019t go to the movies regularly, the industry may continue to switch gears in order to accommodate this promising new market.</p> <p>So, are the changes in cinema design, food and location encouraging mature audiences back into the cinemas, or are these things being accommodated around them? Whichever it is, says Clapp, many older people haven\u2019t been to the cinema in a long time. \u201cIn fact the last time they went was probably in the 1980s and that was a pretty dispiriting experience. It\u2019s a bit of a chicken and egg thing.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>The danger in having a moon village as your vision for the future is that people get the wrong impression. The mind leaps ahead and lands on a movie set: a giant dome shelters a huddle of homes, a bank of generators, and a modestly-stocked shop that doubles as the post office. A lost spacefarer with a PhD in botany clings to life by growing spuds in human faeces.</p> <p>The idea is so easily misconstrued that Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), makes clear from the start what the moon village is not. \u201cLet me tell you what it won\u2019t mean,\u201d he says. \u201cSingle houses, a school, a church, a swimming pool, a bakery, an undertaker. This is not what I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d<br></p> <p>What he does have in mind is the future of human space exploration. In a decade or so, the International Space Station will be done with. The $150bn outpost will plunge back to Earth in a fireball above the Pacific Ocean leaving astronauts with nowhere to go. If humans want to maintain a presence in space, they need a new plan, and soon.<br></p> <p>While Nasa remains fixated on sending people to Mars - a challenge of daunting technical difficulty - ESA under Woerner sees the moon as the obvious next venture for a long time to come. The \u201cvillage\u201d he has in mind is a diverse community of public and private organisations that work on the moon together. A band of nations might build a telescope on the far side of the moon, where observations are shielded from Earth\u2019s electromagnetic din. A single agency could test whether robots can make radiation-proof habitats from lunar regolith. A tech firm could extract water from polar ice and turn some into hydrogen, oxygen and rocket fuel. Another might break into lunar tourism.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1949b78b753beb5a65e683d1e2a0e579dcba0ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1949b78b753beb5a65e683d1e2a0e579dcba0ad/96_0_2343_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ESA\u2019s Jan Woerner is quick to point out that his moon village vision is not \u201csingle houses, a school, a church, a swimming pool, a bakery, an undertakers.

In time, Woerner says, it would build up the vital infrastructure and practical know-how that humans will need to head more safely into the farther reaches of the solar system.<br></p> <p>Woerner has kicked the idea around for a while, but will raise it formally with ESA\u2019s ministerial council for the first time later this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspiring concept, and if others have a better idea, I am ready to change my mind. But so far I can tell you that the moon village is my favourite solution for the future,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe moon is the next logical stepping stone.\u201d<br></p> <p>He has plenty of support. \u201cThe question is what to do after the space station,\u2019 says Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, University of London. \u201cEither nothing follows and you shut down human space exploration, or you build another space station \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to see the point of that \u2013 or you go somewhere else, and I strongly believe the moon is the next place to go.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It is more a necessity than a desire, Crawford says. Before we head to Mars \u2013 or any other faraway body \u2013 humans must learn how to thrive in dusty, high radiation environments. \u201cTo send people to Mars you have to be very confident in all aspects of the technology,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to the moon is risky too, but the advantage of learning and trialling all this stuff on the moon is that if something goes wrong, you can bring people back. The moon is only three days away. Abort options exist.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The moon itself is a laboratory. An archive of solar system history, the signatures of meteorites, comets and the solar wind are written in the dust. A moon village would give scientists the means to explore the body, a lump of the ancient Earth, much as Antarctic bases have opened up the southern continent.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45e045e3974fee56dd06e8aab6ce75fd684c004c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45e045e3974fee56dd06e8aab6ce75fd684c004c/37_0_2790_1674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/Foster + Partners</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The moon village has plenty of parallels with polar outposts. The US McMurdo research centre on the tip of Ross Island began as a handful of buildings in the 1950s. It has now grown to more than 100 structures and a population of 1000 in the summer months. The settlement has an airport, a water distillation plant, sewers and a waste management centre, all needed to support the dormitories, clubs and research facilities. Scientists at the base make space weather observations, study microbes that thrive under glaciers, drill ice cores to obtain 100,000 year records of Earth\u2019s atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, and send out robotic submarines to map the underneath of sea ice.</p> <p>Next year, the US company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/03/us-startup-moon-express-2017-lunar-mission\">Moon Express</a> hopes to land the first commercial spacecraft on the moon. The polar regions are thought to harbour vast reserves of ice that can be melted into water, split into hydrogen and oxygen, and turned into rocket fuel. Bob Richards, a co-founder of the company, has called the moon a \u201cgas station in the sky\u201d. Naveen Jain, the chairman, told the Guardian it is time entrepreneurs had the chance to show what they can do there. \u201cIf ESA wants to enable private enterprises to do what they do best, then I absolutely support it,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The prospect of turning the moon into a mine may not please everyone, and Crawford says that international legislation around the resources should be strengthened. But he sees no moral objection to mining. \u201cThe reason we have qualms about it on Earth is we are damaging the habitats of other living things we share the planet with. The moon is essentially a dead rock, and it must be preferable to exploit bodies that don\u2019t have any indigenous life on them.\u201d<br></p> <p>Under George W. Bush, Nasa planned to return to the moon and build a permanent polar base. But the plan was shelved by Barack Obama, who explained his decision with a blunt \u201cwe\u2019ve been there before.\u201d Even after the Apollo missions, the idea that Nasa has been there and done the moon is nothing but \u201cthe most superficial geopolitical soundbite,\u201d says Crawford.<br></p> <p>Jeff Hoffman, a former Nasa astronaut, believes humans need to go back to the moon as soon as possible. \u201cIt has been nearly 50 years since we explored a planetary surface and we need to get some experience. The problem with a \u2018moon village\u2019 would be if the infrastructure is so costly to build and maintain that resources for Mars get sucked up,\u201d he says. \u201cPlans for lunar exploration need to be done in a way to enhance our ability to get to Mars, not handicap it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Katherine Joy, a lunar scientist at Manchester University, says that while an international consensus is supposed to exist in the form of the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/content/just-released-updates-to-the-global-exploration-roadmap\">Global Exploration Roadmap</a>, a clear plan is still needed. \u201cA pathway needs to be decided soon,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is the strength of the moon village concept. It provides an ambitious vision that can bring people together.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cA lunar base isn\u2019t a distraction from our desire to visit and explore Mars,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we learned from Apollo is that touch-and-go-style missions are exciting, and scientifically rewarding, but they don\u2019t lead to a sustained human presence on a different world.\u201d <br></p> <p>Exploration and learning how to survive on an alien world is only part of the space game. For decades, missions in Earth orbit and out into the solar system have bound countries together. The International Space Station operates only because Americans, Russians, Europeans and others work side-by-side and trust each other. As Britain prepares to leave the EU, the moon village might do for Europe what politicians could not, Woerner believes. \u201cSpace has the power to join forces in Europe - and even beyond Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should use it for the sake of humankind.\u201d<br></p>",

Part of me thinks that I would\u2019ve been able to see through at least the first year of politics if I had better help with my mental health.</p> <p>\u201cAs an introverted person there seemed to be a lot of pressure to go out and talk to everyone you see. By my second day, everyone already seemed to have established groups of friends. I felt like I was doing something wrong. Often my anxiety would get the better of me and I\u2019d end up not going out. I think there\u2019s this whole idea surrounding university that is that you are going to meet your friends for life, your soulmate, etc. I already had a serious boyfriend and a group of close friends that I wasn\u2019t really keen on the idea of dropping everyone in favour of people I\u2019d only spoken to once because \u2026 it\u2019s university.</p> <p>\u201cWhile a lot of students seek counselling, I don\u2019t think mental illness in university students is addressed properly; there\u2019s an assumption that everyone can carry on as normal, when it\u2019s really not that easy when your mind\u2019s telling you to just stay in bed.\u201d</p> <p>Elle is now studying for a qualification in primary education.

I\u2019m not wasting public resources and my own money to have a good time or \u2018discover myself\u2019, as so many student guides encourage one to do. It\u2019s about the degree classification. I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s room for debate. I wish there was. </p> <p>\u201cStudent debt is a huge worry for me. I am probably not going to pursue a master\u2019s degree or a PGCE, despite being fairly likely to achieve a first, because of the thought of going further into debt. I\u2019m a Welsh student, which means I\u2019m, overall, paying \u00a318k less than my English neighbours, but that thought heightens my anxiety.

Leaving my career and entering into the unknown resulted in tremendous pressure to prove that I had made the right decision.

So while classmates were out drinking \u2026 my home was the library. Although my university experience suffered I achieved a first-class degree from a top 10 university. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I think about being in roughly \u00a350,000 worth of debt, I think about how far I would have gotten in my previous career, and where I\u2019d be financially if I hadn\u2019t chosen to go to university as a mature student.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>Not everyone gets a 2:1 or above, it\u2019s just that no-one wants to admit to getting any lower.<strong>\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p>Elizabeth, 21, graduated this year from the University of Birmingham with a degree in English after almost dropping out of her studies in her final year. </p> <p> \u201cWeirdly, I found there was enormous pressure to be having the \u2018best time of my life\u2019 at uni, and when I hit a slump in second year and stopped enjoying myself, it became something very shameful. I was not passionate about my course at all, and that felt like failing in itself. It felt like I was doomed to never be successful like my peers and like I was lacking the drive and employability that I thought I witnessed in everyone around me, when in actual fact I just wasn\u2019t doing a course that best suited my skills. I ended up having a horrible breakdown and very nearly dropped out in my final year. </p> <p>\u201cAfter my final-year exams I had reached a very dark mindset that convinced me I would have to end my life if I was not on track for a 2:1. I had gone as far as making plans and drafting letters to loved ones. It is so commonly said at university that everybody gets a 2:1, that it\u2019s easy and you don\u2019t have to work very hard for it. I got laughed at for worrying I wouldn\u2019t get a 2:1, because \u2018everyone stresses but they all get a 2:1 in the end\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cOn results day Facebook is full of posts celebrating firsts and 2:1s, but I have never seen a post celebrating or even just admitting a 2:2. I know two people who did get a 2:2, but I only know because they asked, and you could see the shame in their face to tell me. Not everyone gets a 2:1 or above, it\u2019s just that no-one wants to admit to getting any lower. </p> <p>\u201cI became a volunteer for Nightline [a charity which offers listening support to students] while at university, which made it clear to me that not everyone enjoys university.

It also leads to a hierarchy amongst students as sexed-up, jock males can, in some unis, be seen as the ideal, though, fortunately, unlike in school, academia/ intelligence is now prized which provides an outlet.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 28 September to correct the qualification of one of the contributors.<br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Do you ever learn about health from the media? I do. Here are some things I\u2019ve seen recently. \u201cHow to engineer maximum deliciousness, pack in nutrients, increase sustainability, and build crazy food mashups.\u201d But this is rather distant from my goal of eating when hungry. \u201cMore than 90% of us don\u2019t get enough potassium.\u201d But enough potassium for what? \u201cGreat Sleep Tonight: Pro Secrets, Revealed.\u201d I had not known anyone slept professionally.</p> <p>One would be more likely to blink at these follies if we were not so surrounded by nonstop fatuities in the imperative voice of advertising. \u201cTastes so pure you\u2019ll love it.\u201d Does anyone know what purity tastes like? \u201cDiscover how good your body was designed to feel.\u201d But who designed my body? \u201cStress less with the bestselling, multi-award-winning anti-stress drink.\u201d Surely caring about the best, most award-winning supplement beverage is a cause of stress?</p> <p>Even the bag my fast-food hamburger arrives in won\u2019t shut up. It\u2019s covered with testimony to the franchise-corporation\u2019s caring, its love of me, its love of soil, tomatoes, our planet, friendship, farmers, heritage, my arteries and babies. Yet I can\u2019t even imagine who is caring \u2013 what human heart beats inside this paper trash. I think I am supposed to care about these things, and so the salesmen parrot what they suppose would be my aspirations.</p> <p>Has any free people ever been so shouted at by caring fools and salesmen? Under the guise of useful knowledge, forces that frankly mean us no good, which range in mood between hysterical enthusiasm, indifference and careless exploitation, warn us with \u201chealth\u201d advice that is variously incoherent, short-sighted (to be reversed or falsified five years later) and banal. You can tell people not to eat eggs, but a decade later you\u2019ll be telling people to eat eggs. It seems trivial, but it always costs something \u2013 in worry and stupefaction, and in hours of our lives.</p> <p>You could say that this advice all comes in bad faith. But the voices which approach us in good faith may be even more to blame.</p> <p>Health, exercise, food, sex have become central preoccupations of our time. We preserve the living corpse in an optimal state, not so we may do something with it, but for the feeling of optimisation. More and more of life gets turned over to life maintenance at the very moment you\u2019d think we\u2019d be free to pursue something else.</p> <p>I find it hard not to want to live longer. I also want to live without pain. This means I want health. But when I place myself at a point within the vast constellation of health knowledge and health behaviours, I can\u2019t help but detect some misunderstanding. The systems of health have little to do with my simple ambitions. There is something too much, or too many, in them; too arbitrary, or too controlling; too doom-laden, too managerial, too messianic.</p> <p>We should spare a thought for the fate of what used to be called the \u201cnecessities of life\u201d. Necessity dictates what must be done for the body before anything can be done for the mind. For millennia, people have known what the necessities of life are. Food, shelter and clothes, made or won by labour. Sex and reproduction, tied to the labour of childbirth and work of child rearing. Sleep. (Alexander the Great said that sleep and sexual intercourse, more than anything else, reminded him that he was mortal). Movement, as has only come into focus since we began to sit for so much of our days. Touch, perhaps, as has become more obvious as the world became less tactile and rough, more screened and smoothed. Excretion.</p> <p>But 3,000 years of civilisation have worked to make these necessities easy to come by. In the last three centuries, human progress has pacified necessity in the rich countries. Back-breaking labour has been reduced. Food is inexpensive and superabundant. Sexual desire has been decoupled from pregnancy. The dangers of infection, fever and accident have been diminished by medicine, and medical research seeks ways to head off more slow-growing diseases. For many, simply to be born in a rich nation is to have won the lottery for inexpensive access to the necessities of life; to be gloriously, unprecedentedly free from cares historically and in comparison to much of the globe. There is freedom to enjoy \u2013 and there are wealth and material freedom to spread to others. For progressive civilisation had always expected that meeting necessity in the west was a mere prerequisite to further, higher goals: justice, equality, democracy, and the extension of ease of access to the necessities of life to all.</p> <p>But we have taken an unexpected detour on the way to meeting those higher goals. Once progress had made it easy to acquire the necessities of life, other forces set about making those needs mentally complicated and hard. Into this category goes much of what passes for wisdom about health, exercise, food and sex. Inexpensive things have become expensive, trivial matters require obsessive thought, universal biology is mazed with fashion and status-seeking, and free possessions are commoditised. If I feel sure of one thing, it is that this kind of \u201chealth\u201d imperative is not moral. It is grooming \u2013 what monkeys do in picking nits out of their fur. We may find that grooming sits among the subordinate necessities of life. But surely the ceaseless grooming and optimisation of everyday life stands in the way of finding out how else we could spend our attention and our energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ea09b09b31fc8fa5ef124b869dd874cb8bd294\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ea09b09b31fc8fa5ef124b869dd874cb8bd294/235_339_3605_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slaves to the machine \u2026 exercise junkies strive to build muscles that only get used in the gym\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slaves to the machine \u2026 exercise junkies build muscles that only get used in the gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uwe Kraft/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A decade ago I wrote an essay titled \u201c<a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/issue-1/essays/against-exercise/\">Against Exercise</a>\u201d. It came about from a trip to the gym to run on a treadmill. I was standing in the usual stance of mutual disregard, pretending not to notice my neighbours sweating through skintight pyjamas and making their angry \u2013 or, I suppose, fierce \u2013 faces. I tried not to look up when someone grunted or shouted, and kept my eyes politely on the calories ticking by on my readout, just as in a lift I\u2019d keep my eyes on the floor numbers.</p> <p>But then I breached convention and looked around, and was struck down by the sort of vision that must have come to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/21/the-10-best-works-by-william-blake\">William Blake</a>, a glance into heaven and hell, suddenly manifest in his garden in Felpham. There was a young man crucified on a lat pull-down. There was a young woman whose legs were madly turned by a spinning bike. No one looked happy: they either looked like executioners, grim as death, or victims. Certainly no one looked sociable \u2013 though this might be the space with the most people, together, supposedly at ease and enjoying leisure time, that they would enter all day. I turned from one unseeing face to the next, each chasing some number, and I said: \u201cYou are condemned. You are condemned. You are condemned.\u201d I, too, was condemned. I got down from the treadmill.</p> <p>This, of course, had nothing to do with an intelligible argument. So when I got home, I began to try to figure out why we go to the gym. There are explicit rationales, and the precise words and phrases which recur in official injunctions to exercise. Then there are the quiet things people say in passing, about the pleasures and the ghastlinesses of it all. Modern exercise has a background in sport, even in the ancient gymnasia \u2013 but it is really quite different. It certainly seemed striking that, as advanced societies have done away with much industrial labour, and have automobilised transport, the new immaterial labourer spends his leisure mimicking the old repetitive gestures of the die press, or a stevedore\u2019s lifting of cargo, or a rural traveller\u2019s walk to a distant town, but turned into spectacle, sped-up, numbered, and producing muscles that serve no practical use but more of the same mimicry. And that this is so often experienced as obligation, rather than play.Then, I began to read and write about diet and food. Certainly we are in a golden intellectual age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/10-things-need-to-know-global-food-system\">political critiques of industrial food production</a>. The pollution and cruelty of factory farms have come into public view. The dangers of pesticides and groundwater contamination lie behind the progress of organic farming. But alongside the public-spirited motives for a return to heirloom products, artisanal production and farm-to-table eating, there seems to be another push towards rarity, social distinction and hostility to the cheap mass provision of food as a fundamental civilised achievement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/18/paleo-diet-critics-science\">What Paleo diet experts think \u2013 and why they're wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most ambiguous, to me, is the new figure of the foodie. Only in a culture cut off from agriculture and need can food become a hobby and grounds for individual identity. The old gourmet was a bit of a snob: he wed himself to France or Italy, learned to cook a single cuisine and became obsessed with importing, usually wine and cheese.</p> <p>The foodie differs in having the whole globe at his fingertips. His cookbooks gravitate first to Europe (Provence; southern Italy), then quickly carry him to Turkey, Morocco, Vietnam, India. No single tradition exists for him to learn, no singular importers to patronise. Rather, an ocean of ingredients washes up on his shores. There is no food we can\u2019t access. There is no traditional food, moreover, that can\u2019t be further enchanted by our concentration, restriction, choice, and discrimination between better and worse specimens. Would you like some chipotle with your lemongrass?

He swims in possibility.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eve O'Sullivan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foodie wades out and swims in possibility. And then, surprisingly, many a foodie will deliberately restrict his range. He sets rules or laws for himself that make the quest for food harder and the thinking more complex. Undiscovered foods only; \u201cauthentic\u201d restaurants only, or kitsch diners or barbecue joints; organic food only; local or farmers\u2019 market food, raw food or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/slow-food-story-goeff-andrews\">slow food</a> only. Foodieism is a natural hobby for first-world professionals, ostensibly showing an interest in the world, but referring back to domination and the perfection of the enriched, physical self.</p> <p>Having our food supply made simple, we devote ourselves to looking for ways to make it difficult. Another route is through dieting, ostensibly for health. Here, though, the weight-loss imperative, with its shadows of attractiveness and social distinction, and other fantasies of rarity, difficulty and expense, complicate the fairly mundane research consensus on improving health: eat moderately, move more. You can avoid bread, eat only protein and fat, and lose weight \u2013 since too much weight is said to be a killer. But as you polish off your bacon, steak and cheese, nothing has falsified the old research that correlates animal fats with plaque-filled arteries, heart disease, stroke and cancers.</p> <p>You can rediscover your inner ape and revert to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/18/paleo-diet-critics-science\">a \u201cPaleolithic diet\u201d with evolutionary justifications</a>. But no 21st-century butcher can provide you the animals eaten by our Paleolithic ancestors. You will not eat it in the conditions of scarcity of our Paleolithic ancestors. None of the rest of your life, upbringing, habits or ingested substances resemble those of our Paleolithic ancestors. You might equally ground your fantasies of historical destiny in the fact that the entire history of human culture and civilisation has occurred in the Neolithic era \u2013 ie, facilitated by the planting of grain and domestication of animals. <em>Star Trek</em> fans would seem to have a better grasp of the scientific method.</p> <p>Then sex and sexuality began to interest me. We\u2019ve had a remarkable sexual liberation \u2013 particularly since the 1960s. Major achievements have included the end of shame and illegality in sex outside of marriage, the feminist reorganisation of intercourse around the female orgasm as well as the male; the destigmatisation of homosexuality, and a new fluidity to the norms of gender identity. The underlying impetus in all these reforms was to remove social penalties for doing what people were doing anyway.</p> <p>But competing with true liberation has been sexual liberalisation \u2013 an effort to tell you that only expertise, exposure, advice and apparatus can let you enjoy, in the right way, what was already freely possessed by you. A true test of liberation, as distinct from liberalisation, is whether you have also been freed to be free from sex. To ignore it, or to be asexual, without consequent social opprobrium or imputation of deficiency. We ought to see social categories of asexuals, who are free to have no sex just as others are free to have endless spectacular sex, and not feel towards them either suspicion or pity. One of the cruel betrayals of sexual liberation is the illusion that a person can be free only if he holds sex as all-important and exposes it endlessly to others \u2013 providing it, proving it, enjoying it.</p> <p>I think sometimes of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ftvh9eWkAc\">John Prine song</a>: \u201cWe are living in the future, I\u2019ll tell you how I know / I read it in the paper, 15 years ago.\u201d We often speak about a coming age. In that near future, we\u2019ll enjoy heavenly ease and wellbeing, safety and leisure. How wonderful it will be! In fact, I think we ought to admit that many of us in the rich nations are already living in that future, and have been for some decades.</p> <p>But our surprising response to our times has been the creation of new forms of pseudonecessity. We go to the gym to strain at imitations of hard labour, lifting nonexistent roofbeams, hoeing nonexistent fields. We pretend that our food \u2013 now safe, plentiful, cheap, delicious \u2013 matters so much to our bodies that we must perfect it, elaborating a new necessity of pollution and taboo for heritage grains and laborious artisanal manufacture. We refuse to recognise that an 80-year lifespan of activities and projects is functional immortality for the human animal. Or that dying is necessary, just to let new people come on to the earth. So we substitute life-preservation for living, spending invaluable portions of youth and middle age on trying to increase our odds for an extra one, two or five years at the very end.</p> <p>Frankly, I suspect that an ethics of living in a rich nation at the dawn of the 21st century involves not caring so much about your health, your diet, your exercise and your thrills. The meaningful time is now. We should be prepared to enjoy our good luck, and drop dead after a sufficient length of time \u2013 but ask, along the way, what we actually wish to do with our time. A culture of health and futurity, right now, represents a terrified or intimidated flight from moral freedom \u2013 covering our eyes from the fact that we have no further urgent tasks of bodily improvement, and really need to choose between setting new social goals, or just grooming ourselves into eternity.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Against Everything</em> by Mark Greif, published by Verso, is available for \u00a313.93 (RRP \u00a316.99) from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/against-everything.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Here, you pass cars with large stickers pronouncing \u201cReal Men Shoot Wolves\u201d to show support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/19/norwegian-court-to-rule-on-six-men-accused-of-illegal-wolf-hunt\">six local poachers who were imprisoned for illegal hunting last year</a>. </p> <p>Lars-Erik Lie, a 46-year-old mental health worker who founded the group in 2010, told the Guardian: \u201cI got so upset and saddened by the locals\u2019 thirst for wolf blood, and wanted to show that not all villagers are in favour of wiping out this beautiful animal. </p> <p>\u201cMany locals think there should be room for both predators and livestock, but they have kept their mouths shut out of fear for repercussions.\u201d Lie has himself been the target of threats. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a801194ff776a2b6f06286e4aad0c51532a8ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a801194ff776a2b6f06286e4aad0c51532a8ba4/0_100_3029_1818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scandinavian wolf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Culling could undermine the viability of the entire Norwegian wolf population, say conservationists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Strandli Brendhagen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the heart of the matter is the conflict between sheep farmers and conservationists. Norway is a large sheep farming nation, unique in letting most of its 2 million sheep roam free all summer without herding, fencing and with little supervision. </p> <p>As a result, 120,000 sheep are lost each year, and 20,000 of these deaths are attributed to predators, judging by state compensation payouts, which are based on documentation and assessment by the authorities. Beyond that, 900 cadavers found annually are confirmed to have been killed by predators. The wolf accounts for 8% of kills. </p> <p>Wolves, bears, lynx, wolverines and golden eagles are Norway\u2019s native top predators. </p> <p>In 1846, the authorities issued bounties to hunt them down, resulting in all species being virtually extinct by the mid-20th century, The wolf was given protected status in 1973, a watershed in wildlife management for the acknowledgement of its part in Norwegian fauna and in need of protection. The first wolf returned in 1980, though the first breeding entirely on Norwegian soil did not take place until 1997. </p> <p>In the meantime, a new breed of sheep had invaded the land. \u201cThe breed of sheep vastly favoured by Norwegian farmers is unsuited to roam around the rugged terrain of the country,\u201d said Silje Ask Lundberg, from Friends of the Earth Norway.</p> <p>The sheep is favoured for its size and large proportion of meat, but is a bad climber and has poor herding and flight instincts, unlike the old short-tail land race, considered the original Norwegian sheep race, prevalent on the west coast, where ironically there are no wolves. </p> <p>Just across the mountain from Lie\u2019s house in Trysil, is the territory of the Slett\u00e5sen pack, which has been marked out for a complete cull even though the wolves live within a designated wolf zone. </p> <p>The framework for predator management has been set by parliament, with local predator management boards setting hunting and culling quotas when population targets have been achieved.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of a scientific and professional approach is obvious,\u201d said Lie. In January his organisation filed a complaint that the board votes in representatives with vested interests, such as farmers, whereas green party members have been excluded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75b649a56f0233da75cefedef5b1063e8a0d0ca9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75b649a56f0233da75cefedef5b1063e8a0d0ca9/0_115_4600_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lars-Erik Lie of Predator Alliance Norway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lars-Erik Lie of Predator Alliance Norway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arve Herman Tangen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> At his office in Oslo, Sverre Lundemo of WWF Norway is also puzzled. \u201cIt seems strange that we should punish the wolf for following its natural instincts, particularly within specially designated zones where the wolf supposedly has priority over livestock,\u201d he says.</p> <p> \u201cThe Slett\u00e5sen pack is very stable and of genetic importance. Scandinavian wolves are subject to inbreeding and poaching, and this makes the small population more vulnerable to random events. Culling these individuals can undermine the viability of the entire Norwegian wolf population.\u201d</p> <p>According to Lundemo, the decision for culling appears to be based on politics as much as on science. The WWF have examined the case document that formed the base of the decision. \u201cThis a questionable decision on many levels. The case documents don\u2019t substantiate why these three particular territories were singled out for culling,\u201d said Lundemo.</p> <p>Despite the population within the wolf zone having almost doubled since last year, attacks on livestock have almost halved. \u201cMost of the injuries are inflicted by roaming young wolves from Swedish packs,\u201d said Lundemo.</p> <p>Sweden has stricter regulations for sheep farmers, refusing to compensate farmers who don\u2019t protect livestock properly. As a member of the EU, Sweden had a planned licenced cull of 10 % of their wolf population of 400 in 2014 reduced following pressure. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth advocate more suitable breeds of sheep, or cattle, and better fences and herding. WWF is exploring the option to challenge the decision legally before the wolf hunt sets in on 1 January 2017.</p> <p>Back in Trysil, the Predator Alliance is gaining momentum. The group has submitted a 35,000-signature petition for protecting the wolf to the prime minister, Erna Solberg. \u201cWe humans have become greedy, behaving like nature is there for our taking,\u201d said Lie. \u201cWhen you have a population as small as the one we have in Norway now, you have to draw the line.\u201d</p>",

How better to leave your mark higher on the wall than to make every human disease obsolete within your child\u2019s lifetime? Or at least find a way to manage awful conditions, so they no longer mar people\u2019s lives?</p> <p>But audacious goals are precisely what are needed. \u201cWe have to be bold about the scale of the challenge we face in improving human health,\u201d says Steve Caddick, professor of chemical biology at University College London and director of innovation at the Wellcome Trust, the world\u2019s largest biomedical research charity. \u201cWhat is truly important about this kind of approach is that it creates the hope you need to go from exploratory science to making the world a better place.\u201d He goes on: \u201cAspiration is essential. This idea that if we put our minds to it, almost anything is possible \u2013 that is what can sustain people through the peaks and troughs of decades of research.\u201d</p> <p>Chan and Zuckerberg will stump up at least $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) for the effort over the next 10 years. That is not a vast sum for the task ahead. The new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/17/francis-crick-institute-biomedical-science-research\">Francis Crick Institute</a> in London, now filling with 1,400 scientists, could be built and run for 10 years on that. The Wellcome Trust itself will spend \u00a35bn on biomedical research in the next five years alone. But part of Chan and Zuckerberg\u2019s hope is to grow a movement to fund science: where they have led, they want other wealthy individuals to follow. An audacious, long-term goal backed by world-class scientists is the way to make that happen.<br></p> <p>As Chan and Zuckerberg state, four types of diseases cause most of the deaths in the world: heart disease, cancer, neurological diseases and infectious diseases. The research kicked off by the initiative will focus on the basic science underlying them. The rationale is sound: it takes fundamental breakthroughs to make a real difference in medicine.<br></p> <p>The first step is a $600m \u201c<a href=\"http://czbiohub.org/\">Biohub</a>\u201d that will draw scientists and engineers from the Bay Area\u2019s leading institutions: Stanford, the University of California, San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley. The hub has two major projects lined up already. The Human Cell Atlas will map out the internal workings of every cell type in the body, a mammoth task that is bound to open up new avenues in medicine. The Infectious Disease Initiative aims to bring fresh thinking to drug design, diagnostic tests and vaccines. According to Tom Solomon, a neurologist and director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at Liverpool University, such radical new approaches could be as important as the money itself.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/02/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-45bn-pledge-change-philanthropy\">Will Zuckerberg and Chan's $45bn pledge change philanthropy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet in Silicon Valley, it seems the only solutions are hi-tech solutions. This is one area where Chan and Zuckerberg may fall short in their aim to leave the world a better place for children. Only 10% of health research funds are spent in developing countries, where 90% of preventable deaths occur. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will apparently direct three-quarters of its efforts towards heart disease, cancer and neurological disease, the chronic conditions of the west. That may leave too little emphasis on infectious diseases.</p> <p>A recent report from the World Health Organisation made clear that unless developing countries have the means to gather and study their own medical data, public health is unlikely to improve. It is the old adage about teaching a man to fish. Childbirth still kills hundreds of thousands of mothers and babies in low-income countries. To prevent those deaths does not require a scientific breakthrough. It takes know-how and facilities.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not as sexy as saying you are going to develop a drug or a vaccine, but what is needed is research capacity development,\u201d says Trudie Lang, director of the global health network at Oxford University. \u201cNurses, midwives and community health workers need to be trained and supported.

  "<p>Eyebrows would be raised if American crocodiles, found on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/crocodile.htm\">southern tip of Florida</a>, decided to relocate to New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue or Moroccan camels suddenly joined the tourist throng outside Buckingham Palace in London. Yet this is the scale of species shift that appears to be under way in Alaska.<br></p> <p>In July, researchers in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cakr/index.htm\">Cape Krusenstern national monument</a> on the north-west coast of Alaska were startled to discover a nest containing Caspian terns on the gravelly beach of a lagoon. The birds were an incredible 1,000 miles further north than the species had been previously recorded.</p> <p>\u201cThere was plenty of shock, it is a very unusual situation,\u201d said Dr Martin Robards, Arctic program director at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which found the nest. \u201cWe checked with Caspian tern experts and they were all very surprised they were this far north. We get Arctic terns here but these terns are much bigger, they really stand out.\u201d</p> <p>The terns, usually found in Washington state, successfully bred and chicks have now flown the nest. While it remains to be seen whether Caspian terns will become ensconced long-term within the Arctic circle, the epic relocation is emblematic of how warming temperatures are causing a huge upheaval in the basic rhythms of Alaska\u2019s environment.

Snow and ice has retreated, spring is coming earlier. The landscape is changing and so are its residents.</p> <p>\u201cTo be 1,000 miles further north attests to how much the globe has warmed,\u201d said Terry Root, a biologist and senior fellow at Stanford University. \u201cBirds follow their physiology, nothing else. If they think they should move, they move. Alaska has warmed so much that it is causing havoc to a lot of nature.\u201d</p> <p>While most species aren\u2019t able to move as far as terns, scientists are noticing shifts across Alaska. Moose and beavers have moved north of the Brooks Range and onto the Arctic plain, which increasingly offers suitable vegetation as the region <a href=\"http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/tundra_greenness.html\">warms up and greens</a>. </p> <p>Red foxes have moved in and have started to outcompete Arctic foxes. A similar thing may happen if the beefy Caspian terns start to push out their smaller cousins.

They are being forced onto land, where they risk starvation. This desperate scenario is shared with walruses, which have already suffered a 50% drop since the 1980s. In recent years tens of thousands of the tusked beasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/27/walruses-alaska-arctic-sea-ice-melt\">have had to crowd ashore</a>, with many perishing in stampedes.</p> <p>The melting on land is just as stark. Over the past decade, Alaska has lost 850 gigatonnes of water from its shrinking glaciers, enough to raise the global sea level by 2.9mm. We are living through the fastest Arctic glacier decline in at least 6,000 years, according to Dr Martin Sharp, professor of Earth and atmospheric science at the University of Alberta.</p> <p>\u201cIf the warming trends continue then we expect to see continuous retreat,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cWe are seeing the complete loss of glaciers, areas that had ice caps in the 1950s don\u2019t have them now. That trend will probably increase.\u201d</p> <p>Alaska is being locked into an unhappy cycle of events. As the declining glaciers lose albedo, or reflectivity from sunlight, they absorb more heat and therefore melt further. </p> <p>The vegetation poking through thawing permafrost aids the spread of wildfire which in turn releases more carbon dioxide \u2013 flames have recently licked areas of Alaskan forest previously unburned for thousands of years. The amount of area burned each year in the state is <a href=\"http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/regions/alaska\">expected to double by 2050</a> even if the world acts swiftly on climate change.</p> <p>Summer Arctic sea ice is forecast to winnow away completely by the 2030s, which will be a boon for tourism operators looking to traverse the opening <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/northwest-passage-clear-ice-again-2016\">north-west sea passage</a>.

The state will still be cooler than the lower 48 states and has plenty of wilderness. </p> <p>\u201cThe Caspian tern is a success story in many ways,\u201d said Root. \u201cUnfortunately, many animals won\u2019t be able to move.

Some counselling services are under-resourced, and students are seeking help against a backdrop of mounting pressure to get the best possible degree, in order to secure a good job to pay off their debts from student loans. </p> <p>\u201cWhat used to happen was that in the first year people played hard,\u201d said one head of counselling. \u201cBut now they are coming in already worried that they need to do well.

Many universities have also become far more proactive in reaching out to students.</p> <p>The figures, obtained through a series of freedom of information requests to higher education (HE) institutions across the UK, indicate that at some universities young men, who are traditionally hard to reach, are increasingly using services as some of the taboo surrounding mental health dissipates.</p> <p>For instance, at the University of Edinburgh, the number of male students approaching support services \u2013 including chaplaincy, disability and mental health services \u2013 between 2010-11 and 2014-15, more than doubled, with numbers up from 274 a year to 623.<br></p> <p>Numbers of men approaching services also almost doubled at Glasgow University over the same period, thanks in part to male staff working on the counselling team, and a peer-to-peer support network which attracted a significant number of male students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-22T15:26:55/embed.html\" data-alt=\"University counselling\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-22T15:26:55/embed.html\">University counselling</a> </figure>  <p>University College London was the only institution in the sample to include figures for transgender students seeking counselling.

Last year 53% had previously been seen by therapists for a variety of issues including depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p> <p>The 50% increase in the number of students accessing counselling is based on figures comparing uptake of services in 2010-11 and 2014-15 provided to the Guardian by 37 higher education institutions, including many leading Russell Group universities, such as Oxford, Durham, Liverpool and Sheffield.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In numerical terms, students accessing counselling services in the Guardian sample rose from just under 25,000 five years ago to more than 37,000 in the 2014-15 academic year, a 50% rise.</p> <p>This trend persists even when an overall increase in student enrolment is taken into account. Among those institutions which provided comparable enrolment and counselling figures, the proportion of students accessing these services rose by 47% in the same period. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that students are now coming to university when previously they would not have come,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cWhen they come to a university like UCL or Oxford or Cambridge \u2013 one of the top 10 universities \u2013 the pressure is enormous.\u201d</p> <p>Swansea University, which recorded just 80 students seeking counselling in 2010-11, saw figures shoot up to more than 1,000 five years later, largely as a result of the university\u2019s efforts to raise awareness among students and to destigmatise mental health issues.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0af31d9c3a841a7e3c8acbedd71d8711ea14cf0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0af31d9c3a841a7e3c8acbedd71d8711ea14cf0c/0_134_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swansea University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swansea University</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swansea University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kevin Child, the head of student services at Swansea, said: \u201cThe significant increase in demand for mental health support is a national trend, with all HE providers identifying the issue as a significant challenge.</p> <p>\u201cWe have attracted students to our services who may traditionally have attempted to manage mental health issues for longer periods without coming forward, especially males. This has enabled us to make earlier interventions and provide more specific and effective support at an earlier stage.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth Caleb, the head of counselling services at Brunel University London (which was not part of the Guardian sample), and chair of the mental wellbeing in higher education working group, said there had been a 22% increase in demand for counselling at her university last year alone, with young men coming forward in greater numbers \u2013 42.5% of Brunel students seeking counselling were male in 2015-16.</p> <p>\u201cNow that students are paying higher fees and are coming away with quite a lot of debt, there\u2019s a lot more concern about getting a job and paying that debt off. They come in with the anxiety that they need to get a good degree,\u201d Caleb said. \u201cIf the first few assignments don\u2019t go brilliantly, it\u2019s far more of a concern to them than it used to be.</p> <p>\u201cThe other issue is the enormous growth in international students and widening participation students. It\u2019s much harder to be a student if you are the first in your family or community to go to university.\u201d</p> <p>International students are often reluctant to join in social activities because they feel they should work all the time. Caleb cited \u201cstudents who are coming from sometimes unstable societies \u2013 Syrian students Skyping their families and hearing the guns going off behind the Skype picture\u201d.</p> <p>She said it was good that more young people felt able to come forward and ask for help, but resources for counselling services had not always grown sufficiently, and in some cases had reduced in spite of the growth in demand. A report on Thursday by the Higher Education Policy Institute said that a number of universities needed to triple their spending on mental health support to meet demand.</p> <p>Some universities are prioritising mental healthcare. The University of York announced on Thursday it was investing \u00a3500,000 in mental healthcare provision across its campus after a six-month review, prompted by an increasing demand for services from students and disruptions to mental health provision in the city. </p> <p>The university is planning to expand its in-house counselling service, employing two new members of staff to ensure those who need urgent appointments can be seen quickly. The vice-chancellor, Prof Koen Lamberts, said: \u201cAs the number of students considering higher education grows, we must work hard to encourage openness between staff and students to talk about these issues in a supportive environment.\u201d</p> <p>The Nightline Association, which offers counselling services to roughly 18,000 students a year through its 39 branches, said that in the last year alone calls rose by 78% in Leicester, 46% in Sheffield, 40% in Durham and 35% in Leeds.</p> <p>Katie Nicoll Baines, a volunteer at Nightline, said: \u201cThe rise is perhaps because people are becoming willing to use our services, and perhaps they just need them more because university is becoming such a competitive and trying environment for a lot of young people.\u201d<br></p> <p>Alan Percy, who is head of counselling at Oxford University and on the executive of the Heads of University Counselling Services, warned against \u201ccatastrophising\u201d student mental health. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of these things are normal emotional responses to life challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of students are feeling overwhelmed by life and the pressures of life in terms of having to be perfect. A lot of them feel they\u2019ve got to get everything right.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not universities that are causing this. It\u2019s a wider social problem.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You know that you\u2019re going to come out with around \u00a350,000 of debt.

The committee of the Mental Health Matters Society are not in the least surprised by the statistics showing university counselling services around the country are under huge pressure.</p> <p>They all say they love their university, describe it as \u201cwelcoming\u201d and are sure it\u2019s better than most at providing services, but have joined the society, set up a decade ago, to be part of a student support network and to campaign for more awareness and funding for mental health.<br></p> <p>Joseph Bonnett, a final-year geography student and the society\u2019s men\u2019s health representative says he found help by talking about his problems with friends and with the society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fff19438deb7fc6b48a72bfcccbd461eaa67be86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fff19438deb7fc6b48a72bfcccbd461eaa67be86/0_246_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Bonnett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Bonnett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says that although such societies cannot provide treatment or counselling, they offer a support network outside the official structures for those suffering from mental health problems.</p> <p>With \u00a39,000-a-year tuition fees and a tough graduate jobs market, the group agree that modern student life involves more pressure.

I don\u2019t think social media helps with that.\u201d</p> <p>The group acknowledges that the growing burden put on university mental health services is also partly the result of a greater willingness to talk about issues. \u201c[Society] is becoming more open, but if we can\u2019t provide support for the people who now feel that they can speak up about [mental ill health], that\u2019s a really difficult position to be in,\u201d says Megan Myer, who is doing a master\u2019s in English literature.</p> <p>Myer argues that universities should be prioritising funding for mental health services above all else. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have the infrastructure and the resources, but if you as a person don\u2019t have the resources to get through university then there\u2019s no point having the big expensive buildings,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople should be the priority.\u201d</p> <p>Louise Knowles, the head of the University Counselling Service, says the wellbeing of students and staff is paramount and that the service works hard to ensure its \u201cfree, confidential service is one our students have confidence in\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is our work in this area that helped us become the first university counselling service \u2013 and one of only seven organisations nationally \u2013 to be awarded a new quality assurance accreditation badge through the Accreditation Programme for Psychological Therapy Services last year,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cOur accreditation recognises both the extremely short wait times \u2013 which have almost halved since 2011-12 \u2013 as well as our talented and clinically robust team who offer a varied range of treatments and interventions in a challenging environment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to continually improving the quality and standard of the service we deliver, balancing this against increasing numbers accessing our service and looking at new and innovative ways of working with students.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Additional reporting by Pamela Duncan and Sophia Schirmer.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>In a rare show of international unity, more than 30 countries this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/paris-climate-agreement-poised-to-come-into-force\">declared their plans</a> to translate into national laws the Paris agreement on climate change.</p> <p>As a result, by the end of this year, or soon after, the accord should come into effect and become binding under international law.</p> <p>This is a major step. It will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\">first time since 1992</a> that a global agreement on climate change has been internationally accepted (the Kyoto protocol, signed by the White House in 1997, was famously stymied by the refusal of the US Congress to ratify it), and the first time in history that rich and poor countries have faced the same obligations to tackle global warming.</p> <p>Ratification may seem a small step, given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">the agreement was passed by every one of the 195 United Nations member states last December</a>. But it is important because it gives full legal standing to the document. That makes it harder for any government to row back on the Paris commitments.</p> <p>The most obvious potentially recalcitrant nation is the US, the world\u2019s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">presidential contender Donald Trump has vowed to unpick the agreement if elected this November</a>. But other countries are also in danger of reneging. Russia was always a reluctant member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/climate-change-paris-deal-cop21-obama-administration-congress-republicans-environment\">Nicaragua showed signs of trying to stop the agreement while the ink was still wet</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/12/what-does-paris-climate-agreement-mean-for-australia\">Australia\u2019s volatile politics on climate change could yet cause a U-turn on the part of its government.</a></p> <p>Paris will enter into force if 55 countries, and enough countries to account for 55% of global emissions, ratify its contents. The former target will be met if the nations that have publicly agreed to ratify now do so, and the latter will soon be met if the EU, as promised, takes on its responsibilities in a bloc-wide agreement, expected early next year.</p> <p>It is also important to recall the history of climate change treaties. The failure of the US to ratify, despite presidential approval, and Russia\u2019s plodding acceptance, meant that the 1997 Kyoto protocol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/feb/16/sciencenews.environment\">only became legal in 2005</a>. By then it was largely academic, as the world had moved on to begin negotiations on a new global settlement on climate change. The world had also moved on in terms of emissions, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/paris-climate-deal-where-us-and-china-have-led-others-must-quickly-follow\">China</a> was confirmed as the world\u2019s second biggest emitter \u2013 and is now the biggest.</p> <p>Kyoto placed quantified commitments on all developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Paris does not. Although nearly all of the world\u2019s countries \u2013 including the biggest emitters, developed and developing \u2013 <a href=\"http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/indc/Submission%20Pages/submissions.aspx\">submitted plans before the Paris conference to cut or curb their emissions</a>, those plans are not legally binding and will not be even when the accord enters into force. </p> <p>The only legally binding commitment is to limit global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an additional \u201caspiration\u201d to take even more drastic action to limit warming to 1.5C, which if adhered to could save the world\u2019s low-lying islands from inundation.</p> <p>Quantified emissions curbs up to 2020 \u2013 not legally binding but set out publicly \u2013 were also agreed in 2009, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/copenhagen\">much-derided Copenhagen conference on climate change</a>, and those commitments still stand. </p> <p>More importantly, the geopolitical landscape has been transformed in the 20-plus years in which the world has been discussing a global response to climate change. China, which carried no obligations under Kyoto, is now the world\u2019s biggest emitter and soon to be the biggest economy. Developing nations are also now the biggest sources of the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, outpacing the richer countries responsible for \u201chistoric\u201d emissions before the 1990s.</p> <p>What should we take from the Paris pact? First, recognise the limitations of what can be considered legally binding under international law. While nations were willing to agree to limit global warming, they were not willing to take on binding targets on reducing emissions, of the kind that were stipulated at Kyoto. It is now clear, after more than 20 years of international negotiations, and a changing pattern of which nations contribute most to the stock of carbon dioxide that is warming the planet, that even supposedly binding agreements do not guarantee reductions in emissions.</p> <p>That depends on countries delivering on their pledges to curb carbon production, which in turn depends on their internal politics. No international treaty, legally binding or not, can force countries to limit emissions if they are not willing to do so.</p> <p>So, although the Paris agreement is an important step, it will not be enough to guarantee that warming will not exceed scientific advice. Following through on the goal of limiting climate change will require much more: a reversal of the current reliance on fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon forms of energy production; businesses to alter their practices so that their activities produce less carbon; individuals to alter their behaviour; and finding ways to cope with a growing population of people who, rightly, wish to enjoy the fruits of modern prosperity without destroying the aspirations of their children to do the same.</p> <p>The Paris agreement acknowledged that climate change is a global problem that will require concerted global action. It is not, in itself, a solution to that problem. But it provides a way forward that can be built into a solution. If we want it.</p>",

If the authorities opt to grant the pardon, they convey the decision with an orange handkerchief. It all brings a level of clarity to proceedings that groans and social media rants do not, and the choice of hankies as the medium acknowledges the heavy emotions at play.</p> <p>It is not what you would call a damnable oversight but if Manchester United had developed a colour-coded handkerchief system at any point in the club\u2019s 138-year history, then fans at Old Trafford would now have an easy way to indicate what they think should be done with Rooney: green, say, for \u2018let him play his way back into form\u2019, white for \u2018take him out of the firing line for a while\u2019, pink for \u2018try a new position\u2019 and brown for \u2018get rid\u2019.</p> <p>In the absence of such a system, there is only fidgeting and murmurs of disquiet when the team is announced and the club\u2019s second highest all-time scorer is included again. Booing is not nuanced enough to be deployed at this stage. Social media is a chicken\u2019s mess. And anyone who suggests trailing a banner from an airplane needs to be answered with an emphatic hand gesture.</p> <p>Most United fans, then, are left hoping that Rooney will somehow reverse what seems like a terminal decline, or that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will demonstrate ruthlessness so they do not have to. Most people do not want to be seen rounding bluntly on a club icon, even if he once threatened to defect to rivals.</p> <p>Stoke fans have it even harder. It is one thing that Mark Hughes, the only manager to guide the club to three successive top-half finishes in the top division and the introducer of a charming style of play, now seems to be floundering. But managers seem less sacred, as Arsenal fans proved at Stoke two years ago when they harassed Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at the local train station following a defeat to Hughes\u2019s team \u2013 way before any \u201cThanks for the memories but it\u2019s time to stay goodbye\u201d banners appeared in the Emirates. Turning against cherished players, on the other hand, feels more craven. Which is why there is an aching sadness to Stoke\u2019s position at the bottom of the Premier League.</p> <p>The club\u2019s supporters take largely silent discomfort in noting that woeful performances are partially due to the dwindling of Jonathan Walters, Glenn Whelan and even Ryan Shawcross. Shawcross, for so long a formidable centre\u2011back who personified Stoke\u2019s refusal to bow to supposed superiors, has not been his indomitable self since being afflicted by back trouble last year. He is only 28 so recovery is not out of the question but, at present, he seems diminished, unable to bring order to a Stoke defence that Tony Pulis will not recognise when he returns to his old stomping ground with West Bromwich Albion this weekend .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86bbff9bfcfd2fb32245d5da7c4729dad496c755\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86bbff9bfcfd2fb32245d5da7c4729dad496c755/0_110_3369_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stoke City\u2019s Jonathan Walters and Ryan Shawcross leave the pitch after an early-season defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stoke City\u2019s Jonathan Walters and Ryan Shawcross leave the pitch after an early-season defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prospects of recovery look slimmer for Whelan, 32, and, most disturbingly of all, Walters, 33. These are players whose characters and play have helped define the club in their Premier League years \u2013 their dynamism, selflessness and frill-free quality has fuelled many a triumph over adversity. It feels wrong to call for them to be dropped but Stoke fans discreetly admit that their inability to galumph around the pitch as effectively as before is one of the reasons for the team\u2019s recent vulnerability.</p> <p>A vexing complication is the fact no younger player has yet emerged to allow Whelan, Walters and Shawcross to be used more sparingly. One reason for that is injuries, another is inadequate investment, another is unfulfilled potential. Giannelli Imbula, signed for \u00a318m in January, has been too inconsistent to displace Whelan. When Xherdan Shaqiri was injured Hughes gave little action to Ramadan Sobhi, the teenage Egyptian signed in the summer with a view to easing any reliance on Walters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-master\">Manchester United\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: no longer the bright young iconoclast | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps Whelan and Walters \u2013 and Rooney \u2013 are to an extent victims of the fact that their managers can at least count on them to work tirelessly even when in need of rest.</p> <p>Walters has been written off before, towards the end of Pulis\u2019s reign, and came back strongly, endearing himself even further to Stoke fans, who are particularly reluctant to vent against ageing wingers, what with there being a statue outside their ground of Sir Stanley Matthews, who played for them until just after his 50th birthday and later declared: \u201cIt was a mistake to pack it in, I could have gone on for another two years.\u201d</p> <p>If sheer gumption were enough for a player to play until his 50s, then Walters would be a good bet to make it.

Their vision needs to meet the concerns and anxieties of Brexit-voting northern post-industrial towns without losing the internationalist outlook of the centre-left remain voters.</p> <p>This is challenging, but far from impossible given the deep ideological divide that runs through the Brexit constituency itself. To undermine the fear and hatred, we need a message of hope, of security and of solidarity. And we need to get real about the best tactics to achieve this. At Global Justice we have set out a <a href=\"http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/brexit-red-lines\" title=\"\">series of red lines</a> that would from the basis of a progressive vision of leaving the EU.</p> <p>First, progressive parties need to admit that the conversion of social democracy to free market economics in the 1990s was a political disaster that fed Brexit. In an article this week, Stephen Kinnock MP declares that the problem for centre-left values is that they\u2019ve been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/cure-divided-britain-managed-immigration-work-permits\" title=\"\">too lax on immigration</a>. This gets everything upside down \u2013 the problem is the privatisations, the corporate-backed trade deals, the competition over low tax rates that was remorselessly pushed here and abroad, and which left working-class communities hollowed out, and individuals abandoned to the mercy of the market.</p> <p>So we urgently need to create hope by proving another sort of economy is possible. Here, the public is to the left of most centre-left politicians. While politicians have largely supported a new corporate trade offensive, including US-EU trade deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\" title=\"\">TTIP</a>, the public has opposed it. It\u2019s time for the British opposition to unequivocally oppose TTIP\u2019s sister agreements, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/30/ttip-trade-deal-agreements-ceta-eu-canada\" title=\"\">Ceta</a>, the Canada-EU deal due to be ratified this winter, and Tisa, a super-privatisation trade deal that would lock in privatisation and liberalisation of services from finance to transportation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s put something progressive in their place: economic relationships based on building up public services fit for the 21st century, on long-term investment, on sharing skills and technologies, on prioritising the realisation of low-carbon, better educated and skilled jobs, with sustainable demand driven by well-being not debt.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s security. Our economy breeds precarious jobs, breaks community bonds and runs down public services. The resulting fear and individualism turns people against one another \u2013 and against those who are \u201cdifferent\u201d most of all. Regulation, where it challenges unfettered market power, is an antidote to this insecurity.</p> <p>Anti-corporate regulation would be welcomed by many families, consumers, workers, minorities. Or small-scale farmers, who should be protected from the end of the Common Agricultural Policy by a fairer subsidy system. But progressive parties must battle to reclaim the language around regulation \u2013 as we have on tax \u2013 so that is not a symbol of \u201cunfreedom\u201d but a democratic means of social, and environmental, protection.</p> <p>Here, progressive politicians will come across as rational, and undogmatic next to trade secretary Liam Fox, who told parliament last week that he wants a \u201clow-tax and low-regulation\u201d economy. Or next to Theresa May, who continues to threaten to exit the European Convention on Human Rights, something that would leave us in a category with Belarus. Or next to Andrea Leadsom, said to believe in replacing agricultural support with an \u201cinsurance\u201d system that makes farmers more dependent on financial markets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/cure-divided-britain-managed-immigration-work-permits\">My cure for a divided Britain? A programme of managed immigration | Stephen Kinnock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the internationalism, most prized by many progressive remain voters, that is the toughest nut to crack, but if communicated as part of a single agenda with hope and security, we can win people back. And we need to do this because ditching freedom of movement will not preserve domestic harmony and an international outlook. It would, rather, fuel demands for a harsher migration system, a further clampdown on refugees, an increase in racism, and increase in Ukip\u2019s vote.</p> <p>In theory, free movement can be the most progressive aspect of our economy, treating people, wherever they\u2019re from, as human beings with equal worth. It allows people an escape from poverty, unemployment and governments they don\u2019t like. The EU\u2019s treatment of migrants is an international disgrace. But the solution is to gradually extend that freedom \u2013 not stop it altogether.</p> <p>So rather than ditch free movement of people to preserve the free movement of capital, as the mainstream remain campaign is now doing, we must do the opposite. Big business must be controlled and regulated. And the poorest should not pay the price for these principles. Perhaps, rather like universities, migrants come to an area accompanied by investment, meaning the appearance of migrants means all lives getting better.</p> <p>How to achieve this? Time is not on our side, and we need to be realistic; the best and perhaps only way to prevent an immediate rewriting of our constitution on the worst terms possible is joining the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain\" title=\"\">European Economic Area (EEA)</a>. There are as many problems with the EEA as there are with the EU, and one additional one, which is that we don\u2019t even get a seat at the negotiating table. But the alternative is a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, which would give the current government a free hand to abolish our protections, introduce immigration controls, and embed the \u201cmarket knows best\u201d mantra into every aspect of our lives.</p> <p>The political tide is currently flowing against the EEA, and only a concerted and unified campaign by progressive politicians will reverse this. The window is closing on this tactically vital act of damage limitation.</p> <p>If progressive forces fail to create a vision that resonates with significant portions of leave and remain voters, the future is very bleak indeed \u2013 a free-trade, low-tax, low-regulation economy, with opposition coming not from the left, but from an increasingly insular economic nationalism fuelled by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/27/arron-banks-the-millionaire-hoping-to-bankroll-uk-into-brexit\" title=\"\">Arron Banks</a>.

The music began in the early 2000s and was the local sound of east London. Often misinterpreted as hip-hop, grime owes more to garage, jungle and reggae. MCs form part of crews and speak in slang, often freestyling on the spot. When they perform live, the crowd\u2019s reception determines if they get a wheel up (replay of the track from the beginning). In its early days grime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/27/jungle-garage-and-grime-20-years-of-rinse-fm\" title=\"\">relied heavily on pirate radio stations such as Rinse</a> where artists could say as they pleased with no filter.</p> <p>Dizzee Rascal\u2019s legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jul/18/popandrock.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Boy in da Corner</a> won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/sep/10/arts.mercuryprize2003\" title=\"\">Mercury prize in 2003</a> and is hailed as the album that took grime mainstream.

Humanitarians know that. The families and friends that we leave behind know that.

There is no safety when attacks are met with silence. When a colleague and I were in South Sudan last November, we heard of several recent violent attacks against aid workers. Despite clear confirmation of the incidents, none were reported or condemned publicly by the political leadership. The incidents became security anecdotes \u2013 devoid of humanity, dismissed as rumour. Impunity for prior attacks, the weakness of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan as a protection force, the negative local public campaign against NGOs, and the relentless intimidation of humanitarians were not the only factors, but all contributed in their own way to the Terrain incident.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70f503852730d0fc45a2802e67651bb6e6510608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f503852730d0fc45a2802e67651bb6e6510608/0_308_5068_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aid is seen strewn across the floor the morning after a convoy delivering aid was hit by a deadly air strike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aid is seen strewn across the floor the morning after a convoy delivering aid to Aleppo was hit by a deadly air strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During my last trip to the border of Syria in May this year, my colleagues and I met with NGOs carrying out cross-border programmes.

  "<p>Hardly a day passes without an announcement by one newspaper publisher or another that jobs must go, titles must be merged and offices must be closed.<br></p> <p>Cutbacks have been the reality of the news trade in Britain for the best part of 20 years at national, regional and local level. And the same story has been unfolding in the USA, Canada, Australia and most European countries.</p> <p>The cause, as we all know, is the onward march of the digital revolution. We who praise its advance cannot also help but lament its disruption. </p> <p>Everyone involved in the business registers concern because its fate is so uncertain. We need to disaggregate the \u201ceveryone\u201d because publishers and journalists are seeking very different outcomes. Nor should we regard all publishers as a single entity. </p> <p>Publishers seeking only profit - such as the chains that control the bulk of the UK\u2019s regional papers - are different from those whose newspaper ownership is about prestige and political clout (and propaganda). </p> <p>And they are different again from the owner of the Guardian/Observer, the Scott Trust, which exists specifically to safeguard the papers\u2019 journalistic freedom and liberal values \u201cfree from commercial or political interference.\u201d<br></p> <p>But no publisher, despite differing motivations, can escape the commercial effects of a technological revolution that is in the process of destroying the funding mechanism that has underpinned newspaper companies for more than 150 years.</p> <p>Journalists are aware of this but tend to turn a blind eye to reality. They blame publishers for the cutbacks, or at least, the way those cutbacks are carried out. I know, because I have done so plenty of times in the past, belabouring, say, Trinity Mirror or Newsquest or the Telegraph Media Group for the imposition of cuts.</p> <p>Some have been more ruthless or cack-handed than others. Nor have journalists been too happy about executives enjoying handsome rewards for implementing redundancy programmes, a constant refrain by the National Union of Journalists.</p> <p>It is irritating, probably intensely annoying, for those required to walk the plank. It does not, however, change matters. Whether chief executives are unpopular or over-paid or even incompetent is largely irrelevant. All are in the same boat and their task is clear: to ensure the survival of \u201cthe product\u201d for as long as possible.</p> <p>They must do so whether they work for public companies, where the appetites of investors must be satisfied, or private companies, where owners seek to make profits or, at worst, keep losses to a minimum.</p> <p>Although journalists, even those without a smattering of economic knowledge, know this to be the case, they find it difficult to be dispassionate about it, not least because they are in the firing line.</p> <p>Leaving aside the grumbles of veteran hacks who have never come to terms with the post-Fleet Street era, journalists who have enthusiastically grasped the advances offered by digital transmission have also begun to be hugely critical of their employers.</p> <p>They have registered their anger about job insecurity, falling wages (including much reduced payments to freelance contributors) and sometimes poor working conditions, such as the pressure to work longer hours, to move house to keep their jobs or to travel further to reach their offices. </p> <p>They also complain about apparent changes of direction by their managers who are struggling to cope with the fast-moving digital environment. <br></p> <p>Then again, those of us who have been around for a long time know that journalists have a long history of bellyaching. It goes with the territory. We always know better than those above us. </p> <p>Nor are journalists really appreciative of the fact that the audiences for our journalism are far greater than we enjoyed in the pre-internet era. They dismiss the figures as the result of clickbait, and in some instances, but not all, they may be correct: maximising eyeballs is helpful in attracting advertisers (just as it was, and is, with newsprint sales).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the overarching concern of all journalists is the gradual reduction in their overall numbers and the retreat from face-to-face, eye-witness reporting. At the international level, foreign postings have all but vanished. Nationally, regional offices have been closed. As for the headquarters\u2019 staffs, they spend decreasing amounts of time on the road.</p> <p>Similarly, fewer and fewer reporters on regional and local papers are allowed leave their offices. Conceding that much more can be accomplished on computers than was ever the case in shoe-leather days of yore (we now take online data journalism for granted, for instance), it remains the case that journalism is undergoing severe retrenchment.</p> <p>Doubtless, many of the essays in a forthcoming book with an somewhat optimistic title, Is print dying... and how to avoid it,* will detail what is largely regarded as \u201ca crisis\u201d. </p> <p>If the authors (including me) are honest they will point to the distinction between the crisis facing publishers and the one facing journalists. In other words, they must differentiate between journalism as a business and journalism as a public service.</p> <p>This is the reasoning behind my earlier statement about publishers and journalists seeking different outcomes and it is the crucial split between the two.</p> <p>The crisis we journalists face at the hands of publishers is the destruction of our trade and therefore the annihilation of a public service. This is not to criticise publishers, which is why I spent some time explaining the pressures they face and the way they are tackling them. It is simply to rationalise what is happening.</p> <p>Here, in a nutshell, is the reality. Journalists cost money. So the last thing newspaper publishers want nowadays are journalists. </p> <p>By which I mean reporters, on-the-road reporters who spend time and effort to seek out stories. They are too expensive and, viewed in strictly economic terms, unproductive. </p> <p>They can spend many days, sometimes weeks and even months, on their research. And what do most of them have to show for it at the end?</p> <p>Even if they land a story that provokes a political row, say, or brings down a high-ranking official, it is highly unlikely to attract new buyers.</p> <p>It might well add lustre to the newspaper, enhancing its status for holding power to account. But seen from a purely commercial perspective, reporters just aren\u2019t worth it. And they, rather than desk-bound journalists, are the ones being laid off. </p> <p>With them go skills and experience. With them go untold stories. With them goes the most potent and useful way of serving the public.</p> <p>Publishers need to recognise the direction of travel. The public and the politicians who represent them need to campaign for the retention of reporters. </p> <p>And the funding, you ask? As I have written before, and more than once, we need to find an accommodation with the hugely profitable and powerful new media organisations that benefit from the journalism they recommend. </p> <p>In fairness, publishers know that. As one senior News UK executive put it in an email to me a couple of days ago, \u201cthe republishing platforms reap financial rewards by distributing our content.\u201d </p> <p>But what happens when there is no-one to supply that content? In recognising the crisis, publishers and journalists must work together to find a solution.</p> <p><em>*Co-editors: Ray Snoddy, Richard Tait, Neil Fowler and John Mair, due to be published in February 2017.

  "<p>If I ate only animals I killed myself, I would live on a rather uninspiring diet of clothes moths and the occasional mosquito. But then I haven\u2019t learned to stalk and shoot and fish, unlike Louise Gray, an environmental reporter who followed the example of Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/may/27/mark-zuckerberg-kill-animals-meat\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and decided to eat only what she had personally murdered for a year.</p> <p>In her very likable and often eye-opening book, Gray, \u201ca farmer\u2019s daughter\u201d, spends a surprising amount of time describing visits to various abattoirs, in order to depict exactly what happens when you don\u2019t kill your own food. Dressing for her first visit, she reports wryly, \u201cI wore a new blouse from Topshop with startled fawns on it.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that even the highest humane standards in such places do not exactly make them pleasant environments, and Gray evokes them with a calm precision. \u201cYou always go backwards in an abattoir, from the packing plant, to the boning hall, to the killing hall, to the lairage. It is to avoid contamination.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the slaughterhouse, author and reader can both breathe more easily as she meets someone who is into collecting and cooking roadkill, and Gray herself kills a variety of wildlife, including a lobster, various fish and game birds, some rabbits, a sheep, a pig and a deer. It is bloody work, carefully described. And what Gray then makes of them in the kitchen does sound mouthwatering.</p> <p>As usual when people talk at any length about food, however, a fair amount of rhetorical bad faith is also going on here. Everyone, including the author, is keen to assert their tremendous \u201crespect\u201d for an animal once it is dead, even though this respect mysteriously didn\u2019t stretch as far as deciding not to kill it when it was still alive. Killing your own animals, Gray says, is \u201cbeyond intimate. It is primal.\u201d Well, yes: so is caving another human being\u2019s skull in with a rock, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should all go around doing it. Most wince-inducing, Gray writes repeatedly of her \u201cgratitude\u201d to birds or mammals she has just slaughtered by firearm or knife (without stunning them first, as abattoirs do) \u2013 as though the beasts had generously volunteered to lay down their lives in order to grace her dinner plate.</p> <p>Luckily the book has charm and style as well. \u201cVegan cheese destroys the soul,\u201d Gray asserts quite persuasively at one point; while after a shooting party she reports, with an interesting mixture of emotions: \u201cMy hands smell of expensive soap and gunpowder.\u201d The accounts of hunting trips with her father contain some vivid and quite moving nature writing and she makes some good points about the blandness of industrialised meat. Scoffing her own pig, she reports: \u201cIt tastes of pig, it smells of pig, it is a pig \u2026 I feel like we have been tricked into eating more pork than we need to in modern life by making it taste like nothing.\u201d If you want a book that wallows in its own sentimentality, moral superiority and superficiality of thinking, you\u2019d better read Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s <em>Eating Animals </em>instead. (But really, don\u2019t bother.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/18/ethical-carnivore-how-to-be-a-guilt-free-meat-eater\">The Ethical Carnivore: 'I no longer feel we should all visit a slaughterhouse'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI realise I have a message,\u201d Gray announces at the end of the book. \u201cIt is this: you don\u2019t have to kill animals yourself, but you should go to the effort to find out where they come from.\u201d Fair enough. Doing so, she believes, will \u201cnaturally encourage\u201d us to eat less meat. So what do you call this sort of diet? The word \u201cflexitarian\u201d sounds to me like a commitment to eat only animals that practised yoga while alive. Gray just calls it \u201cthe human way to eat\u201d, but this does unfortunately imply that the great unwashed masses who like to scoff a dodgily sourced kebab after midnight are somehow less than human.</p> <p>She ends hopefully with the conviction that we are going into a reduced-meat future, but the problem she doesn\u2019t address is what philosophers call moral incontinence: the fact that, as flawed human beings, we can know what\u2019s right without actually doing it. Gray offers many strong ethical and ecological arguments for eating less meat, and then wonders why people still eat such a lot of it, even though the \u201cfacts and figures are all there\u201d. But a person can be intellectually convinced of facts and figures and still gobble steak or pork in the evening. To change this phenomenon globally is probably going to require more than a few friendly chats with one\u2019s Islington butcher.

This means the softer \u2018mom-and-pop shops\u2019 have disappeared, and it\u2019s only the ones who are most willing to take risks and manipulate Christianites who have stayed.\u201d </p> <p>Recent figures from the Copenhagen police estimate that between <a href=\"https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/politi-svaert-komme-hashhandel-paa-christiania-til-livs\">up to 1bn</a> kroner (\u00a3115m) changes hands each year in Pusher Street.</p> <p>\u201cToday you have pre-rolled joints, different types of hash,\u201d says Manghezi. \u201cIt\u2019s all very systemised and there is a lot of money going through there.\u201d</p> <p>In this otherwise semi-autonomous and socially minded community, a capitalist-style \u201cdrugs supermarket\u201d had developed, and was spinning out of control \u2013 culminating in the recent shootout. \u201cThis was something most of us knew could happen,\u201d Manghezi says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time somebody\u2019s been shot in Christiania. But I\u2019ve always thought that the day a police officer gets shot, that\u2019s the day things will get really bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab498cd6bd40aed620e04e8a955ecc15412a67cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab498cd6bd40aed620e04e8a955ecc15412a67cc/0_74_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Christiania resident demolishes a cannabis stall following the shooting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christiania resident demolishes a cannabis stall following last month\u2019s shooting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scanpix Denmark/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the next evening, roughly 400 of Christiania\u2019s 700 adult residents gathered in the community\u2019s meeting space. The democratic process in Christiania is based on a <a href=\"http://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus\">consensus mechanism</a>, and cannabis sellers are often present at community meetings: to have a hash stall in Christiania, you must be a resident. </p> <p>Some gangs, however, have manipulated locals into acting as a front for their trade. Their presence at meetings, Manghezi laments, makes it difficult to build momentum to change the way Pusher Street is run. But this time it was clear something drastic would happen: by the end of the meeting, residents had decided to <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/christianas-marijuana-selling-booths-are-torn-down-after-shooting-1579398\">demolish all stalls in the \u201ccannabis supermarket\u201d</a> and reclaim the area from outside dealers.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole vibe around Pusher Street has really sucked a lot of the energy out of Christiania. This has been a wakeup call for what we have here,\u201d says Manghezi. \u201cPolice confrontation around Pusher Street has halted a lot of the great things that could go on. I hope that what we\u2019ve done will now release some new energy so we can focus on the cool things happening.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05245b137d6f4667434659a2e2f0b9732e0a6f3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05245b137d6f4667434659a2e2f0b9732e0a6f3c/428_274_1970_2462/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ole Lykke.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ole Lykke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athlyn Cathcart-Keays</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the stalls were destroyed, the atmosphere is noticeably different: pop-up community meals have taken place, and there is talk of plans for a fountain. There have always been a lot of positive lessons to learn from this alternative urban enclave. The community continuously experiments with green building techniques, stormwater management, solar energy and water-treatment systems to reduce their ecological footprint. Christiania\u2019s creativity and experimentation has always existed, but the presence of Pusher Street has dominated the focus. \u201cIt has made people sort of not talk about the social experiment,\u201d says Manghezi. \u201cIt\u2019s given the general feeling that things we do here are illegal \u2013 they really aren\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>This freedom to experiment is at the core of Christiania\u2019s principles. When resident and archivist Ole Lykke first moved to the freetown in 1979, he says, \u201cyou\u2019d have a good idea, you\u2019d go ahead with it, and if somebody complained, you\u2019d deal with it. If not, then you\u2019d just go ahead.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/28/christiania-copenhagen-squat-last-stand\">in 2011</a>, their principles were threatened when the Danish government insisted that Christiania either purchase the land or be bought out. Because of Christianites\u2019 rejection of property rights, the prospect of ownership was unappealing. So they set up a foundation to buy the land. Many supporters of the commune jumped at the chance to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrrHWLSsmIc\">buy a little share of freedom</a>\u201d, more than 12.5m kroner was raised, a mortgage was secured and Christiania <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://cphpost.dk/news/local-news/christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html\">was saved</a>. </p> <p>The mortgage payments rise every year, but this \u201crent\u201d is immensely cheaper than the rest of central Copenhagen \u2013 giving Christiania \u201cthe perfect elements for gentrification\u201d, says Manghezi. Autonomous or not, Christiania faces the same challenges as many inner-city neighbourhoods when it comes to the pressures of market forces.</p> <p>Just across the water, in an area known as Papir\u00f8en (Paper Island), a former paper factory is being colonised by a food market, a gallery and design offices, preparing the area for transformation <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2016/02/copenhagen-paper-island-waterfront-redevelopment-creative-business-copenhagenize/463137/\">into a luxury development</a>.

Almost 100% of local people surveyed said they thought the road was safer than it had been before.</p> <p>Jasper Vet, one of the founders of Safe Crossing, says the results should send a loud message to governments, banks and development funders that small investments in basic road safety measures could save hundreds of lives every year.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that all these people are dying pointlessly, that families are being destroyed by losing loved ones or having to deal with disabilities or serious injuries because we\u2019re not taking action on this, is hard to accept when you look at the results of the N2 project,\u201d says Vet.</p> <p>Every year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/09/world-most-lethal-road-bangladesh\">hundreds of people die and thousands more are injured</a> on the N2 highway. Road fatalities and serious injuries spiked after the road was made into a high-speed highway with \u00a3169m of World Bank funding in 2005.<br></p> <p>According to Bangladeshi government figures from 2012, 180 people die on the N2 annually, although this figure is disputed by road safety experts, who believe it to be about four times higher. Thousands more are injured, often seriously. </p> <p>The carnage on the N2 is replicated across Bangladesh, where the World Health Organisation believes more than 21,000 people are killed each year on the roads, costing the country <a href=\"http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/en/\">1.6% of its GDP</a>.</p> <p>While the high accident rate is largely attributed to dangerous driving and unsafe vehicles, the absence of basic road safety infrastructure \u2013 including footbridges, speed bumps and partition barriers \u2013 on many of the country\u2019s fastest and recently renovated highways is a significant contributory factor. Road safety features were neither included in the loan package from the World Bank nor added on by the government.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we call vulnerable road users \u2013 by which we mean people on bicycles, passengers in rickshaws or buses, and the large number of people walking on the side of the road, often trying to get to work or to school \u2013 have had absolutely no protection at all from the dangerous vehicles driving at high-speed since the N2 was renovated,\u201d says Vet.</p> <p> \u201cThe problem is that there isn\u2019t enough accurate data on road fatalities and the link between high fatalities and a lack of road safety features, which means that even the most basic safety features are left out because they are considered too expensive or \u2018add-ons\u2019 to road development projects.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, Safe Crossings partnered with the Centre for Injury Prevention, Health Development and Research <a href=\"http://www.ciprb.org/\">(CIPRB)</a> in Bangladesh to launch road safety work on three of the most dangerous sections of the N2: the project cost \u20ac120,000 (\u00a3103,000). Through surveys conducted with people who use and live close to the N2, Safe Crossings identified a series of danger spots along the road where people were most likely to be killed or injured. The organisation developed a plan to make those sections of road safer, working with international and local road safety groups and local and national government agencies to build road safety structures on the renovated highway.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough funding to do a large-scale project, but that wasn\u2019t the point anyway,\u201d says Vet. \u201cWhat we were trying to do was show that building safe roads that don\u2019t put the lives of thousands of people at risk every year is actually pretty easy and cost-effective.\u201d</p> <p>Safe Crossings built rumble-strips to warn drivers they were entering a village and should reduce their speed, and speed bumps to ensure this happened. Pedestrian crossings were painted on to the road where people were most likely to cross. Bus bays were built at the side of the highways to end the practice of buses stopping on the road, thus reducing the amount of overtaking \u2013 known to be one of the biggest causes of fatalities and injuries. Strips of reflective paint on the side of roads near villages were used to give drivers the impression the roads were narrower than they really were, encouraging drivers to reduce their speed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fef13c11db38afc8aab705529aec6c3b8f23c86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fef13c11db38afc8aab705529aec6c3b8f23c86/19_353_3832_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People try to cross a busy road in Dhaka, Bangladesh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lack of basic road safety infrastructure such as footbridges and speed bumps contributes to Bangladesh\u2019s high accident rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Majority World/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, staff from the CIPRB began visiting villages and communities along the N2. \u201cThis project is different from all the road safety work we have done before because we worked very actively with local communities [affected by the N2],\u201d says Dr Md Mazharul Hoque, from the CIPRB.</p> <p> \u201cIn each village, we have helped set up a road safety committee and we combined infrastructure work with safety and awareness campaigns for those using the road, and with local schools. Without community involvement and people being aware of the dangers of the road, engineering interventions won\u2019t be as effective. The immediate visibility of local support was also really important in helping local authorities understand the need to invest in road safety in these rural highways.\u201d</p> <p>Safe Crossings and the CIPRB are hoping the results of the pilot will encourage the Bangladeshi government to roll out similar initiatives on a national scale. </p>",

We had jumped off the bus from Saltburn and started our quest, as instructed, by dipping our hands reverently in the waters of St Hilda\u2019s Holy Well beside her church in Hinderwell, just past Staithes. However, we were not to reach our second sacred site \u2013 St Hilda\u2019s near Danby, and all of 10 miles away \u2013 until the next morning. By then we had put behind us the austere beauty of the wild and apparently limitless moors, whose glimpses of civilisation amounted to woebegone sheep and the occasional stone wall, and began shadowing the river Esk. Here the scenery took on a more domesticated feel: we looked across the valley to brave little farmhouses and often found our way flanked by the yellow explosions of daffodils. Since the route also includes a wonderful descent into Whitby, affording cracking views of the town and the sea beyond, it\u2019s doubtless only the small-scale nature of the guidebook\u2019s publisher that has kept the pilgrimage from registering on the radar of Britain\u2019s walkers thus far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9891d85c376a27e4b5d31f8f2a889a3e75db0d61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9891d85c376a27e4b5d31f8f2a889a3e75db0d61/392_0_2951_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White and woodem-pew interior St Hedda\u2019s church, Egton Bridge, North Yorkshire, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Hedda\u2019s, Egton Bridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At <a href=\"http://middlesbrough-diocese.org.uk/parishes/st-hedda-egton-bridge/\">St Hedda\u2019s, at Egton Bridge</a>, we marvelled at the extraordinary relics of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Postgate\">Nicholas Postgate</a>, an 82-year-old local priest who was hung, drawn and quartered in 1679 for being a little too Catholic.

Irregular monsoons can also cause delays to the season, and increased incidences of windy storms muddies the salt pans, compromising product quality and price.</p> <p>By the time the farmers have paid for diesel to fuel their pumps, and services such as transport and fresh water to supply their makeshift villages on the edge of the salt flats, it can cost them up to $1.55 to produce each tonne of salt. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a98d0f40af390fb2fe06d8bcb600646c5bf19353\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98d0f40af390fb2fe06d8bcb600646c5bf19353/234_131_4601_2759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A salt worker is transported to her salt pan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A salt worker is transported to her salt pan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This means there\u2019s often little left of the money they receive from middlemen per tonne of salt - approximately $1.78. Middlemen sell on the salt for a market price of around $4.15 per tonne, despite little additional processing beyond some refining.</p> <p>But life for salt farmers is gradually changing. The Salt Workers Economic Empowerment Program (SWEEP), a joint initiative between the non-profit Global Fairness Initiative (GFI) and SEWA, is working to help female salt farmers in Gujarat gain the commercial and technical knowledge to farm salt more sustainably and profitably as the risk of erratic, extreme weather looms.</p> <p>Founded in 2012, the programme currently supports 2,500 farmers. It provides technical training to improve farming techniques and salt quality, covering aspects such as drilling boreholes, improving salt pan layout and managing pumps more efficiently.</p> <p>SWEEP also helps farmers collaborate to engage directly with more reliable buyers, such as the Indian government, to secure a better price for their salt. In this way, the women can achieve an average 64% increase in price (to $2.78 per tonne), according to Caleb Shreve, GFI\u2019s executive director.</p> <p>However, to truly improve the farmers\u2019 livelihoods, Shreve says, it is vital to cut input costs. With this in mind, SWEEP has been helping farmers replace their diesel pumps with solar-powered ones over the past two years to lower the cost of production. Although solar pumps have a high upfront cost of $3,750, the women save an average of 45% on running costs annually compared to diesel pumps by reducing maintenance and fuel costs, according to Shreve.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93310e607916a245450e39950b59c1799fa0f2e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93310e607916a245450e39950b59c1799fa0f2e8/0_0_4789_2873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A solar-powered pump in Surendranagar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surendranagar\u2019s salt farmers are offered loans to help them purchase solar-powered pumps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some 500 farmers have invested in the new pumps to date, taking a 90% loan from SEWA.

Its third plan is expected to be resolved next week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/oil-disaster-investigator-alarmed-by-bp-great-australian-bight-response\">Oil disaster investigator alarmed by BP Great Australian Bight response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hopkins compared the limited information BP had made available about its plans to drill in the Bight with what would be required to drill in other regions, and with practices committed to in other regions.</p> <p> In Hopkins view BP\u2019s plans probably would not be acceptable if it was planning to drill for oil in the Arctic.</p> <p>If BP\u2019s well in the Bight blew out, as the one in the Gulf of Mexico did, the company would first try to cap it. But, if that failed, it would drill a \u201crelief well\u201d, which would intersect with the one spilling oil. It would then be filled with concrete to block the spill.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp-country/en_au/about-us/what-we-do/exploring-great-australian-bight/fate-effects-oil-spill-modelling-assumptions-parameters-results.pdf\">BP\u2019s oil spill modelling</a> says its \u201crealistic and achievable time to drill a relief well is 149 days\u201d. Earlier estimates from the company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/25/bp-would-need-to-bring-equipment-from-texas-to-contain-south-australia-oil-spill\">suggested it would take 157 days</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/sites/bsee_prod.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/federal-register-notice//2016-15699.pdf\">new US regulations</a> for drilling in the Arctic require a relief well to be drilled and completed within 45 days. To achieve that, the company must have access to a nearby rig.</p> <p>BP has not said it will have its own rig nearby in the Bight. Instead, it would borrow one from another company. But it is unclear where such a rig would come from, since there are no other rigs in the Bight.</p> <p>Hopkins told the Guardian it also wasn\u2019t clear how quickly another company could release a rig for this purpose.</p> <p>\u201cThe Gulf of Mexico blowout was stopped in 87 days, during which time it inflicted <a href=\"http://www.cchbooks.com.au/disastrous-decisions-the-human-and-organisational-causes-of-the-gulf-of-mexico-blowout\">damage worth at least $40bn</a>. Who knows what the toll would have been if it had lasted almost twice as long?\u201d</p> <p>Before drilling a relief well, BP would try to cap the blowout using a a \u201ccapping stack\u201d, a new piece of equipment designed after the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p>BP has previously said it would rely on shipping a stack from Singapore to the Bight, which would take <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/25/bp-would-need-to-bring-equipment-from-texas-to-contain-south-australia-oil-spill\">32 days</a>. Including shipping time, it said capping would take 35 days \u2013 an estimate government <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/25/bp-would-need-to-bring-equipment-from-texas-to-contain-south-australia-oil-spill\">officials have said was \u201coptimistic\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Five capping stacks are available for rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and are expected to be on site within 48 hours. In the Arctic, a capping stack must be at the site within 24 hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/senate-reopens-inquiry-into-plans-to-drill-in-great-australian-bight\">Senate reopens inquiry into plans to drill in Great Australian Bight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf the Arctic justifies this level of protection, why not the Bight?\u201d Hopkins said.</p> <p>A recent exercise in the Gulf of Mexico showed that a nearby capping stack could be used to cap a spill in just 15 days, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn this respect BP\u2019s estimate of the time it would take to cap a blowout is a long way short of industry best practice.\u201d</p> <p>Hopkins said that even BP\u2019s plans to use subsea oil dispersants would not necessarily be deployed before oil reached a shoreline. BP has said subsea dispersal would begin within 10 days \u201cwhere that is possible\u201d but oil could reach the coast within 9.2 days.</p> <p>\u201cIts published oil spill response plan gives no guarantee that an oil spill in the Bight would not reach the shoreline and damage the environment,\u201d Hopkins said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for BP said: \u201cIn the very unlikely event that there was a well incident, we would take action immediately, starting from within seconds. There are lots of parallel activities that we would mobilise, such as starting dispersant injection or surface recovery, at the same time as capping the well.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) is a technically credible, strong and independent regulator overseeing a world-class regulatory system. The \u2018objectives-based system\u2019 used by Nopsema requires companies including BP to identify and appropriately manage risk; this system ensures each activity is assessed based on its circumstances, instead of the one-size-fits-all approach taken in some other countries.\u201d</p>",

We will all be arrested for this movie.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that, \u2018Every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin. And the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Other medal recipients included poet Louise Gl\u00fcck, composer Philip Glass and historian Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns, and celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who pulled out of Trump\u2019s new Washington hotel over his anti-immigrant comments.</p> <p>Obama added: \u201cWe also honour Wynton Marsalis, who unfortunately could not make it here today, and Morgan Freeman, who undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.

Round is also flat. Wrong is also right? </p> <p>A new research paper published in the journal <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-016-1198-6\">Synthese</a> has looked at several of these contradictory arguments that get thrown around the blogosphere, the <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/09/15/australia-s-climate-denialists-senator-malcolm-roberts-fails-high-school-science-maiden-speech\">Australian Senate</a> and the opinion pages of the (mostly) conservative media.</p> <p>The paper comes with the fun and enticing title: \u201cThe Alice in Wonderland mechanics of the rejection of (climate) science: simulating coherence by conspiracism.\u201d</p> <p>Why Alice? Because, as the White Queen admitted: \u201cWhy, sometimes I\u2019ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>The three authors, including Dr John Cook, of the University of Queensland, look at both rhetorical and scientific arguments put by deniers. </p> <p>One example is the popular theme that casts \u201csceptics\u201d as \u201cdissenting heroes\u201d who bravely oppose \u201cpolitical persecution and fraud\u201d. You know, like modern-day Galileos. </p> <p>But the authors write that deniers will also try and convince the public that there is no consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change (there is and it\u2019s us). They write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Either there is a pervasive scientific consensus in which case contrarians are indeed dissenters, or there is no consensus in which case contrarian opinions should have broad support within the scientific community and no fearless opposition to an establishment is necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>The authors unleash similar jujitsu-style logic on other contradictory arguments and give examples of where the same individuals have apparently argued against themselves.</p> <p>One of the authors\u2019 examples of incoherent logic comes from the Australian geologist and mining industry figure Prof Ian Plimer and his 2009 book, Heaven and Earth \u2013 a book favourably cited by the likes of the former prime minister Tony Abbott and Cardinal George Pell.</p> <p>On page 278, Plimer writes that \u201ctemperature and CO2 are not connected\u201d but, on page 411, writes that \u201cCO2 keeps our planet warm\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think that people who deny basic science will continue to do so, no matter how contradictory their arguments may be.</p> <footer> <cite>Stephan Lewandowsky</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to the authors, their examples of \u201cincoherence\u201d only hold together in the minds of the deniers if you apply types of glue known as \u201cconspiracist ideation\u201d and \u201cidentity-protective cognition\u201d.</p> <p>So what\u2019s that all about? </p> <p>Conspiracist ideation, or conspiratorial thinking, is the tendency to entertain suggestions: for example that Nasa and the Bureau of Meteorology are conspiring to deliberately manipulate temperature data just to make global warming seem worse than it really is, rather than to correct for known issues.</p> <p>An example of \u201cidentity-protective cognition\u201d in this case, the authors explain, is where people who advocate for small governments and \u201cfree markets\u201d face a dilemma. </p> <p>Accepting the scientific consensus would likely see increased levels of regulation, which challenges their identity as free-market advocates. So instead, the authors argue, the only options open are to either deny the consensus or try and discredit it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because cutting GHG emissions requires interventions \u2013 such as regulation or increased taxation \u2013 that interfere with laissez-faire free-market economics, people whose identity and worldview centres around free markets are particularly challenged by the findings from climate science.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lead author Prof Stephan Lewandowsky, an expert in cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol, has written several research papers finding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jul/08/climate-denial-linked-to-conspiratorial-thinking-in-new-study\">links between the rejection of science, \u201cconspiracist ideation\u201d</a> and the belief in free market economic principles. </p> <p>One argument that deniers may try with this <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-016-1198-6\">Synthese</a> paper is that climate scientists also contradict each other and have offered several explanations for the supposed global warming \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cslowdown\u201d (this was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/feb/12/global-warming-fake-pause-hiatus-climate-change\">never really a thing</a>). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/26/climate-scientists-are-now-grading-climate-journalism\">Climate scientists are now grading climate journalism | Daniel Nethery and Emmanuel Vincent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewandowsky told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Phenomena can have multiple explanations \u2013 so, for example, it is entirely conceivable that volcanic activity and heat exchange with the ocean though the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon might have contributed to what has been called a \u201cslowdown\u201d in warming. Similarly, just because contemporary climate change is driven by CO2 does not mean that the sun could not have caused earlier episodes of climate change. The same phenomenon may have multiple causes \u2013 but the same cause cannot have contradictory consequences. For example, it would be ridiculous to say that the alleged \u2018slowdown\u2019 was driven by La Ni\u00f1a but that La Ni\u00f1a also causes warming. Equally, it cannot be the case that CO2 causes warming as well as cooling. But CO2 as well as La Ni\u00f1a may both contribute to global temperatures.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, Lewandowsky and his colleagues are by no means the first to see the many contradictory arguments from deniers. But does he think looking at them in such detail will make any difference? </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that people who deny basic science will continue to do so, no matter how contradictory their arguments may be. However, these pervasive contradictions should caution the media against giving an airing to those opinions.</p> </blockquote>"
