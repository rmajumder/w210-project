  "<p>Science degrees have copped more than their fair share of criticism in recent weeks. The Grattan Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/mapping-australian-higher-education-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mapping Australia\u2019s higher education 2016 report</a> argues that Australia has too many science graduates. What\u2019s striking about this finding is that it fails to acknowledge the broad-based value of a scientific education. </p> <p>PhD candidate <a href=\"http://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/graduate-programs/sjd/student-profiles/alexandra-phelan.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alexandra Phelan</a> studied for a dual bachelor of biomedical science and a bachelor of law, and is now completing a doctorate in international health law at Georgetown University in Washington as a <a href=\"http://johnmonash.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Monash scholar</a>. In 2014, when the Ebola outbreak hit west Africa, Phelan consulted on the epidemic for both the World Health Organisation and the countries affected. </p> <p>Phelan is continuing to provide advice on how global law can be used in international epidemics to reduce the spread of the Zika virus. But if we are to take note of the Grattan Institute report on education, Phelan would be lamented as falling among the many science graduates who are not working as scientists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/19/music-with-a-message-engineering-industry-tackles-shortage-of-female-students\">Music with a message: engineering industry tackles shortage of female students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Grattan Institute report makes the narrow assumption that science is a vocational degree that trains people to be scientists, and is concerned that \u201cscience graduates are pushing into a general labour market in which they must compete with graduates from other fields\u201d. This conclusion is based on a misconception: that science graduates are limited to a career in science. A science degree teaches skills that are important in any workplace: it is a foundational degree that develops numeracy and challenges students to value the critical lessons learned in the process of discovery: creativity, patience and attention to detail. Phelan is a perfect exemplar of the value a science degree holds to other fields.</p> <p>Every year General Sir John Monash scholars are selected from all fields of endeavour in a highly competitive process, with the goal of identifying and funding individuals who will lead Australia in the future. More than half of these have undergraduate science degrees (including science, maths, engineering, IT and biomedical science, commonly grouped as Stem degrees, but excluding medical undergraduate degrees). It is striking that in an open selection process, with selection panels largely composed of non-scientists, science graduates are over-represented among individuals identified as Australia\u2019s future leaders. The key attributes fostered by a science degree are an inquiring mind, facility with data and technology, an analytical approach to problem solving and a sense of curiosity and inquiry. These are attributes that are of vital importance to Australia\u2019s future leaders.</p> <p>There are broader lessons here. Almost all of Australia\u2019s industries \u2013 including mining, banking and retail \u2013 are, and will continue to be, subject to technology-driven disruption and will need technology-literate people to counter such disruption with innovation. </p> <p>Moreover, most jobs of the future will exist in industries we cannot yet predict but that will require creativity, analytical ability and a comfort with technology. The Grattan Institute report, in fact, acknowledges that \u201cStem employers report that their employees with Stem qualifications are better at problem solving and critical thinking than are employees without Stem qualifications\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/11/time-for-men-to-sign-up-to-female-dominated-caring-and-sharing-jobs\">Time for men to sign up to female-dominated caring and sharing jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/afr-innovation-summit-alan-finkel-urges-smart-regulation-strategic-investment-20160816-gqtvx8\" rel=\"nofollow\">observed this month</a>: \u201cIf you want a worker who can solve a problem in a short time, with resources strung out to the nth degree, hire someone with a science doctorate.\u201d </p> <p>Hugh Evans, the founder of the Oaktree foundation and another John Monash scholar, illustrates Finkel\u2019s point. Evans heads up the Global Poverty project, a global human rights organisation that aims to eradicate world poverty. The problem-solving skills of his undergraduate science degree from Monash are used every day and have an impact on millions of people in need around the world. </p> <p>The Grattan Institute\u2019s recommendation that we need fewer science graduates is potentially very damaging to Australia. We believe that more science grads are needed, not fewer. We need to encourage an understanding among educators, students and the wider community that an undergraduate science degree can be applied to many different contexts, jobs, industries and situations. Government and business should get behind our science students and encourage future ones. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

Farage will describe the Republican\u2019s campaign as a similar crusade by grassroots activists against \u201cbig banks and global political insiders\u201d and how those who feel disaffected and disenfranchised can become involved in populist, rightwing politics. With Trump lagging in the polls, just as Brexit did prior to the vote on the referendum, Farage will also hearten supporters by insisting that they can prove pundits and oddsmakers wrong as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This message resonates with the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to reach out to blue collar voters who have become disillusioned with American politics, while also adding a unique flair to Trump\u2019s never staid campaign rallies.</p> <p>The event will mark the first meeting between Farage and Trump.</p> <p>Arron Banks, the businessman who backed Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign group associated with the UK Independence party (Ukip), tweeted that he would be meeting Trump over dinner and was looking forward to Farage\u2019s speech.</p> <p>The appointment last week of Stephen Bannon, former chairman of the Breitbart website, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/steve-bannon-profile-breitbart-trump-campaign-manager\">\u201cCEO\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign</a> has seen the example of the Brexit vote, which Breitbart enthusiastically advocated, rise to the fore in Trump\u2019s campaign narrative.</p> <p>Speaking to a local radio station before the joint rally, Farage urged Americans to \u201cgo out and fight\u201d against Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cI am going to say to people in this country that the circumstances, the similarities, the parallels between the people who voted Brexit and the people who could beat Clinton in a few weeks time here in America are uncanny,\u201d Farage told Super Talk Mississippi. \u201cIf they want things to change they have get up out of their chairs and go out and fight for it. It can happen. We\u2019ve just proved it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am being careful,\u201d he added when asked if he supported Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me as a foreign politician to say who you should vote for ... All I will say is that if you vote for Hillary Clinton, then nothing will change. She represents the very politics that we\u2019ve just broken through the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he thought this was the biggest factor in the Brexit referendum, Farage said: \u201cIt was the key. It was the absolute key. The reason we won the referendum ... is that we believe immigration should be controlled.\u201d</p> <p>Both Farage and Trump are keen to limit immigration and protect voters against some of the impact of globalisation.<br></p> <p>Farage was condemned during the EU referendum campaign for using anti-immigration rhetoric, including a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">poster showing a queue of refugees</a> with the slogan \u201cBreaking Point\u201d; Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">promised to impose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d</a> on potential immigrants.</p> <p>In a further parallel with Brexit politics, the Trump campaign has argued in recent days that it enjoys support not reflected in the polls, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-campaign-news-polls-kellyanne-conway\">undercover voters</a> who are shy about admitting their support for the controversial nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/766246213079498752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">They will soon be calling me MR.

Farage stepped down as Ukip leader in the wake of the vote, but has hinted that he could re-enter frontline politics if the British prime minister, Theresa May, does not rapidly press ahead with her promise to ensure \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Farage has appeared at Republican events in the past, beginning with a well-received speaking gig at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Farage also popped up at the Republican national convention in Cleveland last month, where he <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?412958-1/nigel-farage-criticizes-president-obamas-intervention-brexit-campaign\">declared himself</a> himself \u201ca huge fan of Barack Obama\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWithout him we wouldn\u2019t have won the referendum,\u201d Farage explained. \u201cHe was very helpful.\u201d The US president had encouraged Britain to remain part of the EU.</p> <p>Dan Schneider, the executive director of the American Conservative Union, raved at the time about Farage\u2019s CPAC appearance to the Guardian, calling him a \u201cvery smart, very funny man and he can turn a phrase very well\u201d. </p> <p>Farage is not uniform in his support of Trump, however. Last month he <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nigel-farage-donald-trump-republican-convention-muslims-us-election-2016-a7153206.html\">told an interviewer</a> that Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric makes him \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d.</p>",

Queensland police said they were \u201cconfronted with a terrible scene\u201d at Shelley\u2019s Backpackers in Home Hill, north Queensland, at 11.15pm local time on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>Queensland deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski said all possible motives for the attack were being considered. Investigators would consider whether \u201cmental health or drug misuse issues\u201d were a factor alongside any \u201cindication of an extremist slant or he was radicalised\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not about race or religion, it is about individual criminal behaviour,\u201d he said. </p> <p>French nationals who witnessed the incident have said Ayad\u2019s shouted throughout the incident and that his words were incoherent and nonsensical.</p> <p>Ayad was apparently infatuated with Ayliffe-Chung, who was working on a Queensland farm following a year travelling. He is said to have told fellow hostel guests he planned to marry her in the days before the attack.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Ayad was allegedly armed with a kitchen knife when he roused Ayliffe-Chung from her bed and hauled her on to a balcony where he allegedly repeatedly stabbed her.</p> <p>A caretaker at the hostel, Grant Schultz, tried to intervene and was wounded in the leg. Witnesses said Ayad then performed a \u201cswan dive\u201d from a stairwell before fatally stabbing Norris\u2019s dog.</p> <p>He allegedly then pursued the wounded Ayliffe-Chung, who is said to have sought refuge in a bathroom with the aid of Jackson. Ayad allegedly set upon Jackson, stabbing him in the eye, head and torso.<br></p> <p>In a statement, Ayliffe-Chung\u2019s mother, Rosie Ayliffe, said her daughter \u201cwould not want to be the reason for any hostilities caused by any misrepresentation of events\u201d. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8838a35da99ac95fea18d6447f0b021ee6cc834\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8838a35da99ac95fea18d6447f0b021ee6cc834/0_0_1996_3438/581.jpg\" alt=\"Mia Ayliffe-Chung with a friend in a social media photo.\" width=\"581\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mia Ayliffe-Chung with a friend in a social media photo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Browne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said: \u201cMy beloved daughter Mia was an amazing young women with an adventurous spirit. Not only was she kind and funny, she was clever, sassy, with a sense of fun. </p> <p>\u201cMia was full of the kind of open-minded compassion for life that you don\u2019t see that often. It felt as though she was reminding us all of the beauty and possibilities we each have and that we should live life to the full. She was always at one with herself, so whole.\u201d</p> <p>She described her daughter\u2019s \u201cstrong sense of right and wrong\u201d, and her \u201cfeisty nature and strong sense of justice\u201d that made her a beloved friend to her peers. \u201cMia was a rare person who saw beyond race, creed and belief. She would always treat others with dignity, respect and kindness,\u201d her mother said. </p> <p>Police reported witnesses saying Ayad had been singing the French national anthem before shouting \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/british-woman-allegedly-stabbed-to-death-by-frenchman-at-australian-backpackers-hostel\">Allahu Akbar</a>\u201d.

Just 85 left! Skills achieved; the ability to tell the difference between a rock and a clump of mud and throwing stones really far. The sun is too hot. Stupid Australia.\u201d</p> <p>She had studied childcare at Buxton &amp; Leek college before her travels, posting regularly on Facebook from stunning locations to share her experiences with family and friends. </p> <p>Paying tearful tribute, her half-sister Nicola Chung, 36, who lives in south London, as does her father, told the Guardian she had spoken to her on the phone on Tuesday. \u201cShe was bubbly, carefree and had trained to be a nanny because she loved children. She was just backpacking. She had been travelling for a year and had arrived in Australia,\u201d Chung said.<br></p> <p>Jamison Stead, 23, a former boyfriend, described Ayliffe-Chung as a \u201cbeautiful soul\u201d. The Australian sales rep told the Press Association they had met in April when she was living in Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast, where she worked waiting tables at the Bedroom Lounge Bar before travelling 800 miles north for a farm work placement where she had, among other things, been cutting cane.</p> <p>Stead said she had been \u201cplanning on exploring Australia, with the intention to find a sponsorship as she wanted to stay here as she had fallen in love with the country and its people\u201d.<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cI can\u2019t quite get my head around what\u2019s happened. Truly devastated, more just disbelief that this has happened.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe was a beautiful girl who had her whole life ahead of her and we spoke of what the future may hold in store for her and what she wanted to do. It\u2019s sad knowing that she won\u2019t be able to do those things. My heart goes out to her and her family.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gollschewski said Ayliffe-Chung was the first person to be attacked and the incident was being treated as a murder case and not a terror attack. He said: \u201cInitial inquiries indicate that comments which may be construed as being of an extremist nature were made by the alleged offender. It is alleged that the suspect used the phrase \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 during the attack and when arrested by police.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ayad, who received hospital treatment for minor injuries, was not known to police and had been in Australia on a temporary visa since March. He appeared to have \u201cno local connections\u201d.</p> <p>The parents of Tom Jackson, who is said to be in a critical condition in Townsville hospital, declined to speak from their home in Congleton, Cheshire.<br></p> <p>Rachel McVeigh, curriculum leader for education and childcare at Buxton &amp; Leek college, said: \u201cMia had a zest for life and was free-spirited, with a keen desire to travel.\u201d Staff and students were devastated, she added.</p> <p>Amy Browne, 19, from the Gold Coast, who worked with Ayliffe-Chung, described her as the \u201cbubbliest and most caring girl I knew\u201d who \u201calways had a smile on her face\u201d.<br></p> <p>Tommy Martin, 24, from Newbury, Berkshire, who met her in Bali, Indonesia, before reuniting on the Gold Coast, told the Press Association: \u201cShe was a free spirit who didn\u2019t have any set plans but that\u2019s the way she loved it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Her friend Siobhan Moor, who she knew in the UK then bumped into on the Gold Coast, posted on Facebook how she had been \u201cwell and truly happy out there living life to the fullest\u201d. </p> <p>Paul Lovatt, the head of pastoral care at Anthony Gell school, which Ayliffe-Chung attended, said she would be remembered as \u201ca bubbly student who was energetic, caring and who immersed herself in life, enriching the school environment she contributed to\u201d.<br></p> <p>Ali Kadri, an Islamic Council of Queensland spokesman, called for caution in public discussion before full facts were known.

Amid the talk of traingate, overcrowding, prices and nationalisation, there has been little mention of safety.</p> <p>This is important, because the safety record for Britain\u2019s rail network is staggeringly good. It is now nine years since a passenger on one of Britain\u2019s trains died in an accident. The last death occurred when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/04/grayrigg-derailment-network-rail-fine\">a Virgin Pendolino derailed in Cumbria</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/virgin-trains-fares-overcrowding-jeremy-corbyn-railways-q-and-a\">Are trains in Britain as overcrowded as Jeremy Corbyn claims?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A brief glance at the history of Britain\u2019s railways shows this run is without precedent. It also compares favourably with the rest of the world. </p> <p>The latest annual safety report by the Office of Rail and Road shows Britain has the third safest railway in Europe since 2010, based on workforce and passenger fatalities per billion kilometers of train journeys. Only Luxembourg and Ireland have a better safety record. Out of Europe\u2019s 10 biggest railway networks, Britain has by far the safest. </p> <p>The train crashes near Bad Aibling in Germany in February, which killed 12 people, and in Italy in July, which killed 23, are a reminder that tragedy is never far away. </p> <p>The ORR report also shows that the for the first time ever there was no fatalities among workers on the railway in the last year, which is another landmark.</p> <p>This look at Britain\u2019s safety record is not mean to say that the existing system of Network Rail managing the infrastructure and private companies managing the trains is flawless. After the railway was privatised in the mid-1990s there was a string of major accidents at Southall, Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield, and Potters Bar. The Hatfield crash led to the collapse of Railtrack, and a lot needed to be learned from those accidents.</p> <p>Prices are too high, the government needs to invest more in new infrastructure, and some trains are overcrowded. However, this safety record shows that Britain is doing something right and the existing system is not compromising safety. That is something to build on.</p> <p><strong>Sports Direct opens up</strong><br></p> <p>Who fancies a day out in Shirebrook? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a> is to host an \u201copen day\u201d on 7 September in an attempt to show that working at its warehouse in the Midlands isn\u2019t like working in a Victorian sweatshop after all.</p> <p>Normally annual general meetings are for shareholders only, with journalists allowed in depending on the mood of the company.

  "<p>Mainstream media companies have opened the door for digital upstarts because their obsession with ratings led them to fail their audiences by colluding with controversial politicians, according to the billionaire journalist behind the Vice website.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/24/top-gear-cast-change-perfect-storm-former-producer\">Top Gear cast change due to 'perfect storm', says former producer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shane Smith, the site\u2019s founder, said that traditional media companies have failed to connect with young audiences or cover the issues they were interested in, and even accused some of tacitly \u201ccolluding\u201d with notorious politicians to drive ratings.</p> <p>\u201cThe secret or our success can be traced to the day we changed our content. The business grew and the audience exploded and we made more money,\u201d he said, giving the annual MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh international TV festival. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>At an earlier press briefing, he had called out CNN\u2019s extensive coverage of Donald Trump as an example of the established media\u2019s failings. \u201cIf you look at Trump as an example: Trump gives you ratings. The whole collusion between CNN and Trump is a perfect example of what\u2019s wrong in media today.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Vice, founded by Smith as a \u201cpunk\u201d magazine in Montreal in 1994, has gradually become a global multimedia company after it expanded into edgy online video. Its success has attracted a string of blue-chip media investors, including Disney, which pumped $400m (\u00a3302m) into the company for an 18% stake, and it plans to launch a TV channel in the UK and 58 other countries later this year. </p> <p>But despite that success, Smith warned there would be an impending crisis in the media industry with consolidation among major players and an \u201cevisceration\u201d of digital businesses, who he said where struggling to make their business models work.</p> <p>\u201cNext year, you\u2019ve already seen huge consolidation this year, next year will be a fucking bloodbath,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are going to see a merger and acquisition frenzy of the last two or three big boys, buying the last two or three [digital] scale plays to say \u2018we\u2019ve got digital, we\u2019ve got mobile, we\u2019re smart.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Smith pointed to online rivals such as Buzzfeed and Vox, which have received $200m each in investment from NBC Universal, and Business Insider, which sold up to Axel Springer \u2013 owner of Europe\u2019s biggest-selling tabloid Bild, as examples of how many of the new breed of digital news media were finding it tough.</p> <p>He said Vice\u2019s success had come when the the website \u201cstopped being the hipster\u2019s bible\u201d and adopted a more mature journalistic approach with shows such as feminist writer Gloria Steinem\u2019s show Woman, the documentary series Gaycation and its Vice News operation.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is the growth of Vice, valuations and our traffic growth and everything, happened,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen we stopped talking about cocaine, supermodels and rare denim. When we started talking about the environment, women\u2019s issues, LGBT issues. Because our audience demanded it. </p> <p>\u201cBecause of that it changed everything. Everyone said young people don\u2019t care about news [and] they sure as hell don\u2019t care about international [news]. Bullshit. They care. But they don\u2019t like way its been portrayed up until now. This is a huge white space.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s other backers include Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP, the MTV owner Viacom and Disney, whose $400m investment late last year provided Smith with a business valued at $4.5bn.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The move by Disney, which now owns an 18% stake directly and through its A+E Networks joint venture with Hearst, has heightened speculation that it will ultimately purchase the company.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point or another Time Warner tried to buy us, Fox tried to buy us, Viacom tried to buy us,\u201d Smith said. \u201cRecently we\u2019ve done a big deal with Disney. And besides Disney they\u2019ve all tried to give us haircuts on valuation, some have tried to censor us. They don\u2019t want to make Vice Disney, they want to give us autonomy. It makes sense for them and it makes sense for us.\u201d</p> <p>He warned that all media had a \u201cfear of Facebook\u201d which, along with Google, sucks up giant swaths of the digital advertising revenue that is the lifeblood of many media companies. There was also the spectre of Facebook \u201cchanging its algorithm\u201d, which would mean it effectively \u201cowned\u201d the media companies that had become too dependent on its giant global popularity to drive audiences to their content.</p> <p>\u201cI learned this two years ago which is why we moved into TV,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realised two years ago we had to get off the crack that is Facebook or at least somewhat mitigate it with some methadone [by expanding Vice on to multiple platforms].\u201d</p> <p>Smith has a penchant for happily fuelling speculation about the future of his company. He controls Vice holding super-voting shares, and says that the industry is at the peak level of valuations and could face a crash.</p> <p>\u201cI can stay independent. It is good for me, as a megalomaniac, I\u2019m set for life,\u201d he quipped. \u201cAs a chief executive I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders to do the best thing for the company. And it is something I wrestle with every day. Do I do something that is good for me and stay independent? Do I do something for the shareholders, and probably the company going forward, do I [continue to massively invest in the business] or do I take the risk of public markets?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Larry Elliott\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\" title=\"\">Brexit Armageddon was a terrifying vision \u2013 but it simply hasn\u2019t happened</a>, 20 August) was a breath of fresh air. I speak as someone whose immediate family of five covered every opinion \u2013 remain, leave and abstain \u2013 but there was no animosity among us; we discussed our reasons in a civilised way and actually found there was quite a lot of agreement on most issues, albeit that we finally and narrowly voted differently, or not at all. I am proud of that. Since the result I have been appalled and depressed by the insults and derision thrown at leave voters, branding them all \u201cracist bigots\u201d and accusing them of \u201cruining our children\u2019s future\u201d. The hysterical media coverage and the self-righteous and self-congratulatory attitude of comedians and commentators has been unbelievable and shameful.</p> <p>The sky didn\u2019t fall in. We are rid of George Osborne and his promise of yet more austerity and a threatened recession. As Larry Elliott says, if nothing else it has forced the government to take a long hard look at the British economy, something that would not have happened without the shock administered by the referendum.</p> <p>Of course there will be challenges and difficulties, but there would have been if we had stayed in an increasingly free-market Europe which has delivered high unemployment and austerity to so many of its citizens. The European project was a noble concept which has become increasingly dysfunctional. You can love Europe (and I do) without endorsing the EU, which is a political organisation.<br><strong>Jill Rooney</strong><br><em>Ashtead, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott\u2019s depiction of our economy entering into some post-Brexit sunlit uplands defies belief. Equally absurd is his criticism of the EU for moving in a more free-market direction. It is the EU that has tried to mitigate the ravages of the free market so assiduously promoted by recent British governments. Does he really believe that Britain under Theresa May is going to enhance these rights and protections?</p> <p>More disturbing is his bald statement that the European project has failed. Has it? It was set up to secure peace in Europe after half a century of terrible wars, and it has made and continues to make a vital contribution to peace. Now, as we face new threats from Isis and from Putin\u2019s Russia, the EU is more necessary than ever before. Britain\u2019s exit has profoundly weakened one of the main institutions providing peace and security in Europe.</p> <p>Most disturbing of all, however, is Elliott\u2019s desire to shake things up. Brexit&#xa0;has certainly done that. The rise in racism, xenophobia and fear have indeed shaken things up for millions of people in this country. In addition our country now faces the real risk of breaking up. But no doubt peace and security, racism and xenophobia and the breakup of the UK are a price worth paying for shaking things up.<br><strong>Dr Shane O\u2019Rourke</strong><br><em>Department of history, University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 The impact on savers is not mentioned in Larry Elliott\u2019s rosy post-Brexit analysis. The Bank of England has had to lower interest rates, and more may come in the autumn. Pensioners relying on savings to supplement their pension will certainly feel that the sky has fallen in as they pay the price of sorting out the mess.<br><strong>Ivan Laud</strong><br><em>Ashbourne, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Please can we have a full two-page debate between Larry Elliott and William Keegan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/leavers-brexit-ashamed-harm-yet-to-come\" title=\"\">Leavers should be ashamed of the harm that is yet to come</a>, The Observer, 21 August).<br><strong>Professor Mike Elliott</strong><br><em>Leven, East Riding of Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Economists, politicians and journalists on both sides of the Brexit debate should know better and refrain from claiming the moral high ground each time a data point seems to give weight to their side of the argument. A Nobel prize in economics is not necessary to know that the consequences of Brexit will be unknown for many years to come, and until then everything should be considered aleatory \u201cnoise\u201d.</p> <p>There will only be one undeniable reality with Brexit: the UK and the EU will at the same time become trading partners and economic competitors (for&#xa0;future foreign investment).</p> <p>Once the new rules of engagement are finalised, it will require years of trials and tribulations to observe if the Brexit gamble pays off or not, the same way as it took decades to observe the relative economic decline of postwar Britain until, ironically, it joined the EU in 1973, with accession ratified in 1975 via referendum (please note the two-thirds majority) and oddly a majority of Conservatives favouring membership, a very split Labour party and an SNP totally against it.</p> <p>Maybe 2057 will be the year when future generations decide that their ancestors\u2019 \u201cnearly-no-skin-in-the-game\u201d gamble has not paid off (may they RIP), try to negotiate new terms for&#xa0;EU accession which will most likely be worse than the current ones from the early 1970s, and hold a referendum to WE-join the EU (assuming Scotland and Northern Ireland go their separate EU&#xa0;ways)?</p> <p>As the saying goes, history tends to repeat itself. Will it once more?<br><strong>Antero Touchard</strong><br><em>Madrid, Spain</em></p> <p>\u2022 As an ironic joke I proposed the launch of Brexit TV following the 23 June referendum result, which would only show reruns of sitcoms and Carry On films from before the UK joined the EU.

It would be useful if we all make sure we\u2019re reading and citing the right treaties.<br><strong>David Phinnemore</strong><br><em>Professor of European politics, Queen\u2019s&#xa0;University Belfast</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>That Britain\u2019s \u201cdivorce\u201d from the EU will take time, as discussed in Jennifer Rankin\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/brexit-trade-deals-gruelling-challenge-taking-back-control\" title=\"\">\u2018An unimaginably hard task\u2019: experts say divorcing EU will take 10 years</a>, 17 August), is undisputed, but the government should not be allowed to establish trading relations with the rest of the world that would merely mirror those of the European Union. Many people voted to leave because they were opposed to treaties being made with third countries that had less to do with trade and more to do with the hegemony of transnational corporations in the shaping of the global economy. Institutions such as the IMF and the OECD supported the opposite view because they correctly understood that the EU was a cornerstone of the neoliberal status quo and would be weakened by Britain\u2019s departure.</p> <p>So steeped have we become in neoliberal ideology that we cannot envisage a trading system that is not predicated upon free trade agreements and the rules of the World Trade Organisation. However, and contrary to the views expressed in your article, there is no need for British trade officials to \u201cpreserve UK ties to the 65 countries that have a trade agreement with the EU\u201d. Nor is there any compulsion to calculate what percentage of EU meat imports from South America accrue to the UK, or any other product for that matter. It is quite feasible to have international trade without prescriptive treaties.</p> <p>Once it has extricated itself from the tentacles of the European commission\u2019s trade mandate, Britain, as one of the world\u2019s largest economies, has a unique opportunity to trade with the rest of the world on a less exploitative and more equitable basis. Making this happen represents a huge challenge to those of us who have campaigned for too long against the worst aspects of EU free trade deals, only to see them replicated in a post-Brexit UK. <br><strong>Bert Schouwenburg</strong><br><em>International officer, GMB</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jennifer Rankin points out that at the moment we have no idea what Brexit means and that our negotiations face formidable obstacles, especially in new trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-launches-conservative-leadership-bid-brexit-means-brexit-video\" title=\"\">Theresa May tells us \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a>, what she means is that the referendum verdict is final and irreversible. Indeed there is a widespread assumption that we are now bound to leave.</p> <p>But there is nothing sacrosanct about a referendum vote. If circumstances change dramatically before the date of our departure, which is at least three years away \u2013 if, for example, there is a massive change of public opinion in favour of remain \u2013 there would be every justification for a second referendum. And there is a strong likelihood that opinion will change.</p> <p>Most economists forecast a recession, and there are good reasons for pessimism. We are unlikely to follow Norway and remain members of the single market, as we would have to continue payments into the EU budget, could not regain control of our own borders, and would still be bound by EU regulations and directives, but without any say in their formulation.</p> <p>As it becomes clear that we will be excluded from the single market, more and more companies are likely to relocate to the continent. Uncertainty about future trade agreements will be bad for business investment and for the value of the pound. Perhaps most seriously, our huge trade deficit is financed by foreign capital, which may well flow out if the pound weakens further. We could face a serious recession, and more severe austerity.</p> <p>Leave campaigners promised us a glorious future outside the EU, with lots of extra money for the NHS. Before long, they may well feel they were sold a pup.<br><strong>Dick Taverne</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrats, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Larry Elliott blames \u201cproject fear\u201d, not Brexit, for undermining confidence. He is right that economists were nearly unanimous in opposing Brexit and he admits that it is still early days, but he is far too optimistic.</p> <p>How many economists believed there would be an immediate disaster before we even knew when or how Brexit would take place (or even if it will take place, given that negotiations might yet prove so complicated that the next general election comes first)? Most economists believed that there would be long-term costs and that whether they were large or small would depend on the deal that was negotiated. (A Norway-type deal might not have much effect, but immediate exit before negotiating any trade deals would be disaster.) So far we simply do not know what those long-term costs are going to be because we do not know what the government will do or how the negotiations will go.</p> <p>Larry Elliott picks out some seemingly good economic news. He omits the fact that, if it is not reversed (and it is not clear why it should be), the fall in the value of sterling has reduced our living standards permanently. The eventual cost could be much higher.</p> <p>As for the short term, if \u201cCity economists\u201d were forecasting immediate Armageddon, perhaps the lesson is that journalists should pay less attention to them and should listen more to academic economists. There were academic economists pointing out that short-term movements, which depend heavily on expectations, are hard to forecast. Maybe economists should have forecast a U-turn in policy towards the deficit (after six years when people who questioned the importance of reducing the deficit were ridiculed), that a sharp fall in the exchange rate would cause consumers to buy imported goods before prices rose, or that Olympic success would induce a feelgood factor, though it might be better to leave such speculations to City economists, concerned as much with day-to-day fluctuations in financial markets as with long-term prosperity.<br><strong>Roger Backhouse</strong><br><em>Professor of the history and philosophy of economics, University of Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 For the last decade, I\u2019ve worked on economic and foreign policy issues related to South Korea, and prior to that studied for my MPhil at LSE. As a result, I\u2019ve had a fondness for both South Korea and the United Kingdom. Over the years, as I\u2019ve focused on South Korea professionally, I\u2019ve often wondered why South Korea couldn\u2019t be more like the UK. Needless to say, I was somewhat surprised by Christian Spurrier\u2019s suggestion that the UK should look to South Korea for inspiration on how to prosper post-Brexit (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/south-korea-economy-britain-brexit\" title=\"\">Want proof that Britain can thrive after Brexit? Look at South Korea</a>, 22 August).</p> <p>For developing nations around the world, South Korea should be an inspiration. Turning a war-torn, resourceless country into one of the world\u2019s most developed economies in a generation\u2019s lifetime is one of the most significant achievements of the second half of the 20th century. Seoul\u2019s success is demonstrable proof that countries can chart a better future, but it\u2019s less clear that it offers lessons for advanced economies like the UK.</p> <p>South Korea aspires to be everything most took for granted about the UK before Brexit. It is moving towards becoming more multicultural and is actively seeking to attract the world\u2019s best and brightest. Immigration is a necessity for South Korea. It wants to connect to the Eurasian continent and has pursued free trade agreements with the US and the EU for the very reason of injecting reforms into its economy to help boost it to the heights of an economy like the UK\u2019s. If Spurrier wants South Korea to be the model for the post-Brexit UK, perhaps he needs only to look to the pre-Brexit UK for the way forward.<br><strong>Troy Stangarone</strong><br><em>Senior director, congressional affairs and trade, Korea Economic Institute</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>In Hawaii, women make up half of their current congressional delegation, with one senator and one representative \u2013 both women of color. There, women make <a href=\"http://statusofwomendata.org/app/uploads/2015/08/Hawaii-Fact-Sheet.pdf\">about 83 cents</a> on the dollar compared to white men \u2013 a few cents above the national average of <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination\">79 cents</a>. The state was also deemed the best state to live in for women\u2019s equality, according to a recent <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-for-women-equality/5835/#virginia-sapiro\">WalletHub study</a>.<br></p> <p>Hawaii was found to be No 1 in the three categories examined: workplace environment, education and political empowerment. Alaska ranked second overall and did especially well in educational attainment, while Arkansas and Mississippi tied Hawaii for first in the category of education.</p> <p>Analysts at WalletHub, a financial information site, calculated scores for each state based on 15 metrics that assessed the gender gap in pay, political representation, and educational attainment.<strong> </strong> </p> <p>States with female senators did well overall, taking 10 out of the top 11 spots overall. Aside from Michigan, which was ranked 28th, each of the 17 states with female senators was in the top 25.</p> <p>Utah earned last place on the ranking. It ranked poorest in terms of workplace and education, while Louisiana placed last for political participation. The state has no female representatives in Congress.</p> <p>WalletHub has put out <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-for-women/10728/#inderpal-grewal\">similar rankings</a> before, including one from earlier this year that looked at the best and worst states for women overall. Organizations such as the <a href=\"https://nwlc.org/\">National Women\u2019s Law Center</a> or the <a href=\"http://statusofwomendata.org/national-trends/best-worst-states/\">Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research</a> have compiled their own research on gender equality by state in the past. In its ranking, <a href=\"http://statusofwomendata.org/national-trends/best-worst-states/\">IWPR found</a> that Minnesota was the best state for women, with Hawaii tied for the No 5 spot with California, Maryland and Oregon. They found that Minnesota did especially well for women\u2019s health and wellbeing and political participation. The worst state in its study was Alabama.</p> <p>Fatima Goss Graves, senior vice-president for program at the NWLC, said what stood out to her about the data was how interrelated it is. \u201cEducational attainment is tied to workplace or to political power and participation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see some states that are faring poorly on two of the three if not all three spots.\u201d</p> <p>The common denominator that \u201creflects\u201d these other disparities, she said, is the gender pay gap. \u201cThe pay gap undermines the ability to do a wide range of things, including furthering education or running for office,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Julie Anderson, a research associate with IWPR, said that work-family support is a huge factor in the inequality issue, especially when more women are becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/gender-equality-women-working-men-homemakers-responsibility\">breadwinners</a> in their families. States lacking supportive policies, she said, can result in women dropping out of the workforce for caregiving responsibilities and causing lost wages or promotions.</p> <p>Goss Graves estimated that some differences between the states stem from changes made to equal pay laws or minimum wage laws, as well as states that allow for paid sick or medical leave or pre-kindergarten and childcare programs. \u201cThose are going to make a real big difference in whether its a state that\u2019s good for women\u2019s equality or whether it\u2019s a state that\u2019s working against women\u2019s equality,\u201d she said. </p> <p>However, she noted that there has been progress in passing laws that are more family-friendly. \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment where states are moving forward a number of policies that they think will make a difference,\u201d she said. Earlier this month, Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/massachusetts-equal-pay-law-women-salary-history\">signed a law</a> that will make it illegal for employers to inquire about salary or wage history.</p> <p>The study itself called the nationwide response to closing the gender gap \u201cdisappointing\u201d. The US was ranked 28th on the World Economic Foundation\u2019s 2015 <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/rankings/\">Global Gender Inequality Index</a>.</p> <p>Timed for the same week as Women\u2019s Equality Day, which commemorates women getting the right to vote, the study was published on Black Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day \u2013 the day that black women finally earned the same amount as white men did in the previous year. Equal Pay Day \u2013 based on the national average, without accounting for racial disparities \u2013 was last April.</p> <p>While being ranked high on the list of states might seem like a reason to celebrate, Goss Graves noted that even the states at the top have more work to do, especially to represent all groups of women. Some states do well for women as a whole but not for specific groups; California was ranked fourth overall by WalletHub but \u201chas one of the largest pay gaps for Hispanic women\u201d, according to Goss Graves. \u201cThere are about six states where the pay gap for black women, if you look at lifetime earnings, they lose out over $1m,\u201d Goss Graves said. </p> <p>Both Goss Graves and Anderson hope that the frequent highlighting of the pay gap will eventually help make a difference. \u201cWe hope shining more light, putting out more facts, revealing the same thing in a different way, it becomes more and more known and perceived as the problem that it is,\u201d Anderson said.</p>",

  "<p>Talks between the major rugby unions about a global season have stalled, raising fears that there will be no international calendar after the 2019 World Cup outside official tournaments, such as the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship.</p> <p>The major southern hemisphere nations have long argued for a global season which would separate club and international fixtures to synchronise the playing calendar. The New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, has described the current schedule as \u201cbordering on the ludicrous\u201d and detrimental to player welfare, but three years of talks have yielded little.</p> <p>A global season would mean changing the timing of events and ending the June and November international windows when countries fly out at the end of nine-&#xa0;or 10-month seasons. The four home unions are split about starting the Six Nations later in the year \u2013 England and Ireland are opposed while Scotland and Wales, whose chief executives were hired from the business world, are in favour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/22/warren-gatland-lions-coach-new-zealand\">Warren Gatland set to be named as Lions coach for New Zealand tour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the Six Nations remains anchored in the calendar, there will be no global season. New Zealand have said that unless changes are made they will not sign up to a new international fixture schedule after 2019 and will negotiate Test fixtures individually. The current system arranges tours years in advance, allowing countries to plan financially. Among this year\u2019s autumn internationals, Ireland host the All Blacks and Australia in November, while England and Wales welcome the Australians and South Africa, but without a schedule drawn up by World Rugby and signed off by all the countries involved a bidding war would break out and threaten poorer unions\u2019 finances.</p> <p>Countries on tour receive none of the income generated by the matches they are involved in and only have their expenses, such as flights and hotels, paid. New Zealand made little more from this summer\u2019s three-Test tour against Wales than the Welsh Rugby Union bank from one match against the All Blacks in Cardiff.</p> <p>That has led the southern hemisphere nations to propose that income from Tests is pooled and divided equally among the tier one nations. There is little appetite for that in Europe and that attitude has hardened New Zealand\u2019s resolve to go it alone, although Wales and Scotland are open to a debate. The All Blacks, along with Australia and South Africa, believe Europe\u2019s greater financial muscle has allowed clubs, especially in France, to plunder leading players from the southern hemisphere and threaten their game\u2019s income driver, Test rugby.</p> <p>A consequence of no international calendar would mean that Lions tours would have to be negotiated. The current deal between the home unions and New Zealand, Australia and South Africa ends after the 2017 series with the All Blacks, with talks to extend it jammed in the global season debate.</p> <p>More talks are scheduled for the autumn before World Rugby\u2019s council meeting, but clubs have yet to be given a formal role in the negotiations, despite the impact any change would have on their fixtures. Officials at this week\u2019s Guinness Pro12 launch spoke of their frustration and they want to be given a voice, along with Premiership Rugby and the Top 14, to help break the impasse.</p> <p>The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Ian Ritchie, is trying to mediate but his union\u2019s entrenched position on the Six Nations and income distribution has meant he has not got far. Its former chairman Bill Beaumont <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/10/bill-beaumont-world-rugby-global-calendar\" title=\"\">made a global season a priority</a> when he took over as World Rugby\u2019s chairman last month, even saying that the Six Nations had to be flexible, but as time passes with nothing being achieved, the world leaders New Zealand are making plans for a very different future.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Australia centre Kurtley Beale has arrived at Wasps but does not know when he will be fit to make his debut three months after suffering a patella tendon injury.

But while these capture the changing conditions seen in the 20th century, they miss the start of the warming trend.<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot is known about the climate record for the time when we have instrumental records,\u201d said Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University. \u201cWe wanted to look at whether these records give us the full picture.\u201d<br></p> <p>Pooling the data, the scientists found that temperatures in the tropical oceans and in the air above northern hemisphere land-masses began to rise above natural variations in the 1830s, just as greenhouse gas emissions edged upwards.<br></p> <p>The scientists first thought that they were seeing the climate rebound after a period of natural cooling brought on by particles thrown high into the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions. But climate simulations showed that the warming they observed could be explained purely by the small rise in greenhouse gas emissions.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe changes in greenhouse gases in the 19th century were small compared with the fairly rapid changes we see now, so seeing the climate respond this way was a surprise,\u201d said Abrams.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/16/i-brought-the-graph-brian-cox-and-malcolm-roberts-debate-climate-change-on-qa-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5v2a4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2658937\"            data-video-name=\"'I brought the graph': Brian Cox refutes claims of climage change denier on Q&amp;A \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"QandA\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b25278e4b0c23bfed89d72\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/16/160816climateqanada_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/16/160816climateqanada.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/16/160816climateqanada_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/16/i-brought-the-graph-brian-cox-and-malcolm-roberts-debate-climate-change-on-qa-video\">\u2018I brought the graph\u2019: Brian Cox refutes claims of climage change denier on Q&amp;A</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The southern hemisphere, including Australasia and South America, appeared to start heating up 50 years later, near the turn of the century, while no sign of warming on the continental scale was noticed in Antarctica. The lack of appreciable warming in Antarctica may be down to ocean currents carrying warm waters to the north and away from the frigid continent.<br></p> <p>The results are important to build up an accurate baseline of the Earth\u2019s temperature before human activity began to wield an influence on the climate.

  "<p>My wife, Rosie Edwards, who has died suddenly of complications from colitis, aged 62, was a nationally recognised teacher in the field of outdoor learning. She dedicated her professional life to helping children understand the natural world.</p> <p>Born in Shrewton, Wiltshire, to Leslie and Dorothy Williams, both farmworkers, Rosie attended South Wilts grammar school for girls in Salisbury before studying geography at Leeds University. In the late 1970s she was appointed head of geography at Bretton Woods community school, near Peterborough. Her twin passions of working with children and the environment came together when she became first deputy and later head of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-508000-297000/page/10\" title=\"\">Stibbington field studies centre</a> in Cambridgeshire in 1984.</p> <p>Inheriting the rundown Victorian school and a collection of dilapidated prefabs, Rosie spent the next 32 years turning them into a centre of excellence. She inspired staff and volunteers to create an environment where primary school children could learn about and immerse themselves in the world of nature.</p> <p>The centre became so successful that it attracted visits from schools across the east of England and beyond for day and residential courses. It was a welcoming place for children where they could move outside the restraints of the classroom. They enjoyed searching for mini-beasts in the ponds, studying renewable energy and learning about map reading. Rosie even used the antiquated classroom to recreate the experience of Victorian pupils.</p> <p>Both teachers, she and I met in Sheffield at the 1993 annual conference of the <a href=\"http://www.geography.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Geographical Association</a>. I moved from Northern Ireland to live with Rosie in Castor, near Peterborough, and we married in 1999.</p> <p>For eight years Rosie chaired the <a href=\"http://www.nationalrural.org/organisation.aspx?id=195f9d45-42c7-45ee-9955-e5d94ca652b5\" title=\"\">National Association of Field Studies Officers</a> and was instrumental in publishing teachers\u2019 guides on using the environment to assist learning. She somehow found time to edit a community magazine for her local villages and recently developed new skills, singing in St Mary\u2019s church choir in Wansford, where we settled in 2001, and the Peterborough Choral Society.</p> <p>Rosie will be remembered by the thousands of children who experienced the Stibbington centre whom she inspired to care for the world around them.</p> <p>She is survived by me and her brother, Chas.</p>",

It is going towards you and away from you, periodically.\u201d</p> <p>This movement affects the colour of light detected from the star - as it the star moves slightly towards us we see the light as being slightly bluer - as it moves away the light appears a little redder. The frequency of this motion relates to the duration of the planet\u2019s orbit, and hence its distance from the star, while the magnitude of the motion provides information about the planet\u2019s mass.</p> <p>While analysis of data collected before 2016 hinted at the presence of a planet, it took a further intense round of data collection earlier this year before the discovery could be confirmed.<br></p> <p>Taking 11.2 days to travel around Proxima Centauri, the planet orbits at just 5% of the distance separating the Earth and the sun. But, researchers say, the planet is still within the habitable zone of its star because Proxima Centauri is a type of red dwarf known as an M dwarf - a smaller, cooler, dimmer type of star than our yellow dwarf sun.</p> <p>Whether the planet could harbour life, however, is matter of debate. <br></p> <p>Red dwarfs are generally very active stars, emitting powerful solar flares, with Proxima b receiving greater doses of high-energy radiation than reaches Earth from our sun. \u201cBecause they tend to have a lot of these flares and things like that, it makes it very difficult for [planets] to keep an atmosphere - these flares just blow the atmosphere away,\u201d said Don Pollacco, professor of astrophysics at the University of Warwick, who was not involved in the research. But, he adds, Proxima Centauri is only a moderately active red dwarf, potentially making its environment less hostile than other such stars. Whether the star\u2019s activity when it was younger could have stripped Proxima b of an atmosphere remains to be discovered, while it is also unknown if the planet has a magnetic field which could potentially protect it from such radiation.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/aug/24/proxima-centauri-planet-could-tell-us-about-alien-life-in-the-universe-exoplanet-proxima-b\">Proxima Centauri planet could tell us about alien life in the universe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The planet has other characteristics that could affect its potential to host life. <br></p> <p>The research reveals that if the planet\u2019s temperature were down to its sun alone, its surface would be, on average, a chilly -40C. \u201cIt seems cold, but then if you look at the same numbers for Earth you would get minus 20, minus 30C,\u201d says Anglada-Escud\u00e9. \u201cWhat keeps Earth warm is basically that it has an atmosphere and an ocean,\u201d he adds, pointing out that should the newly discovered world also boast an atmosphere, its temperature would likewise be higher.</p> <p>And there\u2019s more. It is very likely that the new world is tidally locked to Proxima Centauri (just as our own moon is to Earth) with only one side of the planet ever catching the star\u2019s rays.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are standing [on the side] looking at the star, you are quite warm,\u201d said Pollacco. \u201cIf you are on the other side it is bloody cold - continual night.\u201d</p> <p>Anglada-Escud\u00e9 is sanguine. If the planet has an atmosphere or an ocean, he says, the redistribution of heat could be possible. \u201cEven if you have tidal lock, you have a lot of circulation - it is like jet streams on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>But Pollacco believes discussion about the habitability of the new planet is somewhat premature, \u201cThese observations tell you nothing about the planet itself, it is important to realise that,\u201d he said, pointing out that there is no evidence that the planet has an atmosphere, or any water.</p> <p>Anglada-Escud\u00e9 admits that there is plenty to be unpicked about the new world. While its mass is thought to be at least 1.3 times that of the Earth, its size, and hence density, is unknown, meaning that scientists can only make an educated guess that it is likely to be rocky based on the types of exoplanets that have previously been detected around other small stars.</p> <p>And there are other mysteries to solve. The planet\u2019s location is also puzzling scientists, who say it is unlikely that the planet formed in its current location given that there would have been little planet-forming material available so close to the star. \u201cWhat we suspect is that the planet forms somewhere else, or the raw materials, the dust or the rocks or the ice, condense somewhere else and then ended up there through some migration process,\u201d said Anglada-Escud\u00e9. He points out that if the planet formed farther away from the star and migrated to its current position, it is likely to be a \u201cwater-world\u201d, whereas if it formed in its current location from dust that migrated, it is likely to be very dry unless water was later delivered to the planet by a comet or other body.</p> <p>While Pollacco describes the new discovery as symbolic, he believes the planet\u2019s potential for hosting life could remain a mystery for many years to come, not least because the chances of seeing the planet pass in front of its star - an observation, known as a transit, that is crucial to unravelling the planet\u2019s size and make-up - are low. </p> <p>Anglada-Escud\u00e9 is rather more optimistic. Even if a transit cannot be seen, he believes other techniques could shed light on the nature of the planet. \u201cThere are reasonable expectations that this planet can be detected with direct imaging within the next 10 years,\u201d he said, adding that it might also be possible to design a space telescope to orbit around the Earth and look at the new world.</p> <p>And with Proxima b just an interstellar stone\u2019s throw away, he believes the new discovery could inspire a wave of creativity in designing approaches for probing the planet further.</p> <p>\u201cJust the discovery, the sense of exploration, of finding something so close, I think it is what makes [it] very exciting,\u201d he said. </p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 August 2016. The planet orbits at 5% of the distance separating the Earth and the sun, not a fifth as an earlier version said. <br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The late Dr John Ugelstad was a hero of Norwegian science. \u201cWhy go to space when you can go to Trondheim,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sintef.no/en/press-room/timeline/1978-tiny-spheres-to-treat-cancer--and-much-more/\" title=\"\">Newsweek</a> crowed on a visit to his labs in the 80s. It had come to photograph him in the company of a few of the millions of tiny particles \u2013 microbeads \u2013 he had invented. Prior to Ugelstad, it had been assumed that the only way to make tiny plastic polymers spherical was to do it in the weightlessness of space \u2013 the ones made on Earth had come out as useless droopy plastic souffl\u00e9s. But Ugelstad had found a way, and the results were revolutionary.</p> <p>In medicine, they allowed the separation of bodily substances to make testing much easier, especially for Aids. And in cancer, his \u201cparamagnetic\u201d (magnetic only in a magnetic field) microbeads allowed new treatments that would pile into bone cancer patients\u2019 bones and \u201cscrub out\u201d the old cancerous cells.</p> <p>In cosmetics, though, his work has recently met with mixed reviews. This week, parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/24/microplastics-ban-in-cosmetics-save-oceans-mps-say-microbeads\" title=\"\">a worldwide ban on cosmetic microbeads</a>, found in everything from facewash to toothpaste to shampoo. And the scientific and political consensus has reached a tipping point. The US instituted a ban late last year, Canada did so in June, while the Dutch were on it back in&#xa0;2014.</p> <p>The evidence on microbeads has existed for almost a decade. A&#xa0;landmark study <a href=\"http://www.lakescientist.com/microplastics-pollution-great-lakes-ecosystem-summary-presentations-iaglr-2014/\" title=\"\">on North America\u2019s Great Lakes in 2012</a> used specially designed nets to drag the surface, finding tiny polymer spheres everywhere.</p> <p>There are 100,000 in the average face wash, and estimates once put the number swirling down US plugholes every day at 808tn. Most end up in the sludge pile at the waste-water plant and are packed off for fertiliser. But 1% remain in solution \u2013 8tn beads a day. These then become snacks for microscopic plankton; soon enough the big fish eat the little ones, the beads start showing up in the stomachs of larger fish, and, in the Great Lakes study, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133015000064\" title=\"\">also in fish-eating birds such as the double-crested cormorant</a>.</p> <p>Ugelstad was about to go down in history alongside the guy who invented asbestos and the bloke who put lead in petrol, but action by corporations seems to be turning the tide. In 2012, Unilever said it would stop using them, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Procter &amp; Gamble have set timetables, while Boots ceased with its own brands in 2014. Some have simply deleted the ingredient (look for \u201cpolyethylene\u201d or \u201cpolypropylene\u201d on the pack). Others have instead turned to ground-up peach-pits, oatmeal or sea salt.</p> <p>Rest assured, if you want to continue to sandpaper excess dermis off your face, to ritually grind your way back through gnarled exoskeleton back to the young you you know must be hiding in there somewhere, you still can.

As you\u2019d expect, I pay for my personal expenses whilst away and only reclaim what is a business expense.</p> <p>My personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the Group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years. This includes the Government shareholding having reduced from over 40% to around 9% with over \u00a316 billion plus dividends having been returned to taxpayers.</p> <p>More broadly I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me. I will continue to strive to meet those standards. Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward.</p> <p>As we look forward, it is your hard work over the last five years returning the Group to financial health that means we are best placed among our peers to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper. We chose to focus on helping the UK economy \u2013 in particular through our support for first time buyers, small businesses and UK corporates \u2013 and as a result by choice, our future is inextricably linked with the future success of the UK economy.</p> <p>The extended period of low interest rates that we now face has created uncertainties for the UK economy and new challenges for the Group. And as a UK focused bank we are not immune to the factors likely to shape the UK economic outlook, but I believe we will be well positioned to meet them.</p> <p>With that in mind please be assured that I am as committed as ever to leading the Group forward to deliver our strategy and to meet our future ambitions. Thank you again for your messages of support over the last few weeks. I have greatly appreciated them.</p> <p>Best wishes</p> <p><strong>Ant\u00f3nio</strong></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed9ce41d0d5b6e535eccaebcae693390fbbbf98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed9ce41d0d5b6e535eccaebcae693390fbbbf98/0_0_1604_843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s memo to staff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T09:19:37.782Z\">at 10.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57bd627de4b0568600c03cc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T09:05:54.754Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief UK economist at <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong>, believes UK house prices will fall in 2016 and 2017 as greater uncertainty surrounding Brexit creeps in.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We suspect that house prices could ease back by around 3% over the latter months of 2016 and there could well be a further 5% drop in 2017.</p> <p>We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. </p> <p>The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bd61ade4b0568600c03cc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T09:01:23.445Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Samuel Tombs</strong>, chief UK economist at <strong>Pantheon Macroeconomics</strong> has a different interpretation of the BBA figures, arguing there are clear signs that Brexit is weighing on consumers\u2019 minds.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>July\u2019s mortgage approvals data bring clear evidence that the Brexit vote has made households reluctant to undertake major financial commitments. </p> <p>Following a 5% month-to-month fall in June, approvals fell a further 5.3% in July, leaving them at their lowest since January 2015 and down 19% year-over-year. </p> <p>The decline in approvals corresponds closely with the drop in RICS\u2019 measure of new buyer enquiries and indicators of consumer confidence, so the slowdown seems demand led. </p> <p>Housing transactions, which only edged down in July, have yet to register the full adverse impact of the Brexit vote.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bd5e29e4b048662988f9af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T08:57:53.237Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The BBA\u2019s July data are the first set of borrowing figures since the Brexit vote on 23 June.</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca Harding</strong>, <strong>BBA</strong> chief economist, says despite the drop in mortgage approvals the figures overall suggest the impact of the vote has had little negative impact so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"33587abe49153a1a0aed5da7d3d6342b8fce4272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33587abe49153a1a0aed5da7d3d6342b8fce4272/0_0_3068_2277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with shopping bags\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A breakdown of the numbers reinforces the picture that <strong>consumers</strong> have so far shrugged off Brexit uncertainty. <strong>Consumer credit was 6% higher </strong>in July than a year earlier, reflecting strong retail sales and - in the case of personal loans and overdrafts - low interest rates.</p> <p><strong>Borrowing by companies meanwhile increased by \u00a32.3bn</strong> in July after a small fall in June.</p> <p>Harding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The data does not currently suggest borrowing patterns have been significantly affected by the Brexit vote, but it is still early days.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/24/sir-martin-sorrell-media-brexit-wpp-eu-referendum-itv\">Sorrell was firmly in the remain camp in the run-up to the 23 June referendum </a>and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would be a long and uncertain process.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It\u2019s very early days. What we did see from April to June was caution in front of the vote. What we saw after the vote in July was the UK perking up a bit. But that begs the question as to what the UK would have done in the absence of a Brexit vote or if the vote had gone the other way.</p> <p>We still worry. Business wants certainty. The government wants the best negotiating position with the EU and the two are actually in conflict. We would like a quick clean solution from a business point of view but the government needs a little bit of scope and time for negotiation.

  "<h2>FEET FIRST</h2> <p>The Fiver has mixed memories of playing rush goalie as a youth in the playground. On the one hand there was the joy of lobbing or just passing the ball into an empty goal vacated by an instinctive goalhanger who resented being shunted into the keeper\u2019s role and took every opportunity to charge forward; on the other the pain of trying to be flash oneself and taking every opportunity to charge forward, being dispossessed, conceding and then being berated by all the cool kids for the rest of playtime. Or perhaps just being told to stay put and hurl it forward into the mixer for the big spoilt bullying kid up front to push others out of the way and score. It was probably his ball anyway, and thus he had the right to pick it up and go home any time he was displeased with others\u2019 efforts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2016/aug/23/premier-league-transfer-window-summer-2016-interactive\">Premier League: transfer window summer 2016 \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps Joe Hart is haunted by flashbacks of similar episodes \u2013 those entreaties to play the ball out with his feet, be adventurous and imaginative leaving the Manchester City and England keeper fretting and fearful of spending the rest of his week being flicked on the back of the ear, having chewing gum stuck to his seat and being generally taunted by merciless classmates. Which is maybe why Pep Guardiola\u2019s sophisticated demands that he play the ball out more \u2013 and play more like a false one, if you will \u2013 gives poor Joe The Fear.</p> <p>In any case, Pep has teased that Hart may well get a chance to Make A Statement tonight by getting a run-out amid the unique, white-hot-pressure-cooker atmosphere that can only come with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/steaua-bucharest-manchester-city-champions-league-play-off-match-report\">being 5-0 up</a> going into a Big Cup play-off second leg at home against a team with one trazillionth of its financial and playing resources. Yep, City face Steaua Bucharest \u2013 who unlike them have actually won Big Cup, back in the days when such things were plausible and permissible \u2013 with little to concern them after last week\u2019s away shellacking of the Romanian side. So Pep has hinted that Joe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/joe-hart-stay-manchester-city-guardiola-england\">might get a go between the sticks tonight</a>, having been frozen out of the campaign thus far. The pair were even seen having a conversation in training yesterday, such is the open-minded mood. \u201cI have an excellent relationship with Joe. We are clear \u2013 him with me, I with him,\u201d Guardiola roared.</p> <p>Given that every day in the past fortnight or so has brought further Claudio Bravo-related news and more strong signals to the England goalkeeper that he might as well be presented with a carriage clock, a painting of a spitfire and a gold-embossed chain bearing the engraved message \u201cDo One\u201d, The Fiver is tempted to muse that Hart might as well play tonight\u2019s match under rush goalie rules and try to dazzle everyone with whatever fancy footwork he can summon. John Stones can always dash back if things get a bit dicey, and what could possibly go wrong there? Hart can at least send a message to the rest of Europe, or at least Everton\u2019s bean counters, that he can indeed thrive in Pep\u2019s 0-2-1-0-2-2-0-2-1 system. </p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Paul Doyle for MBM coverage of Manchester City 4-0 Steaua Bucharest (9-0 agg) </a>to see if Pep and co can make it through to the Big Cup group stage draw tomorrow. </p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cNo, if they do I\u2019ll do BT naked.\u201d After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/gary-lineker-presents-match-of-the-day-in-his-underpants\">Gary Lineker\u2019s antics</a>, Robbie Savage makes a promise that you know he is all too keen to keep <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieSavage8/status/768355031364009984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">after being asked on Twitter</a> if Hull City can win the Premier League.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10bfc892f3105ea884b63a297f905ae19b9713ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10bfc892f3105ea884b63a297f905ae19b9713ec/162_30_1850_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robbie Savage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cI\u2019m a football pundit first, waxwork second.

The government\u2019s latest target and full membership of the committee was set to be announced shortly, Downing Street said.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cIn line with the approach of the last government, there will be a cabinet sub-committee to consider airport capacity in the south-east. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/heathrow-third-runway-higher-air-fares-airports-commission\">Third Heathrow runway would push up air fares, say campaigners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis will be chaired by the prime minister. We will publish full details of all cabinet committees, implementation taskforces and their membership in due course.\u201d </p> <p>The prime minister was returning for her first full day back at work on Wednesday after a walking holiday in the Swiss Alps. Several cabinet ministers including the prime minister are in a predicament because Heathrow expansion could adversely affect their constituencies.</p> <p>May\u2019s Maidenhead constituency is under the night flight route and she was not a member of the influential committee as home secretary under David Cameron. In July, it was reported that a deleted web archive from the late 2000s revealed May had been a strong critic of airport expansion in west London, saying her constituents faced the \u201cprospect of a reduction in their quality of life with more planes flying overhead\u201d.</p> <p>Cameron also took personal charge of the committee, and was accused of \u201clocking out\u201d more anti-Heathrow cabinet members such as the then international development secretary, Justine Greening. </p> <p>Greening, now education secretary after May promoted her, is one of the most vocal critics of Heathrow expansion. She is the MP for Putney, Roehampton and Southfields.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to expand Heathrow is like trying to build an eight-bedroom mansion on the site of a terraced house,\u201d she told the Telegraph. \u201cIt is a hub airport that is just simply in the wrong place.\u201d</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, also opposed the third runway as London mayor, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said last year that he was in favour of expanding Gatwick instead. \u201cLondon\u2019s role as an international air transport hub can be maintained without additional runways at Heathrow,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/14/heathrow-airport-expansion-in-doubt-after-theresa-may-promotes-c/\">he said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA second runway at Gatwick, plus enhanced transport links between the airports and better transport links to London will create a \u2018virtual\u2019 hub airport, maintaining Heathrow\u2019s role in the local economy without expanding it.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the committee under Cameron included the then chancellor, George Osborne, who has since returned to the backbenches, as well as Amber Rudd, now home secretary, and the former environment minister Liz Truss, who is now lord chancellor and Patrick McLoughlin, who was transport secretary but is now chairman of the Conservative party. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heathrow-third-runway-recommended-in-davies-report-on-airport-capacity\">Davies commission</a> into airport expansion in the south-east concluded last year that a third runway at Heathrow was the best of three shortlisted options, which also included extending an existing Heathrow runway and building a new one at Gatwick. In December, the government <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/11/heathrow-expansion-verdict-could-be-delayed-beyond-summer\">postponed a final decision</a> pending new analysis of the environmental impacts.</p> <p>After the report\u2019s publication, the government postponed its decision to October 2015, then again to June this year. After the EU referendum result and Cameron\u2019s resignation, McLoughlin said the decision would have to be made by the new prime minister. </p> <p>Last month, 36 Conservative MPs led by the former party chairman Grant Shapps, wrote to May to demand a decision on Heathrow, saying it was \u201ca matter of extreme urgency\u201d.</p>",

At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>What is different is that Trump gushes conspiracy theories like a fire hose. He was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/donald-trump-birther-obama.html\">one of the most vocal birthers</a>, those who claimed Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim and thus ineligible to hold office (that was untrue). Trump later <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/06/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-hillary-clinton-started-the-birther-movement/\">claimed</a> that Clinton started the birther movement, not he. He t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">weeted</a>: \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3uAp2ep3w\">said</a> \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks, implying they were Muslims. He <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/\">tweeted an allegation</a> that 81% of white homicide victims are killed by blacks. And he <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/09/16/donald_trump_suggested_vaccines_cause_autism_during_the_cnn_gop_debate_he.html\">suggested</a> that vaccines cause autism. The list goes on. None of these assertions are true.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if Trump is reading from a textbook on how to invent and disseminate conspiracy theories. First, target those who feel most alienated and disempowered. Then, identify a complex social or political threat to control, which might include stagnant wages, demographic changes or terrorism. Next, identify an outsider group such as China, Latino immigrants, blacks or Muslims who you can blame. Then tell a simple, black-and-white story of conflict between good versus evil, us versus the other. Finally, say the system is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">rigged</a>\u201d by the mainstream media or the elite.</p> <p>Trump is riding a rising tide of alienation and disempowerment, most notably among working class white men. They\u2019re his strongest supporters because uncertainty, anxiety and powerlessness <a href=\"http://www.michaelshermer.com/the-believing-brain/\">drive the need to reassert control</a>. It\u2019s also perhaps why those with a more <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/01/27/donald-trump-is-attracting-authoritarian-primary-voters-and-it-may-help-him-to-gain-the-nomination/\">authoritarian</a> bent tend to favor Trump.</p> <p>Trump shares a certain worldview with his supporters, but he\u2019s also a brilliant psychologist. It should come as no surprise that he \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpdt7omPoa0\">loves the poorly educated</a>\u201d. They\u2019re most likely to buy into his conspiracy theories, and not because they\u2019re stupid. Researchers have found that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12084/abstract\">having less education</a> \u2013 not sex, race, ideology or knowledge \u2013 is the most reliable predictor of whether someone will believe a conspiracy theory. Education not only arms us with facts but also teaches us how to think <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265608142_Analytic_thinking_reduces_belief_in_conspiracy_theories\">analytically</a> (methodically and scientifically) not just intuitively (from the gut).</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p>",
  "<p>The gap between Scotland\u2019s public spending and tax revenues has widened, with the crash in global oil prices leading to a deficit of nearly \u00a315bn.</p> <p>The latest official data shows that Scotland\u2019s structural deficit was more than twice that of the UK last year, after its share of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/07/north-sea-oil-rigs-could-be-scrapped-in-10-years\">North Sea oil tax revenues collapsed</a>, falling from \u00a31.8bn in the previous year to \u00a360m. </p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/08/2132\">government expenditure and revenue Scotland (Gers) figures</a> show that in 2015-16, Scottish tax receipts were \u00a3400 less than the UK average, at \u00a310,000, after several decades during which oil had pushed them above the UK level.</p> <p>The Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a31,200 a head more on public services in Scotland, and on Scotland\u2019s share of UK and overseas spending, while overall tax receipts fell by \u00a3400 a head. </p> <p>Compared with spending at UK level, that led to a gulf of \u00a31,600 a head between what was raised in taxes and spent in Scotland. Overall government spending as a share of the economy increased again to reach nearly 44% of Scotland\u2019s GDP, compared with 40% at UK level.</p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said the figures were very difficult and the plunge in oil prices meant that Scotland had \u201csuffered an economic shock, which has impact on our fiscal position\u201d.</p> <p>The Gers data presented a challenging picture for Scotland, she said, adding: \u201cIt is a challenge we have had for some time now \u2013 how to grow and diversify our onshore economy.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Senior economists warned that a budget deficit of this scale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/24/ifs-scotland-debts-three-times-greater-uk\">made Scottish independence effectively unaffordable</a>, unless Sturgeon made very tough choices on spending cuts or tax rises. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.strath.ac.uk/business/economics/fraserofallanderinstitute/\">The Fraser of Allander Institute</a>, an economics thinktank at Strathclyde University, directly challenged Sturgeon\u2019s statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe route to closing the deficit is fundamentally on the revenue growth side\u201d.</p> <p>Closing a 21% structural deficit would need rates of economic growth for Scotland not seen in current lifetimes, the FAI said. As Sturgeon had pointed out on Tuesday, the Brexit vote was likely to make those efforts even more difficult. </p> <p>\u201cIt is simply not possible to operate under independence with a deficit at this scale \u2013 full stop,\u201d the FAI said. \u201cThe Scottish government needs to set out the tough choices that it would make alongside a detailed and comprehensive plan for how it would manage the public finances under independence. This won\u2019t be easy, but is essential.\u201d</p> <p>The data put Scotland\u2019s net fiscal deficit last year at \u00a314.8bn, including North Sea receipts, \u00a3522m higher than the previous year. That was equivalent to 9.5% of Scotland\u2019s GDP. The UK\u2019s estimated deficit for the same period was 4% of GDP.</p> <p>Asked how an independent Scotland could meet the EU\u2019s requirements for an <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm\">annual spending deficit to be lower than 3%</a>, Sturgeon said independence would change Scotland\u2019s overall financial position. \u201cI accept Scotland faces, whatever our constitutional arrangements, a very challenging fiscal position, [but] the fundamentals of our economy are strong,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s tax revenues were estimated at \u00a353.7bn, but the Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a368.6bn on public services in Scotland, and on Scotland\u2019s share of UK and overseas spending.</p> <p>Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the figures \u201cshould act as a reality check for those calling for another independence referendum\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cDuring the independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon personally promised a second oil boom. Her own government\u2019s figures show she misled people and that is unforgivable,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThe SNP\u2019s own figures confirm independence would mean severe cuts over and above those already being imposed by the Tories, at exactly the time when our public services need more investment.\u201d</p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said: \u201cScotland weathered a dramatic slump in oil revenues last year because we are part of a United Kingdom that has at its heart a system for pooling and sharing resources across the country as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact public spending was \u00a31,200 per head higher in Scotland than the UK as a whole also demonstrates that the United Kingdom, not the European Union, is the vital union for Scotland\u2019s prosperity.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon denied that this meant the country was being subsidised by the rest of the UK, saying Scotland had paid in a higher rate of tax revenues than the UK on average in recent decades. </p> <p>That position ignores the far higher levels of public spending in Scotland, which needed in effect an injection of \u00a315bn last year from the UK treasury. </p> <p>Sturgeon denied that closing the gap would require spending cuts or tax rises. \u201cWhat I say is growing revenue is the priority. Public spending in Scotland is higher than the rest of the UK for some very good and in many respects unavoidable reasons, such as its rurality. It costs more to deliver health services to island communities,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sturgeon insisted that the data offered cause for some optimism. It showed that taxes from the onshore economy, excluding North Sea revenues, had grown by \u00a31.9bn. At 36.5% of Scotland\u2019s GDP, this was the best figure since the financial crisis and more than offset the \u00a31.7bn lost from the decline in oil and gas taxes.</p> <p>But she said the overall figures underlined her anxieties about the damage that leaving the EU could do to the Scottish economy. \u201cLeaving the EU will leave the task of growing the onshore economy so much harder than it might be,\u201d Sturgeon said.</p> <p>Prof John McLaren, an independent economist at Scottish Trends, said future oil revenues were never likely to recover enough to significantly cut the deficit. A doubling of current oil prices to $100 a barrel would still only raise oil receipts to \u00a32.8bn. </p> <p>McLaren said Scotland\u2019s worse position compared with the UK was likely to continue for the next five years, the direct reverse of claims made in Alex Salmond\u2019s white paper on independence in 2013 that Scotland\u2019s tax revenues and finances would remain stronger than the UK\u2019s. </p> <p>\u201cScotland\u2019s fiscal position relative to the UK can be forecast with greater certainty and is likely to remain at around the current level \u2013 about 5.5% of GDP worse off than the UK\u2019s,\u201d McLaren predicted. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 August 2016 to correct a root/route homophone.</p>",

The stars and bars have shown up on supporters\u2019 T-shirts, on hats sold by vendors outside in the parking lot, or waved during the rallies. </p> <p>All of which is doubly problematic in Mississippi. It\u2019s the only state in the country that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/17/mississippi-state-flag-confederate-symbol\">reproduces the confederate flag on its official state flag</a>, still waving over the capitol on High Street despite numerous protests. All politics in Mississippi unfolds in the shadow of the state\u2019s fraught race relations; it\u2019s a fragile and poverty-stricken place, in recovery at best. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s support among black voters has polled <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-african-american-vote-227218\">as low as 0%</a>. The last time he visited Mississippi, a pastor stood on the statehouse steps and addressed a crowd of black protesters, calling Trump one of the \u201cDukes of Hazzard\u201d, a reference to the television characters who sported a confederate battle flag on their muscle car.</p> <p>Mississippi has a higher percentage of black residents than any other state, at almost 40%. Trump\u2019s audience will be almost entirely white, though. The reason may be as obvious as Trump\u2019s campaign slogan itself: \u201cmake America great again\u201d. For black people in Mississippi, the golden era that sentiment harkens to was a time of strife, oppression and violence.</p> <p>A better move for Trump, Barbour said, would be to meet with black small-business owners while he\u2019s in Mississippi. \u201cWe have lots of great opportunities here,\u201d Barbour said. That is, Trump\u2019s support has nowhere to go but up, if he\u2019s willing to reach out beyond his base.</p> <p>But Barbour\u2019s Democratic counterpart, Bobby Moak, chuckled at the thought. \u201cNo, no, no, there\u2019s been no talk of that,\u201d he said. Moak was the longtime chair of the House Democratic caucus until earlier this year. \u201cThe rally here is something of an afterthought.\u201d</p> <p>The true reason to visit Mississippi, Moak said, is funding. \u201cOur governor told Trump he could raise a lot of money,\u201d Moak said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p> <p>Mississippi is a small state, Moak said, but the population only has one candidate to give its money to: Trump. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s at least seven figures,\u201d Moak said. \u201cOtherwise he wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new about candidates dipping into friendly states to pick up campaign funds. This summer, Hillary Clinton has spent time in California and north-eastern states, raising money in places where she enjoys a comfortable lead. </p> <p>But unlike Clinton, Trump supports his campaign with a self-described <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280239-trump-claims-net-worth-of-more-than-10-billion-in-new\">$10bn fortune</a>, his campaign has been tumbling in polls for weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">he has</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey-lewandowski-out\">reshuffled his staff</a> including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">his campaign chair</a>. More specifically, Clinton has used her blue-state visits to drum up money which she then spends in other states. But Trump is spending money as he goes: renting out the 10,000-seat <a href=\"https://www.mdac.ms.gov/bureaus-departments/state-fair-commission/mississippi-coliseum/\">Mississippi coliseum</a> for the rally, for instance.</p> <p>\u201cI think he got some pushback from Republicans here who can\u2019t afford the $1,000 dinner,\u201d Moak said. \u201cThey said: \u2018If he\u2019s coming here, we want to see the Donald.\u2019 So he\u2019s putting on the rally.\u201d</p> <p>There are other costs. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9 \">jet alone</a> burns through $10,000 an hour, adding up to nearly a half-million dollars just in July. All of which means that either Moak\u2019s estimate may be well below the mark, or Trump is managing his campaign funds in a way Barbour, the Republican, called \u201cunconventional\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him do the traditional, raise money in Texas then quickly turn around and use it at a rally in Colorado. Or raise money here in Mississippi then jump over to the Florida panhandle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not interested in the way Reagan did things, or Romney did things.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/anthrax-outbreak-1.3707132\">an outbreak of anthrax</a> in northern Russia caused the death of a 12-year-old boy and his grandmother and put 90 people in the hospital. These deadly spores \u2013 which had not been seen in the Arctic since 1941 \u2013 also spread to 2,300 caribou. Russian troops <a href=\"https://psmag.com/for-climate-scientists-the-siberian-anthrax-outbreak-is-a-sign-of-whats-to-come-5b73e88cdf12#.chfv7nu4y\">trained in biological warfare</a> were dispatched to the Yamalo-Nenets region to evacuate hundreds of the indigenous, nomadic people and quarantine the disease.<br></p> <p>Americans are likely to associate anthrax with the mysterious white powder that was mailed to news media and US Senate offices in the weeks following 11 September 2001. The bacteria \u2013 usually sequestered in biological weapons labs \u2013 killed five people and infected 17 others in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/19/AR2010021902369.html\">most devastating bioterrorism attack</a> in US history. </p> <p>But in Russia, the spread of illness was not the result of bioterrorism; it was a result of global warming. Record-high temperatures melted Arctic permafrost and released deadly anthrax spores from a thawing carcass of a caribou that had been infected 75 years ago and had stayed frozen in limbo until now. This all suggests that it may not be easy to predict which populations will be most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. </p> <p>In 2013, the National Academy of Sciences hosted a forum on the influence of global environmental change on infectious diseases. In his <a href=\"http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/PublicHealth/MicrobialThreats/2013-SEP-24/September2013Presentations/12Patz.pdf\">keynote speech</a>, Dr Jonathan Patz stood in front of a large slide of a mosquito and warned: \u201cGlobal warming\u2019s greatest threat may also be the smallest.\u201d The forum focused on many causes of disease, from fungi, bacteria, viruses and mold spores, to vectors like bats and mosquitoes. Climate change can exacerbate the spread of infectious disease by changing the behavior, lifespans and regions of diseases and their carriers.</p> <p>This can sometimes be hard to prove directly. It can be challenging, for example, to isolate the avenues by which climate change drives emerging infections in warm climates where travel, trade, land use and dense urban living can all lead to the spread of disease. At other times, the signal is bright. Looking way up north in the Arctic \u2013 where there are far fewer people, less travel and trade, and fewer infectious diseases \u2013 the signal that climate change is a source of disease outbreaks is clear. </p> <p>It is usually so cold in the tundra that the ground is perennially frozen in deep layers that can date back 3m years. But the usual circumstances no longer apply at the top of the world. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. In fact, the area of the anthrax outbreak was <a href=\"http://time.com/4438396/russia-anthrax-siberia-outbreak-infected-spores/\">18F (10C) hotter than average</a>, with temperatures reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/anthrax-outbreak-climate-change-arctic-circle-russia\">95F</a> (35C). In addition to releasing ancient microbes, melting layers of permafrost also release methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide, that in turn causes further warming.</p> <p>It is not just animal carcasses that are thawing. Indigenous groups living in the tundra do not bury their dead deep underground, opting instead for wooden coffins arranged in above-ground cemeteries. This raises the potential for infections to spread from this source as well. </p> <p>Could some of the severe infectious diseases that have threatened the planet in the past be reactivated as our northernmost regions thaw? It\u2019s not just climate scientists that are concerned about the health threats of a warming world. Public health experts and physicians are also speaking out. The Lancet Commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/climate-change-threatens-50-years-of-progress-in-global-health-study-says\">released a report</a> in 2015 asserting that climate change could reverse the last 50 years of public health advances. </p> <p>As risk is added to risk, the signals of our changing climate underscore the urgent need to put climate change solutions in place. Even more than we know, our health may depend on it.</p>",
  "<p>Team GB\u2019s historic success at the Rio Olympics has led to the mandatory swell of national pride. Britain is now a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rio-olympics-2016-britain-declared-sporting-superpower-following-historymaking-games-a3325991.html\" title=\"\">sporting superpower</a>\u201d, according to officials. As inevitable as the outpouring of national pride was the darker side of British imperial pomp being unearthed. Conservative MP Heather Wheeler <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-37163416\" title=\"\">captured this mood perfectly</a> when she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherWheeler/status/767756321219379201\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> \u201cEmpire Goes for Gold\u201d, based on a colonial recount of the medal totals showing the \u201cBritish Empire\u201d ahead of the \u201cRest of World\u201d and of course the \u201cEU (Post Brexit)\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it comes as no surprise that an elected member of parliament should be so offensive, not only to most of the world but to millions of descendants of the empire in Britain. The academic Paul Gilroy diagnosed such ideas as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Postcolonial-Melancholia-Wellek-Library-Lectures/dp/0231134541\" title=\"\">postcolonial melancholia</a>\u201d, the yearning for a time when Britain was great and a leader in the world. Britain\u2019s place on the world stage was built off the back of the empire, and when former colonies gained their freedom, it dented not only the power of the nation, but also its psyche. The loss of the empire heralded the decline of Britain\u2019s prowess and has left British nationalism looking for a symbolic pick-me-up ever since. Olympic success is proving quite the tonic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/conservative-mp-praises-british-empire-for-rio-2016-medal-tally\">Conservative MP praises 'British empire' for Rio 2016 medal tally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then add the backdrop of Brexit. A driving force behind the leave campaign was to \u201ctake the country back\u201d and return to its former glories. With the insistence that we could make trade deals with the Commonwealth, this was an open call to return to the times when Britannia ruled the waves. Ethnic minorities saw through this and <a href=\"http://www.ebony.com/news-views/brexit-black-britain#axzz4I9uv2Xf8\" title=\"\">overwhelmingly voted remain</a>. The wave of imperial nationalism stoked by the leave campaign certainly contributed to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/police-report-fivefold-increase-race-hate-crimes-since-brexit-result\" title=\"\">spate of racial attacks</a> post-referendum, and created the environment for an MP to send out such a vulgar tweet.</p> <p>Colonial nostalgia is not just confined to the Brexiters though. It has become a common feature in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/19/the-best-exotic-nostalgia-boom-why-colonial-style-is-back\" title=\"\">TV, films and even restaurant chains</a>. Gourmet Burger Kitchen sparked outrage with the launch of a <a href=\"http://thetab.com/2016/01/16/gourmet-burger-kitchens-old-colonial-burger-called-racist-69201\" title=\"\">burger called the Old Colonial</a>, sanitising empire by superimposing palm trees in the advertisement. And while hosting a debate on reparations for slavery, the Oxford Union <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/29/oxford-union-accused-of-racism-for-sale-of-colonial-comeback-cocktail\" title=\"\">advertised a cocktail called the Colonial Comeback</a>, alongside a less-than-subtle image of African hands in chains. A London bar recently had to change its name after <a href=\"http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2016/08/plantation-bar-changes-name-following-outcry/\" title=\"\">protests that calling a place The Plantation was offensive</a>. It speaks to the appalling collective ignorance of the horrors committed in British history that the owner, The Breakfast Group, was unaware that a bar specialising in Caribbean rum should try as hard as possible to avoid any connotations of slavery. But I suppose if you remember Britain as the nation that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/01/britain-slavery-myths-david-cameron-jamaica\" title=\"\">abolished slavery</a>\u201d, as David Cameron does, perhaps they thought the name would be a testament to abolition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The British empire was based on the exploitation, murder and devastation of people across the globe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The liberation of the Caribbean from direct British rule has not spared the region from colonial nostalgia. My colleague at Birmingham City University, Karen Wilkes, is about to publish a book, <a href=\"http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137503909\" title=\"\">Whiteness, Weddings, and Tourism in the Caribbean</a>, that explores how the exotic, colonial paradise of the Caribbean is a key selling point for tourism and destination weddings. High-end resorts frequently adopt the name \u201cplantation\u201d to attract customers, apparently blissfully unaware of the sordid history of the islands. The <a href=\"https://www.rosehallresort.com/Weddings/Wedding-Venues\" title=\"\">Hilton Rose Hall Hotel and Spa</a> in Jamaica is somehow proud to advertise itself as \u201conce the site of an 18th-century sugar plantation\u201d. For an additional fee at the hotel you can even get married in the exclusive Rose Hall Plantation House; celebrating your nuptials on the site of the rape, torture and murder of countless enslaved Africans.</p> <p>Key features of \u201cpostcolonial melancholia\u201d are the minimising of the brutal history of the British empire, and the celebration of what Winston Churchill called \u201cits glories and all the services it rendered to mankind\u201d. It is this image of empire that is remembered by the majority of the British public, with a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/07/26/britain-proud-its-empire/\" title=\"\">2014 YouGov poll</a> showing that 59% of respondents thought the British empire was \u201csomething to be proud of\u201d. Almost half of respondents also felt that the countries \u201cwere better off\u201d for having been colonised, presumably because the native savages were grateful for the civilisation brought by the enlightened British. Such results are an indictment of the failure of the British school system to provide even a cursory history of the empire. The defence of the white supremacist and colonial pioneer Cecil Rhodes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/28/cecil-rhodes-statue-will-not-be-removed--oxford-university\" title=\"\">mobilised in response</a> to the Rhodes Must Fall campaign at Oxford University, demonstrates how deeply ingrained these attitudes are in British education.</p> <p>Lest we forget: far from being a benevolent saviour, the British empire was based on the exploitation, murder and devastation of people across the globe. Some notable atrocities include, but are by no means limited to: transatlantic slavery, <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2014/08/bengal-famine-genocide/\" title=\"\">famines in the British Raj</a>, and brutal settler colonial regimes in <a href=\"http://www.thepatriot.co.zw/old_posts/rhodesian-atrocities-from-the-horses-mouth/\" title=\"\">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/britain-maumau-empire-waiting\" title=\"\">Kenya</a>. Hundreds of millions of people died as a result of Britain\u2019s vicious regime. The empire collapsed after campaigns, rebellions and revolutions from the people who were oppressed by Britain. The natives did not happily accept colonial rule; they resisted at every turn because they understood the cost of the system to their nations.</p> <p>Walter Rodney\u2019s classic book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Europe-Underdeveloped-Africa-Walter-Rodney/dp/190638794X\" title=\"\">How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</a>, goes into forensic detail as to how colonialism set back the continent by creating political and economic systems that impoverished Africa, with the direct purpose of enriching Europe. Even after independence, Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of liberated Ghana, explained in the 1960s that the economic policies of the country had an \u201cAlice in Wonderland craziness about them\u201d, with Britain extracting all the wealth from the resources of the nation.</p> <p>It is essential that the legacy of the British empire is understood because it still plays a key role in the world today. The devastation of nations by European colonialism goes a long way to explaining extreme poverty and conflict in many parts of the world, and is continued in manifestly unjust trade relations. Reminiscing about the days of empire and pining for Britain to be great again is a device to avoid any reckoning with Britain\u2019s terrible colonial legacy and debt.</p> <p>Perhaps a recognition of the brutality, violence and horror at the dark heart of empire would shake the nation out of its postcolonial melancholia. To acknowledge the dark side of colonialism, however, would destroy the nostalgia that is such a strong part of British imperial identity. It is far easier to get lost in national pride from Olympic success than to reckon with Britain\u2019s history and real place in the world.</p>",

  "<p>Two years ago, the Minnesota Orchestra emerged from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jan/15/minnesota-orchestra-dispute-over-vanska\">a bitter lockout</a>, during which its music director, Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4, resigned in protest. (He was later rehired.) Now here they all are, touring Europe again, and that plush, super-charged Minnesota sound is back with a new edge of tenacity. They played Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony as if it were a resounding declaration, and V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 took big pride in those classic ringing trumpets, sleek winds and gloriously bottom-heavy strings. The match here has always been thrilling \u2013 the conductor\u2019s dynamism on the podium plus the powerful engine of this band \u2013 and now there seems something irrepressibly triumphant about it. Sibelius\u2019s brooding tone poem Pohjola\u2019s Daughter opened the concert and the surging energy was immense.</p> <p> Also tremendously moving was the performance of Sibelius\u2019s Violin Concerto by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/25/facing-the-music-violinist-pekka-kuusisto\">Pekka Kuusisto</a>. His account was questioning and troubled: the opening phrase unfolded as if in mid-conversation, cadenzas were cracked and exploratory, the slow movement was plain and the finale unruly. Kuusisto made no pretence that the concerto should sound safe \u2013 in fact, he made it sound downright vulnerable, a brave antithesis to the romantic showpiece it often becomes. As an encore, he played a sad Swedish folk tune called We Sold Our Homes, with V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 duetting on clarinet and the orchestra humming the harmonies. He spoke of the lockout and about global homelessness and migration. Here is a classical performer who genuinely connects what goes on inside the concert hall with the world outside \u2013 and that makes him a rare and important performer for our times.</p>",

  "<p>Environmental groups have turned on the Obama administration over offshore oil and gas extraction, warning it puts whales and dolphins in peril and risks undermining the president\u2019s commitment to putting the brakes on climate change.<br></p> <p>Barack Obama, who recently called global warming an \u201cgenuine existential threat\u201d, has enjoyed largely solid support from green groups that have praised his leadership on the issue. But Obama\u2019s environmentalist allies are increasingly frustrated over federally approved fossil fuel drilling, just as the US president attempts to put the finishing touches on his climate legacy. </p> <p>On Wednesday, leases for oil and gas exploration across 23.8m acres of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned off to fossil fuel companies. A total of 218.94m acres, about double the size of California, will have been offered up for leases in federal waters <a href=\"http://www.boem.gov/Five-Year-Program-2012-2017/\">by the end of next year</a>, with further leasing planned by the government in a new five-year program that <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-next-step-offshore-oil-and-gas-leasing-planning-process\">will extend this process</a>.</p> <p>In response, protesters stormed the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u2019s office in New Orleans on Tuesday, demanding the cancellation of the lease sales because of the link between climate change and the kind of flooding that has devastated large parts of Louisiana. Several protesters were arrested. </p> <p>\u201cWhile climate change affects everyone, communities of color and low-income communities continue to be hit hardest by the lasting impacts of climate disasters,\u201d said Anne Rolfes, founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.</p> <p>\u201cThousands of oil spills, sinking lands and extreme weather creating turmoil for countless people. What more will convince the Obama administration to stop treating the Gulf like a sacrifice zone to fossil fuel interests?\u201d</p> <p>Another green group, the Center for Biological Diversity, is also ramping up its opposition to offshore drilling, <a href=\"http://biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/CriticalGulf_08-2016.pdf\">releasing a report</a> that found that burning all of the fossil fuels in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico would release a staggering 32.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p> <p>The group claimed that expanding drilling in the gulf is contrary to America\u2019s pledge to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">keep global temperatures to 1.5C</a> above pre-industrial times and risks unleashing more extreme weather, drought and sea level rise upon swathes of the US. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t address climate change while expanding drilling the gulf. This report shows that new oil and gas leasing in the gulf would be a carbon bomb that will deepen our climate crisis,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, oceans attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cPresident Obama needs to align his energy and climate policies before leaving office, starting in the gulf.\u201d</p> <p>In March, activists <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/gulf-coast-residents-crash-oil-lease-auction-chanting-shut-it-down-14679758e1ad#.vlk9d8ab0\">disrupted a lease sale in New Orleans</a>, chanting \u201cshut it down\u201d and brandishing banners in front of bidding companies. The action didn\u2019t disrupt the process, however, with BOEM now overseeing around 4,400 active leases in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Conservationists are also fretting over the impact of oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. While the federal government has ruled out any drilling off the eastern seaboard in the immediate future, seismic airgun blasting is still being pursued by companies in waters stretching from Delaware to Florida.</p> <p>Research from Duke University\u2019s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab has been released as <a href=\"https://oceana.widencollective.com/c/zzdkabnk\">animated maps by green group Oceana</a>, showing that bottlenose dolphins, fin, humpback and sperm whales are all present in areas deemed suitable for the airgun testing.</p> <p><strong></strong>A number of <a href=\"http://usa.oceana.org/sites/default/files/75_marine_scientist_letter-_seismic.pdf\">leading marine scientists have warned</a> that airgun testing, where air is fired at the seabed to determine if oil or gas deposits reside there, can be extremely harmful to the ability of whales and dolphins to communicate with each other or find food. The Obama administration has been pressured to end the practice.</p> <p>\u201cThese maps confirm what we\u2019ve long feared, that dolphins and whales along the east coast are at risk from dangerous seismic airgun blasting for oil and gas,\u201d said Claire Douglass, campaign director at Oceana. </p> <p>\u201cHearing that whales and dolphins could be injured is one thing, but seeing the scale of the threat is another. President Obama should stop seismic airgun blasting and protect our coast.\u201d </p> <p>But fossil fuel companies have warned against any winding down of offshore drilling, claiming that it creates jobs and helps the US become less dependent on energy sources from other countries.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are going to continue to drive investment in America, create jobs, and provide affordable energy, we must look to the future,\u201d said said Louis Finkel, executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, which supports a US \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d by drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>This stance has been embraced by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has an <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/an-america-first-energy-plan\">\u201cAmerica first\u201d energy policy</a> that would drastically ramp up domestic coal, oil and gas production. His rival Hillary Clinton has promised a <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/\">swift transition to clean energy sources</a> but has come under fire from progressives for her ties to the oil and gas industry and for leaving the door open to fracking.</p>",

Ever since publication, it has shown up on lists of great books about modern cities \u2013 even those drawn up by people who consider Los Angeles anything but a great American city.</p> <p>Somehow, this book that drew so much of its initial publicity with shock value (\u201cIn Praise (!) of Los Angeles\u201d, sneered the New York Times review\u2019s headline) has kept its relevance through the decades, such that newly arrived Angelenos still read it to orient themselves. But what can it teach us about the Los Angeles of today?</p> <p>An architectural historian a decade into his career when he first visited, Banham knew full-well that his fellow intellectuals hated Los Angeles. How and why he himself came so avidly to appreciate it constitutes the core question of his work on the city, which culminated in this slim volume.</p> <p>The \u201cmany who were ready to cast doubt on the worth of the enterprise\u201d, he reflected in its final chapter, included a \u201cdistinguished Italian architect and his wife who, on discovering that I was writing this book, doubted that anyone who cared for architecture could lower himself to such a project and walked away without a word further.\u201d</p> <p>The project began when Banham \u201cbrought his shaggy beard and wonky teeth to Los Angeles and declared that he loved the city with a passion\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-caw-paperback-writers21-2009jun21-story.html\">in the words of</a> novelist and Bradford-born Los Angeles expat Richard Rayner. Teaching at the University of Southern California, who put him up in the Greene brothers\u2019 architecturally worshipped Gamble House in Pasadena, \u201cBanham had a privileged base from which to explore. But what he went looking for, and the way he wrote about what he saw and felt, redefined the way the intellectual world \u2013 and then the wider world \u2013 perceived the city.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1305803b15cd7af08ab8ec30368052b517810486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1305803b15cd7af08ab8ec30368052b517810486/71_47_4267_3224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reyner Banham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"756\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reyner Banham with his \u2018shaggy beard and wonky teeth\u2019 in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Johns/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that he declared his love right there on the tarmac at LAX. \u201cBanham initially found the city \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 \u2013 a response shared by many critics,\u201d wrote Nigel Whiteley in the study Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future. </p> <p>Banham first attempted to publicly explain this cutting-edge metropolis, saturated across its enormous space with electronic devices, synthetic chemicals and televisions, in <a href=\"http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b74bdc19c00847ef921b82968a948ece\">four 1968 BBC radio talks</a>. He told of how he came to grips with LA\u2019s embodiment of the experimental: its experimental shape and infrastructure, the combinations of cultures it accommodated, and the experimental lifestyles to which it gave rise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Los Angeles offers radical alternatives to almost every urban concept in unquestioned currency.</p> <footer> <cite>Reyner Banham</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But even an appreciator like Banham had his qualms with the result. \u201cIn Los Angeles you tend to go to a particular place to do a particular thing, to another to do another thing, and finally a long way back to your home, and you\u2019ve done 100 miles in the day,\u201d he complained in the third talk. \u201cThe distances and the reliance on mechanical transportation leave no room for accident \u2013 even for happy accidents. You plan the day in advance, programme your activities, and forgo those random encounters with friends and strangers that are traditionally one of the rewards of city life.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, to Banham this un-city-like city held out a promise: \u201cThe unique value of Los Angeles \u2013 what excites, intrigues and sometimes repels me \u2013 is that it offers radical alternatives to almost every urban concept in unquestioned currency.\u201d</p> <p>In his subsequent landmark book, Banham enumerated Los Angeles\u2019 departures from traditional urbanism, as well as from \u201call the rules for \u2018civilised living\u2019 as they have been understood by the pundits of modernity\u201d, with evident delight. It seemed to legitimise a model he had already, in a 1959 article, proposed to replace the old conception of a single dense core surrounded by a wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4127e4e16b896a77922b17d2c6500ab3a4129ccf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4127e4e16b896a77922b17d2c6500ab3a4129ccf/158_991_7346_4409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of suburban Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Civilised living\u2019 in suburban LA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Southern California/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banham foresaw \u201cthe city as scrambled egg\u201d, its shell broken open, its business yolk mixed with its domestic white, and everything spread across the landscape, its evenness disturbed only by occasional \u201cspecialised sub-centres\u201d. A visitor to Los Angeles today might hear the city explained in just the same way: as a network of nodes, a constellation of urban villages, an exercise in postmodern polycentrism.</p> <p>Banham put another finger in the eye of traditionalists who insisted that a city should have just one strong centre with his short chapter A Note on Downtown, which opens with the words, \u201c... because that is all downtown Los Angeles deserves.\u201d</p> <p>From its fetishised structures such as the Bradbury Building and Cathedral of Saint Vibiana to its brand new office towers \u201cin their standard livery of dark glass and steel\u201d, Banham wrote that everything \u201cstands as an unintegrated fragment in a downtown scene that began to disintegrate long ago \u2013 out of sheer irrelevance, as far as one can see.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s contrarianism reflects the contrarianism of Los Angeles itself, which, insofar as it \u201cperforms the functions of a great city, in terms of size, cosmopolitan style, creative energy, international influence, distinctive way of life, and corporate personality [proves that] all the most admired theorists of the present century, from the Futurists and Le Corbusier to Jane Jacobs and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, have been wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Filled with photographs and diagrams, Banham\u2019s book on Los Angeles divides its subject up into the four \u201cecologies\u201d of its subtitle: the beaches and beach towns of Surfurbia; the Foothills with their ever more elaborate and expensive residences; the utilitarian Plains of Id (\u201cthe only parts of Los Angeles flat enough and boring enough to compare with the cities of the Middle West\u201d) and the famous, then infamous, freeway system he dubbed Autopia: a \u201csingle comprehensible place, a coherent state of mind\u201d in which Angelenos \u201cspend the two calmest and most rewarding hours of their daily lives\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1e892d692089f82dd7e15b3e1b7f3f2c94c176d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1e892d692089f82dd7e15b3e1b7f3f2c94c176d/0_131_5097_3057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1893 Bradbury Building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1893 Bradbury Building in downtown LA was an \u2018unintegrated fragment\u2019 in Banham\u2019s eyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele and Tom Grimm/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between chapters on the city\u2019s ecologies, Banham examined the buildings found in them. Populist, stylistically promiscuous, tradition-agnostic and often deliberately impermanent, Los Angeles\u2019 architecture has, of all the city\u2019s elements, drawn distain the longest. \u201cThere is no reward for aesthetic virtue here, no punishment for aesthetic crime; nothing but a vast cosmic indifference,\u201d <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/01/entertainment/la-ca-cain-essay-20120101/2\">wrote the novelist James M. Cain in 1933</a>. </p> <p>More than 40 years later, Banham saw a stylistic bounty of \u201cTacoburger Aztec to Wavy-line Moderne, from Cape Cod to unsupported Jaoul vaults, from Gourmet Mansardic to Polynesian Gabled and even \u2013 in extremity \u2013 Modern Architecture.\u201d</p> <p>He discussed at length the LA building known as the \u201cdingbat\u201d \u2013 a \u201ctwo-storey walk-up apartment-block ... built of wood and stuccoed over\u201d, all identical at the back but cheaply, elaborately, decorated up-front, emblazoned with an aspirational name such as the Capri or the Starlet.</p> <p>In defining dingbats as \u201cthe true symptom of Los Angeles\u2019 urban id, trying to cope with the unprecedented appearance of residential densities too high to be subsumed within the illusions of homestead living,\u201d Banham diagnosed the central and persistent tension, then as now, between wanting to grow outward and needing to grow upward.</p> <p>Banham drew out the meaning of Los Angeles\u2019 ostensibly disposable buildings not by venerating them, nor denigrating them, but simply by seeing them as they were. Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour would advocate the same approach in their own urban classic, Learning from Las Vegas, published the following year: \u201cWithholding judgment may be used as a tool to make later judgment more sensitive. This is a way of learning from everything.\u201d</p> <p>Still, even appreciators of Los Angeles might take issue with this method when Banham\u2019s non-judgmental attitude \u2013 at least toward the aesthetics of American commercial culture \u2013 starts to look like advocacy for bad taste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"418bda7a39b3c8fb19e84c35901c447aa08a6dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/418bda7a39b3c8fb19e84c35901c447aa08a6dc2/0_0_3762_3630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Watts Towers, Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"965\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018self-absorbed and perfected\u2019 Watts Towers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Non-appreciators of Los Angeles certainly did.

In a more humane society where Banham\u2019s doctrines would be measured against the subdividers\u2019 rape of the land and the lead particles in little kids\u2019 lungs, the author might be stood up against a wall and shot.\u201d</p> <p>Uncowed, Banham followed the book by starring in <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/22488225\">Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles</a>, a 1972 television documentary that followed him through one day in the city that \u201cmakes nonsense of history and breaks all the rules\u201d, and inspired within him \u201ca passion that goes beyond sense or reason\u201d.

Ruscha recommended gas stations. </p> <p>Banham pre-empted objections to Los Angeles\u2019 urban form by claiming \u201cthe form matters very little\u201d, having already written that \u201cLos Angeles has no urban form at all in the commonly accepted sense\u201d.

How legible would Banham, who died in 1988, now find it?</p> <p>The smog \u2013 that supposed bane of the city\u2019s postwar decades which he always downplayed \u2013 has all but vanished. The time of \u201capparently unlimited space\u201d to gratify an \u201cobsession with single-family dwellings\u201d has given way to one of construction cranes sprouting to satisfy the new demand for high-density vertical living. They stand not just over a downtown risen miraculously from the dead, but the specialised sub-centres scattered all over greater Los Angeles.</p> <p>Though the ban on private cars hasn\u2019t come yet, no recent development astonishes any Angeleno who was there in the 1970s more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/20/los-angeles-new-expo-line-train-santa-monica-beach\">the city\u2019s new rail transit network</a>, which started to emerge almost 30 years after the end of the <a href=\"http://www.pacificelectric.org/\">Pacific Electric</a>. It ranks as such as a success of funding, planning and implementation (at least by the globally unimpressive American standard) that the rest of the country now looks to Los Angeles as an example of how to build public transportation and, increasingly, public space in general.</p> <p>Readers might scoff at Banham calling the Los Angeles freeway network \u201cone of the greater works of man\u201d \u2013 but he has demonstrated more of an ability to see beyond it than many current observers of Los Angeles. \u201cEven though it is vastly better than any other motorway system of my acquaintance,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is inconceivable to Angelenos that it should not be replaced by an even better system nearer to the perfection they are always seeking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23a5e36d2f740227e3659e6485f8593a27d19e82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23a5e36d2f740227e3659e6485f8593a27d19e82/0_406_6016_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles downtown cityscape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banham felt downtown Los Angeles only deserved a short chapter dedicated to it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banham also foresaw the rise of the self-driving car, so often mooted these days as an alternative solution to Los Angeles\u2019 traffic woes.

Even the humble dingbat has found a place in the future of the city, becoming the object of <a href=\"https://doppelhouse.com/books/dingbat2-0/\">critical study</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/68455/dingbat-2-0-competition-winners\">architectural competition</a>.</p> <p>Banham also saw the future of Los Angeles in other unprepossessing buildings, especially one \u201cstriking and elegantly simple\u201d stucco box on La Cienega Boulevard. Its architect? A certain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/23/frank-gehry-revitalise-los-angeles-la-river\">Frank Gehry</a>, then almost unknown but now one of the most powerful influencers of the built environment in not just Los Angeles (his current high-profile project involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/23/frank-gehry-revitalise-los-angeles-la-river\">re-making the city\u2019s famously dry, concrete-encased river</a>), but other cities as well.

No longer labouring under the delusions of total exceptionalism that prevailed in Banham\u2019s day, it has, with its towers, trains, parks and even bike-share systems, made strides toward the \u201cliveability\u201d so demanded by 21st-century urbanists. It now even resembles (if faintly) New York, Boston, London, and Paris \u2013 those thoroughly planned, non-experimental cities where, Banham lamented, \u201cwarring pressure groups cannot get out of one another\u2019s hair because they are pressed together in a sacred labyrinth of cultural monuments and real estate values\u201d.</p> <p>In its impressive bid to incorporate older metropolitan virtues and play by the rules of good urban design, modern Los Angeles ignores the possibility of becoming a similarly sacred labyrinth at its peril. Keeping Banham\u2019s Los Angeles: the Architecture of Four Ecologies on its syllabus will hopefully protect against the dire fate of losing its rule-breaking experimental urban spirit.</p> <p>The engineering-trained author regarded Los Angeles as a kind of machine. Though it has come in for a badly needed overhaul of its interface in recent years, nobody has yet written a user\u2019s manual more engaged in the city on its own terms as Banham did 45 years ago.</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>",

The paper is the culmination of years of the author\u2019s research and its publication is an important next step. You want to get it right; give constructive feedback, check whether it works for the journal, and generally improve the quality of the article. But how can you achieve those objectives without the right training and support? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/oct/23/peer-review-system-science-research\">Peer review needs to expand so that more scientists are reviewing papers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve been analysing data emerging from our year-long research project on <a href=\"http://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/peer-review-global-view/\">peer review</a>. First we focused on what academics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/oct/28/why-peer-review-needs-a-good-going-over\">would like to see change</a> in the process. Now we\u2019ve examined how new reviewers feel about embarking on reviewing, and it seems clear that many would like significantly more guidance on how to get it right. </p> <p>Alongside issues of transparency, much of the criticism of peer review revolves around the quality of individual reviews \u2013 from the \u201cshort and snitty\u201d (as one researcher put it in a focus group we held) to those that may be biased by the reviewer\u2019s personal views. </p> <p>The majority of reviewers learn on the job, plunged into assessing their peers\u2019 work as a natural progression of their academic career. This will need fixing if everyone\u2019s overall experience of the peer review process is to improve. Here are some of the key findings from our research on the topic: </p> <h2>New academics want to review but don\u2019t know how to start</h2> <p><a href=\"http://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Peer-review-supplement-motivations-and-support.pdf\">Research we conducted</a> with more than 6,300 authors of journal articles, peer reviewers and journal editors revealed that over two-thirds of researchers who have never peer reviewed a paper would like to. Of that group (drawn from the full range of subject areas) more than 60% said they would like the option to attend a workshop or formal training on peer reviewing. At the same time, over two-thirds of journal editors told us that it is difficult to find reviewers.<br></p> <h2>Guidance is not always available</h2> <p>For those who are already reviewing papers, the most common source of support they received was journal editor guidelines. Just under half of respondents \u2013 45% in science, technology and medicine (STM) and 49% in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) \u2013 said they had received these. Guidelines issued by the publisher came second, with 41% of reviewers receiving them in STM, and 35% in HSS. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/27/peer-review-10-tips-research-paper\">Peer review: how to get it right \u2013 10 tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only one in 10 of reviewers had been to a workshop or formal training but 55% of sciences researchers and 51% of humanities and social science researchers said they would like this opportunity. And that is despite the fact that two-thirds of reviewers rated their confidence in reviewing at eight or above out of 10. </p> <h2>What can editors do?</h2> <p>Editors are trying to recruit and retain good reviewers. But views were split as to the best way to achieve this. Some 46% of editors in STM wanted to offer formal training or workshops but 44% said they didn\u2019t want to. In the humanities and social sciences, just 38% wanted to offer this option, with 56% saying they wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>In terms of what help they were offering, they listed (in the following order): offering their own guidelines and advice, signposting to publisher guidelines, encouraging supervisor involvement, and, for a small number, workshops or formal training. </p> <p>From this research, there seems to be a discrepancy between the support those doing the reviewing wish for and what those overseeing the process are prepared to offer. However, the lack of enthusiasm for offering workshops or formal training has made me wonder whether this may have been more popular had we made it explicit in our question that this training could be delivered by someone other than journal editors.</p> <h2>Why researchers want to review</h2> <p>Playing a part as a member of the academic community, reciprocating the benefit, and enjoying being able to help improve papers were the top three motivations for doing a peer review. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jun/08/scientists-arent-superheroes-failure-is-a-valid-result\">Scientists aren't superheroes \u2013 failure is a valid result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also looked at this data across the age groups, expecting to see some differences in this order, particularly for those at the start of their career who might have been more motivated to take the job for career reasons. But, no matter what the age group, playing a part as a member of the academic community scored highest.</p> <p>Understandably, those aged between 20 and 29 gave the highest score compared to other groups in the \u201cenhancing your reputation or furthering your career\u201d category. However, this still came fifth out of the eight possible responses for those in their twenties. And in terms of whether academics should receive payment for doing reviews, those in the youngest age group (20-29) were most in favour, while those who were over 60 were the most resistant. Whether this is due to the financial pressures for those starting out, or a possible shift in attitude towards payment for reviewers, is yet to be seen.</p> <p>With peer review remaining so central to the research process, despite its flaws, understanding the motivations to publish in peer reviewed journals and to review another academic\u2019s work is crucial. Addressing what training is needed is even more important. There\u2019s a clear desire from the academic community to see effective support put in place, so now is the time for action.</p> <p><em></em><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Showsec is in dispute with the GMB over its refusal to sign a union recognition agreement, and talks between the union and the company have broken down.<br></p> <p>Last week, GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, implied in a leaked letter that McCluskey was interfering in the dispute, and said his union would picket the conference were Showsec to win the contract, forcing most Labour MPs and members either to cross a picket line or not attend<br><br>Now McCluskey, in a letter to Roache seen by the Guardian, said it was clear the conference would not go ahead following a GMB boycott.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the responsibility of the general secretary of the Labour party, Iain McNicol, to implement decisions or to deal with any problems that may arise,\u201d McCluskey wrote. \u201cI am astonished that we are only four to five weeks to conference and that he has not done so.</p> <p>\u201cIt is quite evident that in the event of a GMB boycott of conference, it simply won\u2019t proceed and the blame would lay squarely at the feet of Iain McNicol.\u201d</p> <p>In a further sign of the deteriorating relationship between the two unions, McCluskey denied Unite had attempted to interfere in the dispute. Unite has backed the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the leadership election while the GMB supports his rival, Owen Smith.</p> <p>In the letter from Roache to McCluskey, leaked to PoliticsHome last week, the GMB boss said: \u201cAs you know, we are the dominant union in the security sector, and we will not tolerate any attempt by other unions to find a solution by dreaming up an inferior recognition agreement.</p> <p>\u201cIf Showsec do not sign our standard agreement, GMB will be forced to boycott and picket conference and many friends and colleagues will find themselves unable to cross our picket line.\u201d </p> <p>Roache said he hoped McCluskey would either allow urgent discussions with G4S or make it clear he would \u201csupport a Labour party conference staffed by a union-busting firm\u201d.<br></p> <p>In his reply, McCluskey said his union also had an interest in the security sector but denied he had had any contact from the party over the matter.<br></p> <p>\u201cI am somewhat perplexed by the nature and content of your letter as it appears to imply that Unite is somehow responsible for this current shambles and the tone set by your expression \u2018will not tolerate\u2019 other unions setting inferior standards, infers that there is a dispute between Unite and the GMB,\u201d McCluskey wrote.<br><br>\u201cWho are the \u2018other unions\u2019 you are talking about?

More than 100 former and retired members of Labour party staff wrote to the Guardian last week calling for attacks on party staff to cease.<br></p> <p>The letter says despite the long hours, stressful working environment and little job security, party staff \u201cremain completely loyal to the party and to their employers, and the least they are entitled to expect is some loyalty and respect in return \u2026 To hear members of the Labour party attack their own employees is depressing; to hear talk about \u2018clearing them out\u2019 is unacceptable; to hear such statements from the most senior level is intolerable\u201d.<br></p> <p>Corbyn has since written to staff to address their concerns, saying they \u201cmust not be used as a political football by anybody within the party \u2026 I hope you all feel that if you are put in difficult or unacceptable circumstances, you can raise the issue with your line manager, other senior member of staff, or your trade union representatives.\u201d<br></p> <p>Labour has insisted the conference security issue will be resolved, but said it would not comment on commercial matters.</p>",

  "<p>When the Ethiopian Olympic marathon medallist Feyisa Lilesa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/ethiopian-olympic-medallist-feyisa-lilesa-seeks-asylum-after-marathon-protest-oromo-rio\" title=\"\">crossed his arms at the finish line</a>, the world asked what the symbol stood for. Little is known about the historical marginalisation and collective persecution of Lilesa\u2019s people, the Oromo of north-east Africa.</p> <p>Almost all Ethiopian runners come from the Oromia region; but the Ethiopian athletics federation is highly scornful of their Oromo identity. Perhaps the federation\u2019s imperious attitude towards the athletes emanates from its paranoia and mistrust of the people, and fear that one day Oromo athletes might open Ethiopia\u2019s Pandora\u2019s box and spill the beans at an international sports event. Exactly what Lilesa did in Rio - and now he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/medallist-feyisa-lilesa-fails-to-return-to-ethiopia-after-olympics-protest\" title=\"\">has not returned to Ethiopia</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/medallist-feyisa-lilesa-fails-to-return-to-ethiopia-after-olympics-protest\">Medallist Feyisa Lilesa fails to return to Ethiopia after Olympics protest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At risk to his life, and at the sacrifice of his career, Lilesa was determined to express at the Olympics the collective grievances and institutional discrimination his people suffer in the Oromia region. The courageous crossing of his arms is a gesture of solidarity with the Oromo protest symbol that has been used over the last nine months in defiance of the ruling regime. In a short interview, Lelisa told what many believe is the story of the Oromo: the killings, the maimings, arbitrary detentions, profiling, enforced disappearances and economic injustices perpetrated by the Ethiopian government against the Oromo nation.</p> <p>The current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/dozens-shot-dead-in-anti-government-protests-across-ethiopia-says-opposition\" title=\"\">social and political crisis in Ethiopia</a> was triggered by the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/ethiopia-addis-master-plan-abandoned\" title=\"\"> Addis Ababa \u201cmaster plan\u201d</a>, which was perceived by protesters as an attempt to remove the Oromo from the capital city. Even though it later dropped plans for this land grab, the regime claimed that its intention was to develop the city\u2019s business district by further moving into the Oromo territories and neighbouring districts. No prior consultation, discussion or deliberation was had with the Oromo people, the ancestral owners of the land. Some saw this as being part of a grand scheme to ensure the long-term hegemony of the regime\u2019s favoured ethnic group over the rest of the country. The Tigray, the regime\u2019s dominant group, make up only 6% of the country\u2019s population.</p> <p>As Lilesa\u2019s protest drew national attention, the situation in Ethiopia appeared to be deteriorating and having a serious impact on internal stability. It also cast a shadow of political uncertainty over the country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The UN has highlighted how Ethiopian military and police forces systematically targeted certain ethnic groups</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Contemporary experiences teach us that economic and political inequality increases the risk of internal strife. When one ethnic group captures political power and excludes its perceived rivals, ethno-nationalist conflict is likely to increase, potentially descending into civil war. A heterogeneous society such as Ethiopia, where disparities in wealth overlap with ethnic grievances, is a good case study.</p> <p>The scale of the Oromo protest over the last nine months has exposed Ethiopia\u2019s ethnic-coded wealth distribution. According to Oxford University\u2019s 2014 <a href=\"http://www.opride.com/2014/08/13/building-medical-capacity-in-oromia-is-our-fierce-urgency-of-now/\" title=\"\">Multidimensional Poverty Index</a> (MPI), Ethiopia is the second poorest country in the world with about 58% living in acute destitution. Not all Ethiopians have benefited equally from the country\u2019s economic growth.</p> <p>The Oromia region, the nation\u2019s agricultural breadbasket, is also the nation\u2019s second poorest region in the federation. According to the 2014 MPI, about 90% of Oromo live in severe poverty and destitution, more than 80% of Oromo households do not have access to electricity or sanitation and more than 75% of Oromo do not have access to potable drinking water.

  "<p>The first thing I do as I prepare to go for holiday is panic. \u201cHow will I ever get it all done?\u201d I ask myself. \u201cWhat will happen if this or that doesn\u2019t get follow-up while I\u2019m away?\u201d</p> <p>Then, I try to breathe and remember the advice a mentor once shared: <a href=\"http://www.how-matters.org/2016/02/26/my-struggles-with-self-care/\">taking care of me</a> is the work.</p> <p>Taking time off is not a luxury. It is a necessity in becoming inspired and effective contributors to social change. Our work relationships require us to recommit every day to making them work, with deep listening, patience, humility, and an embrace of paradox. These qualities are hard to come by when I\u2019m stressed and overcome by the tyranny of the to-do list.</p> <p>So I\u2019m sharing five steps I take when it\u2019s time to switch off and revitalise:</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every day I\u2019m away, I commit to doing something that gives me a clear sense of taking care of myself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>1 Make comprehensive handover notes</h2> <p>I start by taking everything that\u2019s in my head and on my to-do list and make a summary for my co-workers. This \u201cstatus update\u201d helps me identify what really needs to get done while I\u2019m away and what can wait for my return. Making handover notes also helps me determine what can be delegated and if, when, and how I can be contacted if questions or emergencies arise. They are also a great way to remind the boss of the responsibilities and projects I\u2019m holding. Ultimately, the handover notes are for me, so that I go on holiday feeling all the loose ends are tied up.</p> <h2>2 Cut off email from your phone</h2> <p>I have a hard and fast no-email rule while on leave. Given that I\u2019m tethered to my phone for social media and the camera, it is just too tempting for me to see what emails have come in. So I make sure those emails are simply not delivered to my phone. How many of them are truly urgent anyway? I\u2019ve learned the hard way to not let the fear of returning to hundreds of emails be stronger than my resolve not to be disturbed by work.</p> <h2>3 Commit to a daily practice</h2> <p>It could be a walk every afternoon, 20 minutes of meditation, reading a beloved book, making breakfast every morning, or calling my grandmother. Every day I\u2019m away, I commit to doing something that gives me a clear sense of taking care of myself or my family. Too many times, during busy work days, I just don\u2019t have the time, or make excuses for why this has to be put off. These things become my first priorities while I am away, and become easier to integrate into my daily life on my return. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d49c1da8c138cc26391157b167d427c7f1114476\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d49c1da8c138cc26391157b167d427c7f1114476/0_79_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Does Theresa May know how to reap the full benefits of her holiday?

Artistic endeavours of any sort are a great way for me to do this. I am a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/24/development-disruptors-poem-jennifer-lentfer\">poet</a> all the time, but exploring new music, making a collage, or taking a storytelling or cooking class reconnects me to my creativity and my passion. I use different parts of my brain from those used to plan and budget and evaluate. Every time, it\u2019s amazing what unexpected \u201ca-ha\u201d moments occur as a result.</p> <h2>5 Take time to reflect on your goals</h2> <p> Thomas Merton wrote: \u201cIt is true that we are called to create a better world. But we are first of all called to a more immediate and exalted task: that of creating our own lives.\u201d Time to take a <a href=\"http://www.how-matters.org/2015/12/31/did-i-2015-reflections/\">careful accounting</a> of what I have experienced in my life, what has shaped it, is often hard to come by on holiday, especially if surrounded by family or friends. But it\u2019s crucial. Our professional goals and achievements are only part of our lives. What should I celebrate? What do I have yet to attain? Am I creating the life I truly want? Am I resisting change, or embracing it?</p> <p>Development work is an emotional and spiritual endeavour, requiring us to not only to use our intellects, but our whole selves. The world needs many more people resolved and fearless enough to work and fight for a better future for us all.</p> <p>So take your days off, and \u201cfill up the well\u201d.

Conversely, areas of southern Brooklyn with high PM2.5 levels peaked in pollution exposure at night as people returned to their neighborhoods after work. Areas of Queens near LaGuardia airport remained elevated throughout the day.</p> <p>Concentrations of PM2.5 also vary throughout the day and affect the identification of hotspots, depending on factors including power generation and traffic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07fb41653a5ab742c74cb19fc0cdcdc9d4f72f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07fb41653a5ab742c74cb19fc0cdcdc9d4f72f29/0_0_13063_7229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exposure Indices Active vs Home Air pollution NYC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cAir pollution is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses but we have previously presumed that people exposed are at home all the time,\u201d said Dr Marguerite Nyhan, lead author and a researcher in environmental health at Harvard University, although all the research was conducted at MIT\u2019s Senseable City Lab.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that\u2019s not a true assessment of exposure as more people are exposed as they go from home to work and when they are socializing. We found that lots of people are being exposed in central Brooklyn and Queens and lower Manhattan, where people work and recreate. </p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not the way cities are typically regulated for air pollution \u2013 they just look at highly polluted areas rather than the amount of time people spend in them.\u201d</p> <p>Disregarding population shifts throughout the day, PM2.5 air pollution in New York is greatest in midtown and downtown Manhattan, parts of the Bronx and areas of Queens and Brooklyn that meet the East River. These areas have PM2.5 levels that are around 14 micrograms per square meter \u2013 higher than the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/\">annual average advised</a> as acceptable by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p> <p>According to WHO, worldwide around <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/\">7 million people a year die</a> as a result of air pollution. The US accounts for around <a href=\"http://lae.mit.edu/air-pollution-causes-200000-early-deaths-each-year-in-the-u-s/\">200,000 of these annual deaths</a>, with most linked to fumes from cars, trucks and other transportation, as well as emissions from power plants. Particles of PM2.5, which are around 30 times smaller than a human hair in width, can worsen asthma and heart disease and are linked to reduced lung function.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/environmental/comm-air-survey-08-14.pdf\">study commissioned by New York City</a> found that annual average PM2.5 levels fell by 16% in the six years to 2014 but warned that air pollutants \u201cremain at levels that can be harmful to public health, particularly among seniors, children and those with pre-existing health conditions\u201d.</p> <p>Asked whether the city considers peoples\u2019 exposure as they move around the metropolis, a spokesman for New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, said: \u201cThe city\u2019s monitoring study is designed to assess outdoor, street-level air pollutant levels across the city. </p> <p>\u201cSo in a sense, the data can be used to assess exposures at residences, places of employment, or parks and other recreation areas. The study is not designed to assess any single exposure setting.\u201d</p> <p>De Blasio has set a goal for New York to have the cleanest air of any US city by 2030, pledging to cut PM2.5 levels by 50% in this timeframe by adding electric vehicles to the city fleet, phasing in clean sources of electricity and making buildings more energy efficient.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/28/kasia-molga-the-human-sensor-making-manchesters-air-pollution-visible\">The 'human sensor' making Manchester's air pollution visible</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nyhan said her research, published in <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/esthag\">Environmental Science &amp; Technology</a>, could be used if New York wanted to go down the path of \u201clow emissions zones\u201d as <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/low-emission-zone\">London has done</a>.

Clearly, it would be slightly obnoxious at this stage to counter by rolling a piece of paper into the old typewriter and bashing out the headline WHAT THE OLYMPICS COULD LEARN FROM THE LOVELY PREMIER LEAGUE. Anyway, I for one enjoy all the lectures from people who like Olympic sports and athletes almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 enough to watch them more than once every four years. But it does make me a little sad that they seem to have missed the times when the Premier League really tried to tack hard toward Olympic disciplines \u2013 for instance, when wannabe biathlete Ashley Cole came off the training pitch at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/27/ashley-cole-chelsea-air-rifle\">Chelsea\u2019s Cobham training ground and shot a work experience student</a>.</p> <p>Comparing the Olympics with football is to compare something with the gestation of a novel to something that happens continuously for 10 months of the year or more. Furthermore, Olympic events are often deemed so <em>recherch\u00e9</em> that the sport itself is merely one moment in a heavily promoted backstory. For this televisual playbook, we owe much to dear old Simon Cowell. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2009/nov/13/simon-cowell-x-factor\">the Karaoke Sauron</a>, of course, who apotheosized the packaged \u201cjourney\u201d of any competitor, and his relentless focus on the backstory has bled across all broadcasting.</p> <p>You can no longer have a lot of sport without it. The training montage frequently seems as important as the event itself. I am not sure the logical destination of all this is anywhere particularly aspirational. Consider NBC, who are so patronisingly obsessed with the idea of context that they didn\u2019t even show Rio\u2019s opening ceremony live. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2016/07/12/nbc-opening-ceremony-olympics-rio-delay-one-hour/87000530/\">They wanted to \u201ccurate\u201d it</a>. As their top sports executive explained: \u201cWe think it\u2019s important that we are able to put [it] in context for the viewer so that it\u2019s not just a flash of colour.\u201d</p> <p>There must and shall be takeout. And yet, I find myself rather against the idea that all of modern life must, in some way, teach us about some other aspect of modern life. When Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld were making Seinfeld, they shied away from this cosy didacticism that had historically characterised so many other American sitcoms. Their mantra was \u201cNo hugging, no learning\u201d, and they were so insistent upon it that they <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q-IuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT248&amp;lpg=PT248&amp;dq=seinfeld+no+hugging+no+learning+jackets&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M90AXT6a6X&amp;sig=jLm1jQr3odHi0JpJFg2O2b45Wok&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_ODkmNfOAhXD1SwKHc7uBi8Q6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=seinfeld%20no%20hugging%20no%20learning%20jackets&amp;f=false\">even had jackets bearing the motto made up for staff</a>.</p> <p>These days, fewer and fewer sporting moments are permitted not to be a learning experience, as though enjoying them purely sportingly, and for their own sake, would be a waste of time or a lesser experience. There must be hugging. There must be learning. Post\u2011event interviewers are always effectively asking the person who has provided the sporting moment what we\u2019ve learned from it. We get the long view while the athlete is still out of breath. And we do that particularly as far as the Olympics is concerned, because the reality is a) the sports are often deeply niche and b) no one is going to be sticking around for the next three years and 49 weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/ryan-lochte-olympic-tale-gold-medals-white-privilege-rio\">Ryan Lochte: an Olympic tale of gold medals and white privilege | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Football is largely immune from this.

Last week (<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/team-gb-threatens-to-sue-leaveeu-over-olympic-video-10540692\">and to the fury of Team GB</a>) it was the turn of British Olympic gold medal winners to be co-opted by people whose idea of a training regime is a full English and some light bigotry. Leave.EU \u2013 the provisional wing of the Brexit campaign \u2013 released a video featuring pictures of all the British Olympic gold medal winners up to that moment, interspersed with text reading \u201cWe\u2019re too small \u2026\u201d and \u201cWe need to be in the EU \u2026\u201d They were being ironic, of course, with all of the gossamer touch we came to expect during the referendum campaign itself. The only sadness was that they hadn\u2019t thought of this a few hours earlier, then they wouldn\u2019t have had to include Mo Farah\u2019s first gold, and their video would have looked exactly the way they seem to like things.</p> <p>I say this advisedly. On the very last morning of the referendum campaign itself, I saw Nigel Farage take to a stage in Westminster for his final address, which began with a Leave.EU film about Britain narrated by his good self.</p> <p>In this, he quavered that Britain was \u201ca country of sporting greatness\u201d. Quite right \u2013 and yet, the only footage used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/leavers-take-control\">illustrate this was of Botham\u2019s Ashes</a>. Botham\u2019s Ashes! I mean really \u2026 what could be more <em>au courant</em> than Botham\u2019s Ashes? I hardly need remind you of the date of that undoubted triumph, but it did seem remarkable that nothing in the intervening three and a half decades of British sporting success was worthy of inclusion instead.</p> <p>Indeed, it made me wonder: what is it about so many of the sporting triumphs of the past 35 years that makes them somehow unsuitable for a Leave.EU video? You might have thought, say, that Super Saturday during the London Games might have provided a moment of total sporting Britishness. Then again, to the likes of Leave.EU, it didn\u2019t seem to.

It became international law in December 2014 and its annual Conference of States Parties brings together all the governments that have joined the treaty to debate its implementation and impact. The treaty brings some much-needed regulation to the $100bn global arms trade. The elephant in the room here is the fact that in Yemen civilians are dying every day because bombs, provided to Saudi Arabia by states sitting around the table, are being dropped on them.</p> <p>Earlier this year, campaign group <a href=\"http://controlarms.org/en/\" title=\"\">Control Arms</a> analysed arms transfers to Saudi Arabia in the context of the Yemen crisis. We found nine parties to the ATT issued licences or carried out arms exports to Saudi Arabia in 2015: France, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/23/british-cluster-bombs-yemen-cameron-killing-civilians-inquiry\" title=\"\">the UK</a>, as well as two signatories, Turkey and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/us-promoting-war-crimes-yemen-saudi-bombing-obama\" title=\"\">the US</a>. These sales and licences totalled more than US$25bn and included bombs, rockets and missiles \u2013 just like those falling on the people of Yemen.</p> <p>Some states, specifically the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, have tightened up their export controls in response to the crisis in Yemen; but several, notably the UK, US and France, are continuing with business as usual, violating the treaty in plain sight. Whether for profit or diplomatic gain, this is appalling hypocrisy. It is also illegal. The UK, in a statement to the conference, confirmed its unerring commitment to the ATT, and chided those who might criticise treaty violators because \u201cthis could deter others joining\u201d. Perhaps not violating the treaty would be a better way to discourage criticism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/saudi-arabia-bombs-yemen-tories-human-rights\">Who\u2019s making sure the Saudi bombs keep falling on Yemen? The Tories | David Wearing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ATT prohibits arms deals where there can be reasonable knowledge the arms will be used in violations of international humanitarian law. Reports from UN experts, human rights groups and news reports of bombings of schools, hospitals and mosques could not make this clearer.</p> <p>The arms trade has operated in the shadows for decades. With the ATT in force, arms deals may not be made covertly any more. Each state must submit an annual report that declares which transfers have been authorised. This week, states will also decide whether these reports should be made public or stay secret. There should be no question about this. They shouldn\u2019t even be given a choice. Reports must be made publicly available.</p> <p>Greater transparency can help stop illegal sales, reduce the risk of arms being diverted to terrorist groups and criminals; stop the flood of weapons to human rights abusers, and stop the arms that are being used to violate humanitarian law in too many communities on too many days. It\u2019s time to shine a light on this deadly trade.</p> <p>So this week, the stakes could not be higher. The arms trade is big business for many states \u2013 but for so many people around the world it\u2019s so much more. What happens in Geneva is a matter of life or death.</p>",

Set after the events of this summer\u2019s reboot, it also completely ignores it, featuring a new cast of two female and two male ghostbusters, a volte face that\u2019s neither explained nor even referred to. The script\u2019s fumbling, intermittent attempts at humour barely qualify as half-hearted, which leaves only the gameplay as a source of redemption. Unfortunately, Ghostbusters is a blandly generic twin-stick shooter, where one joystick moves your character and the other directs their gunfire. You and three player- or AI-controlled compatriots walk around agonisingly slowly, shooting ghosts with a range of tiresomely conventional weapons, before occasionally whipping out proton packs and catching one. The action isn\u2019t unpleasant, but the fact that you see everything the game has to offer in its opening 15 minutes makes the rest of its 12-plus hours an exercise in repetitious futility that you should avoid at all costs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c59ef8c8a11de12c54ee271c9b824ed883eeef87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c59ef8c8a11de12c54ee271c9b824ed883eeef87/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Happy Few.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smile like you mean it...

The biggest shock was that the peppy opening scene of the trailer, a daytime TV-style news bulletin, rapidly gave way to a stark game of survival set in a dingy alternate-1960s Britain. The country has suffered a terrifying national trauma that everyone is legally obliged to forget by taking Joy, an anti-depressant/memory suppressant that renders the populace happily vacant. Your main job is, of course, staying alive.

Slightly too many puzzles were unnecessarily fiddly, but it proved a lot more satisfying than the vacuous ghostbusting on offer elsewhere.

They witnessed their transformation and it encouraged them to tell their stories more so than a promise that we\u2019d add filters back at our office. </p> <p>Dragons, divas or drawing on your face \u2013 scroll through a millennial\u2019s phone and you\u2019ll probably encounter this masquerade.

Add to that tracking emojis, text drawings, image enhancing veneers, and geotags that pin locations to images; and you have the ingredients for a viral video factory.<br></p> <p>For us, it\u2019s proved to be a powerful storytelling tool. While the world is puzzling about how to get more Snapchat \u201cfriends\u201d, at the Hindustan Times we see a creative palette for content creation. When we covered the millions of Indians applying for university, we launched <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimes/videos/10153873301613580/\" rel=\"nofollow\">#CampusCalling, the world\u2019s first Snapchat reality show</a>. Young people sent us their snap stories, offering a microcosm of student life. </p> <p>But Snapchat also helps keep our storytellers safe. Increasingly, citizen journalists with smartphones are broadcasting live to Facebook or Periscope when witnessing human rights violations and police brutality. Going \u201clive\u201d means authorities can\u2019t easily delete phone footage or destroy evidence. Snapchat isn\u2019t live, but it\u2019s a few seconds away from it. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimes/videos/10153913596908580/\" rel=\"nofollow\">We used it to cover our undercover drugs investigation in Punjab</a>. Fearing police or drug dealers could take our phones, it was a cloud-based video solution.</p> <p>The seemingly frivolous platform is gaining favour with everyone from international NGOs to newspapers, as a powerful storytelling tool. <br></p> <p></p> <p>In December I\u2019ll climb Africa\u2019s highest peak, Kilimanjaro, along with sexual abuse survivors from every continent, recording their stories. Snapchat\u2019s face filters will be used to hide identities again. Unlocking the app\u2019s face mapping potential has only just begun.

Dik-diks, zebra, and impala were no longer common but extraordinary and delicate. Meeting elephants was heart-stopping. </p> <p>I marvelled at the stunning horizon behind layers of mountains and valleys in hues of magical colours. I revelled in the powerful scents of herbs and trees, fresh morning air, and the unforgettable aroma of meals cooked on a campfire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ca7191bc8be065c0d4f9f1a25b8b299485cfdc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca7191bc8be065c0d4f9f1a25b8b299485cfdc4/484_268_1341_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children round a camp fire in Samburu National Reserve, Kenya during a visit to celebrate World Elephant Day 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children round a camp fire in Samburu National Reserve, Kenya during a visit to celebrate World Elephant Day 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kahumbu/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days later, back in Nairobi, I took a walk. I was taking part in a demonstration in support of Kenya\u2019s constitution. We walked from Kinoo village on the outskirts of Nairobi down Waiyaki Way, one of Kenya\u2019s major highways, towards the city centre.</p> <p>To get to Kinoo from my office in the upmarket district of Karen, my taxi followed previously unknown roads through filthy, polluted mini-towns. I saw a boy and a man carefully collecting water from a morning puddle. I imagined what their morning tea would taste like. <br></p> <p>It was 9 am and I was in a world of smoke, exhaust fumes and loud shouting and banging, but this was \u2018their\u2019 world, not mine. My taxi windows were up, the air conditioning full on. We were in a world apart.</p> <p>The walk down Waiyaki Way was a leisurely affair on a spectacular morning with blue, blue skies complete with pristine fluffy clouds. We were strangers united, in colourful T-shirts waving national flags, talking about justice, laughing, dancing. We chatted, our conservation meandered \u2026 police brutality, land grabbing, corruption cartels .... </p> <p>There were hundreds of us, but thousands of others along the streets watched our noisy parade silently, unmoved. Why are Kenyans bystanders in their own imploding world, we wondered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3a29d4071fa9c054b18b3373a9ececabcf322b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3a29d4071fa9c054b18b3373a9ececabcf322b6/0_188_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three young residents of the second largest slum in African, Kibera, walk on the garbage-strewn basin of a water canal that makes its way through the slum on March 21, 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three young residents of the second largest slum in African, Kibera, walk on the garbage-strewn basin of a water canal that makes its way through the slum on March 21, 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bottles of water were distributed. I saw plastic wrappers and empty bottles being flung by the wayside on road verges, right in front of me. My blood boiled. I asked that we didn\u2019t do it, and in that moment the rubbish strewn along the highway came into sharp focus. Plastic bags mostly. Everywhere, piles of litter, dumped onto the road verges. Anger began to well in me. Then there were the muddy patches and the need to hop over soggy piles of you-don\u2019t-know-what and don\u2019t want to know.</p> <p>But it was the smells that offended me the most. At one point I fought down the need to reach. Walking through a small slum, I was no longer in a separate world, I was face to face with a disinterested population of adults, and playful children in their Sunday best whose innocence, I reflected, had probably been stolen multiple times over.</p> <p>Talk of justice for wildlife and protection of national parks seemed totally inappropriate at that moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75aea124fc5cb0c4075be8381bde38136024f434\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75aea124fc5cb0c4075be8381bde38136024f434/0_164_5103_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peak hour traffic on Tom Mboya Avenue, Nairobi, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peak hour traffic on Tom Mboya Avenue, Nairobi, Kenya.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we walked down the road, cars were hooting at us, and Matatus\u2014the ubiquitous minibuses that transport millions of Nairobi across the city every day, and kill quite a few of them too\u2014tried to drive right through us. </p> <p>Someone said: \u201cwalk on the road, it\u2019s your constitutional right\u201d. Nobody cared. The Kenyan constitution promises a clean and healthy environment but we have a filthy city, air, water and even the food we eat is polluted. The noise, smells are all so oppressive.</p> <p>My feelings were not simply the over-sensitive reaction of a privileged Nairobi resident coming face-to-face with the real world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/10/no-escape-nairobi-air-pollution-sparks-africa-health-warning\">Scientific studies show</a> that the amount of cancer-causing elements in the air in Nairobi city is 10 times higher than the threshold recommended by the World Health Organisation. </p> <p>Michael Gatari, an environmental scientist at the Kenyan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, predicts that \u201cwithout doubt, the pollution will have a huge economic and health impact.

The frogs and toads have gone silent. The lions too. I can hear the Mbagathi river gurgling.

Tiny 8 year old Anita who sat on my lap to colour in the lions in her activity book. Ibrahim who commandeered my camera and taught the others how to use it. Movin who knew the names of all the endangered species, Junior whose gift of expression was through art, Jonn in games, and Alvin through dance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a0d1bd40c757728ee9881bfe5c99473fdae3f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a0d1bd40c757728ee9881bfe5c99473fdae3f4/0_61_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls from Kibera School for Girls, Nairobi, during a trip to Samburu National Reserve, Kenya, to celebrate World Elephant Day 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls from Kibera School for Girls, Nairobi, during a trip to Samburu National Reserve, Kenya, to celebrate World Elephant Day 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kahumbu/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 37 children we brought to Samburu from Nairobi\u2019s slums came from Ngong, Kibera, Dandora and Mathare \u2026 places I have been to but can\u2019t imagine living in. They are much worse than anything I experienced earlier that day. There is virtually nothing green in our slums. The ground, paths, streams, and buildings are all one uniform colour ... brown. They call it chocolate city, but that is too kind. Noisy bars operate 24/7, there is no escape from danger, and every vice possible is just a step away. </p> <p>People who live there seem to have a numbed life, oblivious of the noise, smells and piles of trash everywhere. I can\u2019t imagine how a trip to Samburu to meet wild elephants and lions must have felt for these children. Camping was a terrifying novelty for some at first. But they were so upset to leave after only 3 days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b0b412a3b71c496440519b5a56c01c6027c1abf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b0b412a3b71c496440519b5a56c01c6027c1abf/0_61_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children setting up camp in Samburu National Reserve, Kenya, at the start of a visit to celebrate World Elephant Day, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children setting up camp in Samburu National Reserve, Kenya, at the start of a visit to celebrate World Elephant Day, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kahumbu/WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samburu is an 8 hour drive from Nairobi, but city residents don\u2019t have to go that far for the experience. Nairobi National Park is literally across the road from Kibera\u2014just a five minute walk. The park is amazing: 117 square kilometres of savannah, bush and forest, valleys, dams and streams. It has more birds than most countries, and a mind-boggling diversity of animals that include lions, rhino, giraffe, buffalo, hippos, and much more. <br></p> <p>Poor Kenyans live in filthy noisy slums, separated from rich Kenyans in safe, leafy suburbs. The park is the ultimate equalizer, a peaceful space for all to share. But we are losing it even before most of us have gotten to know it. Bulldozers stand ready to convert this unique wilderness into roads, railways, pipelines and power lines to feed an ever-growing urban expansion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf440d89d2af64738efd0f5ef3a4283e29166722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf440d89d2af64738efd0f5ef3a4283e29166722/0_293_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"KENYA, Nairobi: A lioness stalks a small group of buffalo through grass made long and lush by seasonal rains in Nairobi National Park, 17 May, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">KENYA, Nairobi: A lioness stalks a small group of buffalo through grass made long and lush by seasonal rains in Nairobi National Park, 17 May, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MEAACT PHOTO / STUART PRICE/MEAACT Kenya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public, neighbours, residents of Kibera, business operators and even conservationists are silently watching as the park, an icon of the city, crumbles.

On how just a few weeks after the President inspired the global imagination by burning Kenya\u2019s ivory stockpiles, demonstrators were being killed on the streets in violent confrontations with the police. </p> <p>I reflect on the slums and the park. I ask myself, how do we get the poor and the rich alike to defend the park as we would our treasured cathedrals and ancient monuments?</p> <p>How can we lift the veil of clouded thinking that is ready to sacrifice our country\u2019s unique heritage in the interest of short-term economic gain? How can we make people understand that fresh air, calming sights, insect and bird songs, peace, nature and greenery are an essential part of creating a healthy and wealthy society and not an obstacle to it?</p> <p>These are the thoughts that keep me awake at 4 am.</p>",
  "<p>At the heart of this spellbinding book is a simple but chilling idea: human nature will be transformed in the 21st century because intelligence is uncoupling from consciousness. We are not going to build machines any time soon that have feelings like we have feelings: that\u2019s consciousness. Robots won\u2019t be falling in love with each other (which doesn\u2019t mean we are incapable of falling in love with robots). But we have already built machines \u2013 vast data-processing networks \u2013 that can know our feelings better than we know them ourselves: that\u2019s intelligence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> \u2013 the search engine, not the company \u2013 doesn\u2019t have beliefs and desires of its own. It doesn\u2019t care what we search for and it won\u2019t feel hurt by our behaviour. But it can process our behaviour to know what we want before we know it ourselves. That fact has the potential to change what it means to be human.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/yuval-noah-harari\">Yuval Noah Harari</a>\u2019s previous book, the global bestseller <em>Sapiens</em>, laid out the last 75,000 years of human history to remind us that there is nothing special or essential about who we are. We are an accident. Homo sapiens is just one possible way of being human, an evolutionary contingency like every other creature on the planet. That book ended with the thought that the story of homo sapiens could be coming to an end. We are at the height of our power but we may also have reached its limit. <em>Homo Deus</em> makes good on this thought to explain how our unparalleled ability to control the world around us is turning us into something new.</p> <p>The evidence of our power is everywhere: we have not simply conquered nature but have also begun to defeat humanity\u2019s own worst enemies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/22/better-angels-steven-pinker-review\">War is increasingly obsolete</a>; famine is rare; disease is on the retreat around the world. We have achieved these triumphs by building ever more complex networks that treat human beings as units of information. Evolutionary science teaches us that, in one sense, we are nothing but data-processing machines: we too are algorithms. By manipulating the data we can exercise mastery over our fate. The trouble is that other algorithms \u2013 the ones that we have built \u2013 can do it far more efficiently than we can. That\u2019s what Harari means by the \u201cuncoupling\u201d of intelligence and consciousness. The project of modernity was built on the idea that individual human beings are the source of meaning as well as power. We are meant to be the ones who decide what happens to us: as voters, as consumers, as lovers. But that\u2019s not true any more. We are what gives networks their power: they use our ideas of meaning to determine what will happen to us.</p> <p>Not all of this is new. The modern state, which has been around for about 400 years, is really just another data-processing machine. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes, writing in 1651, called it an \u201cautomaton\u201d (or what we would call a robot). Its robotic quality is the source of its power and also its heartlessness: states don\u2019t have a conscience, which is what allows them sometimes to do the most fearful things. What\u2019s changed is that there are now processing machines that are far more efficient than states: as Harari points out, governments find it almost impossible to keep up with the pace of technological advance. It has also become much harder to sustain the belief \u2013 shared by Hobbes \u2013 that behind every state there are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The modern insistence on the autonomy of the individual goes along with a view that it should be possible to find the heart of this heartless world. Keep scratching at a faceless bureaucracy and you\u2019ll eventually uncover a civil servant with real feelings. But keep scratching at a search engine and all you\u2019ll find are data points.</p> <p>We are just at the start of this process of data-driven transformation and Harari says there is little we can do to stop it. <em>Homo Deus</em> is an \u201cend of history\u201d book, but not in the crude sense that he believes things have come to a stop. Rather the opposite: things are moving so fast that it\u2019s impossible to imagine what the future might hold. In 1800 it was possible to think meaningfully about what the world of 1900 would be like and how we might fit in. That\u2019s history: a sequence of events in which human beings play the leading part. But the world of 2100 is at present almost unimaginable. We have no idea where we\u2019ll fit in, if at all. We may have built a world that has no place for us.</p> <p>Given what an alarming thought this is, and since we aren\u2019t there yet, why can\u2019t we do more to stop it from happening? Harari thinks the modern belief that individuals are in charge of their fate was never much more than a leap of faith. Real power always resided with networks. Individual human beings are relatively powerless creatures, no match for lions or bears. It\u2019s what they can do as groups that has enabled them to take over the planet. These groupings \u2013 corporations, religions, states \u2013 are now part of a vast network of interconnected information flows. Finding points of resistance, where smaller units can stand up to the waves of information washing around the globe, is becoming harder all the time.</p> <p>Some people have given up the fight. In place of the founding tenets of modernity \u2013 liberalism, democracy and personal autonomy \u2013 there is a new religion: Dataism. Its followers \u2013 many of whom reside in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley\">Bay Area</a> of California \u2013 put their faith in information by encouraging us to see it as the only true source of value. We are what we contribute to data processing. There is potentially a huge upside to this: it means we will face fewer and fewer obstacles to getting what we want, because the information needed to supply us will be instantly accessible. Our likes and our experiences will merge. Our lifespans could also be hugely extended: Dataists believe that immortality is the next frontier to be crossed. But the downside is obvious, too. Who will \u201cwe\u201d be any more? Nothing more than an accumulation of information points. Twentieth-century political dystopias sought to stamp on individuals with the power of the state. That won\u2019t be necessary in the coming century. As Harari says: \u201cThe individual will not be crushed by Big Brother; it will disintegrate from within.\u201d</p> <p>Corporations and governments will continue to pay homage to our individuality and unique needs, but in order to service them they will need to \u201cbreak us up into biochemical subsystems\u201d, all of them permanently monitored by powerful algorithms. There is a dystopian political aspect to this, too: the early adopters \u2013 the individuals who sign up first to the Dataist project \u2013 will be the only ones with any real power left and it will be relatively unchallenged. Gaining entry into this new super-elite will be incredibly hard. You\u2019ll need heroic levels of education plus zero squeamishness about marrying your personal identity with intelligent machines. Then you can become one of the new \u201cgods\u201d. It\u2019s a grim prospect: a small priestly caste of seers with access to the ultimate source of knowledge, and the rest of humanity simply tools in their vast schemes. The future could be a digitally supercharged version of the distant past: ancient Egypt multiplied by the power of Facebook.</p> <p>Harari is careful not to predict that these outlandish visions will come to pass. The future is unknowable, after all. He reserves his strongest opinions for what all this should mean for the current state of relations between humans and animals. If intelligence and consciousness are coming apart then this puts most human beings in the same situation as other animals: capable of suffering at the hands of the possessors of superior intelligence. Harari does not seem too worried about the prospect of robots treating us like we treat flies, with violent indifference. Rather, he wants us to think about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/industrial-farming-one-worst-crimes-history-ethical-question\">how we are treating animals in our vast industrialised farming systems</a>. Pigs unquestionably suffer when living in cramped conditions or forcibly separated from their young. If we think this suffering doesn\u2019t count because it is not allied to a higher intelligence, then we are building a rod for our own backs. Soon the same will be true of us. And what price our suffering then?</p> <p>This is a very intelligent book, full of sharp insights and mordant wit. But as Harari would probably be the first to admit, it\u2019s only intelligent by human standards, which are nothing special. By the standards of the smartest machines it\u2019s woolly and speculative. The datasets are pretty limited. Its real power comes from the sense of a distinctive consciousness behind it. It is a quirky and cool book, with a sliver of ice at its heart. Harari cares about the fate of animals in a human world but he writes about the prospects for homo sapiens in a data-driven world with a lofty insouciance. I have to admit I found this deeply appealing, but that may be because of who I am (apart from anything else, a man). Not everyone will find it so. But it is hard to imagine anyone could read this book without getting an occasional, vertiginous thrill. Nietzsche once wrote that humanity is about to set sail on an open sea, now that we have finally left Christian morality behind. <em>Homo Deus</em> makes it feel as if we are standing at the edge of a cliff after a long and arduous journey. The journey doesn\u2019t seem so important any more. We are about to step into thin air.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em> is published by Harvill Secker.

  "<p>Scott Morrison added another track to his greatest hits album this week with his suggestion on the Ray Hadley talkback radio show that some superannuation funds are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/scott-morrison-attacks-super-funds-not-investing-in-coal-for-political-reasons\">avoiding investing in coal</a> for political reasons.</p> <p>The last two politicians who got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/01/superannuation-transition-to-retirement-julie-bishop-gotcha-moment\">basic facts about the superannuation industry </a>so wrong, Julie Bishop and Sarah Hanson-Young, were publicly kicked from pillar to post. Either Scott Morrison understands that superannuation funds have to make decisions solely through the lens of providing benefits to members in retirement, or he better study up on our nation\u2019s superannuation laws.</p> <p>Superannuation funds need to satisfy the sole purpose test. The sole purpose of superannuation funds is to provide benefits to their members in retirement. The test ensures the trustees of superannuation funds are making decisions with the best interest of their members at heart. Sometimes these decisions match the political beliefs of the members of the fund, but investment decisions must be made through a financial lens.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that the system works as it should. Social and environmental nasties like coal have, in recent years, detracted from the returns of many portfolios. Despite massive short-term losses and a bleak long-term outlook, most superannuation funds in Australia still invest in coal and other fossil fuels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/scott-morrison-attacks-super-funds-not-investing-in-coal-for-political-reasons\">Scott Morrison attacks super funds not investing in coal for 'political reasons\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scott Morrison would do well to study the facts on the financial performance of coal and fossil fuels, as would the trustees who take responsibility for managing our retirement savings.</p> <p>Companies with exposure to fossil fuels have been taking a pummelling. Last week BHP Billiton <a href=\"http://www.skynews.com.au/business/business/company/2016/08/16/bhp-billiton--8-3bn-loss-biggest-on-record.html\">posted a record loss</a> of $8.3bn. The fossil fuel industry as a whole has written down an estimated $15bn in assets for the 2015/16 financial year, according to research by independent not-for-profit Market Forces.</p> <p>Many financial analysts, including Citibank, Moody\u2019s and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, have publicly declared that the writing is on the wall for the coal industry. This is not a cyclical downturn; thermal coal is in structural decline.</p> <p>The US provides the most visible example of the coal industry\u2019s decline. More than half of the major coal companies in the US have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the last two years. US coal consumption peaked in 2007 and has declined by almost a third since.</p> <p>Coal is faring little better elsewhere: 25% of countries in the EU have already shut down their last coal power plants, and the UK, Austria and Portugal are aiming to be coal free in under 10 years. Portugal achieved a stellar run of four days straight on 100% renewable energy earlier this year and achievements like this will only keep on coming.</p> <p>Chinese coal consumption has been in decline since 2013, with the speed of the decline tripling this year. China is the world\u2019s largest coal consumer and the rapid decline of its coal industry is reverberating across the globe. Chinese economic activity has now decoupled itself from electricity demand. The motivation of the Chinese government to tackle their serious air pollution problems and their economic transition away from manufacturing means that coal is unlikely to get back up again.</p> <p>China has gone further than Australia by placing a moratorium on new coal power plant approvals and at least 15 provinces have been ordered to halt construction on previously approved coal power plants. With many coal plants already operating at below 50% capacity, Beijing is seeking to slow the oversupply of coal by closing up to 1000 mines this year.</p> <p>As the global renewables transition gains pace, investors are increasingly talking about the growing risk of fossil fuels investments becoming stranded, or, in other words, the emergence of a carbon bubble.</p> <p>Current fossil fuel company valuations incorporate fossil fuel reserves far greater than what can be safely burnt to stay below 2\u00b0C. An analyst at Barclays has suggested that the <a href=\"http://www.miningweekly.com/print-version/fossil-fuel-industry-risks-losing-33tn-to-climate-change-2016-07-12\">fossil fuel industry risks losing up to $33tn</a> in revenue as these reserves are forced to stay in the ground.</p> <p>Given all of this evidence the question must be raised: how could continued investment in coal reconcile with the fiduciary duty of superannuation fund trustees?</p> <p>In the last financial year more than half of the 20 worst performing ASX 100 stocks had significant exposure to fossil fuels. The Thomson Reuters/Future Super fossil fuel free index outperformed the ASX 300 in the same year by over 14%. And superannuation funds that divested from coal outperformed industry averages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/the-superannuation-changes-are-seriously-good-the-coalition-must-fight-for-them\">The superannuation changes are seriously good. The Coalition must fight for them | Gareth Hutchens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The evidence from the last financial year reaffirms the investment thesis of ethical investment managers: companies with better environmental, social and governance records can also be better financial performers.</p> <p>A global transformation in the way human societies produce and consume energy is underway, with serious implications for fossil fuel investments. Superannuation trustees have a responsibility to act to safeguard the retirement savings of ordinary Australians from exposure to industries in decline. Rather than being merely political, fossil fuel free investment strategies are proving to be the sensible approach for responsible investors.</p> <p>As Australia\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison should know better than to chastise superannuation funds who choose to protect their members\u2019 savings from the decline of coal and fossil fuels.</p> <p>Luckily Australians can shop around and make up their own minds on which super fund is best protecting them from the impacts of climate change on their portfolio.</p>",

  "<p>At the Paris climate talks last December, governments agreed to work towards limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Here\u2019s what we learned:</p> <h2>1 Off-grid renewables are becoming more accessible</h2> <p>The falling cost of technologies such as solar PV means renewables have become cost-effective in many parts of the developing world, said Henning Wuester, director of the International Renewable Energy Agency\u2019s Knowledge, Policy and Finance Centre. This is particularly the case in rural areas away from the electricity grid, where people are otherwise using relatively expensive, inefficient diesel generators and kerosene lamps.</p> <p>Despite this, the upfront cost of small-scale solar systems to power a few lights or charge a mobile phone can present a significant barrier to widespread adoption, said Aly-Khan Jamal, a partner at Dalberg Global Development Advisors. However, he said there have been \u201cexciting breakthroughs\u201d in addressing such challenges:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Businesses providing these systems are using pay-as-you-go approaches that allow households and businesses to pay a small amount each month. Some allow you to eventually buy and fully own the system; others have a \u2018perpetual lease\u2019 where it is somewhat like paying for a utility.</p> </blockquote> <h2>2 Mobile money is critical ...</h2> <p>Mobile money payment systems make these pay-as-you-go models feasible, said Jamal, as they give businesses the ability to monitor and control electricity provision remotely, and make collecting payments very efficient \u2013 in turn significantly reducing costs. </p> <p>Wuester added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mobile payment schemes have been critical in driving the roll-out of off-grid solutions. This has enabled more than 300,000 households [across East Africa] to get access to electricity, including about 30% of the Kenyan population, 40,000 in Uganda and 20,000 in Tanzania.

Pina said that Oikocredit \u2013 together with London-based solar systems provider <a href=\"http://www.bboxx.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBoxx</a> \u2013 uses M-Pesa to collect monthly payments from solar system users in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <h2>3 ... but it has limits</h2> <p>Jamal pointed out, however, that mobile money penetration isn\u2019t even across all countries, so different approaches need to be used depending on the market. What\u2019s more, he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the most remote and low income communities, mobile networks don\u2019t invest in telecoms infrastructure (it\u2019s not worth it for them) so relying on mobile money to reach these really challenging communities may not be sufficient.</p> </blockquote> <h2>4 Pay-as-you-go could trap the poorest in debt</h2> <p>Social entrepreneur and investor Jamie Hartzell put the following question to the panel:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The boom in pay-as-you-go household solar in East Africa is very exciting. But it is all based on credit, and the companies have a view to selling other products like TVs. How big is the risk that boom will turn to bust and push the poorest of the poor into unpayable debt?</p> </blockquote> <p>Nico Tyabji, director of strategic partnerships at solar financier SunFunder, replied that while users might have a legally enforceable contract, \u201cthe reality is no one\u2019s going to come knocking\u201d \u2013 they just don\u2019t get the service any more. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/20/energy-renewables-climate-change-finance-investment-east-africa-india-off-grid-development\">Investors' neglect of small-scale renewables threatens universal energy access</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tyabji said that since cutting off access isn\u2019t in the companies\u2019 interest, they spend time thinking about how to make the process work best, for example by setting up payment models around harvest season so that users can pay when they have access to money rather than having to stick to a regular payment schedule. However, he added that as products and services get bigger and pricier, Hartzell\u2019s concerns could become an issue.</p> <h2>5 Credit must be responsible</h2> <p>Edward Hanrahan, CEO of ClimateCare, reiterated the need for caution in what he described as the \u201cmassive rush to [...] provide credit at levels unseen before to the lowest income populace\u201d. </p> <p>He cited the example of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/20/energy-renewables-climate-change-finance-investment-east-africa-india-off-grid-development\">Pamoja Life</a>, one of ClimateCare\u2019s investment projects in east Africa, which ensures that the overall monthly or weekly cost of the goods provided is lower than the goods it is displacing (for example, a solar unit costs less than equivalent kerosene). This means monthly outgoings are reduced rather than increased. </p> <p>Hanrahan added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, we are all now looking at providing \u2018add-on\u2019 products \u2013 fridges, internet access, TVs. It is crucial that we manage the ladder of credit in a very responsible manner</p> </blockquote> <h2>6 There\u2019s a big investment gap</h2> <p>\u201cThe world is not investing enough in renewables as a whole, not just off-grid solar, given the imperatives of climate change and sustainable development goals,\u201d said Jeremy Leggett, founder of Solarcentury and SolarAid, and chairman of Carbon Tracker.</p> <p>While investment in large, centralised energy systems is driven mainly by multilateral agencies and large developers who rely on long term power purchase agreements, there is still a funding gap for decentralised systems where the requirements are smaller and the risks are higher, said Pina. Despite a growing interest in off-grid developments and new debt structures, Pina believes there is still a need to develop new guarantee structures to attract investors.</p> <p>Tyabji said organisations such as SunFunder came into being to plug part of that investment gap:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a few exceptions, we haven\u2019t yet seen the levels of investment from development banks (let alone commercial banks) that other kinds of energy and infrastructure projects get. So it\u2019s still down to niche players like us.</p> </blockquote>",

Trump rolls out new immigration look, praises Obama</h2> <p>Speaking on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program on Fox News, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">rolled out a new version of</a> his now-obscure position on immigration, telling the host that \u201cI just want to follow the law\u201d...</p> <p>\u201cI just want to follow the law,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-election-news-campaign-live?page=with:block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b#block-57bb9896e4b047b85f602a9b\">said</a>. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is following the law ... Now the existing laws are very strong. The existing laws, the first thing we are going to do if and when I win, is we are going to get rid of all of the bad ones. ... As far as everybody else, we are going to go through the process. What people don\u2019t know is Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump actually said this: &quot;What people don&#39;t know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country.&quot;</p>&mdash; Rick Klein (@rickklein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/768035137883873280\">August 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. Trump: \u2018war zones\u2019 safer than inner cities</h2> <p>Donald Trump veered off the teleprompter on Monday night to claim that \u201cinner cities run by the Democrats\u201d were more dangerous than countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.[...]</p> <p>\u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats,\u201d Trump said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/donald-trump-inner-city-crime-war-zone-hillary-clinton\">Trump: inner cities run by Democrats are more dangerous than war zones</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. Trump jacked rent at Trump Tower once donor money flowed</h2> <p>The Trump campaign rents office space in Trump Tower. When Donald Trump was mostly self-financing his campaign, the office space cost one thing. When Trump began accepting more donations from the public, the price quintupled, the Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-rent_us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March. </p> <p>The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March \u2015 the same amount it had been paying since last summer \u2015 and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/768049003841871872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like Trump U, Trump campaign is a scam.
