  "<p>Gennady Golovkin did not waste his energy on anything other than banalities and formalities when he addressed the world\u2019s media for a final time before Saturday night\u2019s intriguing clash of weights and styles against Kell Brook. There was no need. Why use words to sell a fight when his fists have long performed that job with such distinction?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/tyson-fury-rematch-wladimir-klitschko-take-place-29-october-manchester-boxing\">Tyson Fury\u2019s rematch with Wladimir Klitschko to take place on 29 October</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead the unbeaten WBA, WBC and IBF middleweight champion thanked his sponsors and management team, praised his \u201cstrong\u201d opponent, and stressed \u2013 more than once \u2013 how happy he was to be in London. And then, after a lingering pre-fight stare-down that felt more like a contractual obligation than an attempt to introduce the wobblies, he politely shook hands with his opponent and headed to his hotel to rest up while everyone else worked the room.</p> <p>Golovkin\u2019s promoter, Tom Loeffler, stressed that his man had left early because he was tired after travelling from the US, and restless after being stuck in London traffic for over an hour. But Eddie Hearn, Brook\u2019s promoter, was quick to hint that there may be more to it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Golovkin looked that great,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI thought he looked a little bit drawn in the face. They scuttled off after and didn\u2019t want to talk to any of the media.\u201d</p> <p>This being fight week, the provocations did not end there. \u201cThey feel invincible as a team,\u201d Hearn added, warming to his theme. \u201cThey feel they can just rock up to these cities, go out, knock people out, collect the money and off they go. When the fight was first made they thought it was going to be an easy knock-over job. Now they know they\u2019re in a real fight.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/anthony-joshua-ibf-heavyweight-defence-manchester\">Anthony Joshua\u2019s IBF heavyweight defence scheduled for Manchester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bookies, who make Brook the 5-1 underdog, appear to dispute that analysis. It will take more than jet lag to dethrone the 34-year-old Kazakh who is unbeaten in 35 professional contests \u2013 with 32 knockouts \u2013 and has never been dumped on his backside in nearly 400 amateur or professional fights.</p> <p>As Golovkin explained after touching down in the UK, he learned the ropes the hard way. \u201cI had 350 fights as an amateur, maybe more,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember going into the gym and my first coach \u2013 he was crazy \u2013 he would take me to all the gyms, there were maybe 15 in my city. He said: \u2018OK, G, I want you to fight him.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 I would say, as I was very interested to learn. Every month I would enter a competition, three or four fights, every time. \u201cI was like a dog. He would say: \u2018With him!\u2019 \u2013 \u2018OK, coach\u2019 \u2013 \u2018With him!\u2019 \u2013 \u2018OK, coach.\u2019 But I would beat everybody. Maybe he got money for it, I don\u2019t know, but he was crazy and it was a good experience for me.\u201d</p> <p>Not much has appeared to ruffle Golovkin since. Those close to him insist that what you see is what you get: a polite, respectful and even fun person outside the ring \u2013 but someone utterly deadly inside it. As Loeffler explained, he only changes when the subject of his older brothers, Vadim and Sergey, who were soldiers who were killed in action four years apart in the 90s, is raised. \u201cGennady is a very easy-going guy,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s always smiling, he\u2019s always in a good mood, but when the subject of his brothers comes up, he really becomes closed. His oldest brother was the one who inspired him to get into boxing. He\u2019s the one who brought him to the gym and his son is named Vadim after his oldest brother.\u201d</p> <p>It has taken years for Golovkin\u2019s talents to be fully admired but his trainer, Abel Sanchez, believes even at 34 there is more to come. \u201cWe see a lot of things in the gym that we never see in a fight, unfortunately. But Kell is definitely the most accomplished fighter we have faced to date. He is a champion. He has never lost and doesn\u2019t know how to lose. That\u2019s scary.\u201d</p> <p>Golovkin has sparred for just 75 rounds to prepare for Brook. But Sanchez insists there is no complacency. \u201cI don\u2019t like to spar him too much, or any of my guys too much,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it is a waste of time. We had nine days of sparring over three weeks. That has been the same for the last seven fights. It never goes over 80 rounds.\u201d And nor is the work too strenuous \u2013 deliberately so. \u201cGennady is not an abusive guy in sparring. He will put rib protectors on them, I don\u2019t allow him to hit them to the head a lot. If he hurts someone he gets off of them rather than trying to beat him. So he is also champing at the bit for the next fight to come around.\u201d</p> <p>There is not long to wait. Soon Gennady will switch to the world\u2019s dangerous puncher GGG. \u201cIt really starts when I start putting his wraps on,\u201d explains Sanchez. \u201cIt is like he is putting his armour on, he is putting his sword in his sleeve and he is ready to go to work.\u201d And Brook will soon find out what that feels like.</p>",
  "<p>What\u2019s the point of budget repair if 725,000 Australians are unemployed and a further 1,067,000 people are underemployed?</p> <p>At its most basic level, economic policy is about maximising the speed at which an economy can sustainably grow to ensure the pool of unemployed and underemployed workers is as small as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/08/48bn-found-down-the-back-of-the-couch-doesnt-leave-much-confidence-in-gdp-figures\">$4.8bn found down the back of the couch doesn't leave much confidence in GDP figures | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The superficially strong 3.3% annual GDP growth rate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/australia-notches-up-25-years-without-recession-as-public-spending-boosts-growth\">this week\u2019s national accounts</a> would normally signal a stronger labour market. The skewing of that growth to exports of bulk commodities, where employment is small, means the domestic side of the economy is still not growing fast enough to attain full employment.</p> <p>There was also a significant contribution to GDP from government demand, something that flies in the face of the government\u2019s obsession with budget repair. It is unclear where economic policy is currently being aimed.</p> <p>The policy priority is to reduce spending to ensure the deficit is as low as possible and to return to budget surplus. Such policies take money from the economy and by definition, growth slows and with that, the rate of job creation softens and unemployment is higher than it would otherwise be.</p> <p>The positive influences of expansionary fiscal policy are summed up well in the current year 12 high school economics text book (Australia in the Global Economy 2016 edition; Tim Dixon &amp; John O\u2019Mahony): \u201cAn expansionary fiscal policy involving increased spending or tax cuts would accelerate economic growth \u2026 in stimulating aggregate demand, expansionary fiscal policy can help reduce unemployment.\u201d It is base-case economics.</p> <p>What is concerning is that the current slack \u2013 or underutilisation \u2013 in the labour market is about as severe as during the early 1990s recession. This is because the highly flexible labour market, with an increasingly skilled and talented workforce, has been limited to achieving annual pay increases of just 2% \u2013 about the same as the low point for wages in and around the last recession in the early 1990s.</p> <p>The duration where the economy has seen sub-2.5% wages growth is longer than at any stage during the early 1990s recession. The degree of slack is now extreme.</p> <p>With the unemployment rate having been stuck above 5.5% for four years, it may simply be the case that policy makers are complacent about unemployment.</p> <p>Given a choice between a return to budget surplus in three years, or entrenching unemployment below 600,000 people (or 5%) of the workforce, the government is choosing the budget surplus. </p> <p>As the former treasury secretary Ted Evans once noted, policy makers largely choose the unemployment rate they wish to live with.</p> <p>In other words, policies can be implemented that will lower the unemployment rate. They may involve spending on education, skills and training, or dealing with wage rates and industrial relations reform. Or it could be a simple fiscal stimulus where money is injected into the economy in infrastructure building programs.</p> <p>Take your pick if your goal is full employment.</p> <p>Scott Morrison has indicated that budget repair is his priority. On the latest projections, the existing policy framework has the unemployment rate holding at a high 5.5% over the next few years.</p> <p>If there is any attempt to hasten the return to surplus outside the automatic stabilisers, or \u201crepair\u201d the budget via spending cuts, the outlook for people without jobs will remain bleak.</p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s slogan during the election campaign revolved around \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. It can deliver on that pledge with some job-friendly policies over the next few months but it may mean delaying a return to surplus.</p> <p>It is likely that many of those now unemployed and underemployed don\u2019t give two hoots whether the budget deficit is $6bn or $16bn and would prefer a government that was able to provide a framework where more jobs could be created.</p> <p><em>Stephen Koukoulas is a Research Fellow at Per Capita, a progressive thinktank.</em></p>",
  "<p>Owen Coyle remembers the challenge and it is a fair bet that Jack Wilshere remembers it, too. \u201cIt caught Jack and it halved him in two, sending him spinning up in the air and back down to the grass,\u201d Coyle says. The Blackburn Rovers manager was in charge of Bolton Wanderers at the time and an 18-year-old Wilshere had arrived from Arsenal for the first loan spell of his career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/jack-wilshere-arsenal-bournemouth-best-place-to-develop\">Jack Wilshere says Bournemouth is \u2018best place\u2019 to develop away from Arsenal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was January 2010 and the perpetrator of the training ground softening-up was Kevin Davies, the club captain and a player Coyle describes as being \u201cas strong as an ox\u201d. It was the traditional northern welcome for a softie from the south and, according to Coyle, Wilshere said nothing, got back up and carried on.</p> <p>\u201cI was kind of amused by it, thinking: \u2018OK, let\u2019s see what happens now,\u2019\u201d Coyle says. \u201cA couple of minutes later, Kevin gets the ball and goes to play and Jack just comes from the side \u2013 he was like a bull. Jack takes him out, puts him spinning up in the air and he just stands over him and says: \u2018Are you OK, skip? Are you OK, skip?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cTo be fair to Kevin, he said: \u2018D\u2019you know what, Jack? That will do for me.\u2019 They had wanted to send a wee marker out. \u2018Can he handle it? Is he tough?\u2019 There is this myth, or whatever you want to call it, about boys from the south, and northerners being tougher. But Jack is as tough as old boots.\u201d</p> <p>There have been no such tests or initiations for Wilshere at Bournemouth, the club he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/arsenal-jack-wilshere-bournemouth-loan\">joined on Wednesday of last week</a> for the second loan spell of his career and for whom he will make a debut at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Eddie Howe, the manager, jokes that his squad does not have the hard men to dish anything out and adds: \u201cThe era of meeting a new signing with a crunching tackle has gone.\u201d But what is under the microscope \u2013 yet again \u2013 is Wilshere\u2019s capacity to bounce back in the face of adversity.</p> <p>Eyebrows were raised when the midfielder chose Bournemouth over his other suitors, who included Milan and Roma, and it is possible to paint the move as a climbdown for him. When Wilshere went to Bolton, he was the coming star, one who was yet to start a Premier League game. Now, he is a 34-cap England international, one with Champions League pedigree and A-list profile.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a brave decision,\u201d Howe says. \u201cHe is testing himself to the extreme. Coming here is not going to be easy. We are not Arsenal. We are not going to dominate the ball, even though we try to do so. He will have to fight. Hopefully, he can look back on this as a turning point in his career.\u201d</p> <p>Wilshere has never been afraid to fight and his supporters \u2013 with Howe prominent among them \u2013 see his strength of character in the choice of Bournemouth. When Wilshere realised that he was down the pecking order at Arsenal, he resolved to join another English club. \u201cThe key thing for Jack was to stay in the Premier League,\u201d Howe says. And he had no hang-up about dropping down the division to Bournemouth in search of a career spark.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xyx5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692229\"            data-video-name=\"The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere's career so far \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c70aabe4b0df5f040dc06a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160831Wilshere.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/31/the-ups-and-downs-of-jack-wilsheres-career-so-far-video-report\">The ups and downs of Jack Wilshere\u2019s career so far</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Coyle says: \u201cThe easiest thing is to say: \u2018I\u2019m just going to stay put, I\u2019ll stay in my comfort zone,\u2019 or whatever. But Jack has said: \u2018I\u2019m prepared to push myself.\u2019 The modern player doesn\u2019t have to do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do and Jack had numerous other options. If he didn\u2019t want to go to Bournemouth, he didn\u2019t have to go. But he\u2019s looked at it and he\u2019s probably had a very good chat with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who he has a fantastic relationship with, and said: \u2018This is fresh and it gets me back to where I want to be.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Liam Brady, the former Arsenal academy director and a man who knows a thing or two about left-footed playmaking, oversaw Wilshere\u2019s development at the club from the age of nine. He believes that Wilshere can not only become \u201cone of the best England players but one of the best players in the Premier League\u201d, and he has a simple explanation for the 24-year-old\u2019s recent difficulties: injury.</p> <p>When Wilshere returned from what was a successful three and a half months at Bolton, Coyle says that Wenger said he \u201ccould build a team around this player\u201d. The following season, Wilshere broke through at Arsenal but since then the setbacks have gripped with frustrating regularity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/03/jack-wilshere-bournemouth-ac-milan-arsenal\">Jack Wilshere makes first Bournemouth appearance in defeat to Milan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was the right ankle crack that ruled him out from June 2011 for 17 months; the fracture to the left foot on England duty in March 2014 that followed a tackle from Denmark\u2019s Daniel Agger; the left ankle ligament damage in November of that year after the challenge from Manchester United\u2019s Paddy McNair and the fractured left fibula that ruined his season last time out.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have called into question Jack\u2019s way of playing, saying that it invites injuries, but two of them were down to very bad tackles from Agger and McNair,\u201d Brady says. \u201cJack always had loads of character but, unfortunately, his injuries have stunted his influence at Arsenal. Having known him for many years, I wish him an injury-free season. I hope this is a relaunch for him and he comes back to Arsenal in good shape.\u201d</p> <p>Wilshere has dipped in and out of training at Bournemouth so far, with Howe making the point that \u201cthere are very few players who will do every minute of every session\u201d. He has examined Wilshere\u2019s data from Arsenal and, as he does with each member of his squad, he has tailored an individual fitness programme for him.</p> <p>Howe played him in the first half of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/03/jack-wilshere-bournemouth-ac-milan-arsenal\">Warren Cummings\u2019s testimonial match against Milan</a> at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday and it was noticeable how high up the pitch Wilshere was, in a No10 role, close to the striker Benik Afobe, whom he counts as one of his best friends. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/05/benik-afobe-arsenal-bournemouth\">The pair grew up together at Arsenal</a> and Afobe is the godfather to Wilshere\u2019s daughter, Delilah.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is rocket science as to where Jack is best,\u201d Howe says. \u201cWe would certainly want to see him attacking and using his creativity in the final third.\u201d</p> <p>Brady adds: \u201cJack\u2019s best position is left of a holding midfield player. He can play as a No10, he can play the holding midfield role, as he did for Roy Hodgson with England, but his best role is linking midfield to attack, and getting up around the box, where he can use his talent to go past people and his ability to score and make goals. If you have him as a holding midfield player, you take away that aspect of his play. I\u2019d always want him up around the opposition goal.\u201d</p> <p>Brady feels that Wilshere and Bournemouth are a good fit, given Howe\u2019s preference for a passing style, and there is excitement at the club before the West Brom game. Wilshere is living on the south coast and Howe says that the player\u2019s presence has lifted the training.</p> <p>\u201cI remember when I was at Burnley,\u201d Coyle says, \u201cand I signed Andy Cole on loan. Although he was 36 years old, he still passed the ball like a Champions League player and the level of training went up. The impact that Andy Cole had was just terrific and I\u2019ve got no doubts that when Bournemouth have a Jack Wilshere at the top of his game, it will totally enhance everything that Eddie is doing. The supporters and everybody will think: \u2018We can attract this type of player.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Bournemouth are the Premier League\u2019s smallest ever club in stadium size and, at times such as these, it is tempting to cast the mind back to the recent past and Howe\u2019s first spell in charge, which began in January 2009, when the team were stuck at the foot of League Two and in the throes of financial crisis. When Howe returned for his current spell in October 2012, they were fourth bottom of League One.</p> <p>\u201cA few years ago, if you had said to me that we would have a possibility of signing a player of Jack\u2019s name and ability, I would have told you it was not possible,\u201d Howe says. \u201cIt is a different path, one which we have not trodden before. It is a big moment for the football club.\u201d</p>",

In such deep waters, the only activity that was likely to disturb them is oil or gas drilling.</p> <p>Hanson-Young said on her fact-finding mission people were often shocked oil exploration would be allowed in a marine reserve. \u201cWhat is the point of having these places if a company can come and drill for oil?\u201d</p> <p>Veteran environmentalist and former Greens leader Bob Brown recently returned from a trip to the Great Australian Bight, and told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt would be very unwise for BP to move that leased oil rig from South Korea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is rapidly growing into a national and international furore,\u201d he said, saying NOPSEMA appeared to be working too closely with BP, and not giving the public the information it needed to properly scrutinise the plans.</p> <p>An oil spill in the Great Australian Bight could threaten South Australia\u2019s $442m fishing industry and coastal tourism industry, which could be worth more than $1bn and employs <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=cc8244da-9474-42f9-85e2-c040adc9dbdb&amp;subId=412135\">almost 7,000 people</a>.</p> <p>In 2010, BP was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil spill, at the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico. That occurred in waters that were significantly calmer and more shallow than the wells proposed in the Great Australian Bight.</p> <p>BP maintains that oil and gas exploration can safely coexist with the marine environment. \u201cWe have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning,\u201d a spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bp-reveals-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-sites-are-within-marine-reserve\">told Guardian Australia earlier this month</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A recent news report <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/08/05/american-muslim-women-removed-from-plane-for-making-flight-attendant-feel-unsafe/\">documented the removal of two Muslim women</a> working for the federal government from an American Airline flight. On its surface the airline staff appeared to be upholding safety regulations, but in reality they were engaging in discriminatory practices. I know this to be true because I was one of the two women. We were removed from the plane for doing nothing more than requesting water and asking why we were still aboard an idling plane for more than five hours.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Although the incident was humiliating it was also eye-opening. Until it happened to me, neither my friend nor I had realized how common this trend had become. Passengers are removed from an aircraft for benign reasons such as asking for a beverage, a child harness, speaking a foreign language, changing orupgrading seats, taking pictures, making videos, or questioning a long delay. It isn\u2019t just about what happened to me \u2013 increasingly Muslims are a part of a cycle of discrimination that targets them due to their appearance. </p> <p>American Airlines states that they prohibit \u201cdiscrimination of any kind\u201d and ensure that their \u201cpolicies require that we treat all our customers in a fair and courteous manner and discrimination due to race, ethnicity, religion, or skin-color is not tolerated\u201d. However, this was not reflected in the treatment that I and other passengers received. </p> <p>Shan Anand, a young, turbaned, Sikh man along with three of his Muslim friends were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/lawsuit-claims-flight-ejected-men-muslim-article-1.2499843\">removed from an American Airlines flight</a> traveling from Toronto to New York earlier this year. When I asked Shan why he thought he and his friends were removed from the flight he said: \u201cWe know why it happened, right? There were four of us, three are Muslim and I am Sikh.\u201d When Shan and his friends asked American Airlines why they were removed, they were told: \u201cThere were inconsistencies of their behavior traveling as a group.\u201d But the explanation made no sense to Shan \u2013 he was traveling in a group of six with two Latinos, three South Asians and one Arab, yet only the South Asians and Arab were removed. Shan and his travel companions were told that \u201cthe crew felt unsafe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnsafe\u201d: a trigger word commonly used as an excuse by airlines under the pretext of ensuring safety and security post-9/11. Nearly all Muslims have at some point been subject to secondary security screening selection, but being thrown off a plane was an entirely new level of humiliation for me. </p> <h2>Measuring discrimination</h2> <p>Khurram Ali, the former civil rights director for the Council on American-Islamic Relation\u2019s (CAIR\u2019s) New Jersey chapter, explains that the pilot of an aircraft is given a list of those passengers that are marked with the infamous SSSS on their boarding pass. The SSSS or *S* indicates someone needs to be scrutinized a bit further by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). And although it is unknown if airline attendants have access to the names labelled SSSS by TSA on domestic flights, they do have access to their respective airline computer reservation system, which details passenger name and detailed information.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/16/southwest-airlines-man-removed-flight-arabic\">Southwest Airlines draws outrage over man removed for speaking Arabic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although there is no published criteria used to select passengers for \u201crandom selection\u201d or \u201csuspicion\u201d, Ali says: \u201cIt is happening to more and more people who are considered visibly Muslim.\u201d Ali documented 27 airline discrimination complaint cases with three of those being \u201cpulled off\u201d or airline removal cases for CAIR\u2019s New Jersey chapter during his short tenure. But as he pointed out, those numbers come nowhere near the amount being documented by CAIR on a national level.</p> <p>CAIR has been fairly thorough in its documentation of discrimination against American Muslims, however it is still in the process of aggregating data regarding Muslim airline passengers being \u201cpulled off\u201d planes. Corey Saylor, CAIR\u2019s director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, acknowledged that they \u201care seeing more airline cases\u201d. But in regards to statistics, Saylor stated: \u201cWe do not have stats as of yet. We are working on it.\u201d </p> <p>The only cases the public is aware of are those documented in the media. I counted nine airline passenger removal cases involving American Muslims published in the media over the past 13 months. But if that isn\u2019t indicative enough, just look at trending hashtags on social media like #FlyingWhileMuslim to understand and confirm the reality of rising discrimination. </p> <p>The official reasons for removal of these passengers are all in relation to safety and security concerns. But there is no mistaking this trend toward discrimination of Muslims.. Here are a few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Mohamed Ahmed Radwan made the flight attendant feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d when he asked her why she called him out over the public tannoy with the words \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslim-kicked-off-plane-american-airlines-racial-discrimination-cair-uncomfortable-a7147311.html\">I will be watching you</a>\u201d.

(Southwest Airlines, December 2015)</li> <li>Hakima Abdulle, a hijabi woman, made her aircraft flight attendant \u201cfeel uncomfortable\u201d after <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslim-woman-kicked-off-plane-as-flight-attendant-said-she-did-not-feel-comfortable-with-the-a6986661.html\">switching seats with another passenger</a>.

(Delta Airlines, July 2016)</li> </ul> <p>Many instances have gone undocumented due to fear of victims being further targeted, labeled troublemakers and being put on a \u201cno-fly\u201d list. The silent acceptance of these incidents has enabled airlines to dismiss the arbitrary treatment of select passengers as compliance with airline security regulations post-9/11. This policy is not effective and ultimately makes Americans feel marginalized in our own country. </p> <p> Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, or Mark for those that have trouble pronouncing his name, recalls his experience with Southwest Airlines as \u201ctearful and humiliating\u201d. Makhzoomi came to America after his father was executed in Iraq by Saddam Hussain: \u201cI experienced dictatorship in Iraq and now I am experiencing it in the freest country in the world.\u201d </p> <p>The discrimination Khairuldeen faced in Oakland, California, was anything but subtle. Khairuldeen detailed how he was removed from the aircraft, questioned by airline representatives and security, cornered against a wall, searched, sniffed by dogs in public and later interrogated privately by the FBI. Southwest Airlines representative and the authorities that removed him from the plane berated him for having spoken Arabic aboard the aircraft. Khairuldeen recalled the Southwest Airlines representative, stating: \u201cWhy would you speak that language knowing the environment in an airport?\u201d </p> <p>Khairuldeen said: \u201cI was excited because we were talking about my upcoming graduation from UC Berkley, saying \u2018inshallah\u2019. You know, we use this word 30 to 40 times in any given conversation.\u201d The rest of Khairuldeen\u2019s conversation revolved around what they served for dinner at an event he attended which hosted the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon. \u201cI was telling my uncle that they served us chicken, mash potatoes and spinach for dinner at the event,\u201d said Makhzoomi. Yet the authorities that escorted him and claimed to understand Arabic, accused him of \u201cdiscussing martyrdom\u201d in his telephone conversation. </p> <h2>An atmosphere of fear</h2> <p>Cenk Uygur, political commentator and co-founder of the Young Turks, believes that this issue goes beyond discrimination towards Muslims in particular. Uygur was also kicked off of an American Airlines flight but he doesn\u2019t believe it was because of religion. \u201cWas it religious? In my case, I don\u2019t think it was racially motivated.\u201d Uygur believes that the root of the matter boils down to power and compared airline attendant behavior toward Muslims since 9/11 to police officers abusing their authority and using excessive force on African Americans. \u201cAfter 9/11 airlines/flight attendants have taken up the \u2018I can do whatever I want attitude\u2019 in the name of security,\u201d Uygur says. \u201cIn my opinion, the core of the problem is flight attendants are given unlimited power and they tend to abuse it. They tend to use their power on those they perceive to be powerless. And unfortunately in America, the darker the skin color the more powerless you are. And many Muslims tend to fit in that category.\u201d </p> <p>He adds: \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s much harder on women, because they are more visibly Muslim and they often bear the brunt of the burden of Islamophobia or discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has given people permission to be Islamophobic and told them that it\u2019s okay to discriminate against Muslims. Trump basically says, \u2018If I become president I will systematically discriminate against them [Muslims],\u2019\u201d Uygur says.</p> <p>Likewise, Khairuldeen Makhzoomi attributed the recent rise in discrimination towards Muslims to Donald Trump, saying, \u201cTrump is using \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 to rise to political power.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s statements have fostered and further instigated an atmosphere of fear and prejudice towards the estimated 6-7 million Muslims in America. </p> <p>I\u2019m an American, and being labeled a safety threat is unacceptable in a country founded on tolerance and freedom. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Though the band\u2019s unyieldingly catchy, electro-influenced maximalism still drives most tracks \u2013 and anyone who denies that Bastille can write a hook is deluded \u2013 the album ripples with unease. Film obsessive Smith has slipped vintage movie samples into the songs, and even these point to his state of mind: for instance, Warmth starts with a male voice intoning \u201cGetting caught up in the circus-like atmosphere, feeling less responsible\u201d, and the track accordingly vibrates with the yearning for a safe haven. An Act of Kindness, warmed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsfftwLUf0\">Jungle-style harmonies</a>, is an emotional memory of feeling unworthy; the spaghetti-western ballad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSw25JvPB8o\">Two Evils</a>, is an affecting account of man-in-the-mirror self-confrontation, and also suggests they should do many more slowies. Guitars feature more heavily than on the debut album, further blurring the line between Bastille and fellow over-thinkers Coldplay, but Bastille have the edge in terms of unfeigned emotionalism. </p>",
  "<p> One network\u2019s pain is a rival network\u2019s joy. Seven\u2019s Sunday Night program has filmed an exclusive interview with Adam Whittington, the bloke who organised for Sally Faulkner\u2019s children to be abducted from a street in Beirut after they were taken to Lebanon by their father. The doomed abduction \u2013 organised with the help of Channel Nine \u2013 ended up with Faulkner, Whittington and two of his colleagues, the 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown and three other Nine crew members being jailed in Beirut on kidnapping charges.

But Seven was quick to dispel the notion that any chequebook journalism was involved, saying: \u201cSunday Night made no payment to Mr Whittington, his family or any other party for the interview. The fact that he wasn\u2019t paid will be disclosed in the program.\u201d Nine revealed in its financial results that the 60 Minutes incident along with two other court cases had cost the network an additional $7m in legal fees. <br></p> <h2>There\u2019s no such thing as a free launch</h2> <p>BuzzFeed\u2019s political editor, Mark Di Stefano, thought he was a very lucky first-time author when the politician he chose weeks ago to launch his book, the Labor senator Sam Dastyari, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/sam-dastyari-steps-down-from-labor-frontbench-over-donations-row\">became the man of the moment</a> and his launch was suddenly attracting more attention than it deserved. On the morning of the unveiling of Di Stefano\u2019s campaign diary, What a Time to Be Alive: That and Other Lies of the 2016 Campaign, Dastyari spoilt the party by pulling out. He was replaced by the Labor MP Terri Butler at the last minute. But Butler, who won Kevin Rudd\u2019s old seat of Griffith at the election, was so funny the crowd soon forgot all about Dastyari. BuzzFeed Australia\u2019s editor, Simon Crerar, revealed that when Di Stefano was the ABC\u2019s Darwin reporter he applied for a job at BuzzFeed by sending through his CV with a list of \u201cnine reasons why you should hire me\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Triple J, aka the decline of western civilisation</h2> <p> In other publishing news, the new book by the Australian\u2019s former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell will be launched by Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney this month.

This week\u2019s column in the Oz explored Mitchell\u2019s theory that Triple J is to blame for everything that is wrong with the media today, like young reporters having no corporate memory and the legacy of the \u201cskinny-tie political chic\u201d of Triple J alumni Steve Cannane, Angela Catterns, Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, Wil Anderson, Roy and HG and Robbie Buck. The Lateline host Tony Jones didn\u2019t work at Triple J, Mitchell says, but he is still annoying because he affects a \u201cTriple J kind of radical chic\u201d. Mitchell: \u201cLike [Chris] Kenny, I blame the ABC. In my view, the ABC has been slowly taken over from the inside, culturally at least, by Triple J.

  "<p>You won\u2019t find the word \u201cAutonomy\u201d anywhere in Micro Focus\u2019 27-page announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/uk-micro-focus-hewlett-packard-software-deal\">its $8.8bn (\u00a36.6bn) deal</a> to take control of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software division. The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/uk-independent-tech-firm-to-buy-part-of-hewlett-packard-micro-focus\">newest technology champion</a> isn\u2019t exactly crowing about reclaiming for the nation bits and pieces of a former famous member of the FTSE 100 index.</p> <p>The omission was wise. First, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s $11bn purchase of Cambridge-based Autonomy in 2011 was the deal that precipitated crises and write-offs at the US firm. The litigation continues, so best for Micro Focus to ensure it has the right legal protections in place and skirt around the contested claims.</p> <p>Second, old Autonomy is unrecognisable today. Many of its products for searching unstructured data have been incorporated into HPE\u2019s software offering. The Autonomy-related stuff represents only about a fifth of HPE\u2019s software division.</p> <p>Third, it would be misleading for Micro Focus to invoke the thrills and spills of the Autonomy era. Its own style is as dull as its name. Micro Focus occupies the unglamorous end of the technology industry, where the money is made by managing and updating legacy infrastructure. It is a fix-it merchant rather than a pioneer.</p> <p>There\u2019s no shame in that, of course, especially when your recent record is as impressive as Micro Focus\u2019s: the share price was 300p in 2011 and is \u00a322 now, up 15% on Thursday as investors applauded the swoop on a chunk of HPE.</p> <p>Enthusiasm is the right reaction if you believe scrutiny under the Micro Focus lens can turn profit margins at the business from 21% to 46% within three years. That\u2019s the promise from executive chairman Kevin Loosemore, who can point to similar surgery performed on past acquisitions.</p> <p>The difference this time is size. Micro Focus is grabbing control of a business bigger than itself. It is a \u00a35bn ($7bn) company making a $8.8bn deal. The complexities will inevitably be greater, but let\u2019s not knock the ambition. Loosemore and co have earned the right to play on a global stage and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/arm-shareholders-softbank-takeover-tech-lord-myners\">after the dispiriting sale of ARM Holdings to SoftBank for \u00a324bn</a>, it\u2019s good that a UK tech company can step up. A dull, but very worthy, deal.</p> <h2>Osborne\u2019s grand folly HS2 could be hitting the skids </h2> <p>\u201cOften it is modest, rapidly deliverable investments that can have the most immediate impact, particularly on the road network, but also in some places on the rail network,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">said Philip Hammond on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Was the chancellor hinting that HS2 will be ditched? Let\u2019s hope so. The economics of the proposed high-speed railway look more grotesque every time the sums are totted up. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, one of the UK\u2019s biggest investors in infrastructure, said the other day that he wouldn\u2019t dispatch a penny to HS2 because it is of \u201clittle economic benefit\u201d. </p> <p>In reply to a follow-up question from the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, Hammond said he is a great believer in the \u201cEddington principle\u201d that modest, easily deliverable projects are often the most worthwhile.</p> <p>Sir Rod Eddington, former boss of British Airways, wrote a report in 2006 for Darling, transport secretary at the time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/07/hs2-the-zombie-train-that-refuses-to-die\">Simon Jenkins\u2019 long read on HS2 in this paper in June</a> reminded us what it said: transport policy \u201cneeds to avoid wasting time and money pursuing alluring new super high-speed motorway or rail networks or pursuing <em>grands projets</em> with speculative returns.\u201d</p> <p>Go for it, chancellor: ditch George Osborne\u2019s grand folly.</p> <h2>Time for Sports Direct to spread the profits </h2> <p>One reason why Mike Ashley burns with resentment about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">exposure of pay and working practices</a> in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse may be that, in another corner of the business, his bonus arrangements for a couple of thousand permanent staff has been remarkably generous over the years.</p> <p>A few years ago Sports Direct was being lauded for a scheme whereby some employees, mostly in the stores and head office, were scooping tens of thousands of pounds. In 2013, a lucky \u2013 or hard-working \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/18/sports-direct-staff-bonus-profits\">2,000 staff shared a \u00a3100m payout</a> in the form of Sports Direct stock. In total, \u00a3250m has been distributed this way, as Ashley often likes to point out.</p> <p>The contrast between the treatment of permanent staff and those on zero-hours and agency contracts is stark. But, if Ashley is serious about reform, one idea should be obvious: distribute the spoils more evenly.</p> <p>Ashley used to say he wanted Sports Direct to be more like John Lewis (before alighting on Selfridges this week) and the bonus system at the employee-owned department store is worth studying: payments are declared annually as a percentage of salary.</p> <p>To work in practice at Sports Direct, many zero-hours and agency workers would have to join the regular payroll; at the moment, only 5,000 out of 27,000 staff are permanent full- or part-time employees. But, since Ashley says wants to boost the ratio of permanent employees, the stars could align.</p> <p>If Sports Direct was regularly distributing equally, say, 10% of its profits to, say, 20,000 staff, public perceptions might alter. The governance grumbles would still have to addressed, of course. But a fairer company-wide bonus scheme would be a start. Ashley, if he wanted to be outrageously cheeky, could even describe it as the logical extension of his original thinking.</p>",

Where anyone misbehaves, the whole contingent will be sent home, and in some cases individuals have been prosecuted in their home countries.</p> <p>But campaigners said this was just smoke and mirrors. \u201cThe problem is that the UN has a conflict of interest: it\u2019s allowed to police itself, and it\u2019s allowed to act as judge and jury,\u201d said Paula Donovan, co-director of <a href=\"http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/\">Aids-Free World</a>, an NGO that runs a campaign, <a href=\"http://www.codebluecampaign.com/\" draggable=\"true\">Code Blue</a>, on sexual abuse in the UN. </p> <p>Code Blue has called for independent organisations to be set up to receive, investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse by peacekeepers. Officials said this would be more cumbersome to implement than a UN-based team that already had the diplomatic status allowing it to act quickly.</p> <p>The summit, which UN undersecretary general, Herv\u00e9 Ladsous, described as the largest gathering in the history of peacekeeping, follows an event last year at which 50 nations pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/un-peacekeeping-obama-countries-pledge-troops-counterterror\">increase their contribution</a> to UN missions to deal with increasingly challenging and diverse threats. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" draggable=\"true\">Barack Obama</a> called on peacekeepers to play a more aggressive role, particularly on tackling Islamist insurgent forces in countries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia\" draggable=\"true\">Somalia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mali\" draggable=\"true\">Mali</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Delegates pledged more than 40,000 personnel \u2013 including soldiers and police officers \u2013 last year, on top of the 125,000 peacekeepers already operating around the world.

Currently it takes about six months to set up a peacekeeping mission, but pledges from last year\u2019s event and Thursday\u2019s summit mean the UN now aims to have a stock of pre-approved personnel so that it can deploy a \u201csubstantial brigade\u201d within 60 days. </p> <p>Britain has about 270 troops in a decades-long peacekeeping operation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cyprus\" draggable=\"true\">Cyprus</a>, and is now shifting its attention to Africa. Fallon announced on Thursday morning a planned deployment to South Sudan next year would now number 400 \u2013 up from 300 \u2013 along with about 40 personnel in Somalia. There are about 25 women involved in UK peacekeeping operations. Challenged on the comparatively small number of people the UK contributed, Fallon pointed out Britain was the sixth-largest financial contributor. </p>",

Reading a submission from the SNP \u2013 who now have some claim to being the UK\u2019s only modern political party \u2013 you get a sense of what that might mean.

I would like to thank Sir Peter Bazalgette for his fantastic energy and hard work in the role as he passes the baton to Nicholas.\u201d<br></p> <p>Serota, is the son of the late Labour peer Lady Beatrice Serota, who became deputy speaker of the Lords. His career has included running what is now Modern Art Oxford when he was in his 20s and the Whitechapel Gallery, where he was appointed director in 1976. He became director of the Tate in 1988.</p> <p>Serota joined the old Arts Council as a regional exhibitions officer in 1970, but it is a far bigger beast now. From 2015-18 ACE expects to invest \u00a31.1bn of public money and about \u00a3630m national lottery cash in the arts and culture sector. The most pressing issues it faces are a lack of diversity and an imbalance between spending in London and the regions. Plus what the consequences of Brexit will be on a sector which overwhelmingly wanted to remain in the European Union.</p> <p>The news was welcomed by ACE. Its chief executive, Darren Henley, said Serota was \u201ca visionary arts leader of immense national and international standing, whose cultural credentials are second to none\u201d.</p> <p>His start date in the \u00a340,000-a-year part-time role is 1 February.</p> <p>Tate said a search for Serota\u2019s replacement would begin immediately.

By forcing the UK to wait until it has pressed the button on Article 50, many believe Juncker has restricted its room for diplomatic manoeuvre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">What is article 50 and why is it so central to the Brexit debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The legal action is supported by some of the 1.2 million Britons who live abroad in other EU countries.

I have told all the directors-general that there cannot be any prior discussions with British representatives. No notification, no negotiation<em>.\u201d </em>The European Union has dismissed the challenge, saying that the decision not to negotiate until Article 50 has been triggered is an agreement between the other 27 remaining EU states.</p> <p>Fair Deal for Expats is also intervening in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court\">forthcoming judicial review in London, </a>due to take place in October, which is seeking to give parliament \u2013 as opposed to the prime minister \u2013 sole authority to trigger Article 50.</p> <p> John Shaw, a spokesman for Fair Deal for Expats, which is represented by the Cheltenham law firm Croft Solicitors, said: \u201cPeople in Britain and across Europe have become accustomed to Mr Juncker\u2019s antagonistic style and bombastic rhetoric. But his dictatorial-style bullying tactics will not be tolerated. Enough is enough.</p> <p>\u201cMr Juncker is urging Britain to trigger Article 50 sooner rather than later, but he\u2019s not entitled to issue edicts preventing the UK from having discussions with the commission. He\u2019s forgetting that the UK is still a member state.\u201d <br></p> <p>Patrick Green QC and Henry Warwick, barristers working on the claim, will argue that there is no such thing as a \u201cpresidential order\u201d and that either it has no legal force to stop commission staff entering into talks or else it is an abuse of Juncker\u2019s powers. Juncker, it is alleged, is preventing the UK from exercising its rights to begin discussions until British diplomats are at a diplomatic disadvantage.<br></p> <p>Fair Deal for Expats said: \u201cThe purpose of the challenge is to allow the UK to negotiate freely with the European commission before Article 50 is triggered, so that the outline terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU can be agreed in everyone\u2019s interests and as soon as possible.\u201d </p> <p>The organisation argues that Juncker is in contravention of the \u201cprinciple of sincere cooperation that the commission is required to abide by\u201d, that his order has no proper basis in law, and that it discriminates against the UK and its people, who remain EU citizens. </p> <p>The EU commission has claimed, according to Fair Deal for Expats, that the Juncker statement has been mistranslated. Juncker\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpresidential order\u201d has also been described as a loose figure of speech.<br></p> <p>A statement issued by the European commission said: \u201cPresident Juncker, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, the European parliament president, Martin Schulz, and a series of national leaders have all made clear that the legal ground for exiting the EU is Article 50 of the treaty and that negotiations begin after that is triggered. President Juncker has instructed commissioners and EC officials also to follow that principle.\u201d Juncker\u2019s comments were only intended to bind commission officials not other EU member states.</p>",

  "<p>Humans have destroyed a tenth of Earth\u2019s remaining wilderness in the last 25 years and there may be none left within a century if trends continue, according to an authoritative new study.<br></p> <p>Researchers found a vast area the size of two Alaskas \u2013 3.3m square kilometres \u2013 had been tarnished by human activities between 1993 and today, which experts said was a \u201cshockingly bad\u201d and \u201cprofoundly large number\u201d.<br></p> <p>The Amazon accounted for nearly a third of the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d loss, showing huge tracts of pristine rainforest are still being disrupted despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/07/amazon-deforestation-illegal-logging-brazil\">the Brazilian government slowing deforestation rates in recent years</a>. A further 14% disappeared in central Africa, home to thousands of species including forest elephants and chimpanzees.<br></p> <p>The loss of the world\u2019s last untouched refuges would not just be disastrous for endangered species but for climate change efforts, the authors said, because some of the forests store enormous amounts of carbon.<br></p> <p>\u201cWithout any policies to protect these areas, they are falling victim to widespread development. We probably have one to two decades to turn this around,\u201d said lead author Dr James Watson, of the University of Queensland and Wildlife Conservation Society.<br></p> <p>The analysis defined wilderness as places that are \u201cecologically largely intact\u201d and \u201cmostly free of human disturbance\u201d, though some have indigenous people living within them.

The trajectory of loss in the world\u2019s biggest rainforest was \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d, the authors warned, given it happened despite deforestation rates slowing.</p> <p>In Africa, none of the lowland forest in the western Congo basin is now considered globally significant wilderness, the study found. WWF believes the area is possibly home to more gorillas and chimpanzees than other area in the world.<br></p> <p>The study said that wilderness was being loss faster than pristine places were being designated as protected areas, at 3.3m sq km versus 2.5m sq km.<br></p> <p>Professor William Laurance of James Cook University said: \u201cEnvironmental policies are failing the world\u2019s vanishing wildernesses. Despite being strongholds for imperilled biodiversity, regulating local climates, and sustaining many indigenous communities, wilderness areas are vanishing before our eye.\u201d<br></p> <p>The study said the reason was that such areas are \u201cassumed to be relatively free from threatening processes and therefore are not a priority for conservation efforts\u201d.<br></p> <p>The ramifications of remaining wilderness being corrupted were wide-ranging and irreversible for both people and wildlife, Watson said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are four reasons why we need to protect these places. One is biodiversity, the second is carbon, the third is the poorest of the poor are living in them, and the fourth is this is a reference point for nature, of pre-human environments,\u201d he told the Guardian.<br></p> <p>The Earth\u2019s remaining wilderness areas are strongholds for many of the land-based mammals on the red list of endangered species, which was updated this week to reveal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/04/eastern-gorilla-critically-endangered-illegal-hunting-iucn-red-list\">four of the world\u2019s six great apes are now critically endangered</a>. </p> <p>Losing forests in these areas could also affect leaders\u2019 efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change, the study said, because of the amount of carbon stored in trees and peat.</p> <p>Rewilding plans by conservationists, similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/19/-sp-rewilding-large-species-britain-wolves-bears\">efforts to reintroduce wolves, lynx and other species to the UK</a>, could also be harmed by the loss of wilderness, because the world risked losing a true picture of what certain ecosystems looked like.<br></p> <p>\u201cWithout concerted preservation of existing wilderness areas, there will be a diminished capacity for large-scale ecological restoration,\u201d the authors wrote.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0ad235c15374f29a5775223c62cc3fed5fe6b54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0ad235c15374f29a5775223c62cc3fed5fe6b54/0_0_1600_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burnt alpine vegetation at the Lake Mackenzie fire, Tasmania, January 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burnt alpine vegetation at the Lake Mackenzie fire, Tasmania, January 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Blakers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson said unique ecosystems were being lost, and there was no turning back. \u201cWhat is critical about this paper is when you erode these wildernesses, they don\u2019t come back, you can\u2019t restore them. They will come back as something else, but you can\u2019t restore them,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The study, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30993-9\">published in the journal Current Biology on Thursday</a>, predicted that if current trends continue there could be no globally significantly wild areas left in \u201cless than a century\u201d.<br></p> <p>However, the mapping exercise found that there is still 30m sq km of wilderness globally, 23% of the world\u2019s land area. Strongholds include the boreal forests of northern Canada, Australia\u2019s deserts and western woodlands, some lowland forests in Asia and parts of central Africa.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey are the jewels in the crown. We have obligation to protect them in same way as we do species,\u201d said Watson.</p> <p>Stopping or slowing the loss of wilderness will require governments to put in place national strategies that recognise their value, the authors said. One Brazilian programme that supported the creation of protected areas to save carbon and help indigenous people was singled out as the type of project that could help address the decline. </p> <p>But the authors admitted that: \u201c[such] positive examples are too few, and we argue that immediate action to protect the world\u2019s remaining wilderness areas on a large scale is now necessary, including in global policy platforms.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, said: \u201cThis paper is a powerful reminder of the key role forests play on climate targets, and should be taken at heart by policymakers. Despite the recent drop in deforestation rates, Brazil is still the tropical country that most loses forests every year. </p> <p>\u201cOur Paris pledge on deforestation is shamefully weak - we are comformed with ending only illegal deforestation only by 2030 and only in Amazonia - and we don\u2019t even have a plan for achieving that little. Brazil will ratify the Paris agreement next Monday. If the government is serious about meeting the deal\u2019s long-term goal, it should be talking about zero deforestation.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Barrett, WWF-UK\u2019s director of science and policy, said: \u201cThis vast scale of loss in global wilderness is having grave impacts. As we seemingly enter the Anthropocene era, this report further signifies humanity\u2019s immense impact and the effects that is having for wildlife and people alike.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to the recent red list update which showed the situation of giant pandas improving, but said: \u201cWhile flagship species and habitats have an important role in tackling the biodiversity crisis, this alone won\u2019t solve the problem. We need significant changes in how we value our planet as at present we\u2019re taking relentlessly from our oceans, rivers, forests and wilderness.\u201d </p> <p>The study comes as the world\u2019s top conservationists conclude their <a href=\"http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/\">meeting in Hawaii this week</a> on dozens of motions for protecting wildlife, including restrictions on the trade in the pangolin, the world\u2019s most trafficked animal, and calls on governments to keep harmful activity such as oil drilling out of protected areas. </p> <p>Later this month governments are due to attend <a href=\"https://cites.org/cop17\">a major meeting in Johannesburg</a> to discuss the legal trade in endangered species, including the fate of the current international ban on the trade in ivory.<br></p>",
  "<p>Researchers have discovered there are not just one but four distinct species of giraffe, overturning two centuries of accepted wisdom in a finding that could boost efforts to save the last dwindling populations. <br> Analysis of DNA evidence from all of the currently recognised nine sub-species found that there is not just one species of giraffe but enough genetic differences to recognise four distinct species. Experts said the differences are as large as those between brown bears and polar bears.  Giraffe have suffered a decline in number from around 150,000 across Africa three decades ago to 100,000 today, as their habitat has been turned over to agriculture. But as a single species the giraffe is currently listed as of least concern on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/04/eastern-gorilla-critically-endangered-illegal-hunting-iucn-red-list\">red list of endangered species</a>, leaving the tallest living animals a relatively low conservation focus compared to rhino and elephant. <br> \u201cPeople need to really figure out that giraffes are in danger. There are only 100,000 giraffes left in Africa. We\u2019ll be working closely with governments and big NGOs to put giraffes on the radar,\u201d said Dr Julian Fennessy, lead author of the new study which saw genetic testing in Germany on 190 giraffe. </p> <p>The four recommended new species are the southern giraffe, with two subspecies, the Angolan giraffe and South African giraffe; the Masai giraffe; the reticulated giraffe; and the northern giraffe including the Kordofan giraffe and west African giraffe as subspecies. </p> <p>If formally recognised as four separate species, three of those four would suddenly be deemed more seriously threatened by the red list, Fennessay said, which would hopefully catalyse greater efforts to protect them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e78b953ffada87af15d5dba150c4d0c02167cb03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e78b953ffada87af15d5dba150c4d0c02167cb03/0_0_3351_2298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Masai giraffe, one of the four newly recognised species, grazing inside Nairobi national park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Masai giraffe, one of the four newly recognised species, grazing inside Nairobi national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the southern giraffe was increasing markedly in number, populations in east and central Africa were in trouble, he said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all habitat loss, fragmentation and a lot of that is, let\u2019s be honest, linked to human population growth \u2013 increasing land for agricultural needs, whether for commercial or for subsistence farming,\u201d he said, speaking from Windhoek, Namibia. \u201cIn some of these countries though there is illegal hunting or poaching causing the decline.\u201d</p> <p>Co-author Axel Janke, a geneticist at the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre and Goethe University in Germany, said: \u201cThis has huge implications for conservation. It\u2019s also significant from an evolutionary aspect: the giraffe is a very young species and we see evolution, becoming species, in real time, happening in front of our eyes.\u201d <br> Both said they were surprised at the number of genetically distinct species, because the currently recognised nine subspecies are relatively similar-looking. The most obvious differences are in the shape of their patterns and how far they extend, and how many horns the creatures have. </p> <p>The study also suggested that the four species do not mate with each other in the wild, an unexpected finding given giraffe move far and wide, and have been shown to interbreed in captivity. <br> The historically accepted definition of one species of giraffe was based on a description in 1758 by the Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, who examined a Nubian giraffe (now to be considered as a northern giraffe). The new study\u2019s discovery that there are in fact four will not come as a a total surprise to those who study giraffe closely \u2013 <a href=\"http://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-5-57\">previous research</a> has suggested some subspecies appeared genetically distinct enough to be considered separate species.<br> The conclusions of the study, which took five years, will be now be reviewed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s specialist group on giraffes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e8e8bafc4b4d46f17aa1d6e6d30dd694a5a2e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e8e8bafc4b4d46f17aa1d6e6d30dd694a5a2e3/0_0_5033_3369/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West African giraffe, a subspecies of northern giraffe, in southern Niger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West African giraffe, a subspecies of northern giraffe, in southern Niger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shanna Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement, the IUCN said: \u201cThe number of species of giraffes has come in for much discussion and debate in recent years. The findings of this latest study will need to be carefully evaluated, as it could - as the authors note - have considerable implications for their conservation. We know that giraffes, while widely distributed, are declining nearly across their range, with some narrowly distributed populations in serious trouble. </p> <p>\u201cIf the findings of the current study are accepted, then it may well be that some species would be listed in threatened categories on the IUCN red list. This would hopefully flag the need for increased attention on a species that is otherwise normally considered common.\u201d</p> <p>Fennessy, who is also co-director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, said: \u201cI would just hope that as the IUCN reviews this, they look at the fact 200 years ago people looked at giraffe coat patterns from samples sent from Africa and made a decision to call it one species and nine subspecies. And now, using nuclear mitochondrial and genomic DNA, I think more science can help us answer the mystery.\u201d<br></p> <p>The new study, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30787-4\">Multi-locus Analyses Reveal Four Giraffe Species Instead of One</a>, was published in the journal Current Biology on Thursday.</p>",

The existing rule fails according to its own objective: it does little to increase the diversity of Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu schools, because for now at least they are unlikely to appeal to parents of other faiths. But the rule is effectively discriminatory for Roman Catholics: it prevents them from opening new free schools because it is almost certainly <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2N.HTM\">against canon law</a> for a Catholic Bishop to set up a school that turned away Catholic pupils on the basis of their Catholicism. Given that there is growing demand for Roman Catholic schools, which are more likely to be ethnically diverse than other schools, more likely to be in poor areas, more likely to be rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted, and more likely to provide what parents want, the rule should be replaced by a legal duty on faith schools to ensure that their pupils mix \u2013 perhaps through sport, performing arts, or school visits \u2013 with children of other backgrounds.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3 - Making welfare more contributions-based.</strong> In another article Timothy said one problem with the Conservative election defeat of 1906 was that it led to plans for contributions-based welfare backed by his hero Joe Chamberlain being shelved.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 1906, MPs behaved as though their identities as free traders and tariff reformers were more important than as Unionists, and the consequences of their defeat continue to be felt even now. The Lloyd George \u2018People\u2019s Budget\u2019 of 1908 introduced a non-contributory pension system \u2013 unlike the contributions-based proposal made by Chamberlain that was rejected by Salisbury and Balfour \u2013 and our welfare state to this day remains non-contributory (a fact that is, coincidentally, relevant to the debate about EU nationals claiming benefits in Britain).</p> </blockquote> <p>As my colleague Heather Stewart has already reported, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/theresa-may-urged-revive-social-insurance\">May\u2019s new director of policy, John Godfrey, is also interested in social insurance systems that create stronger links between what individuals pay and the welfare they get. </a></p> <p><strong>4 - More housebuilding.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/03/nick-timothy-what-does-the-conservative-party-offer-a-working-class-kid-from-brixton-birmingham-bolton-or-bradford.html\">In another ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Often \u2013 on aspects of welfare reform, the increase in the minimum wage, and the investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the (excruciatingly badly-branded) Midlands Engine \u2013 the Government has got these calls right. But when it comes to energy policy, house building, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">high immigration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\">cuts to tax credits</a>, the protection of pensioner benefits, and the profile of spending cuts, it has not.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5 - A full inquiry into Orgreave. </strong>The Home Office is still considering calls for a full inquiry into Orgreave, but Timothy said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-as-with-hillsborough-we-must-get-to-the-bottom-of-what-happened-at-orgreave.html\">in a ConservativeHome article </a>he was in favour of a proper inquiry.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy needed to be reformed, the unions needed to be faced down, and unprofitable pits needed to be closed. But if the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are two ideas that Timothy strongly supports - but which May is much less likely to back because they would involve abandoning Conservative party manifesto promises.</p> <p><strong>6 - Getting rid of the \u201ctriple lock\u201d that ensure state pensions rise every year in line with growth or inflation or by 2.5%, whichever is higher.</strong></p> <p><strong>7 - Abandoning plans to lift the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\"> one ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The chancellor] could redistribute the welfare cuts to take the pressure off low-paid, working people. But the obvious alternative is already off the table: pensioner benefits are protected and so is the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which means that the state pension goes up by the highest out of the growth of wages, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Another option \u2013 to demonstrate that the Government really does value hard work above all else \u2013 is to stop the inheritance tax cut for estates valued between \u00a3650,000 and \u00a31 million. But that policy is not only a manifesto promise but a totem for the Conservative party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:50:37.251Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1697de4b07ac3d446a39c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T13:40:29.517Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sam Freedman</strong>, who used to be a policy adviser to Michael Gove when Gove was education secretary and he is now executive director at <strong>Teach First</strong>, the organisation that gets high-powered graduates into teaching, has put out a statement strongly criticising the plans to extend grammar schools.

Letwin said that he personally was \u201cperfectly content\u201d to see the government explore the idea of expanding them, but he also said he was \u201ccompletely agnostic\u201d about whether one type of school was necessarily better than another.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1430be4b08465d44fe9b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:08:11.900Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">5 thing we've learnt from Justine Greening's UQ on grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ministers are often hauled to the Commons to answer an urgent question (UQ) when the government has floated a policy idea in the media but has not yet made a formal announcement. That is exactly what happened today, when <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the shadow education secretary, was granted a UQ on the back of the Telegraph splash. Normally the minister just turns up and tells MPs to wait until the formal policy paper is published, and in many respects that\u2019s what <strong>Justine Greening,</strong> the education secretary, was doing today, but these sessions can be nevertheless be quite illuminating and today\u2019s certainly was. Here are five things we learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 - Theresa May\u2019s plan to \u201cbring back grammar schools\u201d is popular with Conservative MPs - but only up to a point.</strong> Most of the Tory MPs who spoke expressed support for grammar schools. But the very first backbencher to be called, and arguably the most important on this issue, <strong>Neil Carmichael</strong>, the Conservative who chairs the Commons education committee, expressed strong reservations. Telling Greening that the UK was well down the table in international literacy and numeracy league tables, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is absolutely necessary for any discussion about grammar schools to not distract us from that fundamental task that we have of improving social mobility and making sure that we have the best use of all of the talent across the whole country and not just talk about the few.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Desmond Swayne,</strong> a former PPS to David Cameron and certainly no Tory leftie, told Greening that he would not fancy having to face parents in his constituency who could not get their children into a local grammar school. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb#block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb\">11.14am.)</a> And<strong> Lucy Allan, </strong>another Conservative, demanded an assurance that there would be no return to the days of the 11-plus. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d#block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d\"> 11.07am.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Greening herself seems to sceptical about championing a grammar school renaissance.</strong> Some Labour MPs said they thought Greening sounded distinctly lukewarm about the policy she was supposed to be defending and they were right. Greening kept stressing the importance of having an open mind on the matter of educational reform and she said nothing to suggest that she is a grammar school enthusiast (while, quite cleverly, also avoiding sounding disloyal to May.) In fact, Greening even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cgrammar school\u201d, instead preferring to talk about selection.</p> <p><strong>3 - A full return to a grammar school system seems to be off the table - although the government is considering letting more grammar schools open and extending the principle of selection in state education. </strong>Greening was not specific about much, but she did make it very clear that the government was not planning a full return to the grammar/secondary modern era. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be no return to the simplistic, binary choice of the past where schools separate children into winners and losers, successes or failures. This government wants to focus on the future, to build on our success since 2010 and to create a truly 21st century schools system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And when asked if she would return to the days of the 11-plus, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can assure you that there will be no return to the past. This is about moving forward. This is about having a 21st century approach to our school system, precisely not one that is rooted in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Greening did say: \u201cWe do think selection can play a role.\u201d It could be that May is keen to talk about grammar schools is because the phrase is popular with the public. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361#block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361\">10.08am.) </a>But whether the government\u2019s proposals really do involve a large number of new grammar schools, in the traditional meaning of the word, remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>4 - </strong><strong>Labour is remarkably united in strongly opposing grammar schools. </strong>By my count only one Labour MP expressed some support for the government\u2019s idea (<strong>Kate Hoey</strong>) and otherwise it was striking how MPs from all wings of the party spoke out very strongly against the idea. <strong>Angela Rayner,</strong> the shadow education secretary, was particularly effective. She told Greening:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can you tell the House what evidence you have to support your belief that grammar schools will help disadvantaged children and close the attainment gap? At a time when our schools are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, with the thousands taught in super-sized classes and schools facing real-term cuts to their budget for the first time in nearly two decades, pushing ahead with grammar schools shows a dangerous misunderstanding of the real issues facing our schools.</p> </blockquote> <p>This makes it all the more surprising that Jeremy Corbyn chose not to raise the grammar school issue at PMQs yesterday. Perhaps he chose to avoid the subject because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3778820/Corbyn-s-team-attended-used-grammars-children.html\">his son attended one, and his head of strategy and communications Seumas Milne sent his children to grammar schools.</a> Given that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/13/uk.politicalnews2\"> Corbyn\u2019s second marriage broke up because he did not want his son to go to a grammar school</a>, he could argue that his opposition to grammar schools is so strong and sincere that it has led to great sacrifice. But it is understandable why someone very reluctant to discuss his family in public may have decided it was a subject best avoided at PMQs.</p> <p><strong>5 - T</strong><strong>he Tories will try to turn this into an issue of what works versus ideology. </strong>Greening did not really engage with the arguments raised about grammar schools and social mobility. Instead, she just argued that it was sensible to have a debate, and she accused Labour of being dogmatic. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be wrong to discount how we can improve prospects for those children, especially the most disadvantaged, purely because of political dogma. If Labour is not willing to ask itself these difficult questions, how can it possibly come up with any of the solutions? </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8/49_0_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Greening.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Greening answering the UQ on grammar schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:21:32.756Z\">at 1.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d14114e4b013613fffb3e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T10:49:10.638Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> on Justine Greening\u2019s UQ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/773821240209465344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Justine Greening sounding less-than-enthusiastic about grammars in House.

However, it is certainly interesting to note that public opinion is quite nuanced; when people were confronted with two counterarguments to grammar schools, support was in some cases strong. What does this mean for the overall stance of public opinion? It could mean two things: first, it could suggest that public opinion is malleable and that if parties opposed to new grammar schools exploit that malleability, the voters may be turned away from grammar schools. Alternatively, though, it could suggest that while voters are clearly aware of the counterarguments to grammar schools \u2013 and have some degree of affinity with them \u2013 this is already baked in to the polling numbers; in other words, that voters know the problems with grammar schools but feel overall that grammar schools should still be opened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Polling Digest also says that people \u201coverwhelmingly agree that grammar schools help academic success and increase social mobility\u201d. This is interesting because it is the exact opposite of what people who are experts in social mobility have been saying, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/07/former-tory-minister-grammar-schools-fail-disadvantaged-children\">David Willetts here,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\">Alan Miliburn here.</a> (Put more bluntly, the public are wrong.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d12605e4b0c1d95ae14883\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:50:26.205Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Sally Weale </strong>has written a very good article about what it is like for parents in Kent where children are sitting the 11-plus to see if they can get into grammar school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/kent-children-11-plus-government-plans-grammar-schools\">Kent children sit 11-plus as government plans new grammar schools</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d122efe4b0b2ee83376350\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:36:44.795Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is an urgent question on grammar schools in the Commons at 10.30am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/773794329462706176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UQ at 10.30 from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelaRayner\">@AngelaRayner</a> asking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustineGreening\">@JustineGreening</a> on Government plans to lift the statutory ban on opening new Grammar Schools in Eng</p>&mdash; Labour Whips (@labourwhips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/773794329462706176\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The speaker takes a dim view of ministers announcing policy on the front page of the Telegraph and not in the House of Commons chamber.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1213ce4b0b2ee83376349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:32:21.976Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tusk says UK should start Brexit talks with EU &quot;asap&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Tusk,</strong> the president of the European council, is meeting Theresa May in Number 10 this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798859067813888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meeting PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> to inform about EU27 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bratislavasummit?src=hash\">#Bratislavasummit</a> and discuss process for Brexit talks <a href=\"https://t.co/ANGuFY7wAC\">pic.twitter.com/ANGuFY7wAC</a></p>&mdash; Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798859067813888\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798947697659904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our goal to establish closest possible EU-UK relations.

She suggested that some of the government\u2019s 500 new free schools, announced by David Cameron shortly before he stepped down, could be grammars. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t want a situation where parents wanted a selective school only to be told they couldn\u2019t have one,\u201d a source at the meeting said. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Michael Fallon</strong>, the defence secretary, has been defending the government\u2019s plans this morning. But<strong> Nick Clegg</strong>, the former deputy prime minister and former Lib Dem leader, and<strong> Ed Balls,</strong> the former shadow chancellor, have both used interviews this morning to criticise the plans. Clegg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know they talked about grammar schools in their manifesto. They didn\u2019t talk about extending selection to free schools and so on, which seems to be now what they intend to do. This is the danger of having a new government with new leadership and new priorities, not elected by the people, now foisting their own evidence-free prejudices upon us. There\u2019s no evidence at all that that is the answer to many of the problems in our education system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Balls said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To tell a kid at 10 or 11, you\u2019re second best, they then have to arrive at that school and the teachers have a huge task to persuade them, you can still do well, you\u2019ve still got talent, you\u2019ve still got ability.

Perhaps a sly attempt to free up more assets eligible for purchase under the current quantitative easing structure.</p> <p> There were two main takeaways from today\u2019s ECB decision and press conference. The first is that inflation and growth forecasts were lowered but only marginally reflecting the negative, albeit less so than previously expected, impact of the Brexit vote. The other is that the committee has been given a full mandate to redesign QE. In other words, the central bank is approaching the point at which it will no longer be possible to carry out QE in its current form, but it is looking at ways to overcome it.</p> <p> That would explain why they did not announce an extension to the QE program beyond March 2017 today because they must first decide how the program will be adapted. That is not to say it won\u2019t be. In fact, Draghi made it clear that QE will continue, stating that it will run until or beyond the current expiry if necessary. He also claimed that it will run until inflation path is consistent with its goal, which it currently isn\u2019t close to.</p> <p> All things considered, today was not the event it was built up to be. However, it is clear that the ECB is working towards some significant changes to the QE program, even if that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more stimulus in the short term. Whether that takes three or six months isn\u2019t really too important.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d17697e4b013613fffb4e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:34:25.312Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a word cloud of Mario Draghi\u2019s statement, from Teneo Intelligence</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b8af86c9b7185ee9003a07bfd8a74aef85b27ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b8af86c9b7185ee9003a07bfd8a74aef85b27ca/0_0_622_388/500.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d16adce4b013613fffb4a4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:20:26.612Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Draghi's press conference: instant reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economics lecturer Daniel McLaughlin says investors go ahead of themselves this month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/drdanmclaughlin/status/773884435590701058\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Market had talked itself into belief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecb\">@ecb</a>  would act today so inaction a wake up call.

  "<p>The prime minister has said she wants to create a new generation of grammar schools, arguing that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/justine-greening-confirms-plan-lift-ban-grammar-schools-11-plus\">selective schools could return to British education and make the system more inclusive</a>, rather than exclusive.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But is it possible to create \u201cinclusive\u201d grammar schools when the objective of selective education is to separate children by ability? </p> <h2>Do they favour the better-off? </h2> <p>In the past few years, many of the 163 remaining grammar schools in England, under pressure to improve social diversity in their intake, have been looking at ways to become more inclusive, and break the middle-class stranglehold on selective state education.</p> <p>One of the criticisms grammar schools face is that they favour the better off because of their reliance on entrance examinations such as the 11-plus to select pupils, many of whom will be privately tutored to prepare them for the test.</p> <p>In response, a number have rewritten their admissions codes to discriminate in favour of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and thus increase social diversity in their schools. Others have introduced what is described as a \u201ctutor-proof\u201d test, so that children who cannot afford private tuition are not at a disadvantage.</p> <p>According to the Sutton Trust, which works to advance social mobility through education, currently fewer than 3% of entrants to grammar schools are entitled to free school meals, a measure of social deprivation, while almost 13% of entrants come from outside the state sector, assumed to be mainly fee-paying preparatory schools.</p> <p>Around a third of grammar schools now prioritise disadvantaged pupils, among them the King Edward VI Foundation in Birmingham which runs five grammar schools in the city. Three years ago the foundation decided to reserve 20% of its places for pupil premium children (ie children from disadvantaged backgrounds who attract additional funding).</p> <p>In addition it decided to set a slightly lower qualifying score for those children who may have been held back by educational disadvantage, but still have the ability to thrive in a competitive grammar school environment. Three years on, the schools have a far higher proportion of children from disadvantaged backgrounds than before.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a starting point,\u201d says the executive director Heath Monk. \u201cIt\u2019s still a competitive test and you either get in or you don\u2019t. But it\u2019s not just changing the admissions arrangements; we\u2019ve also been working with primary schools, children and parents to remove perceived barriers to coming to a selective school.\u201d</p> <h2>Can entrance exams return? </h2> <p>One of the key problems grammar schools have faced is getting children from hard-to-reach communities to even sit the test, let alone pass. In order to help address that, the foundation runs masterclasses and familiarisation programmes in local primary schools so children are exposed to the test. It also promises to support transport and uniform costs, as well as contributing towards music tuition and trips, \u201cto make sure children from more disadvantaged areas don\u2019t feel: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not the school for me\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>These measures may go some way to addressing Theresa May\u2019s demands for more inclusive grammar schools. But according to Anna Vignoles, a Cambridge professor who studies the interaction between social mobility and education, even when there were large numbers of grammar schools they never achieved high levels of participation by students from poorer backgrounds.</p> <p>\u201cBy definition the grammar school system is designed to select a group of students by a test,\u201d said Vignoles. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely elitist at the moment because there are not many grammar schools. If you increase the number of grammar schools dramatically, you would reduce some of the pressure and you would expect to see some improvements in the social representation of people going to grammar schools.</p> <p>\u201cBy dramatically, I mean if you put a grammar school in every town and district, then you might be taking the top 20% of pupils on the basis of the test, whereas at the moment you are taking the top 1-3% in some areas. So it\u2019s certainly true there will be less pressure on individual schools.\u201d</p> <p>But, she says, we still end up with a system which separates the top fifth from the rest. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you define that as inclusive.\u201d</p> <p>As for the \u201ctutor-proof\u201d 11-plus, judging by the booming private tuition industry, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/sharp-rise-in-children-receiving-private-tuition\">detailed in a Sutton Trust report</a> on Thursday, it would suggest that parents still feel it\u2019s worth forking out to give their child the best possible advantage. \u201cI imagine it would be quite hard to come up with a test that was tutor proof,\u201d says Vignoles.</p> <p>She agrees that grammar schools have been taking steps to attract more children from poorer backgrounds, but the problem is complex because disadvantage sets in at an early age.</p> <p>Children still have to pass the test, and those from wealthier backgrounds start to pull away in terms of their test scores and achievement, so that by the age of 11 there is already a gap. Add in some tutoring and cramming by middle-class families \u2013 as well as a reluctance by disadvantaged families to apply \u2013 and the social representation in grammar schools is further skewed.</p> <h2>Do grammars breed social segregation? </h2> <p>Vignoles agrees with May that there is already social segregation within the school system. A recent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/07/quarter-families-buy-rent-new-home-secure-school-place\">Santander report </a>suggested London parents were willing pay a premium of more than \u00a370,000 to buy a house close to a good school. \u201cIt\u2019s true there is selection by mortgage and parents move to be near good schools,\u201d says Vignoles. \u201cBut the introduction of grammar schools is not going to introduce a mechanism to make that better.\u201d</p> <p>Because it\u2019s not just about grammar schools, it\u2019s about the other schools \u2013 once known as secondary moderns \u2013 that educate the children who don\u2019t go to grammars. Among the many concerns for parents is that the best teachers will be drawn away from those schools, attracted by high-ability grammars and easy-to-teach pupils. </p> <p>For Stephen Gorard, professor of education at the University of Durham, the evidence shows decisively that any appearance of advantage for those attending selective schools is outweighed by the disadvantage for those who do not.</p> <p>\u201cMore children lose out than gain, and the attainment gaps between highest and lowest and between richest and poorest are larger.\u201d</p> <p>In order for selection by ability to be considered ethical, Gorard says, three things need to be established. Selective schools must be shown to be more effective than non-selective ones; \u201cthe largely disregarded rump of such a system\u201d, ie the secondary modern schools, must be shown to be at least as effective as non-selective schools, and the overall benefits must outweigh any unintended harmful side effects.</p> <p>\u201cNone of these three things has been established. Given the dangers, and the lack of evidence of any benefit at all, selection by ability is currently the very antithesis of an evidence-informed policy.\u201d</p>",

Thus the fear is the 400 British troops already deployed or soon to arrive will be sucked into an unpredictable political and military morass.</p> <p>The government spokesman Michael Makuei said key issues regarding the protection force were unresolved. \u201cWe need to agree on armament, on deployment, on the timeframe \u2026 If we don\u2019t agree, nobody will enter South Sudan. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southsudan-security-un-idUSKCN11B22H\">Anybody who enters without our consent is an invader</a>,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"405c8a1b386b9bb88cabc21f57205587e95c391b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/405c8a1b386b9bb88cabc21f57205587e95c391b/0_103_4213_2528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salva Kiir, South Sudan\u2019s president.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salva Kiir, South Sudan\u2019s president, with Samantha Power and members of a UN security council delegation in Juba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lynch/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, who led a security council delegation to Juba at the weekend, reportedly exchanged sharp words with Kiir over the security situation. During the July fighting, several senior US diplomats <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/06/dinner-drinks-and-a-near-fatal-ambush-for-u-s-diplomats/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&amp;utm_term=Flashpoints\">narrowly escaped death after their convoy was shot at</a> by Kiir\u2019s presidential guard. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to want to see a significant acceleration in operational discussions about the deployment of the force,\u201d Power said. \u201cThere are very conflicting signals because there are some who, if they had a choice, would expel UNMISS [the UN peacekeepers] tomorrow,\u201d Power said.</p> <p>Having played a lead role in facilitating South Sudan\u2019s independence and providing billions in aid, the US and Britain have responsibility for preventing a descent into chaos. But the bitter conflict pitting Kiir and his Dinka tribal base against his former vice-president, Riek Machar, and his Nuer allies is far from over.</p> <p>Machar fled to Khartoum following the July clashes, while his rebel SPLA-IO forces are concentrated in the Equatoria and Upper Nile regions. Ministers <a href=\"https://tamazuj.atavist.com/makuei-and-lomuro-hint-at-objectives-for-next-military-offensives\">have been talking of new military offensives to \u201celiminate\u201d the rebels</a>, who are supported by the Sudan government of Omar Bashir.</p> <p>Kiir\u2019s backers also suspect the UN and Ethiopia, a US ally, of favouring Machar. For this reason, proposals backed by the regional power bloc, IGAD, that Ethiopian troops join the Juba protection force could prove counterproductive. South Sudan has recently cosied up to Eritrea, Ethiopia\u2019s foe, which is viewed as a rogue state in the west.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b277b0a475f5570fd4512517a2b7d92250530f2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b277b0a475f5570fd4512517a2b7d92250530f2a/0_155_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Displaced people walk next to a razor wire fence at the UN compound in Juba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Displaced people walk next to a razor wire fence at the UN compound in Juba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Patinkin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The proposed new force would protect the UN mission, western embassies and aid workers, up to a point, but may do nothing to help South Sudanese victims of the war.

But it might begin afresh now and there can be cause for optimism that the sport might, for the first time in a long time, be looking firmly into the future.</p> <p>Ecclestone\u2019s control forged its past. When he took over in the late 1970s, the sport was certainly popular but largely among aficionados. Nor was it alone: Group C sports car racing was huge and a real competitor to F1. TV coverage was being sold on a race\u2011by\u2011race basis and the sport\u2019s financing, like many involved in it, was amateur. Ecclestone turned it professional. He saw off the sports cars and established F1 as the single, globally recognised racing series, ensuring that status was no mere ephemera but that it turned into money to bankroll the teams, the owners and the growth of the sport itself.</p> <p>In 2001 he bought the commercial rights to F1 for 100 years from the FIA for $360m, a deal so fortunate and, it must be said, woefully undervalued that everyone wanted a piece of the action. By 2003, the sport\u2019s income was $729m, with CVC buying it in 2006. By last year its income had risen to $1.8bn. These are the numbers that led to the deal dominating recent headlines far beyond the racing. These are the numbers Ecclestone brought to F1. But what is likely to be the most profitable deal in CVC\u2019s history also had a price.</p> <p>CVC stayed out of F1\u2019s management, leaving Ecclestone to do what he does best, making vast sums of money (the company had an $8.2bn return on its investment by 2014) from the two main sources of revenue: the sale of TV rights and the hosting fees charged to circuits. This took F1 to countries more interested in the value to their regimes than in the racing, and to pay-to-view TV. There was also a rather less edifying result \u2013 a drop in the global TV audience from 600 million to 400 million since 2008.</p> <p>F1 was paying out as dutifully as ever but CVC was putting nothing back in. In 2013 Force India\u2019s deputy team principal, Bob Fernley, said the company was \u201craping the sport\u201d and that it was \u201cthe worst thing that has ever happened to Formula One\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile the world had accelerated into the digital revolution. Famously Ecclestone has no interest in social media, unable to see how it might turn into a profit, and F1\u2019s presence on the new platforms has been minimal. This, allied to the declining viewing figures, suggested the sport was mortgaging its future for short-term returns. Liberty, it seems, has more in mind.</p> <p>F1\u2019s new chairman, Chase Carey, who was the vice-chairman of 21st Century Fox, is known to be a sports fan and was key in pushing Fox to focus on sports coverage. He is bringing all the right noises to the sport. As expected, expansion, promotion and use of digital content are all being pushed, but Carey is doing so with the backing of a media company, not a private equity firm. If Liberty\u2019s intent is real, F1 could not have found a more suitable partner.</p> <p>The 62-year-old Carey <a href=\"http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/new-f1-chief-promises-bigger-than-ever-sport-for-fans-and-teams-820386/\" title=\"\">told Motorsport.com</a>: \u201cThe opportunity is to grow and develop this sport for the benefit of the fans, teams, partners and our shareholders by increasing promotion and marketing of Formula One as a sport and brand.\u201d That is a proposal against which there will be no argument from any of the groups he&#xa0;cites.</p> <p>Indeed, Liberty has already said it wants the teams to be part of the investment, a stake that would, regardless of its insignificance, at least be a start. The company will not change the current agreement on how much money the teams receive but its willingness to work with the key players to help the sport grow in pursuit of greater revenue for all is a key step.</p> <p>Equally, fans long dismayed by the sport\u2019s march to soulless enormodromes in the desert might take heart. \u201cI want to be clear that, certainly, the established markets \u2013 the home and foundation of Formula One in Europe in particular \u2013 are of critical importance,\u201d said Carey. \u201cBuilding the sport in Europe, building on that foundation, has got to be second to none. We do want to take advantage of the global footprint of this sport, we want to focus on it.\u201d</p> <p>Again, few will dispute that fortifying the bulwark of the sport makes sense but ambition to expand is also in evidence. \u201cIn the longer term, markets like the US and key Asian markets are opportunities to develop. We\u2019re not going to do that overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are huge audiences there. If we reach them using digital platforms and some of the tools that haven\u2019t been exploited aggressively, we can build a whole new generation of fans.\u201d</p> <p>Bold plans, then, that are receiving a broadly positive response. But the ink is barely dry and there should be no underestimation of Carey\u2019s credentials as a hard-nosed business man. Liberty did not engage in an $8bn takeover to lose money.</p> <p>How to ensure the bottom line but move on from F1\u2019s current model is the task that lies ahead. Ecclestone, who has played F1\u2019s money game for so long and will continue to broker TV and track deals, was quick to point out what is a very realistic and sobering reality. \u201cCVC&#xa0;bought the company to make money, and that will be the intention of Liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking at it as a hobby.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The harm we cause one another \u2013 casually, accidentally, deliberately, unknowingly \u2013 haunts Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s mind. Her debut novel, Harmless Like You, which sparked a fierce bidding war among publishers, takes its title from a photography series that Yuki, one of Buchanan\u2019s main characters, puts together in the early 1970s. The series is made up of pictures taken on the sly of girls around New York City: brown, black, Asian girls, and one of a white American darling, complete with ringlets, rosy cheeks and a copy of the 11 June 1972 edition of the New York Times, with the now-famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/40-years-since-saigons-fall-napalm-attack-haunts-woman-in-iconic-image\">Napalm Girl</a>, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, on the front cover. </p> <p>The title of Yuki\u2019s series, in turn, comes from something her lover Lou says to her: \u201cI think the real cowards are the ones over there killing harmless little girls like you.\u201d It is a painful comparison; not only is Yuki Japanese, not Vietnamese, but he is grossly underestimating her.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of harmlessness is fascinating to me,\u201d Buchanan says. \u201cA bully will call something harmless teasing or a little harmless fun, when actually it\u2019s hugely harmful.\u201d Lou is a bully, but familiar pain is far more comforting to Yuki than unfamiliar tenderness. Though Yuki spends most of her youth in the US, her Japanese father spent time in an internment camp, and still hates the States. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of what the book is about is how pain shape-shifts down the generations. There is nothing more personal than family, and yet families are so profoundly affected by political decisions,\u201d Buchanan says. Yuki, an American citizen, remains in the US when her parents return to Japan, determined to finish high school and attend college, but instead drops out and begins a job that fills her days with fluff. She is rootless, even when she finds herself a home of sorts with Lou, surrounded by people who look nothing like her.</p> <p>Buchanan, daughter of a Japanese-Chinese American mother and white British father, used to only write white characters. \u201cThe standard character was a white person,\u201d she says. \u201cI get really excited when I read writers who write people who, let\u2019s be honest, don\u2019t have my exact racial makeup but who are mixed-up in that way. I wanted to start writing characters like that.\u201d But she discovered an unseen challenge while writing short stories: a simple last name provided no clues for readers to imagine ethnicity or background. \u201cYou end up having to give these mini-histories. It can be quite challenging, especially in a short story, to get that information across in a way that feels natural.\u201d</p> <p>In Harmless Like You, Buchanan had a whole novel in which to explore Japanese-American Yuki and her son, Jay. Both characters look for ways to reconcile themselves with their histories, though in vastly different and sometimes opposing ways. Yuki left her parents voluntarily; but Jay, a toddler when Yuki leaves, is half-orphaned through no choice of his own. Where Yuki\u2019s introspection is focused on the harm she causes to the world, even while being harmed constantly, Jay sees the harm others inflict on him \u2013 his mother, his father, his wife, even his newborn daughter.</p> <p>When asked whether the political messaging that comes through from these events \u2013 hereditary trauma, the politics of motherhood, the gender politics that shadow women who leave their family and men who become a single dad \u2013 Buchanan demurs: \u201cTo borrow the 1960s and 70s feminist slogan, the personal is political. It wasn\u2019t that I tied the personal to the political, it was that I couldn\u2019t tear them apart.\u201d</p> <p>Like her characters, Buchanan inherited her sense of home from her family. Her father, of Scottish heritage, grew up in England. Her Japanese and Chinese grandparents met in the US and stayed there, as in their countries it would have been harder to get married, unlike in New York where, as Buchanan\u2019s grandmother put it, \u201cJews were marrying Catholics\u201d. Her American mother moved to England to be with Buchanan\u2019s father, and she \u201cmissed New York a lot. A lot, a lot,\u201d Buchanan stresses. </p> <p>And so Buchanan spent her life living alternately in London and New York, each time missing the other place, feeling as if there was more home there than here. \u201cOn the good days, I feel like I have many homes. On the bad days, I feel like I have no home,\u201d she says. When she talks, her speech works musically between accents, often affected by the country she\u2019s in (though she does, she admits, sound more British when cross).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20d97b8a1f6da22781e5cde9b060c68e06e8124f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20d97b8a1f6da22781e5cde9b060c68e06e8124f/1442_0_3072_3840/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, pictured at the 2016 Edinburgh international books festival.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, pictured at the 2016 Edinburgh international books festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several years ago, Buchanan\u2019s mother was affected by something called transient global amnesia. \u201cShe woke up one morning and forgot where she was, her age, the year, the country. She was in London. I was in New York. We didn\u2019t know it was TGA then.\u201d Buchanan laughs; once they found out what it was, she and her family agreed that it sounded like \u201ca really bad budget airline\u201d. TGA causes sudden memory loss and symptoms similar to an epileptic seizure or stroke. The syndrome\u2019s name is strangely apt: Buchanan\u2019s mother, like her daughter, is transient, visiting the US often, travelling across the globe between each of the two places she\u2019s called home. But it wasn\u2019t so much her life \u2013 though Yuki is Buchanan\u2019s mother\u2019s age \u2013 but rather the fear of her mother not existing any more that began the gestation of Harmless Like You. </p> <p>\u201cI thought I might have lost my mother,\u201d Buchanan says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave the apartment. I sat by my phone and freaked out. I didn\u2019t understand who I would be if she\u2019d never been in my life. Later, when I found out my mother was OK, I started to write a very different story \u2013 one where the mother does leave.\u201d</p> <p>In the month since the novel came out in the UK, Buchanan has been experiencing her own desertion issues. The book\u2019s cover features Yuki\u2019s face with a paint splatter blurring out her eyes. \u201cEvery time I see her in a bookshop, I feel like I\u2019m abandoning her. That I\u2019ve left her exposed in the playground, to see if people will like her, want to be her friend or ignore her and leave her alone,\u201d Buchanan laughs. \u201cI recognise this is totally psychologically revealing of me more than of her.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Harmless Like You (Sceptre, RRP \u00a314.99) is available from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harmless-like-you.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a> for \u00a312.29.</li> </ul>",

The tectonic plates of London clubland are constantly shifting. It is in the nature of even the best clubs to rise and fall as tastes change. Fabric, however, wasn\u2019t falling. It was pushed. And it was pushed by the authorities, on flimsy evidence.

The number of licensed clubs in Britain fell from 3,144 in 2005 to 1,733 in 2015 and the capital is far from immune. In a statement on Wednesday, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/fabrics-licence-revoked\">said</a>: \u201cOver the last eight years, London has lost 50 per cent of its nightclubs and 40 per cent of its live music venues. This decline must stop if London is to retain its status as a 24-hour city with a world-class nightlife.\u201d The timing is poignant for Khan, who has begun his term with the launch of the night tube and plans to appoint a night tzar to ensure London is a safe and thriving 24-hour city. The mayor has no power to overturn the ruling but has expressed his disappointment that \u201cthousands of people who enjoyed going to Fabric as an essential part of London\u2019s nightlife will lose out\u201d. He should know. As a young man, he went to Fabric himself.</p> <p>Anyone who has ever spent a memorable night at a club knows how important they are to the life of a city. A good club fosters community, solidarity, liberation and a sense of collective joy. It is a space where you might find your identity, meet new friends, fall in love or be inspired to make music yourself. Clubs are transformative places \u2014 the kind of benign melting pots that cities aspire to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f506801646121a0d505e7b98b51acb541438b9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f506801646121a0d505e7b98b51acb541438b9e0/0_711_4460_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric, London club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clubs give a city its night-time pulse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even those who have never stepped on to a sweaty dancefloor in their lives can appreciate what they give to a city. Clubs help to revive moribund areas: Shoreditch was a dead zone after dark before The Blue Note opened in 1993. They attract hordes of international visitors, so-called \u201ctechno tourists\u201d. They give a city its night-time pulse. After the Brexit vote, London needs to reassert its cosmopolitan credentials, hence Khan\u2019s slogan London Is Open, which makes the city\u2019s growing intolerance towards club culture feel even more like an act of self-mutilation.</p> <p>\u201cLandmark clubs are evidence of creativity and energy in a city,\u201d says Dave Haslam, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/10/life-after-dark-history-british-nightclubs-dave-haslam-review\">Life After Dark: A History of British Nightclubs and Music Venues</a>. \u201cThey bring people from all parts of the country and all nations. It\u2019s to do with the profile and credibility of a city. Britain is renowned for popular culture and nightlife. If the authorities close down clubs, then they\u2019re threatening that credibility. This is like the main ship in the fleet being sunk.

The superclub bubble was bloated to bursting point. Fabric survived the dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/killjoy-councils-student-debt-and-stolen-phones-the-slow-death-of-british-clubs\">post-millennium contraction</a> that claimed behemoths including <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OfficialCream/\">Liverpool\u2019s Cream</a> because it had the scale of a superclub but a connoisseur\u2019s mentality, famed for its cutting-edge, bass-heavy sound system and forward-thinking lineups. \u201cFabric was actually the antidote to superclubs,\u201d says Cameron Leslie, who co-founded the club with Keith Reilly. \u201cIt\u2019s always been an incubator and a platform for artists. We\u2019ve never chased stars.\u201d</p> <p>Fabric continued to thrive when many other beloved London clubs fell by the wayside, avoiding bankruptcy in 2010 and a threat to its licence in 2014. With West End clubs all but wiped out by Crossrail, residential developments and rent hikes, it was one of the few significant clubs left in zone one. \u201cWhen I grew up, you could go to amazing clubs in central London,\u201d says Benji B. \u201cMy musical DNA was created by The End, Bagleys, the Velvet Rooms \u2026 I realise now I was incredibly spoilt because my generation had all of these options.\u201d</p> <p>Now Fabric has joined that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/what-happened-to-the-great-london-nightclubs\">roll call of clubland\u2019s fallen</a>. The sudden, unnecessary loss of a commercially flourishing club is particularly painful when club promoters are fighting a war on several fronts. One is economic. Financial pressures such as rising rents and student debt make expensive clubs less attractive to people who can drink and dance more frugally at late-opening pubs and bars. The proliferation of festivals offers more bang for your buck and a less regulated environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"169797a04c8da29683c382c416eeed9add5062c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169797a04c8da29683c382c416eeed9add5062c7/0_345_5296_3178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnmills, the Farringdon club that has been replaced by an office block.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnmills, the Farringdon club that has been replaced by an office block.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liat Chen/PYMCA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another threat is the cash-crazed development binge that is rendering parts of London unrecognisable. As the value of real estate rockets, the expiry of a club\u2019s lease can spell the end. Fabric\u2019s erstwhile Farringdon neighbour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/13/trade-club-london-after-hours-scene-25-anniversary\">Turnmills</a> has been replaced by an office block, and Manchester\u2019s late, lamented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/02/how-we-made-hacienda-club\">Hacienda</a>, has been replaced by luxury flats. Now some fear that Fabric\u2019s site is destined for the same fate. Even a high-end development springing up close to a club can be dangerous, guaranteeing noise complaints from the new neighbours. \u201cClubs have traditionally moved into underpopulated, derelict areas and created a sense of life,\u201d says Haslam. \u201cThey\u2019re often the pioneers who take the risk. If that area then becomes more appealing and ripe for exploitation, then big business moves in and the club becomes surplus to requirements.\u201d</p> <p>As if the market weren\u2019t treacherous enough, promoters are facing growing hostility from councils and the Metropolitan police if there is a whiff of trouble.

You\u2019d cease to have any form of nightlife in Britain.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How, in 2016, can the obvious economic and cultural value of a flagship club be disregarded so readily?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Leslie believes Fabric has been unfairly scapegoated and doesn\u2019t understand why, after so many years, the authorities have taken such a punitive line: \u201cIt feels absolutely unjust.\u201d Until recently, the club had been widely admired for the professional way in which it handled 350,000 clubbers a year \u2014 the equivalent of two Glastonbury festivals \u2014 amounting to 6.7 million over the club\u2019s lifetime. Of those, six have died on the premises. \u201cWe all think of Fabric as the gold standard of how to run a club,\u201d says Proud. \u201cIt was a wonderful environment.\u201d</p> <p>Yet now the police are describing it as a \u201csafe haven\u201d for drug use where \u201cfurther drugs-related deaths will inevitably follow\u201d. The recent rhetoric is a throwback to the moral panics surrounding the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/23/acid-house-dawn-rave-new-world\">acid house boom in 1988</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/criminal-justice-public-order-act\">Criminal Justice Act in 1994</a>. The subcommittee even briefly considered the dubious theory that faster rhythms encourage more drug-taking, echoing the Criminal Justice Act\u2019s infamous reference to \u201crepetitive beats\u201d. How, in 2016, can the obvious economic and cultural value of a flagship club be disregarded so readily? Perhaps, in an age of austerity, policing nightclubs is considered too expensive and too complicated, and it is easier just to shut them down. \u201cThey simply don\u2019t know how to deal with the challenges of the night-time economy and see Fabric, myopically, as a crime generator,\u201d says Leslie. \u201cTheir objective is: shut the club down and the crimes go away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5d7f45d73ef968df4685925876779fc893fb131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d7f45d73ef968df4685925876779fc893fb131/0_243_5189_3114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flats built on the site of the famous Manchester club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flats built on the site of the famous Manchester club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, closing a club doesn\u2019t reduce drug use; it simply disperses it. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/10/glasgow-arches-club-goes-into-administration-and-is-set-to-close\">longrunning Glasgow club The Arches</a> was forced into administration by the council\u2019s draconian removal of its late licence, despite its commitment to body searches, strict security within the club and paramedics. Glaswegian clubbers have since turned to illegal parties with none of those measures. It is equally unlikely that Fabric\u2019s closure will inspire anybody to eschew drugs for ever.</p> <p>The hole that Fabric\u2019s demise leaves in the clubbing landscape could conceivably be filled by a new club but there is little incentive to invest in one. Why sink millions of pounds into developing a new venue, knowing that it could be shut down by a single fatality or police raid? Even if you had deep pockets and a strong spine, it would be hard to find a viable space in the centre of town. \u201cA lot of people think maybe running a club in London is just too much trouble,\u201d says Proud.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clubbers come to London specifically to do Ministry of Sound and Fabric.

Fabric can legally appeal Islington council\u2019s decision but it may not be able to afford to.

  "<p>It\u2019s probably just as well the Manchester derby is happening so early in the season.

If their rivalry is to be apocalyptic, it\u2019s fitting that their first crossing of Mancunian swords should happen in Manchester and should be meaningful.</p> <p>For Mourinho and Guardiola, the season has begun relatively sedately, the only real hint of controversy coming in their decisions that, respectively, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/bastian-schweinsteiger-jose-mourinho-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Bastian Schweinsteiger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/joe-hart-torino-excited-test-serie-a-transfer-window-manchester-city\" title=\"\">Joe Hart</a> have no place in their sides. Both have been relatively consistent with selection. Neither has done anything extreme. The sense has been of a mild clearing of throats, a gentle warming up, a reluctance to show too much of a hand too soon.</p> <p>Mourinho has selected the same lineup for each game with only one exception, Paul Pogba coming in for Ander Herrera in the deep-lying midfield role alongside Marouane Fellaini. The shape has remained 4\u20112\u20113\u20111 but this is the big test of Mourinho\u2019s faith in Wayne Rooney. So far, he has insisted the England captain will not be used in midfield but it may be he decides he needs a third central midfielder.</p> <p>Mourinho\u2019s first two meetings with Guardiola came in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-internazionale-champions-league\" title=\"\">Champions League semi-final in 2010</a>; he was at Internazionale and Guardiola was at Bar\u00e7a.

When he tried to press high with a 4-2-3-1 in his first <em>cl\u00e1sico</em>, though, his new Real Madrid side was picked apart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/29/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga\" title=\"\">hammered 5-0</a>. It was then that he switched to a 4-3-3, his <em>trivote</em> of holding midfielders designed to protect the back four and prevent Bar\u00e7a hitting their passing rhythms. The result was that poisonous series of games when they met four times in 17 days in the spring of 2011. Madrid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/21/real-madrid-barcelona-copa-del-rey\" title=\"\">won the Copa del Rey final</a>, drew in the league game and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/27/real-madrid-barcelona-champions-league\" title=\"\">lost the first leg of the Champions League semi-final 2-0</a> before reverting to 4-2-3-1 to try, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/03/barcelona-real-madrid-champions-league1\" title=\"\">unsuccessfully, to salvage the second</a>.</p> <p>But thereafter, Mourinho played the <em>trivote</em> only once against Guardiola: five games using it yielded a win, two draws and two defeats; while nine games with a 4-2-3-1 have brought two wins, four draws and three defeats. It appears the decision to switch to 4-3-3 was a short-term measure brought about by his desire, after the 5-0 defeat, to avoid such a humiliation again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"093fa9f709adddcc459ee3ef1e5276cde999b4e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/093fa9f709adddcc459ee3ef1e5276cde999b4e7/21_125_2910_1746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Silva\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Silva can threaten the back of Manchester United\u2019s midfield in Saturday\u2019s derby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magi Haroun/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Saturday there is perhaps a danger of United being overrun at the back of midfield by Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva but City, so far this season, have not looked the sort of remorseless passing side to force Mourinho into an approach of radical non-possession, which might mean leaving out Rooney for Herrera or Morgan Schneiderlin. There will, it seems likely, be at least some attempt from United to take the initiative; this will probably not be Mourinho at his most risk averse, when his team effectively ignore the ball, maintain their shape and wait to pounce on a mistake.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s approach so far has been chiefly notable for the 3-2-2-3 formation his side seem to take up when in possession, the M shape at the back being formed either by the full-backs tucking into midfield and Fernandinho dropping between the centre-backs or by John Stones stepping up from the back alongside Fernandinho. That Guardiola has reportedly stopped the club negotiating new contracts for Bacary Sagna, Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Pablo Zabaleta suggests he is not entirely happy with their contributions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/08/bext-xi-united-city-manchester-derby\">Who makes our combined United and City XI for the Manchester derby?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Assuming he follows the same pattern \u2013 and the beauty with Guardiola is that he may have something entirely different in mind \u2013 it will presumably be Stones stepping up, leaving the full\u2011backs to guard against Juan Mata and Anthony Martial.</p> <p>Then again, given Mata\u2019s lack of pace and the fact Martial has been slightly short of top form this season, Guardiola could take the risk of having the full-backs tuck into midfield, which would have the bonus of getting two men around Zlatan Ibrahimovic \u2013 a player, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/07/zlatan-ibrahimovic-pep-guardiola-manchester-united-city-barcelona\" title=\"\">with whom he has a difficult history</a>. And there\u2019s the issue of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, who is now fit, if not match-fit, and could either replace Fernandinho or come in for a more naturally attacking player to strengthen the back of midfield.</p> <p>The other major issue is who Guardiola plays at centre-forward in the absence of the suspended Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Kelechi Iheanacho is the nearest option to a straight swap but Guardiola has plenty of history using a false 9. Raheem Sterling could perhaps move into the middle, which would mean either Leroy San\u00e9, if he is fit, or Jes\u00fas Navas, coming in on the flank.</p> <p>If both managers go in as they have until now, it will be United\u2019s 4-2-3-1 against 4\u20111\u20114\u20111, two shapes that match up straightforwardly for marking purposes: United have an extra holding midfielder who, while testing Pogba\u2019s defensive discipline, can counter City\u2019s additional creative midfielder. But that\u2019s a big if: positions are not yet entrenched and, from a tactical point of view, the real excitement is that either coach is capable of making a significant change.</p>",

  "<p>The UK\u2019s new flood defence plans anticipate significantly higher extreme rainfall, after new research was published as part of the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/551137/national-flood-resilience-review.pdf\">National Flood Resilience review</a>. </p> <p>The government, which had been criticised for not taking full account of the impact of climate change in driving up flood risk, will now plan for 20-30% more extreme downpours than before. </p> <p>The review, prompted by severe flooding in recent winters, also found that 530 critical infrastructure sites, such as water and telecoms, are at serious risk from floods, each potentially affecting at least 10,000 people. Utility companies have pledged to have new protection in place by the end of the year. </p> <p>The government\u2019s official climate change advisers recently warned that <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/\">flooding could cause a cascade of emergencies</a> by knocking out energy, transport, water and communications links.<br></p> <p>The review allocates \u00a312.5m for more temporary defences, such as barriers and pumps, at strategic locations around the country. By this winter, the government said, four times more temporary barriers will be available.</p> <p>\u201cLast winter we saw just how devastating flooding can be. This review sets out clear actions so we are better prepared to respond quickly in the event of future flooding and can strengthen the nation\u2019s flood defences,\u201d said the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom.</p> <p>Ben Gummer, Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cThe government has made clear that we expect water and telecoms companies to work ever closer together to improve their preparation and response to flooding, making sure lifelines such as mobile phone masts and water treatment works continue to function.\u201d </p> <p>Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \u201cThis review was launched because the government was caught out by [recent] flooding. It deserves credit for admitting that ministers have previously misunderstood and significantly underestimated the probability of flooding.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it is disappointing that the government chose to ignore surface water flooding during the review, even though it poses a threat to more properties in the UK than does coastal and river flooding,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s official advisers, welcomed the review but said it fell short of what was needed: \u201cAs well as implementing short-term measures, such as better protecting key sites, we need a new and comprehensive, long-term strategy to address flood risk in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: \u201cThis review suggests a sea-change in government understanding of floods, but its recommendations are a wash-out. \u00a312.5m for temporary flood defences is a drop in the ocean when the review concludes that winter rainfall could increase by up to 30% in future in parts of the UK, [which] will put thousands more homes and businesses at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalfloodforum.org.uk/\">National Flood Forum</a>, which represents flood communities, welcomed the review but said its narrow scope did not tackle the community-level work required. He said preventing every flood is impossible and adapting homes to cope is vital: \u201cIt is really important to engage with people about the residual risk in the right way, so that they own that risk. There are elements of government that understand this and there are other elements that clearly don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Councillor Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association, said: \u201cCouncils will need significantly more support from government to help prepare for the possibility of further flooding.\u201d Council flood funding was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/19/local-authority-flood-defence-funding-cut-by-a-third-next-year\">cut by 50% in 2015</a>.</p> <p>The review asked the Met Office to develop new plausible extreme rainfall scenarios. It added 20-30% to recently recorded extreme events, a figure it expects will mean only a 10% chance of worse rain in the next 10 years. \u201cWhen we used the Environment Agency\u2019s detailed models to predict the flooding associated with these extreme rainfall scenarios, we discovered (unsurprisingly) that it, too, was worse than anything we have seen to date,\u201d the review states.</p> <p>The Met Office modelled over 11,000 monthly rainfall scenarios, many times more than the set available from real-world observation in recent decades. \u201cThis allowed us to identify several hundred extreme monthly rainfall events that are greater than current existing rainfall records, but are regarded as plausible for the current climate - what might be termed \u2018black swan\u2019 events,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>The review found that a 20% heavier extreme rainfall event in Carlisle would lead to 280 more homes flooding, on top of those that were inundated last winter, while 400 more homes would flood in Mytholmroyd and a similar number in Hebden Bridge. A \u201cstress test\u201d in the review of a plausible extreme tidal surge affecting Great Yarmouth found that \u201cit would mean an additional 1,700 properties would flood compared to the December 2013 tidal surge, when 20 properties were flooded\u201d. <br></p> <p>One approach little mentioned by the review is to use natural methods to slow the flow of water and tree planting has been shown to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/500000-tree-planting-project-helped-yorkshire-town-miss-winter-floods\">prevented flooding at Pickering</a> in North Yorkshire over Christmas, at a time when heavy rainfall caused devastating flooding across the region. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/10/flood-defence-nature-experiments\">separate back-to-nature trial in Holnicote</a>, Somerset, has also showed promising results.</p> <p>Brenda Pollack, from <a href=\"http://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/\">Rewilding Britain</a> said: \u201cThe government has missed an opportunity. With the focus on cities, valuable work in rural areas to mitigate against floods will take a back seat. But restoring natural, varied landscapes helps absorb flood waters and is more cost effective than expensive flood barriers.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking before the report\u2019s publication, former floods minister Richard Benyon said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/brexit-is-opportunity-to-rethink-flood-protection\">farmers could to be paid to hold back floodwater</a> under a post-Brexit rural payments system: \u201cThere is an opportunity now to completely rethink rural policy, and flood protection can come in as part of the way we support farmers and see farming as doing a public good when it protects communities from flooding.\u201d</p> <p>Flood defence spending was cut sharply by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government but partly reversed after severe floods in the winters of 2013-14 and 2015-16.

  "<p>One of the reasons climate change is such an important topic is that it will affect (and already is affecting) the natural biological systems. Both plants and animals will have to respond to the changing climate. In some cases, this means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/aug/03/new-research-shows-penguins-will-suffer-in-a-warming-world\">adapting to higher temperatures</a>. In other cases, the changes may be alterations in the precipitation, length of growing season, availability or resources, or other influences. <br></p> <p>While some animals can adapt, others will have to migrate. Obviously migration can be apparent in mobile animals that will move to maintain a more or less similar climate to that to which they are accustomed.</p> <p>But animal and plant movement does not occur in just a changing climate. It also has to navigate changes to the landscape that humans create. For instance, increased land allocation to agriculture or urbanization can create barriers for free migration. So, what scientists really want to know is how these two factors (climate change and land use change) will collectively affect the patterns of animal and plant movement.</p> <p>A study that actually was published a few years ago but is only now getting press looked at this issue. The publication was authored by Julian Olden and his colleagues from the University of Washington and the Nature Conservancy. What they researchers found was very interesting. The study was published in the journal Ecology Letters and is titled <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12132/abstract\">Projected Climate-Driven Faunal Movement Routes</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"953e9b00a97cd529882923e22c1854bf6621282f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/953e9b00a97cd529882923e22c1854bf6621282f/21_0_144_180/144.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Olden\" width=\"144\" height=\"180\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Olden</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Olden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, they projected changes in the distribution of climatically suitable zones for projected future climates. They considered nearly 3,000 vertebrate species. Using a computer model, the projected how and when the species would migrate and they tracked the migration routes. The study incorporated a resistance to movement based on the amount of human alteration to the landscape. The analysis was similar to how the flow of electrons through a wire circuit is calculated. In fact, electronic circuit theory formed a basis for the calculations. </p> <p>From their analysis, the authors identified several locations in North and South America that will be crucial for species movement in a changing climate. Large movements are expected in the southeastern US, the Amazon region, and parts of Brazil. Some of the areas where migration is expected have intact biological regions. Others, in particular the southeastern US and Brazil, have pathways that are heavily impacted by human activities, which may create a barrier to the migration routes.</p> <p>In the study, the team of scientists first identified what they term \u201cclimatically suitable\u201d conditions for each of the species under a changing climate scenario. They plotted routes for the species from areas that were projected to be unsuitable to these suitable areas. The routes were plotted so that they avoided the most heavily human-impacted regions. They then plotted the paths on a map for easy of visualization.</p> <p>Some concrete and specific examples were provided. For instance, in the southeastern US, species are projected to move northward into the southern Appalachian Mountains. In South America, species are expected to migrate from central Argentina in the Pampas, Sierras de Cordoba, and Andes. The authors identified 14 biological regions and calculated the average direction of movement across each biome. Great visualizations are shown of paths of migrations, for instance, in the southeastern US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e63c702db97d2b254da279ed221f121ebb1fcd66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63c702db97d2b254da279ed221f121ebb1fcd66/0_0_468_349/468.jpg\" alt=\"Vector image of migration patterns, southeastern USA.\" width=\"468\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vector image of migration patterns, southeastern USA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lawler et al.

That topic is really settled and the science is on the edges of how fast climate change will occur. Rather this study helps us assess what the impacts of climate change will be.</p>",
  "<p>OK, I\u2019ll come clean: I didn\u2019t know that much about the nomad Kazakh minority living in Mongolia before I saw this documentary.

The snowy, rocky terrain of the Altai mountains is gorgeous and inviting, but also treacherous. Most fascinating is their working relationship with the magnificent golden eagles of the region. Captured at just the right moment of growth \u2013 old enough to fly, but still young enough to get yanked from a nest \u2013 they are trained to aid in foxhunting, but only for seven years, before they are returned to the wild.

The eagle-napping involves climbing down the side of a cliff, and it\u2019s here where it becomes evident that director Otto Bell isn\u2019t too worried about mixing in re-creations with his footage. But even if Aisholpan\u2019s training \u2013 which includes hoodwinking, responding to calls, dragging dead foxes and other hallmarks of falconry \u2013 is for the camera, it doesn\u2019t make it any less extraordinary. Especially in this remarkable environment, captured in breathtakingly crisp digital video.</p> <p>The movie needs a centerpiece, though, so Aisholpan ends up entering the community\u2019s annual Golden Eagle competition. Despite some raised eyebrows, she is allowed to compete: she\u2019s not only the first female, but the youngest entrant. Does she do well? Does her majestic eagle swoop down from the top of a mountain when she whistles, grabbing on to her protected forearm with cinematic gusto? I\u2019ll let you figure that one out.</p> <p>In addition to the feelgood, family-friendly aspects (along with Daisy Ridley, Star Wars\u2019 Rey, narrating), there are wonderful glimpses of this unique society\u2019s non-ornithological customs. Even the villains, those nasty jerks trying to keep a young girl from her dreams when she so clearly has a natural gift, are elegantly framed, with dazzling decor in their traditional dwellings.

Companies including banks and airlines pay Micro Focus to extend the life of the computers they use to run their businesses, for example to manage data. This allows the companies to avoid spending on newer computer systems. </p> <p>Loosemore said there would be some job losses as a result of the deal. \u201cOver time we will probably see some reductions as we look for efficiencies in the business.

HPE acquired part of its software portfolio through the $11bn purchase of Autonomy in 2011 \u2013 a deal that later descended into acrimony.</p> <p>The takeover was supposed to form the central part of HP\u2019s move into software, but HPE later wrote off three-quarters of the company\u2019s value, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/autonomy-founder-sues-hewlett-packard-for-150m-over-claims\">accusing Autonomy executives of financial mismanagement \u2013 which they deny</a>.<br></p> <p>Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, said the deal was a confident move by Micro Focus, swimming against the tide of UK companies being snapped up by overseas buyers. \u201cIt\u2019s a big scalp for the FTSE 100 group, which has been on a buying spree of late.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the recent acquisition of one of Britain\u2019s most prized tech companies, chip designer Arm, to a Japanese firm, he added: \u201cAfter Arm Holdings was sold to SoftBank, it\u2019s a sign that the UK tech sector is still capable of making deals in the other direction,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c[The HPE deal] would be the biggest acquisition by a British company of a foreign tech firm, and comes in the face of a massive drop in the value of the pound that has made UK firms the target of overseas bidders.\u201d</p> <p>Loosemore said he would be keen to see a growing technology scene in the UK but it was not something the company was focused on.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, Micro Focus will pay $2.5bn in cash to HPE, while HPE shareholders will own 50.1% of the combined company, which will operate under the name Micro Focus and be run by its executives. HP said it would pay $700m in one-off costs related to the separation of the assets.</p> <p>Micro Focus was founded in 1976 and is headquartered in Newbury. It employs more than 4,500 people in more than 80 global locations, with about 20,000 customers worldwide. HPE has more than 50,000 customers.</p> <p>For more than a decade, about half of Micro Focus\u2019s business has been in the US. It employs just 500 people in the UK.

They are protesting against <a href=\"http://weareica.com/projects/india-buildings/?door=we-are-architects\">development plans</a> for a 235-bedroom hotel, restaurant, bar and retail space that will take over a site at the back of the library, on the Old Town\u2019s lower level street, the Cowgate.</p> <p>Campaigners see the plans \u2013 which include no additional housing or community spaces \u2013 as further proof of the over-development and gentrification of this part of the city, already bristling with bars, restaurants, clubs and hotels, which make up a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728\">Unesco world heritage site</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/new-images-of-65m-india-buildings-hotel-development-1-3904954\">\u00a365m development proposal includes the historic cluster</a> known as India Buildings, which stretch around the corner of quaint Victoria Street, across from the Grassmarket.

They claim the development, which reaches nine storeys at its highest point, will lower light levels within the library by as much as 80%, though developers say it will be far less.</p> <p>The development will also see the closure of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.edinburghaccesspractice.scot.nhs.uk/opening-times.aspx\">Edinburgh Access Practice</a>, a drop-in NHS GP practice for some of the city\u2019s most marginalised communities, including homeless people and those with mental health problems and substance addictions.

If a farmer makes his land available to hold flood water that would otherwise go into people\u2019s homes he is delivering a public good. And he can do that by planting trees and looking at something like the flood plain meadows partnership.\u201d He also cited a \u201cslow the flow\u201d scheme that has been shown to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/500000-tree-planting-project-helped-yorkshire-town-miss-winter-floods\">prevented flooding at Pickering</a> in North Yorkshire. </p> <p>Mary Creagh, chair of the environmental audit committee, said communities threatened by flooding needed more immediate help. <br></p> <p>She said: \u201cPeople living in the cities of Leeds, and York and Carlisle can\u2019t wait for six years or 10 years for this type of very slow-growing [project]. These cities need defending now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a55c2f47d7aec55cdfd4e2d1a7b259d5200edc7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a55c2f47d7aec55cdfd4e2d1a7b259d5200edc7c/616_0_2445_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"York has long suffered from flooding due to the swollen river Ouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">York has long suffered from flooding due to the swollen river Ouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She called for the government to devote resources and planning to flooding similar to those seen in the Netherlands. </p> <p>Benyon agreed that more money should be spent on tackling flooding. He said: \u201cGovernments of every persuasion are going to have to spend lots of money on steel and concrete and large-scale protection. This report is absolutely vital ... to make sure that not only local authorities but right down to individual householders are taking responsibility for something that will continue to be a risk for now and in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Flood defence spending was cut sharply by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government but partly reversed after severe floods in the winters of 2013-14 and 2015-16. In March\u2019s budget, a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/700m-boost-for-flood-defences-brings-150m-more-for-yorkshire-and-cumbria\">\u00a3700m boost was pledged</a>, meaning some English cities and towns that had been left without planned flood defences by the cuts are now getting the projects. The north of England, devastated by winter floods, is getting at least \u00a3150m of the new money, giving better protection for thousands of homes.</p> <p>The Guardian had revealed in 2012 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\">294 projects in line for funding were left stranded</a> after the heavy cuts and exposed a series of places that were later flooded. </p> <p>These included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\">Leeds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/storm-desmond-cuts-delayed-kendal-flood-defence-plan-several-times\">Kendal</a>, which were submerged in last winter\u2019s storms. Both places will now get new defences. The new money is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/budget-targets-insurance-premiums-to-raise-700m-for-flood-hit-regions\">funded by an increase in insurance premium tax</a>.</p> <p>The government had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/07/david-cameron-is-treating-the-symptoms-of-flooding-but-not-the-cause\">warned by a series of official bodies</a> that flood risk was rising due to inadequate spending and was costing billions of pounds in damages. Government scientists have long warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/26/floods-worst-climate-change-uk\">more severe flooding is the greatest impact of climate change</a> in the UK.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/12/uk-poorly-prepared-for-climate-change-impacts-government-advisers-warn\">Floods already causes \u00a31bn of damage</a> every year on average but the risks will rise yet further as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger.

Although the game appears as an extra layer on top of our environment from the personal perspective of our phones, the location element helps Pok\u00e9mon Go create electronic empathy in the physical world, as shops and restaurants set up in-game location-based features to attract players.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jul/19/surreal-estate-virtual-reality-marketing\">Virtual reality: are you ready for surreal estate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis \u2018real world\u2019 AR opens new brand opportunities, not only for sponsorship, real world retail gamification and foot traffic, but for the creation of segmentation tools to interpret the massive datasets of user preferences and behaviours which Pok\u00e9mon Go encourages,\u201d says Martin Hollywood, lead creative technologist at Razorfish London.</p> <h2>From sci-fi to VR</h2> <p>Ernest Cline\u2019s 2011 novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ready-player-one.html\">Ready Player One</a> is played out in a future virtual universe, where brands have their own planets. Cline sees this happening for real as VR hardware becomes mainstream. \u201cWe should think about what happened with the internet. Suddenly companies had to have a website,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may be that brands will have a virtual space where you can try on clothes or test drive a car,\u201d he says. This is already happening, with in-store retail experiences incorporating mixed reality. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cExperiential marketing is about intimacy at scale,\u201d says Jason Alan Snyder, chief technology officer at <a href=\"http://www.momentumww.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Momentum Worldwide</a>. \u201cThe danger for brands is that the algorithms we increasingly use are pushing us into ever-narrowing information silos and connecting us with tribes of people we agree with. Empathy is about understanding different perspectives and VR can alter perceptions. My hope is to leverage VR into a connective tissue by creating empathetic groups.\u201d Snyder and his team created the blended reality <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/31/american-express-fan-experience-us-open/\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Express fan experience at this year\u2019s US Open</a> which includes the Pro Walk, a holographic replica of the locker room and walk on to the centre court, as well as a shared VR experience where groups/families can play tennis like the pros.</p> <h2>Mixed reality</h2> <p>The smartphone is the centre of our digital world; it\u2019s how we communicate and shop. How long will it be before we can touch what we see in AR in the same way as we can in VR with a headset and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_glove\" rel=\"nofollow\">haptic gloves</a>? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/aug/17/facial-recognition-a-powerful-ad-tool-or-privacy-nightmare\">Facial recognition \u2013 a powerful ad tool or privacy nightmare?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer may be semi-immersive mixed reality. At MIT, Abe Davis\u2019 research into interactive dynamic simulation blurs the boundary between augmented and physical reality so that instead of layering over the real environment, the AR appears to be interacting with it. Davis uses video to virtualise physical content so that it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f1fCCb3hVg\" rel=\"nofollow\">can interact with virtual content</a>, so that when you see \u2013 on your smartphone \u2013 a Pok\u00e9mon interact with a flexible object, you also see that object react. </p> <p>\u201cWhile VR brings you closer to people who are far away and separates you from people who are close, AR makes you part of the environment and helps you discover your own version of the content. The fact that everyone has their own perspective on it brings people together,\u201d says Davis. </p> <p>However, although the potential is far reaching, there are significant challenges around building Davis\u2019 research into a robust product that works on a smartphone. \u201cWe are still some way from producing real-time dynamic AR, which conveys reactions and behaviours as well as experiences and interactions.\u201d </p> <p>Mark Brill, mobile strategist and senior lecturer in future media at Birmingham City University, recognises how touching an object virtually could engage customers with brands \u201cWe already augment mobile communication with emojis and filters,\u201d he says. However, there are challenges. \u201cPeople will only use it if it fits their lives or adds something useful or desirable. So brands need to highlight what it brings that\u2019s new and different, otherwise it is just a gimmick.\u201d </p> <p>One reason to electronically break the fourth wall is to convey product information. Victoria Buchanan, executive creative director at Tribal Worldwide London created the Volkswagen Passat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/apr/08/volkswagen-passat-invisible-technology-advertising\">Invisible made Visible</a> campaign using VR and AR to project the car\u2019s invisible data and sensors on to a film showing how its advanced features (like assisted parking and braking) worked. \u201cRather than layering AR on to our world, we effectively stepped into the VR, using <a href=\"http://www.lidar-uk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LIDAR</a> scans to recreate different environments to showcase the car\u2019s invisible features.\u201d she explains. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Immersive technology needs to focus on connecting humans to humans in a profound way</p> <footer> <cite>Jason Alan Snyder</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another example of shared VR/AR experience is the hyper-real <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/lockheed-martin-rigged-school-bus-group-vr-take-kids-tour-mars-170968\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lockheed Martin Mars experience</a> bus, in which the windows of a school bus were replaced by screens to create an immersive field trip to Mars.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.virtualfutures.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virtual Futures Salon</a> highlighted that electronic empathy is about emotional involvement and does not require hyper-realism. \u201cThe key is to establish an emotional connection between the consumer and the experience \u2013 it is not about the technology,\u201d says Los Angeles based digital content adviser Scott Nocas, adding that Tamagotchi has sold over 76m units. \u201cBrands need to make themselves into Tamagotchi \u2013 or Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 so that we keep them alive.\u201d </p> <p>Ultimately, electronic empathy comes down to the human factor \u2013 the emotional engagement that has always been at the heart of successful branding. </p> <p>Immersive technology that engages multiple senses is expanding the creative space, providing more intense and personal experiences that can bring people together in multiple dimensions, sometimes simultaneously. But, it will only be effective commercially if it is widely accessible and focuses on shared human experience, rather than reinforcing a particular perspective.</p> <p>\u201cEmpathy is about discovering things that we share and engage with emotionally,\u201d says Snyder. \u201cImmersive technology needs to focus on connecting humans to humans in a profound way. It can change people\u2019s perceptions, and if used properly it has the potential to change the world.\u201d</p> <p><em>Joanna Goodman is a writer and editor.

  "<p>Bill Shorten has taken aim at low wage growth and blamed employers for refusing to collectively bargaining with workers in a speech preaching the virtue of inclusive prosperity.</p> <p>In his speech to the McKell Institute on Thursday, Shorten said fairness was a driver of growth, rebutting Coalition statements that Labor was not interested in \u201cgrowing the pie\u201d, merely redistributing wealth.</p> <p>Shorten\u2019s call to unfreeze a pause in wages also contrasted with statements by treasurer, Scott Morrison, that Australia should not grow incomes through a wage \u201cexplosion\u201d or \u201cinflation\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/18/wages-growth-is-at-record-lows-unless-youre-a-commonwealth-bank-ceo\">Wages growth is at a record low \u2013 unless you're a Commonwealth Bank CEO | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shorten made the comments in Sydney while launching a McKell Institute report that found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/bill-shorten-middle-class-australians-are-working-harder-and-longer-for-less\">middle-class incomes in Australia have gone backwards</a> since the global financial crisis.</p> <p>It found the average Australian annual income has declined about 2.7% since 2012 from approximately $67,900 (US$52,229) per annum to $66,500 (US$51,148), despite labour productivity continuing to exceed other comparable nations.</p> <p>Shorten in part blamed the \u201cflat\u201d enterprise bargaining system, which he said was \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers who bargain are undercut by employers who don\u2019t bother.

Inclusion is a plan for prosperity, not one of the benefits,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Social policy and a strong safety net were not a matter of charity but \u201cabout investing and lifting people back into work and supporting their full participation in our economy and our society\u201d.</p> <p>In the speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/bill-shorten-middle-class-australians-are-working-harder-and-longer-for-less\">Shorten warned of a growing sense of disempowerment and disillusionment</a> led by \u201cextremists and demagogues from every point of the political compass\u201d.</p> <p>He said marginalised people had to feel \u201ctheir efforts will be rewarded \u2013 that it is still possible to win when you play by the rules\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFairness is therefore both an obligation and a necessity.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten said the task now was \u201cto advance a new case for targeted growth and inclusive prosperity\u201d and \u201cdebunk the old idea that Australia has to choose between fairness and growth\u201d.</p> <p>After the release of GDP figures on Wednesday the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, said the figures showed that \u201cbusiness profits helped to drive stronger national income growth\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut we cannot afford to be complacent.

  "<p>Small talk is a fundamental social bonding tool, passed down from our primates, according to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S45/01/12S05/index.xml?section=topstories\" rel=\"nofollow\">a study from Princeton University</a>. The researchers have been examining how lemurs use vocalisations, akin to our chit-chat, to build familiarity and closeness. Dubbed \u201cgrooming at arm\u2019s length\u201d, humans do it too. The actual content of the exchange is not the most important part; it is the social function it serves. Small talk can offer a way into business exchanges \u2013 a safety buffer before the hard numbers and negotiation.<br></p> <p>Whether pitching for investment, winning new clients or building contacts, knowing how to connect with others through small talk can be an asset, says career coach and psychologist Salma Shah.</p> <p>Shah says: \u201cDoing business with a person carries risk and lots of unknowns; from a psychological point of view, \u2018good\u2019 small talk \u2013 when we connect with someone \u2013 makes us relax, open up and trust [...] A good conversation creates a feelgood factor and a positive emotional limbic response, which we then associate with that person.\u201d </p> <p>But there are caveats. Small talk can be a segue into big talk; but in the busy world of business, the trick is knowing when \u2013 and when not \u2013 to use it. <br></p> <h2>Use your judgment</h2> <p>Sara Trechman, co-founder of healthy snack food startup <a href=\"http://www.wellandtruly.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Well&amp;Truly</a>, secured a meeting with one of the top five supermarkets after a chance chat in a queue for coffee at a Barcelona trade show.</p> <p>Trechman says: \u201cWe talked about how long the queue was taking and places in Spain never having any change \u2013 it turned out she was a buyer for one of the top five supermarkets and it set off a business conversation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Launched in February by Trechman and her sister-in-law Maria Norrman, Well&amp;Truly has secured listings in Tesco and Whole Foods. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that starting off conversations with small talk allows us to find similarities other than business; it builds an element of common ground,\u201d Trechman says. \u201cAt the same time, you need to be able to read when investors want to get straight to the numbers, without any sort of preamble. When pitching to big supermarkets we know they\u2019re time-poor and have multiple other meetings to get through.\u201d </p> <p>For Well&amp;Truly, small talk has been a part of consolidating business relationships.</p> <h2>Have something worthwhile to say</h2> <p>David Atkinson, managing director of <a href=\"http://theymco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yorkshire Meatball Co</a>, likes business transactions to be as simple and straightforward as the meatballs his father-son business makes. \u201cHaving sold and pitched at many levels in my time in small business, I\u2019d say small talk is white noise,\u201d he says. You can begin a meeting with pleasantries, but ultimately people are busy. Atkinson says his approach has always been to know why he is talking to someone and introduce himself as having a solution to their problems.<br></p> <p>\u201cHave something worthwhile to say and make sure you are asking questions, because the more time you\u2019re chit-chatting about the weather, the less time you\u2019re learning about the person you\u2019re trying to sell to,\u201d he says. His approach has worked so far \u2013 the company is set to launch a franchise model across the UK and its products will be on the shelves of four major retailers in the coming months.<br></p> <h2>Consider the context</h2> <p>Evidently, context is everything. And so is recognising that some people do not like small talk. \u201cAlways take a steer from your potential customer if you are trying to win new business,\u201d says Shah. \u201cIf they open with small talk, then do keep it going and go at their pace.\u201d Equally, if you are with someone who just wants to keep things business only, Shah suggests mirroring their style. \u201cThis will make them feel comfortable and receptive to what you have to offer.\u201d </p> <p>Aadil Seedat, launched Greater Manchester-based <a href=\"http://www.umbrella-host.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Umbrella Host</a>, a cloud computing service, three years ago. He says throwing in the odd cheesy joke or industry pun has won him contacts and business from his target audience \u2013 web developers. \u201cThey\u2019re generally not very formal and enjoy a good laugh [...] But when delving down into figures I tend to avoid small talk because that\u2019s the time you provide your serious commercial skills and experience.\u201d <br></p> <h2>Do your research</h2> <p>Asking open-ended questions is a great way to build rapport and establish common ground, says <a href=\"https://executive-coaching.co.uk/meet-the-team/geraldine-gallacher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">executive coach Geraldine Gallagher</a>. \u201cIf I\u2019m at an event I\u2019ll ask the person why they\u2019ve come along or what they have thought of the panels so far; go into curious-mode and learn about the people you\u2019re talking to,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t overcomplicate things by going into a state of hyper-analysis which prevents you from being natural. And use your own boredom threshold as a marker of when to cut to the chase, or move on. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, small talk can be boring, and if you\u2019re bored, they\u2019re definitely bored too.\u201d </p> <p>If you are going to a business meeting, know who will be in the room and what they do by researching their backgrounds beforehand. \u201cLinkedIn is a great tool for establishing whether there is professional common ground you can mention,\u201d says Gallagher. </p> <p>She suggests some stock questions you can try: \u201cAsking about the environment you\u2019re in is a good one, especially if it\u2019s an interesting building\u201d. What is going on in the news is another solid option, as long as you aren\u2019t drawn into anything too political or religion-based. And don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming the person who brings you up to the meeting is an assistant or secretary \u2013 they could be the one running the show once you get into the boardroom \u2013 so use the elevator ride up there to build some rapport and glean information.<br></p> <p>But don\u2019t overdo it. \u201cIf you make too much small talk it can detract from your gravitas and make it sound like you\u2019re babbling,\u201d says Gallagher. Nobody wants to hear about your nightmare journey down the M6 in minute detail. </p> <p>Ultimately, remember why you\u2019re there, and make sure you get across what it is you can do for the person in front of you.<br></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

  "<p>Art deco began in France during the first world war and went on to accompany the age of jazz, Josephine Baker, cocktails, convertibles and talking pictures. While art nouveau had been curvy and nature-inspired, art deco was symmetrical, layered, topped with pyramids, stepped forms and zigzag lines. It was celebrated at Paris\u2019s Exposition International des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925.</p> <p>Unable to compete with the extravagant, steel-framed skyscrapers being constructed in the US, European cities developed their own style of streamlined building, with exotic facades combining art-deco geometry with national motifs. Art deco was fun, sophisticated, technological and modern. Inspired by cubism, futurism and the craze for all things ancient Egyptian that followed the discovery of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb in 1922, it lent a colourful, dynamic look to urban architecture.</p> <h2>Paris</h2> <p>France was keen to demonstrate at the 1925 exhibition that it had recovered its glory and artistic prestige after the war. Two-thirds of the exhibits there were French, including many from Paris\u2019s luxury department stores. Today, most of the shops have lost their celebrated art-deco facades, but there are still examples of the style in the capital: the centrepiece of the Jardins du Trocad\u00e9ro is the Palais de Chaillot, built for the Exposition Universelle in 1937, and there is also the Palais de Tokyo, inaugurated the same year. Also worth seeing are the Grand Rex and Louxor cinemas, as well as the art deco <a href=\"http://equipement.paris.fr/piscine-pontoise-2918\">Piscine Pontoise</a>, where two tiers of blue-doored changing booths surround the pool, under a glass roof.

During the 1920s and 30s, this was the country\u2019s capital and rapid urban growth saw art deco, combined with traditional Baltic folk elements, produce a simplified yet characteristic version of the style. The Christ\u2019s Resurrection Basilica (1932-40) was used as a storehouse by the Nazis and as a factory by Stalin before being finally consecrated in 2004. It\u2019s as close to a skyscraper as a church can get. Kaunas\u2019s central post office, the HQ of dairy company Pienocentras and the city\u2019s 1936 <a href=\"http://www.muziejai.lt/Kaunas/karo_muziejus.en.htm\">Great War Museum</a> are all solidly art deco.

Modernist designs dominated Barcelona, and in Valencia art deco-inspired buildings continued an offbeat, highly individualistic tradition. Valencian architect Joan Guardiola\u2019s Casa Jud\u00eda (1930) in Calle Castell\u00f3n is a mesmerising mix of Hollywood Cleopatra and downtown Aztec. Valencia was undergoing an economic boom in the 1920s and 30s, and art-deco influences can be seen all along Calles Mar\u00eda Cristina and Sueca, in Plaza del Ayuntamiento, and in the city\u2019s two 1930s cinemas: the Capitol and the Rialto.

  "<p>In the months after the surrender of Japan on 14 August 1945, the British people were ready to believe that war was behind them. The newspapers were full of stories about possible home rule for India, and dockers going on strike in London, Liverpool and Hull. It is questionable how many readers of the Manchester Guardian on 6 December 1945 saw, let alone read, a short item that was tucked away at the foot of page six, nestled between a reader\u2019s letter about the Nuremberg war crimes trials and a leading article about the foundation of the United Nations.</p> <p>Under the headline \u201cBritish in Indo-China\u201d appeared a copy of a letter that had also been sent to Ernest Bevin, the foreign secretary. \u201cIt appears that we are collaborating with Japanese and French forces against the nationalist forces of Vi\u00eat Minh,\u201d the letter read. \u201cFor what purpose is this collaboration? Why are we not disarming the Japanese? We desire the definition of government policy regarding the presence of British troops in Indo-China.\u201d The letter was signed by the \u201cBritish other ranks\u201d of the signal section of an infantry brigade based in Saigon.</p> <p>It was highly unusual \u2013 notwithstanding the egalitarian spirit of those postwar days \u2013 to see a group of low-ranking British troops so publicly demanding that the foreign secretary explain his government\u2019s policies. But what was truly extraordinary was the disclosure that British troops were fighting in the former French colony against the local population, and that they were doing so alongside their former enemies: the Japanese army and the Vichy French.</p> <p>Few members of the public were aware that the British government had been so anxious to see the French recover control of their prewar colonial possession that the entire 20th Infantry Division of the British Indian Army had been airlifted into the country the previous August, with orders to suppress the Vietnamese people\u2019s attempts to form their own government. There were almost 26,000 men with 2,500 vehicles, including armoured cars. Three British artillery regiments had also been dispatched, the RAF had flown in with 14 Spitfires and 34 Mosquito fighter-bombers, and there was a 140-strong contingent from the Royal Navy.</p> <p>On landing, the British had rearmed the Vichy troops with new .303 British rifles. Shortly afterwards, surrendered Japanese troops had also been rearmed and compelled to fight the Vietnamese \u2013 some under the command of British officers.</p> <p>The British were operating in accordance with an order that they should show a ruthless disregard for civilians, who, consequently, were killed and maimed in large numbers. \u201cThere is no front in these operations,\u201d the order said. \u201cWe may find it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Always use the maximum force available to ensure wiping out any hostilities we may meet. If one uses too much force, no harm is done. If one uses too small a force, and it has to be extricated, we will suffer casualties and encourage the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the troops who were expected to act on such orders were appalled. One of the signatories to the letter to Bevin was Dick Hartmann, a 31-year-old soldier from Manchester. Hartmann later recalled: \u201cWe saw homes being burned and hundreds of the local population being kept in compounds. We saw many ambulances, open at the back, carrying mainly \u2013 actually, totally \u2013 women and children, who were in bandages. I remember it very vividly. All the women and children who lived there would stand outside their homes, all dressed in black, and just grimly stare at us, really with \u2026 hatred.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the UK, parliament and the public knew next to nothing about this war, the manner in which it was being waged, or Britain\u2019s role in it.<strong> </strong>And it appears that the cabinet and the War Office wished their state of ignorance be preserved.</p> <p>At the Allies\u2019 south-east Asia headquarters in Ceylon, however, and at the War Office in London, British commanders and senior defence officials were enraged by the letter. Hartmann and his comrades were warned that a brigadier was coming to see them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live - at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe just came in one morning and gave us a haranguing about the evils of our ways. He said a few years before we would have been shot, but unfortunately he couldn\u2019t do that now.\u201d Hartmann was worried. But some of his comrades had many years of jungle combat behind them and were unimpressed by the brigadier and his bluster. They told him, bluntly, that they believed Britain\u2019s cause in the country to be unjust, and that he should make himself scarce. The brigadier turned on his heel, and did just that.</p> <p>But there were no more letters from Saigon, there was little press attention, and almost no comments were made in the Commons. Despite the size of its military commitment to Indochina, this was to be a British military operation that would be kept out of sight, and largely out of mind. And it would not be the last such campaign.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Almost 70 years later, in September 2014,</strong> David Cameron, the British prime minister, gave a statement in which he prepared the country for the resumption of military action in Iraq, this time against Islamic State forces. \u201cWe are a peaceful people,\u201d Cameron said, standing in front of two union jack flags. \u201cWe do not seek out confrontation, but we need to understand we cannot ignore this threat to our security \u2026 we cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe. We have to confront this menace.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody doubted that the prime minister was under pressure to act after Islamic State had filmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/isis-video-david-haines-beheading\">the brutal murder of a British aid worker</a> and threatened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/03/alan-henning-isis-syria-video-murder\">the slaughter of a second</a>. Moreover, nobody disputed his assertion that the British are \u201ca peaceful people\u201d who do not seek confrontation.</p> <p>In fact, between 1918 and 1939, British forces were fighting in Iraq, Sudan, Ireland, Palestine and Aden. In the years after the second world war, British servicemen were fighting in Eritrea, Palestine, French Indochina, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Egypt, China and Oman. Between 1949 and 1970, the British initiated 34 foreign military interventions. Later came the Falklands, Iraq \u2013 four times \u2013 Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Libya and, of course, Operation Banner, the British army\u2019s 38-year deployment to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>For more than a hundred years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2014/feb/11/britain-100-years-of-conflict\">not a single year has passed</a> when Britain\u2019s armed forces have not been engaged in military operations somewhere in the world. The British are unique in this respect: the same could not be said of the Americans, the Russians, the French or any other nation.</p> <p>Only the British are perpetually at war.</p> <p>One reason that this is rarely acknowledged could be that in the years following the second world war, and before the period of national self-doubt that was provoked in 1956 by t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\">he Suez crisis</a>, Britain engaged in so many end-of-empire scraps that military activity came to be regarded by the British public as the norm, and therefore unremarkable. Another is that since 1945, British forces have engaged in a series of small wars that were under-reported and now all but forgotten, or which were obscured, even as they were being fought, by more dramatic events elsewhere.</p> <p>A great deal is known about some conflicts, such as the 1982 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-falklands-gamble\">Falklands war</a> and the 2003 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/iraq-war-still-casts-a-long-shadow-over-a-dangerous-and-deeply-unstable-region\">invasion of Iraq</a>, and Britain\u2019s role in the two world wars has become in many ways central to the national narrative. But other conflicts are remembered only dimly or have always remained largely hidden.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>One strategically vital war,</strong> waged by Britain for more than a decade, was fought for most of that time in complete secrecy. In January 1972, readers of the Observer opened their newspaper to see a report headlined \u201cUK fighting secret Gulf war?\u201d On the same day, the Sunday Times ran a very similar article, asking: \u201cIs Dhofar Britain\u2019s hush-hush war?\u201d British troops, the newspapers revealed, were engaged in the war that the sultan of Oman was fighting against guerrillas in the mountains of Dhofar in the south of the country.</p> <p>Four years earlier, the devaluation crisis had forced Harold Wilson\u2019s government to pledge that British forces would be withdrawn from all points east of Suez by December 1971 \u2013 the only exemption being a small force that was to remain in Hong Kong. Now the Observer article was demanding to know: \u201cHas Britain really withdrawn all her forces from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula? Or is the British government, like the Americans in Laos, waging a secret war without the full knowledge of parliament and public?\u201d The Observer located one of the insurgency\u2019s leaders, who told its reporter that the war had begun with an \u201cexplosion\u201d in the country on 9 June 1965, triggered by what he described as poor local governance and \u201cthe oppression of the British\u201d. By the time the Observer and Sunday Times were publishing their first, tentative reports, Britain had been at war in Oman for six-and-a-half years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0df21bd83d3730c47a68105a34953ef68ef98079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df21bd83d3730c47a68105a34953ef68ef98079/4_269_4973_2983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Charles Kendall, the British consul to the sultan of Oman, in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captain Charles Kendall, the British consul to the sultan of Oman, in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Prime/ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Situated on the south-west corner of the Arabian peninsula, the Sultanate of Oman is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the north, and by Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the west and south-west. The country also sits alongside the Strait of Hormuz, the 33-mile wide waterway through which oil from the Persian Gulf makes its way to market. In the 1960s, more than 60% of the western world\u2019s crude oil came from the Gulf, a giant tanker passing through the Hormuz bottleneck every 10 minutes. As the oil flowed, local economies flourished and became important markets for exported British goods: London became even more anxious to protect its interests in the region and the local rulers who supported them.</p> <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Britain maintained control of successive sultans of Oman to prevent any other colonial power gaining a foothold in the region. It achieved this through a simple means: money. In the mid-1960s, the country\u2019s tyrannical ruler, Sultan Said bin Taimur received more than half his income directly from London. Only from 1967, when Omani oil was pumped from the ground for the first time, did the country begin to generate most of its own income.</p> <p>Even then, Britain exercised enormous control over the sultan. His defence secretary and chief of intelligence were British army officers, his chief adviser was a former British diplomat, and all but one of his government ministers were British. The British commander of the Sultan of Oman\u2019s armed forces met daily with the British defence attache, and weekly with the British ambassador. The sultan had no formal relationship with any government other than that of the UK.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Officially, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman was an independent state. In truth, it was a de facto British colony</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The official British position was that the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman was a fully sovereign and independent state. In truth, it was a de facto British colony. As such, successive British governments were responsible for the woeful political, social and economic conditions that the sultan\u2019s subjects endured, and which both created and fuelled the popular revolt.</p> <p>In the mid-1960s, Oman had one hospital. Its infant mortality rate was 75% and life expectancy was around 55 years. There were just three primary schools \u2013 which the sultan frequently threatened to close \u2013 and no secondary schools. The result of this was that just 5% of the population could read and write. There were no telephones or any other infrastructure, other than a series of ancient water channels. The sultan banned any object that he considered decadent, which meant that Omanis were prevented from possessing radios, from riding bicycles, from playing football, from wearing sunglasses, shoes or trousers, and from using electric pumps in their wells.</p> <p>Those who offended against the sultan\u2019s laws could expect savage punishment. There were public executions. Conditions in his prisons \u2013 where Pakistani guards received their orders from British warders \u2013 were said to be horrendous, with large numbers of inmates shackled together in darkened cells, without proper food or medical attention.</p> <p>The people of Oman despised and feared both their sultan and the British who kept him in place and colluded with his policy of non-development. Unsurprisingly, the sultan often had to call upon the British to provide the military force required to protect him from his own people.</p> <p>During the 1950s there were a number of uprisings in the north of the country, which were put down by British forces. Both the SAS and the RAF were critical to the success of these counter-insurgency operations. Between July and December 1958, for example, the RAF flew 1,635 sorties, dropping 1,094 tons of bombs and firing 900 rockets at the insurgents, their mountain-top villages and irrigation works. This was more than twice the weight of bombs that the Luftwaffe dropped on Coventry in November 1940.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7024797972629edc73b52e09232f7e5bb4c7192b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7024797972629edc73b52e09232f7e5bb4c7192b/0_327_8458_5518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The SAS on patrol in Oman in 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SAS on patrol in Oman in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topfoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In 1966, a new rebellion broke out</strong> in the south of the country, among the people of Dhofar province. The following year, after surviving an assassination attempt, the sultan and his Dhofari wife retired to his palace on the coast at Salalah. He was so rarely sighted that many of his subjects became convinced that he must have died, and that the British were concealing that from them.</p> <p>For the new Labour government, the close relationship with the client sultanate presented an ideological problem. The Labour party had been elected in 1964 on a manifesto that included a pledge to wage a new \u201cwar on want\u201d in the developing world, and to fight for \u201cfreedom and racial equality\u201d at the United Nations general assembly. It would cause the most excruciating humiliation were it to become known more widely, at home and abroad, that Oman was the last country on earth where slavery remained legal. The sultan owned around 500 slaves. An estimated 150 of them were women, whom he kept at his palace at Salalah; a number of his male slaves were said to have been physically deformed by the cruelties they had suffered.</p> <p>After the rebellions of the 1950s, the Sultan of Oman\u2019s armed forces were reorganised, with British advice, training, equipment and funds. More Omanis were recruited into the ranks, but all of the officers were British. Some were \u201cseconded officers\u201d while others were so-called contract officers, or mercenaries \u2013 men who had previously served in Oman with the British Army and who had chosen to return to earn handsome rewards.</p> <p>Initially, the rebels they faced in Dhofar were Arab nationalists. However, to the west of Dhofar lay Aden, from which the British were forced to withdraw at the end of 1967, in the face of increasingly violent rebellions. British rule had been replaced by a Marxist state, the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen, which received aid from both China and Russia. By early 1968, a Dhofari nationalist insurgency was developing into a Chinese-backed revolutionary movement with pan-Arabian ambitions. To the British officers, however, the foe was always simply the <em>adoo</em> \u2013 Arabic for enemy. By the end of 1969, the <em>adoo</em> had captured the coastal town of Raysut, and by early the following year they controlled most of the high plains and were within mortaring distance of the RAF base at Salalah.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any enemy corpses we recovered were propped up in the souk as a salutary lesson to would-be freedom fighters</p> <footer> <cite>Anonymous British officer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The new oil fields on the desert between Dhofar and the capital, Muscat, were beginning to look vulnerable. Some in London were developing a fearful Middle Eastern domino theory, in which they envisaged the Strait of Hormuz falling under communist control.</p> <p>The British response was merciless. \u201cWe burnt down rebel villages and shot their goats and cows,\u201d one officer wrote. \u201cAny enemy corpses we recovered were propped up in the Salalah souk as a salutary lesson to any would-be freedom fighters.\u201d Another officer explained that unlike in Northern Ireland, where soldiers were anxious to avoid killing or wounding non-combatants, he believed that in Dhofar there were no innocents, only <em>adoo</em>: \u201cThe only people in this area \u2013 there are no civilians \u2013 are all enemy. Therefore you can get on with doing the job, mortaring the area and returning small arms fire without worrying about hurting innocent people.\u201d</p> <p>In their determination to put down a popular rebellion against the cruelty and neglect of a despot who was propped up and financed by Britain, British-led forces poisoned wells, torched villages, destroyed crops and shot livestock. During the interrogation of rebels they developed their torture techniques, experimenting with noise. Areas populated by civilians were turned into free-fire zones. Little wonder that Britain wanted to fight this war in total secrecy.</p> <p>There was no need to resort to the Official Secrets Acts or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/31/d-notice-system-state-media-press-freedom\">D-notice system</a> in order to conceal the Dhofar war, and the ruthless manner in which it was being fought, from the outside world. Two simple expedients were employed: no journalists were permitted into the country, and nobody in government mentioned the war. When Wilson published his account of the Labour government of 1964-70, for example, he mentioned the war that the US was fighting in Vietnam almost 250 times. His own government\u2019s war in Oman was not mentioned once.</p> <p>While the Wilson government had every reason to be sensitive about the military support it was providing to a slave-owning despot, whose rule might charitably be described as medieval, there were additional reasons for the all-embracing secrecy. This was an era in which the developing world and the United Nations had rejected colonialism, and Arab nationalism had been growing in strength for decades. It was vital, therefore, for the credibility of the UK in the Middle East, that its hand in Oman should remain largely hidden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2bc9fb93dbcaddf24ec0e05f7a6d05435295f033\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc9fb93dbcaddf24ec0e05f7a6d05435295f033/0_314_5168_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omani rebels, called the adoo by the British, in 1971.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omani rebels, called the <em>adoo</em> by the British, in 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Akehurst, the commander of the Sultan\u2019s Armed Forces from 1972, suggests a further reason for the British government not wishing to draw attention to its war in Dhofar: \u201cThey were perhaps nervous that we were going to lose it.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, by the summer of 1970, Britain\u2019s secret war was going so badly that desperate measures were called for.</p> <p>On 26 July, the Foreign Office in London announced that Sultan Said bin Taimur had been deposed by his 29-year-old son, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/04/oman-sultan-qaboos-despot\">Qaboos bin Said</a>, in a palace coup. In fact, the coup was a very British affair. It had been planned in London by MI6 and by civil servants at the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office, and given the go-ahead after the election that brought Edward Heath into Downing Street.</p> <p>The new sultan immediately abolished slavery, improved the country\u2019s irrigation infrastructure and began to spend his oil revenues on his armed forces. Troops from the SAS arrived, first as the sultan\u2019s bodyguards, and then in squadron strength to fight the <em>adoo</em>. Eventually, the tide turned, journalists were permitted into the country, and by the summer of 1976 the war was won.</p> <p>Strategically, the Dhofar war was one of the most important conflicts of the 20th century, as the victors could expect to control the Strait of Hormuz and the flow of oil. Thousands died, the British won and the west\u2019s lights stayed on. Today, the war is still studied at the Joint Services Command and Staff College in Britain. But because of the way in which information about the long campaign was so successfully suppressed at the time that it was being waged, it has been all but blanked out of the nation\u2019s memory. Like the British wars in Eritrea, Indochina, the Dutch East Indies and Borneo, it is remembered in Britain only by those men who fought it, and their families.</p> <p>Some aspects of Britain\u2019s role in the coup and the war remain among the deep secrets of the British state. Wilson\u2019s correspondence on Oman, for example, and that of his successor Heath, are to remain closed to historians and the public until 2021. In 2005, a Foreign Office memo was briefly made public that describes the way in which the old sultan\u2019s own defence secretary, Colonel Hugh Oldman, had taken the lead role in planning the coup that deposed Oman\u2019s ruler, in order to safeguard British access to the country\u2019s oil and military bases. The document was then hurriedly withdrawn \u2013 its release, the Foreign Office said, had been an unfortunate error.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e9b80c60462b066c7feec98c511a98f3897348d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e9b80c60462b066c7feec98c511a98f3897348d/0_0_4950_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Qaboos bin Said took over from his father in 1970 in a palace coup orchestrated by Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qaboos bin Said took over from his father in 1970 in a palace coup orchestrated by Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Judging from the last decade and a half,</strong> there is little sign that the British state is about to lose its appetite for war. The first conflict of the new century in which the UK became involved was the post-9/11 assault against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</p> <p>This war enjoyed early success, but stuttered and soured after the UK\u2019s mission expanded to Helmand in the south of the country. The war dragged on, costing an estimated 95,000 lives over 13 years, including those of 453 British servicemen and women, and brought little discernible benefit to the people of Afghanistan. The 21st century\u2019s second war \u2013 the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2013 was possibly the UK\u2019s greatest foreign policy disaster since Suez. Casualty estimates vary widely, from 150,000 dead to more than a million. What cannot be disputed is that 179 of the dead were British. More than a decade later, Iraq remains in chaos.</p> <p>The post-9/11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq were fought in the full glare of the media and came to haunt the politicians who had initiated them. Despite this, Britain continued to invest in war \u2013 politically, technically and financially \u2013 as a means of projecting power and securing influence among key allies, and also, it seemed at times, in an attempt to impose order and a degree of familiarity upon a chaotic and unpredictable world.</p> <p>But could this be done in secret? Surely, in the age of global media, 24-hour rolling news, social media, and the troops\u2019 own ability to record and instantly share images of conflict, it would be impossible for a British government to go to war and conceal its actions, in the way that Britain\u2019s war in Dhofar was hidden from the public for six-and-a-half years? Tony Jeapes, who commanded the first SAS squadron that was covertly deployed to Oman, considered this question, and concluded that while such secrecy was \u201can ideal state of affairs\u201d, it would probably be impossible to repeat.</p> <p>In the years since the Dhofar war, the UK\u2019s special forces have been gradually expanded, and since 1996, all its members have been obliged to sign a confidentiality agreement. This has reinforced the discretion with which members of elite units within the military traditionally perform their duties, and it has rarely been broken.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the evolution of successive generations of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, has presented military planners with greater opportunities to mount operations that could remain unknown, other than to those who are ordering, planning and executing them, and to those on the receiving end.</p> <p>The reliance of modern societies on the internet and the increasing frequency with which states probe and attack each other\u2019s cyber defences have led some analysts to talk of a hybrid warfare, much of which is shrouded in deniability. The result is that the line between war and peace is increasingly blurred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fa912515c2a6b068ae7e1abbb815bc42926c1fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fa912515c2a6b068ae7e1abbb815bc42926c1fc/0_176_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An RAF Reaper.

It appeared that a lethal trinity of special forces, drones and local proxies was being brought to bear in a way that would spare the British public the disagreeable details of the nature of modern war, and relieve parliament of the need to debate the wisdom of waging it.</p> <p>In July 2007, less than a week after succeeding Tony Blair as prime minister, Gordon Brown had announced a series of sweeping constitutional changes that he said would make the British government \u201ca better servant of the people\u201d. One measure \u2013 clearly a response to the deeply unpopular war in Iraq and the calamitous and costly expedition into Helmand \u2013 was to give members of parliament the final say on declarations of war.</p> <p>Six years later, in August 2013, parliament exercised its new right when MPs rejected a government motion that would have authorised military intervention in Syria\u2019s bloody civil war.</p> <p>Ministers of the coalition government were appalled by the vote \u2013 it was said to be the first against a British prime minister\u2019s foreign policy since 1782 \u2013 and argued that it not only blocked the deployment of British troops, it also prevented the UK from providing any military assistance whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear to me,\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons, \u201cthat the British parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that and the government will act accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>But those words \u2013 \u201cact accordingly\u201d \u2013 were not quite what they seemed.</p> <p>In July 2015, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, gave MPs an update on the renewed military operations in Iraq \u2013 the campaign that Cameron had announced while standing before two union jack flags and declaring the British to be \u201ca peaceful people\u201d. The RAF, he said, had carried out 300 air strikes in Iraq, there were 900 UK personnel engaged, and the operation had cost \u00a345m in the previous 12 months. He reassured his audience that \u201cour position remains that we would return to the House for approval before conducting air strikes in Syria\u201d.</p> <p>Before making this statement, Fallon was said to have been unsettled by talk in Washington political circles that the UK\u2019s refusal to act in Syria could be seen only as a sign of British decrepitude. His statement was deeply misleading: for at least 18 months, RAF pilots who were said to have been \u201cembedded\u201d with the US and Canadian military had been carrying out airstrikes against targets in Syria. Others had been flying combat missions with the French military over Mali. They were said to be under the command of these foreign forces, but they were clearly a British contribution to a war that MPs had decided the country should avoid.</p> <p>Two weeks later the truth was out, and Fallon was back on his feet in the Commons, explaining himself to angry MPs.</p> <p>\u201cEmbedded\u201d service personnel were nothing new, he declared; they comply with UK law, but \u201chave to comply with the rules of engagement of the host nation\u201d. He had not publicised what had been happening because these pilots had been assisting with other countries\u2019 operations. Moreover, he made clear that the failure to publicise what was happening should be regarded as \u201cstandard practice\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/17/british-pilots-took-part-in-anti-isis-bombing-campaign-in-syria\">British pilots took part in anti-Isis bombing campaign in Syria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In December 2015, MPs voted that overt military action against Islamic State forces should finally proceed. The government was given parliamentary approval for military operations that had already been covertly under way for two years.</p> <p>In the Gulf, meanwhile, it was disclosed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/british-us-military-in-command-room-saudi-strikes-yemen?CMP=share_btn_tw\">British military personnel were sitting in the control rooms</a> from which the Saudi Arabian air force was guiding its bombers on to targets across Yemen. The British were helping their Saudi counterparts key in the codes that would help them select and attack their targets. The Saudis were not only flying British-built aircraft and dropping British-made bombs, they were dropping vast numbers of them. Over a three-month period in 2015, the value of exports of British-made bombs and missiles had increased by 11,000%, from \u00a39m to \u00a31bn.</p> <p>This bombing campaign has been heavily criticised by rights groups for causing thousands of civilian deaths. In parliament, the British government has had little to say about this, other than to insist that it \u201cobeys the norms of humanitarian law\u201d.</p> <p>Once again, the government appeared to be quietly pulling the country into a Middle Eastern conflict without any parliamentary oversight or approval.

  "<p>Speaking at a literary festival in Bhutan, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh recently predicted that Himalayan regions, for no fault of their own, will face a catastrophe as climate change takes hold. So chilling was Ghosh that the local paper reported \u2013 only half in jest \u2013 that a disturbed audience had to be soothed by a subsequent talk by Buddhist monks.<br></p> <p>Ghosh, best known for his historical novels, has been travelling the world talking about his new book, <a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html\">The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable</a>, born out of a series of lectures at the University of Chicago.</p> <p> </p> <p>One of its central themes is that writers, artists and filmmakers, including himself, have largely ignored climate change \u2013 \u201che great derangement\u201d of the title \u2013 simply because it seems too far-fetched and terrifying. </p> <p>But does it really make a difference if authors write about climate change? \u201cMaking a difference isn\u2019t the point; the point is to examine the meaning of the arts. If we believe that the arts are meant to look ahead, open doors, then how is this huge issue of our time, absent from the arts? It\u2019s like death, no one wants to talk about it,\u201d Ghosh said.</p> <p>He is deeply critical of the global carbon-dependent economy, and believes we need to return to traditional methods of agriculture. He talks about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/27/india-drought-migrants-head-to-cities-in-desperate-search-for-water\">current drought in western India</a>, partly caused by a shift to water-hungry crops, which has caused thousands of farmers to migrate to the cities. </p> <p>\u201cThe desires of people everywhere<strong> </strong>are now to do with carbon. That farmer in India, who once knew how to cultivate drought resistant crops like millet and barley, he is better equipped to dealing with climate change than your city dweller eating rice. Meanwhile, you and I are going to be dead in the water.\u201d </p> <p>The book traces the paths to development taken by India, China and the west. Ghosh is a supporter of climate justice \u2013 which looks at the historical responsibilities of nations for climate change, and is quite clear that India and China deserve reparations for choosing more sustainable paths \u2013 India by choosing a spartan Gandhian model of development for years, China by choosing the one child policy, even at the cost of inflicting great suffering. Meanwhile, the west pursued a consumerist, carbon-intensive economy, unimpeded. He is also scathing about the Paris climate deal, which he calls \u201ctepid\u201d in its approach to climate justice, and leaves poor nations dependent on the charity of richer nations.</p> <p> But he is also critical of India\u2019s current mulish stance on climate change: refusing to compromise on growth until climate reparations are made. Instead, he thinks India needs to do both. \u201cIt is pretty clear from the Paris agreement that climate justice is not going to happen. We need to keep that issue alive, work for it, but also work towards preventing a catastrophe. When the great wave comes, are you going to say, hey don\u2019t take me, I am Indian?\u201d</p> <p>In the book, Ghosh grimly predicts a \u201cpolitics of the armed lifeboat\u201d where the poor of the global south will be left to their doom while the rich go on unscathed. Nevertheless, he also wonders if the poor may well be more resilient. </p> <p>\u201cIn 2003, the European heatwave caused 46,000 deaths,\u201d he muses. \u201cWhen the power goes out in New York, there is a crime wave. When the power goes out in India, several times a day, no one even notices. It\u2019s quite possible the middle class will be the most affected, and the really poor and rich will survive.\u201d</p> <p>Worryingly, Ghosh has few solutions to offer. In the book, he hopes religious figures will get involved in climate change, governments having failed. \u201cI am not sure there are solutions. The problem is of such a scale that we are dwarfed by it,\u201d he said.</p>",

He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> <p>He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22.

Elijah Cummings via the House oversight committee, but here\u2019s a snippet of Powell\u2019s email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I didn\u2019t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> <p>Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> <p>However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the President\u2019s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won\u2019t be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful.

And while the actual details of league\u2019s shadiness aren\u2019t ever common; the perception of shadiness, which matters most, is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/nsw-police-launch-investigation-into-alleged-nrl-match-fixing\">NSW Police launch investigation into alleged NRL match fixing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How deep a shade do the allegations cast on Richard Ings\u2019 then-ridiculed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/07/australian-doping-sport-drugs\">blackest day in Australian sport</a>\u201d line in 2013? Looking back, Ings\u2019 illustration was in response to evidence that personal relationships between professional athletes and organised criminal identities might \u201chave resulted in match fixing and the fraudulent manipulation of betting markets\u201d.</p> <p>In the quest to win the battle of perception, perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter. Such a brutal job was done on mocking the drama of that moment that mere mention of \u201cblackest days\u201d might simply incite a shudder and nothing more. People cope in their own way.</p> <p>In a recent radio interview, CEO Todd Greenberg said that when it came to rugby league, he was conscious \u201cnot to take the \u2018soap\u2019 out of the soap opera\u201d. A grabby media line, sure, but an instructive one too. Since Donny Lane defied residential rules and played for Glebe, not Annandale, in 1917, shadiness has forever been part of the game.</p> <p>League fans have developed the resilience to embrace it and own it, too. Humour helps.</p> <p>Early in the Wests Tigers game on Sunday, a solitary roar emerged from somewhere near the grandstand. The home team, trying to keep their season alive, had conceded another debatable penalty \u2013 laying on the ball too long. \u201cWe get it ref! Jarryd Hayne must play semi-finals!\u201d came the raspy, conspiratory cry, followed by laughter at the notionally absurd joke.</p> <p>League-types, with backs to the wall, stick together. Witness one of the game\u2019s wisest, funniest and senior elder statesmen, Roy Masters, commencing an analysis of the match-fixing allegations on ABCs Melbourne-based TV program, Offsiders, after they emerged in June. The man who first coined the term Fibros and Silvertails was sitting alongside an all-Melburnian panel of Gerard Whateley, Caroline Wilson and Waleed Aly. On the allegations, he submitted that \u201cwhat it all boils down to is this: people want it to be true, because it adds to the salacious gossip, rumour and innuendo surrounding sport, particularly at this chilly time of the year\u201d.</p> <p>In one way, the construction of rugby league as the sporting embodiment of Who Weekly works in its favour. Fans are conditioned to the tawdry vulgarity of league\u2019s weekly drama; it\u2019s part of the show. Sydney, where these latest acts of alleged sin are set, has forever been its moral home. </p> <p>Speaking at the Tom Brock Annual Lecture in 2001, the late playwright and league devotee Alex Buzo described 19<sup>th</sup> century Sydney as a \u201craffish capital with rather too much in the way of violence and corruption\u2026looked at rather askance by the rest of the country\u2026its dominant sport called \u2018Thugby League\u2019\u201d. In 2016, despite some well-intentioned attempts at polish, the game still retains that identity \u2013 its devotees revel in its earthiness; and outsiders are rarely envious.</p> <p>So when match-fixing allegations emerge, the league public can be forgiven for thinking they\u2019ve heard things like this before. In the spirit of scandal, there will be intimate interest in the sordid detail, no doubt, but not for them the confected and puritanical shock and horror that fans of other sports may habour. </p> <p>It remains to be seen just how large the appetite is for yet another sermon \u2013 another navel-gazing exercise \u2013 on the insidious links between gambling money and the game itself. The same money that rugby league elder statesman Phil Gould, in response to the Gillard government\u2019s proposed poker machine legislation in 2011, said would \u201cdestroy your club, and the game of rugby league at all levels in the Sydney metropolitan area\u201d. That sermon will come, but is the cognitive dissonance too strong?</p> <p>And as news of the police investigation emerged on Wednesday, administrators and custodians were quick to advise to be careful what you say; that these things are difficult to prove; and you don\u2019t want to cast blanket aspersions on the innocent. The reaction amongst the league rank and file to the news was typically muted. It was not out of shock. They haven\u2019t actually been here before, but it feels like they have.</p> <p>The game\u2019s fabric may be damaged, but as with scars, some people just prefer it that way. </p>"
