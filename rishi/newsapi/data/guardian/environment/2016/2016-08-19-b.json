  "<p>The IOC president, Thomas Bach, was present on a ribald, boozy and tremendously fun night at the Deodoro Stadium to see Australia\u2019s Chloe Esposito overcome a 45-second deficit to win gold in the women\u2019s modern pentathlon. The British representatives, Kate French and Samantha Murray, finished sixth and ninth respectively, the first time Team GB have failed to make the podium since the competition was introduced at Sydney in 2000.</p> <p>Both women had entertained faint hopes of a podium finish after three of the event\u2019s four phases and five disciplines. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, I couldn\u2019t have asked for any more after my fencing yesterday,\u201d said French. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t great but I kept moving up today, I finished 19th yesterday so I moved up a lot.\u201d</p> <p>French finished joint top in the showjumping round while Murray came fourth in the swimming and won an impressive eight consecutive contests before going out in the bonus round of the fencing. The 26-year-old from Preston won silver at London 2012 and became a pub quiz staple in the process, her medal being the final one of 65 in total won at those Games by British athletes. French started the final discipline 59 seconds after the Polish leader, Oktawia Nowacka. Murray was a further nine seconds behind as the field tackled a three kilometre run, pausing occasionally to shoot at targets with a laser pistol. Nowacka eventually finished third, behind Esposito and Eloudie Clouvel from France.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/18/rio-2016-olympics-modern-pentathlon-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5va8e\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2664725\"            data-video-name=\"Rio 2016 Olympics modern pentathlon: all you need to know \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b573f1e4b062ce4d2246eb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/18/rio-2016-olympics-modern-pentathlon-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\">Rio 2016 Olympics modern pentathlon: all you need to know</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Do not be fooled by the name: this sport is over a century old and was invented with the intention of glorifying manliness and militarism. While its exact history has been disputed since its conception in 1894, it is no more modern than many of that particular year\u2019s other landmark wheezes: Blackpool Tower, the Manchester Ship Canal and the Merseyside derby.</p> <p>Designed to incorporate the skills required by cavalry soldiers of the time, the modern pentathlon included all the hardships a military man behind enemy lines might expect to endure on a particularly bad day: swimming, running, riding an unfamiliar horse and taking on enemies with a pistol or sword: two ways to kill a man, as the Irish broadcaster Ciaran Murphy recently observed, with three more to get away.</p> <p>It is when the unfamiliar horse gets involved that matters stray beyond each athlete\u2019s control. In the wake of the swimming and fencing events, 18 horses were led into the showjumping arena, previously the home of rugby sevens. A well groomed and haughty selection of accomplished bay, chestnut and grey showjumpers ranging in age between eight and 16, they are assigned by ballot to competitors who have never sat on them, with often hilarious consequences. At the Mexico 1968 Olympics, the West German pentathlete Hans J\u00fcrgen Todt had to be separated from the uncooperative Ranchero, after frustration got the better of him and he began swinging haymakers at his steed.<br></p> <p>There was no such violence here and French could not have done better on Arnold Massangana. \u201cI always enjoy the riding but it\u2019s quite hit and miss whether you get on with your horse or not,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, I rode really well and my horse was really good to me, so I had a really nice clear.\u201d</p> <p>Murray had to acquaint herself with Up Class Girl, whose biography suggested the eight-year-old mare might be a difficult customer. As the new partnership waited their turn to tackle the obstacles, the mount of Leydi Moya refused and unceremoniously catapulted her rider into a fence and the Cuban was subsequently carried from the arena in a neck brace and on a stretcher. Murray went round unharmed but picked up 21 faults.</p> <p>Previously, in the fencing bonus event, she had done a more than passable impression of Errol Flynn, swishing her \u00e9p\u00e9e with aplomb as she won eight consecutive duels to work her way up the leaderboard. Shrieking \u201cYes!\u201d repeatedly as she won one quick-fire round after another, she might also have been mistaken for Meg Ryan during the famous restaurant scene in When Harry Met Sally. Following the previous day\u2019s fencing ranking event, this new bonus round enabled those who had performed badly to make up ground.</p> <p>Fittingly, given the sport\u2019s origins, Rio 2016\u2019s modern pentathlon was staged on the grounds of the city\u2019s biggest army barracks, the occupants of which have been press-ganged into Olympic security duty. The sight of them at their temporary work suggests a more modern modern pentathlon might incorporate such disciplines as giving directions to lost journalists, posing for photos with foreign sports fans, looking slightly menacing while holding a machine gun and standing around being very bored.</p> <p>While parachute jumping and grenade throwing have long since been eliminated from the sport in favour of more ground-based, less lethal and spectator friendly activities, there have been some more recent innovations.</p> <p>Before 2009 shooting and running were separate events, until the two disciplines were merged to make the former more testing for athletes. It is in this event that the modern pentathlon is won or lost, with the disciplines that precede it dictating in what order the athletes take to the run-and-shoot course and with how much time to make up on the leader.</p> <p>Helping to make an occasionally complicated sport easier to follow, it could scarcely be more simple: everyone sets off at intervals but first past the finishing post wins gold.</p>",
  "<p>Tom Heaton knew the meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson was unlikely to go well and so, at least, he was not disappointed. It was towards the end of the 2009-10 season and the Burnley and England goalkeeper, who was then in his 13th year at Manchester United, had reached a decision. He would be leaving the club that summer.</p> <p>Ferguson had wanted him to sign a new contract and had told him the offer was there. But Heaton had turned 24 and he needed regular football. There was a further factor in play, something that would shape the dynamic sharply. Heaton was at the end of his deal and he would leave Old Trafford as a free agent. And so, there he was, about to break the news to Ferguson.</p> <p>Heaton\u2019s recollections are heavy on understatement. \u201cHe was pretty short with me,\u201d he says, before adding: \u201cIt got heated for a minute or two.\u201d It is a scene that is easy to imagine and given the legendary nature of Ferguson\u2019s rages, to embellish to varying degrees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/21/tom-heaton-england-squad-joe-hart-football\">Roy Hodgson calls up Tom Heaton to England squad as Joe Hart replacement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI understood,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI\u2019d spent an awful long time at the club, I joined them at 11 and, after everything they\u2019d put into me, I was walking out of the door as a Bosman free transfer. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to that meeting, if I\u2019m being honest. But, deep down, I knew it was the right decision.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson did too and a few weeks later he had Heaton back in the office. \u201cHe said he was always there for me, if I ever needed him,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cHe respected my decision and he understood it. That was incredible for me to hear. Every time I have seen him since \u2013 you stand up straight and it\u2019s: \u2018Hi, boss. How you doing?\u2019 You never lose that factor. But he\u2019s always been brilliant. He sent me a few messages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/21/tom-heaton-england-squad-joe-hart-football\">when I got into the England squad</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI never made a competitive appearance for United but I travelled as the No3 and I got on the bench 20, 25 times for the first team. I was in and around it at that level but I knew I wanted to be a No1. It was always a risk. But I think getting into the Premier League two years ago with Burnley justified the decision.\u201d</p> <p>Heaton is back in the big time, after he and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/sean-dyche-promoted-burnley-win-championship-title\">Burnley bounced straight back</a> from their relegation in 2015 as last season\u2019s Championship winners and the club captain cannot hide the excitement. There is a buzz in the old Lancashire mill town, which has endured tough times, and the 1-0 defeat at home to Swansea City on the opening weekend has not dampened it. Liverpool are the visitors to Turf Moor on Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cThe football club really is the heartbeat of the town,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cYou drive along and one in two people have a Burnley shirt on. My dad was born in Burnley and he was a Burnley fan growing up, and his dad was a Burnley fan, too. I was born in Chester but having had that family connection \u2013 and I\u2019ve still got a few relatives here \u2013 I was aware of how big the club was. Still, when I signed three years ago, it opened my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to have a tightknit community that is so connected to the football club. In this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/burnley-swansea-premier-league-match-report\">day and age of the Premier League</a>, which is a global brand, there is a real core in the town. You can almost feel the passion and positivity from the fans. They really get behind the players.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6955a27e8c0f99059e91558d3eacfbc634f6d90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6955a27e8c0f99059e91558d3eacfbc634f6d90/0_82_3766_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Burnley fans turn out to in force to celebrate their team\u2019s triumph in the 2015/16 Sky Bet Football League.

It has been a wild ride but the club\u2019s values, as preached by the manager, Sean Dyche, are set in stone.</p> <p>\u201cThe manager often talks about the minimum requirement, which is to give everything you\u2019ve got for the shirt and that message has got out,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cThe fans have seen it over the last few years. If you see someone giving everything they\u2019ve got for the shirt, you can get behind it. That\u2019s been a key factor, certainly in my time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/burnley-leicester-promotion-sean-dyche-premier-league\">Burnley inspired by the Leicester story but no one is getting ahead of themselves | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an awful lot of knowledge about the town\u2019s economic situation but one thing I would say is that having Premier League football back helps. It puts it on the map. Everyone is aware of it, worldwide, so that should give it a boost in itself. There really is a good buzz about the football club and it gives everyone a lift.\u201d</p> <p>Dyche has been in charge since October 2012 and in the Premier League there are only two managers who have been in jobs for longer \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe, who was Dyche\u2019s predecessor at Burnley. The watchwords of his tenure have been relentlessness, inclusion, hard work and discipline, and Heaton sees similarities between him and Ferguson.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly, on the man-management side of things, there are things that are similar,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI\u2019m relatively sure that he [Dyche] has quite a good relationship with the boss and the way he is, I\u2019d imagine he likes to take a bit from people he comes across.</p> <p>\u201cIn my experience with Ferguson, he was firm but he was always fair. He was very approachable. You could talk to him, you could have a laugh but if you ever crossed that line, he\u2019d let you know. That would certainly be a similarity here [with Dyche]. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/burnley-leicester-promotion-sean-dyche-premier-league\">We have fantastic relationships at the club</a>, massive respect but you know that if you step out of line, he will be the first to tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Heaton is asked the hypothetical question about how he would feel about telling Dyche he was leaving the club on a free transfer. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would give me both barrels,\u201d Heaton says, with a wry smile.</p> <p>Heaton was one of the reserve goalkeepers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/england-euro-2016-squad-23-picked-roy-hodgson\">Roy Hodgson\u2019s England squad at Euro 2016</a> and his journey to the top can be described as circuitous. During his time at United he had loan periods at Swindon Town, Royal Antwerp, Cardiff, Queens Park Rangers, Rochdale and Wycombe Wanderers, and he is part of the select band to have played in all four divisions of English football. His experience of League Two came at Rochdale in 2009-10, while he remembers the stint at Swindon in 2005-06 with particular fondness.</p> <p>\u201cAndy King took me there as a 19-year-old and I got my first league experience in League One,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to him now, thinking back. It\u2019s tough to get that opening but he took a risk on me. On some days it was good and on others, it was not so good. You\u2019ve just got to go through that.\u201d</p> <p>The lot of a young goalkeeper, particularly at a top club, can seem thankless. They work and they work but the breakthrough can resemble a dot on the horizon. At United, Ferguson was never going to drop Edwin van der Sar and when the Dutchman was unavailable in 2009-10, for example, there was Ben Foster or Tomasz Kuszczak to come in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/sean-dyche-promoted-burnley-win-championship-title\">Sean Dyche tells promoted Burnley to win Championship title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a funny one, the goalkeeping position,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like centre-forward, where a young lad might be given, say, 10 minutes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/29/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-new-deal-england\">Marcus Rashford at United is a prime example</a>. You give him a taste and he does unbelievably well. You give him a bit more, and look at him now.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really do that with a goalkeeper. It\u2019s a position where you take less risks because any slight issue causes a problem. There is no substitute for going through those days when you\u2019ll be chucking it in and at the top level, you just can\u2019t afford that.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go and gain that experience, go through those things and I was aware of that. I had that desire to play \u2013 what I would call earning a career.\u201d</p> <p>Heaton\u2019s form for Burnley earned him the recognition at senior England level. He made his debut as a late substitute in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/england-australia-international-friendly-match-report\">pre-Euro 2016 warm-up against Australia</a> and although it was, to use his words, \u201csix minutes and two touches\u201d, it meant everything to him.</p> <p>\u201cThe really disappointing thing about the finals was that everything was in place,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cI actually thought the performances in the group games were really good and if you had asked me two hours <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\">before the Iceland defeat</a>, I\u2019d have said: \u2018We\u2019re going a long way here.\u2019 For whatever reason, it just didn\u2019t happen. But on a personal note, the experience was absolutely brilliant and having had that taste, it just makes me want more. I\u2019ve got a real hunger and ambition to step on.\u201d</p> <p>His priority is to help Burnley retain their hard-won Premier League status. During the relegation season in 2014\u201115, they started slowly but in the final reckoning they were only five points off survival. Dyche has found the summer transfer market tough but he did add a midfielder, Steven Defour, from Anderlecht, for a club record \u00a38m earlier in the week.</p> <p>\u201cWe are stronger than last time, we have got more experience and more strength in depth,\u201d Heaton says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to make those things count. We all know it\u2019s going to be a tough challenge but it\u2019s one that we are going to embrace and we\u2019ll see where that takes us.\u201d</p>",

And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency.</p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience.</p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten.

Rio is his seventh Games and, though he\u2019s not done yet, most likely his last.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/19/nick-skelton-individual-showjumping-gold-rio-olympics-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vgvq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2668895\"            data-video-name=\"Rio 2016: Nick Skelton takes individual showjumping gold \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b74fdee4b0377cf1118416\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/19/160819skelton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/19/160819skelton_KP-2055174.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/19/160819skelton.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/19/nick-skelton-individual-showjumping-gold-rio-olympics-video\">Rio 2016: Nick Skelton takes individual showjumping gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am not going to stop now. I only ride Big Star at the moment. When he stops, I will stop. For definite,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been in the sport a long time. I am so happy \u2013 it was amazing. I was just emotional on the podium because I am so happy with what I\u2019ve done. To do it now is unbelievable. It is pretty emotional for all concerned.\u201d</p> <p>Skelton has been jumping competitively since the early 70s. Even allowing for the commonly long careers in equestrian sport, it is a singular record. It might not have been after a broken neck in 2000 forced his retirement but his full recovery and return to competition two years later has been the stuff of showjumping folklore.</p> <p>Despite six world and 10 European championship medals, the Olympics always proved a tougher mark. He was leading on a horse named Arko until the final round in Athens 2004 before blowing it, and only in 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/london-2012-olympics-showjumping\">did he finally make the podium</a> with gold as part of the GB jumping team.

Big Star, dancing eagerly on his toes before the off as if he knew his moment had arrived, tore into the course with visible enthusiasm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/charley-hull-olympic-golf-justin-rose\">Charley Hull on course for Olympic success with help from Justin Rose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over bars, double and triple jumps and a water obstacle he soared, tossing his head with the arrogance of a champion in between. The result was near perfect, another double clear, and catapulted Skelton to the top of the standings as the sole rider with no penalties in either round.</p> <p>A wait followed to see who could match him. Steve Guerdat, the Swiss reigning Olympic champion, nailed it with immaculate precision on board Nino des Buissonnets, guaranteeing a jump\u2011off. They were soon joined by the Qatari Sheikh Ali Al\u2011Thani, a member of the Gulf state\u2019s royal family on board the equally regal-looking First Devision, and then Kent Farrington of the US, who seemed to grin through his double clear round aboard Voyeur. Peder Fredricson of Sweden joined the elite crew, as did Canada\u2019s Eric Lamaze, and now six would contest the medals.</p> <p>Skelton was first out. This time Big Star looked calmer. They stood still before the off, knowing exactly what was required but Skelton again jumped aggressively, throwing his horse through the obstacles with all the risk/reward mastery of his years. Another double clear.</p> <p>\u201cI was first to go in the jump-off, and I thought in my mind to go as fast as I could, but be safe,\u201d Skelton said. \u201cHe\u2019s a quick horse anyway, and I had to be clear, because it adds a bit of pressure on everyone else. I needed luck on my side, and it was today.\u201d</p> <p>Guerdat was up next and cracked, hitting the first fence. Then the Sheikh from Qatar, so upright as to be almost leaning backwards, lost his cool and knocked over two. Shakey. The American Farrington winged a couple and Skelton was guaranteed a medal. But which colour?</p> <p>Last to go were Pederson and Lamaze. The Swede looked good and went clear but with time now added as a factor, came in 0.53 behind Skelton. Silver at least. Lamaze was fast but not quite accurate, clipping a single fence and Skelton, approaching his seventh decade, had his first individual gold medal and Britain\u2019s 23rd in Rio. It was silver for Pederson and bronze for Lamaze.</p> <p>Skelton was besieged in the aftermath, flushed and euphoric, signing shirts like a superstar and grappled repeatedly in bear hugs from friends and admirers at the Deodoro Arena. But, like nearly all in his sport, he reserved the strongest affections for his Dutch-bred horse.</p> <p>\u201cToday [Big Star] was absolutely amazing. The last competition he won was the Aachen grand prix in 2013 \u2013 it has been two years to get him back. It has taken a lot of work, but I always knew if we could get him right then he could do this.</p> <p>\u201cHe is an absolutely amazing horse. He has all the right attributes and he is the best horse I am ever likely to have. I have nursed him and nursed him, and he has come good for me \u2013 this is for him.\u201d</p> <p>Big Star is 13. Doing all the hard work means he won\u2019t have Skelton\u2019s longevity and the 2020 Tokyo Games would be a stretch too far. So if Skelton is as good as his word, he has won the Olympics with his final shot. Tell that to the grandchildren.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun</a> </figure>",
  "<p>In August 2007, Peter Connelly, a blond, blue-eyed toddler from north London, was found dead in his cot at home. Just over a year later, in November 2008, Peter\u2019s mother, Tracy Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were convicted of \u201ccausing or allowing\u201d Peter\u2019s death, and the public, shocked by the horrific details of the abuse \u2013 he had more than 50 injuries to his small body \u2013 wanted to know how it had happened.</p> <p>The case was heartbreaking, though hardly clear-cut. The events leading up to the tragedy involved a range of public agencies: Peter was on Haringey council\u2019s child protection register and had been seen more than 60 times by social workers, police and health workers. But no one anticipated the extreme public response to the convictions (there had been 56 other child homicides in the year Peter died, none of which provoked a similar reaction), and the tragedy rapidly snowballed into a major political crisis involving David Cameron, then an unproven leader of the Tory opposition; Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s powerful secretary of state for children and families; and Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the Sun.</p> <p>Cameron, possibly looking to promote his \u201cBroken Britain\u201d agenda, declared Baby P to be a Labour policy failure \u2013 breaking a parliamentary convention that child deaths are not exploited for political gain. He was enthusiastically cheered on by Brooks, whose reporters relentlessly pursued Haringey\u2019s director of children\u2019s services, Sharon Shoesmith, and who set up a Sun petition calling for her to be fired. Balls, wrong-footed by Cameron and unsettled by the shrill media response to the death, set in train events that would lead within a month to Shoesmith\u2019s brutal sacking by Balls, live on TV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/29/ed-balls-sharon-shoesmith-baby-p-sacking-payout\">Ed Balls: no regrets about sacking Sharon Shoesmith over Baby P affair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today Shoesmith is a mixture of steely resolve and vulnerability, of resilience and apprehension. She says she has come to terms with what happened to her, but especially in public, \u201cI remain anxious that someone is going to come at me.\u201d It is understandable, given the thoroughness with which she was vilified. Tabloid journalists camped outside her door. She was demonised daily in the press, harassed in the streets and \u2013 in a foreshadowing of today\u2019s social media storms \u2013 subjected to thousands of abusive texts and a hail of online abuse, including death threats. At times she considered taking her own life.</p> <p>Today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/19/stop-scapegoating-social-workers-to-better-protect-children-shoesmith-says\">Shoesmith publishes a book</a> that attempts to understand why and how she became public enemy No 1. It is remarkably calm and forensically well-researched (it is based on the PhD she undertook after she lost her job). There is little outward bitterness towards the politicians who opportunistically hung her out to dry (though it is a fascinating account of the frenzied realpolitik in Westminster and the media at the tail end of New Labour). The book is not about her, she says, nor about settling scores, but about politics and the media, about blame and the power of public emotion.</p> <p>For all its comprehensive and persuasive dissection of the Baby P effect, she has no expectations that the book will change the negative public and tabloid media view of her. \u201cI do not have a choice, really. It\u2019s what I have to live with.\u201d There have been some successful attempts over the years to unpick what might be called the Sun\u2019s version of events, including a powerful BBC documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/baby-p-untold-story-cover-up-bbc\">Baby P \u2013 the Untold Story</a>, which was broadcast two years ago and systematically deconstructed the idea that social workers alone were to blame for Peter\u2019s death. Even Brooks admitted during the Leveson inquiry that her paper\u2019s coverage of Shoesmith had been \u201ccruel, harsh and over the top\u201d. But the deep-rooted narrative that Shoesmith and the social workers were to blame is hard to shift; facts incongruent with that dominant narrative, she says, tend to be filtered out, and challenging it can be seen as \u201ctantamount to condoning Peter\u2019s death\u201d. In June she was interviewed by Piers Morgan on the TV show Good Morning Britain. \u201cStraight away it was an attack,\u201d she recalls, Morgan accusing her of calling herself a \u201cvictim\u201d, something she says she has never done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18785b519ad0b25f2c1efcc9969fbb3ad5a5b9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18785b519ad0b25f2c1efcc9969fbb3ad5a5b9c9/0_261_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Connelly, also known as Baby P\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Connelly, also known as Baby P</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: itv NEWS/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has close friends and family who know her and who she really is, she says, and that protects her: \u201cEnough people who know me reflect that back to me.\u201d But she will never control her public identity: \u201cNobody wants to hear. You cannot reconstruct yourself. It continues. You are defined as this person and nobody wants to change it.\u201d</p> <p>Her book contains a brilliant chapter \u2013 based in part on private Whitehall emails that came to light during her own legal fight \u2013 that charts how the political establishment, hand-in-hand with the media, allowed a narrative of individual blame to deflect criticism from themselves and construct a simple explanation for a complex story. As she pored over the emails years after the event, it was a shock to realise how, within six days of the conviction of Peter\u2019s killers, it was decided behind the scenes that she and Haringey\u2019s social workers were to be held responsible. (The role of the police and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jun/14/baby-peter-whistleblower-great-ormond-street-apologises\">Great Ormond Street hospital</a> would be largely ignored.)</p> <p>Shoesmith writes of how the Ofsted inquiry report gave Balls, who was under pressure from Brooks, the ammunition to sack her. Her dismissal, Shoesmith realised, was the price of political closure. \u201cHow naive was I!\u201d she says. \u201cLooking back at the court material, there was a sense that [they felt that] if they hit me hard enough I would never stand up again. And I nearly didn\u2019t. I came very close to not standing up again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/19/stop-scapegoating-social-workers-to-better-protect-children-shoesmith-says\">Stop scapegoating social workers to better protect children, Shoesmith says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Did she really not have any inkling that she was going to be sacrificed? Right up to her sacking, she says, she blithely trusted that reason and fairness would prevail. \u201cI could see that much of what had been said was lies, and I expected that someone else would know that and do something about it.\u201d Some senior colleagues had been privately encouraging \u2013 more than 60 Haringey head teachers wrote a letter in support of her \u2013 and she continued to go into work each day. Being removed from her job live on TV, unbelievable as it seems now, took her by surprise. \u201cI was frozen to the spot for a long time. That was the point of absolute shock, mental and physical horror that took years to overcome.\u201d</p> <p>A few days before her sacking, a well-meaning colleague rang her with some advice. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018There is no way back from this: move out, change your name, resign, go and buy a little house in Essex or somewhere and start all over again.\u2019\u201d She was horrified. She vowed that she couldn\u2019t resign, because this would have implied guilt. In the book she explains: \u201cHaving spent a lifetime working for children, I was unable to countenance being held responsible for the murder of a child. My resignation would most certainly have signified personal responsibility, and the many distortions of what had been reported in the media would remain unchallenged. I was being invited to take the blame, or be the scapegoat, for the killing of Peter Connelly, presented as my \u2018public accountability\u2019\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"978f30304f3bc881d5c2fb6d38a88fe494ffd693\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978f30304f3bc881d5c2fb6d38a88fe494ffd693/0_56_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoesmith (second from left) outside the High Court in London after winning appeal against her sacking following the death of Baby P.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoesmith (second from left) outside the High Court in London in May 2011, after winning an appeal against her sacking following the death of Baby P.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the criticism of her then and since has been about the notion that she did not apologise, or was not apologetic enough; and that she, as the accountable director, should have taken responsibility. She says she apologised many times for the failure of safeguarding staff to prevent the death, but she will never apologise in a way that suggests she was responsible for his death. The judge in her court case, she says, pointed out that \u201cpublic accountability does not mean that heads should roll\u201d. If every children\u2019s director resigned after a child homicide, there would be no one in post, she says. Accountability has to be realistic: \u201cYou cannot expect that social workers can prevent every death of every child. You have to remember that this is happening every week, not all of them known to social care.\u201d</p> <p>Refusing to slink away from Haringey was not just about pride, she realised, but about protecting her sanity. \u201cYour identity gets very knocked about. Identity is important, because you have a self-perception of who you are, what sort of person you are, and, of course, I saw myself as someone who cared deeply, and I wasn\u2019t the person I was being portrayed as. People say: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you just change your name?\u2019 But changing your name is tantamount to guilt as well in the end.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/baby-p-untold-story-cover-up-bbc\">Baby P: the Untold Story is the anatomy of an establishment cover-up | Patrick Butler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It probably came as a surprise to Balls and Haringey (which had formally sacked her without compensation) when Shoesmith got up off the floor and launched a judicial review for unfair dismissal in March 2009. Two years later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/oct/29/sharon-shoesmith-agrees-unfair-dismissal\">she won</a>. Lord Justice Kay declared that Shoesmith was \u201centitled to be treated lawfully and fairly, and not simply summarily scapegoated\u201d. Balls, the judge said, had denied Shoesmith \u201celementary fairness\u201d in his treatment of her. Haringey\u2019s sacking of her, he ruled, was \u201ctainted by unfairness\u201d. In theory, she had won her case. In practice, she soon understood, things were not quite so straightforward. \u201cThe big disappointment for me was that [although] I did win, people wanted to say, \u2018Yes, but it was only a technicality\u2019. I knew it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She was criticised in the media as grasping and disrespectful; for having the temerity to fight for compensation. She would never really \u201cwin\u201d, it seemed; never be forgiven for not resigning, or not meeting the ever-rising bar of contrition demanded by her detractors. Worse, by the time her court saga was over, in 2011, \u201cI was starting to lose my grip on reality.\u201d</p> <p>Many of her professional friends had by this time melted away. She would go for 10-mile walks from her London flat each day, and see \u201cfamiliar faces\u201d in crowds or on the opposing pavements. She would run over to greet them only to discover it was someone else entirely. \u201cWhen you lose it all at once, your brain is searching out familiarity,\u201d she says. She enrolled in a course of psychotherapy, but quit when one of her fellow students started selling stories about her to the Sun. Having worked six days a week as a senior director, she found herself unemployable.</p> <p>Her recovery began when she started a PhD at Birkbeck University to try to piece together what had happened. She immersed herself in psychological theory, and painstakingly pulled together a chronological account of events in Haringey from the thousands of pages of documents released during the court case. It was a painful experience. She often felt isolated. In her darkest moments she would open the file in which she kept supportive messages sent to her over the years and reread them. She also kept in touch with the four Haringey social workers who were sacked in the wake of Baby P\u2019s death. Together they have an informal self-help group that has carried them through whenever one of them might feel like \u201cjumping out of the bloody window\u201d. Shoesmith is closest to anger when she talks of how her former staff were treated by the media. At the height of the witch hunt, one was forced to leave her home. \u201cShe had lived there for 19 years. She had to get in a van in the middle of the night and scuttle off like some criminal, and she has lived in hiding ever since. That\u2019s how we treat social workers in modern Britain.\u201d</p> <p>But there is much to be be learned from the Baby P case, she believes, not least in the way we handle our expectations of child protection. Politicians too often play to public fantasies that safeguarding systems exist that will ensure child homicides will \u201cnever happen again\u201d. The brutality of the official response in Haringey did not go unnoticed among social workers: thousands more children were swiftly taken into care across England, many no doubt unecessarily, as nervous safeguarders decided a no-risk approach would keep them off the front page of the Sun. The \u201cBaby P effect\u201d means that roughly 20,000 more children a year are in care now compared to 2008, she points out: \u201cIt is highly likely that not all these children needed to come into care.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/jun/23/closing-the-college-of-social-work-is-yet-another-attack-on-the-profession\">Closing the College of Social Work is yet another attack on the profession</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be understandable if Shoesmith were consumed by bitterness, but she claims one of the first things she did as part of her recovery was \u201cwork out the anger\u201d. She is sad that she will never work again, but philosophical. The tabloid media, she believes, will never leave her alone, and will see the publication of the book as a provocation in itself. Yesterday, the Sun and the Mail pounced, accusing her of \u201cprofiting\u201d from Peter\u2019s death by publishing the book (she says she did not receive an advance, and any royalties will be spent on funding her work in raising awareness about child homicides). She does admit to taking some satisfaction in the spectacular falls from power of her political tormentors, although oddly she appears to understand the actions of Balls, her nemesis: \u201c[He] had the whole of Labour\u2019s social policy for a decade on his shoulders. I can see where [he was] coming from.\u201d</p> <p>She wrote to Balls in 2011, asking to meet, but didn\u2019t hear back. After he lost his seat at the last election, she recalls hearing his wife, Yvette Cooper, talking on the radio about the impact on Balls of losing his job, and she felt a strange sense of empathy. She\u2019d still love to meet him: \u201cI\u2018ve got a PhD, he\u2019s on Strictly [Come Dancing],\u201d she smiles. \u201cMaybe he would like to meet me and have a chat? We have got experiences in common. I could tell him who I really am.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Learning from Baby P by Sharon Shoesmith is published by Jessica Kingsley at \u00a315.99.

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland is to start charging major financial institutions for any cash it holds on their behalf for trading purposes, in the latest illustration of the impact of Mark Carney\u2019s post-Brexit vote stimulus package.</p> <p> It is the first time a bank has started to make charges for sterling deposits since the governor of the Bank of England announced on 4 August <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">that interest rates would be cut from 0.5% to 0.25% </a>to stave off any economic downturn following the vote to leave the EU. Carney said he was not a fan of negative rates.</p> <p>Even so, from Monday, about 70 RBS customers will start to receive negative rates because they will charged for any cash they place as collateral for trading in complex financial products, such as futures or options. The move will not affect the small business customers whom the bank, and its NatWest arm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/natwest-paves-way-for-introduction-of-negative-interest-rates\">warned last month it may have to charge for making deposits</a>. </p> <p>Negative rates, though, will be applied for customers who trade through RBS on deals guaranteed by clearing houses. RBS is 73% owned by the taxpayer. </p> <p>An RBS spokesman said: \u201cUntil recently, RBS has applied a 0% floor to the overnight rate charged for deposits required by clearing houses for futures trades. However, due to the sustained low interest rate environment, RBS will now be passing the cost of holding such deposits on to a limited number of our institutional clients. Futures are entered into by sophisticated financial investors looking to hedge risk.\u201d</p> <p>While the rate cut has reduced borrowing rates for mortgage customers, savers are paying a price. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are still a long way from banks imposing negative interest rates on personal customers, which would be a deeply unpopular move, though clearly the direction of travel is concerning for savers,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>A table of savings rates compiled by Savings Champion, a consumer website, shows the lowest rate offered at 0% by specialist bank Weatherbys for a 45-day and 90-day notice account.

  "<p>Campaigners against low pay are hoping that a victory for Deliveroo couriers this week will encourage further action by gig economy workers.

She said it was hard for those employed in the gig economy - the term for temporary, self-employed work - to organise and agitate for better pay and conditions. </p> <p>\u201cThey are not in the same workplace and there is not the same unity of cause. There is always somebody who will do it if you don\u2019t want to.

If they go on strike it\u2019s not going to bring the economy to a halt, unlike coal miners or rail workers,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Social media and digital technology will probably play a key role in low-pay campaigns, he added. \u201cEven amongst the workers who are working around the world from home we find most of them join online social networks through Facebook, forums and blogs,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much formal training in the gig economy so the only way they can make it work for them is to get support from other workers. They need to learn from each other. They\u2019ll find ways to meet up and exchange information. These networks form the basis for people to share dissatisfactions.\u201d</p> <p>The use of social media has taken employers by surprise. Workers for Deliveroo and the parcel firm Hermes have used closed social media groups to exchange information about things they are unhappy about, and messages about the protests were spread on open Facebook group pages and on Twitter.</p> <p>Dewhurst said firms\u2019 reliance on digital technology for their business models also laid them open to the possibility of workers\u2019 action. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/30/job-pay-workers-gig-economy\">\u2018Love the job, hate the way we\u2019re treated\u2019: life on the frontline of UK\u2019s delivery army</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although this kind of tech has been designed to isolate individuals and atomise work, deskilling the industry and driving down wages, the very platform it uses to do that is hugely vulnerable to ad-hoc collective action by groups of individuals,\u201d she said. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now very easy for Deliveroo to hire and fire people, but equally easy for drivers to decide not to work, and when they decide do to it altogether, can garner huge leverage against their would-be employer.

  "<p>In January 2006, a newly elected Tory leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jan/04/health.conservativeparty\" title=\"\">made a speech</a> that is remembered for a single question: \u201cAs Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith promote half-price Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?\u201d David Cameron asked.</p> <p>He knew the answer. Chocolate sells. The&#xa0;impulse to grab a sugary snack overcomes the will to choose something more&#xa0;nutritious. Consumer and retailer alike face powerful incentives to have unhealthy food in easy reach. But Mr Cameron was reluctant to propose regulation, since that was not the Conservative way.</p> <p>Little has changed. A government strategy for dealing with childhood obesity, published this week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/18/former-ministers-attack-massive-damp-squib-childhood-obesity-plan\" title=\"\">has been ridiculed by health experts and campaigners</a> for the flimsiness of its prescriptions. A tax on sugary soft drinks survives from George Osborne\u2019s last budget, but a ban on the promotion of trashy food to children has been rejected. Targets to reduce the sugar content of food will be voluntary. The most revealing criticism has come <a href=\"https://www.retail-week.com/sectors/grocery/sainsburys-boss-coupe-calls-for-food-sugar-limits-to-be-compulsory/7011315.article\" title=\"\">from Mike Couple, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s</a>, who urged the prime minister to embrace a culture of compulsion \u2013 forcing everyone in the market to trade in healthier food. If popular junk options are still available from rival outlets, there is less incentive to risk the investment in new abstemious products.</p> <p>This is a case where the collective interest of the nation\u2019s health (and the financial interest of the taxpayer, who pays when obese children become chronically ill adults) overrides the rights of individual companies to sell whatever they want to whomever they want. Manufacturers of processed foods increasingly resemble the tobacco lobby \u2013 reluctant to admit that their product is poisonous, insistent that consumer choice is paramount. The analogy is strengthened by neurological research suggesting the extreme compulsion to keep eating sugary, fatty, salty food amounts to a kind of addiction.</p> <p>This is more than a one-off challenge for the prime minister. It is a test case for her entire political creed. Theresa May arrived in Downing Street with a pledge to rehabilitate her party\u2019s one-nation tradition: none would be economically or socially excluded. For a generation, the Conservative approach to this task has rested on the presumption that the state is usually an obstacle to progress and that the best way for government to help&#xa0;people is to get out of their way.</p> <p>An issue such as childhood obesity demonstrates the limitations of that view. The new strategy acknowledges that the problem is most severe among children in low-income backgrounds in deprived areas. Ill health and poor nutrition are a function of what <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/295681/07-735-obesogenic-environments-review.pdf\" title=\"\">a seminal 2007 report</a> called the \u201cobesogenic environment\u201d \u2013 the panoply of economic and social factors that militate against healthy eating. Politely requesting changes in behaviour, whether by consumers, retailers or industry, is futile. Mr Cameron once thought behavioural psychology offered a middle way between state meddling and inaction. People might be \u201cnudged\u201d into better choices by ruses stopping short of regulation. That approach can be effective at the margins, but delicate psychological prodding cannot engineer drastic shifts in social norms and economic structures.</p> <p>In other respects, Mrs May sees the value of intervention where once her party was wedded to an ethos of laissez-faire. She supports an activist \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d in recognition that voters expect government to play more than a bystander\u2019s role when market forces are shaping national destiny. Is&#xa0;she ready to contemplate an equivalent gear&#xa0;change in social policy?</p> <p>It isn\u2019t easy, as was made clear earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/08/13bn-troubled-families-scheme-has-had-no-discernible-impact\" title=\"\">in a leaked report</a> evaluating the \u201ctroubled families\u201d programme. This scheme was much lauded by Mr Cameron as the antidote to social dysfunction, thought to be incubated in a few tens of thousand of homes. It evolved into a checklist reduction in unemployment, truancy and criminal behaviour in the target families, but the return on investment has been poor. (\u201cNo discernible impact,\u201d the report\u2019s author wrote.) Notionally, households have been \u201cturned around\u201d, but that is a bureaucratic judgment to satisfy funding requirements more than an indicator of real transformation. Defenders of the scheme say it is too early to judge the impact. Supportive critics say the intention is good but the funding inadequate. None can deny there is a problem.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the numbers positing government retreat as the solution are dwindling, even in Tory circles. To her credit, Mrs May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/industrial-strategy-welcomed-as-part-of-governments-new-business-policy\" title=\"\">has taken a pragmatic position</a> on the role of the state in nurturing economic success.

In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank.</p> <p>Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. </p> <p>In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. </p> <p>The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat.

While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt.</p> <p>All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. </p> <p>Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed. Any overheating would be controlled by fiscal and monetary measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that HM is superior to QE, and much better suited to our current challenges. It represents a pragmatic and superior alternative to any other policy, although it cannot be a panacea for structural issues such as poor demographics.</p> <p>In a heavily indebted world, suffering from low economic growth and facing serious political issues originating from inequality, HM has the potential to outperform any other policy.</p> <p>We must consider it now, or be forced to implement it in a hurry when the next economic recession hits.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b703d8e4b062ce4d224e4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T13:12:01.273Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ahead of the US open, European markets are in negative territory as investors shy away from shares on renewed talk of a possible US interest rate rise after some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve board members.</strong></p> <p>The Stoxx 600 is down around 0.7%, heading for its biggest weekly loss since the middle of June.

July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments.<br></p> <p>2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). <strong>The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending</strong>. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year.<br></p> <p>3) <strong>Meeting our March <em>EFO</em> forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year.</strong> While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year.<br></p> <p>4) <strong>However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole.</strong> July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum.

It is said that the capital city of the US might well have been Philadelphia if not for an <a href=\"http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/yellowfever.html\">epidemic of yellow fever in 1793</a> which drove members of the federal government, including George Washington, out of the city and towards the arguably even more pestilential climes of Washington DC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/aug/26/fighting-yellow-fever-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-in-pictures\">Fighting yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not the first time that Philadelphia had experienced an epidemic of yellow fever. The high temperatures and humidity of many North American and southern European cities supported outbreaks of this mosquito-borne disease until the early 20th century, but one could rely on the winter frosts to put an end to the devastation caused by the disease. Harder to tackle was the inevitable death toll among susceptible troops and workers who were moved into an endemic area. Efforts to construct the Panama canal were compromised by mortality from yellow fever until severe measures were taken to reduce the mosquito population.</p> <p>Trying to eliminate an infectious agent by eradicating its carrier is a tall order unless the insect population is actually only hanging on by its fingertips within an essentially hostile or variable climate, or if there is a reasonable infrastructure to, for example, keep marshes continuously drained. Sadly yellow fever can happily exist without a human host, completing its life-cycle in monkeys in tropical forests.</p> <p>A much simpler solution, therefore, is to protect the human population by conferring immunity through vaccination. Happily a <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2118520\">vaccine was developed by Max Theiler and colleagues in the 1930s</a>.</p> <p>It was probably the first \u201cexotic\u201d vaccine I received, at the age of 18 months, when I was to set sail for Ethiopia with my parents in 1966. My mother tells me that after I had received the shot, I offered my other arm; this was hardly the case 10 years later when I recall running as fast as I could away from the surgery to avoid vaccination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/13/angola-yellow-fever-outbreak-shows-that-funding-vaccines-is-critical\">Angola's yellow fever outbreak shows funding vaccines is critical | Sam Agbo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In those days, we were obliged to submit ourselves to re-vaccination every 10 years if we wished to preserve the right to enter certain endemic areas. The current edict is that protection offered by a single dose is actually lifelong: a very good thing indeed.</p> <p>Why is yellow fever then still a problem? In particular, why has there been such a serious <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1606997\">resurgence in Angola and the DRC</a>, stretching vaccine supplies to the point that consideration is being given to reducing the dose in order to cover more people \u2013 or <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/25/053421\">even to offering doses of lower efficacy to larger numbers of individuals</a> in an effort to halt transmission through an overall increase in protection?</p> <p>The usual suspects \u2013 climate change, deforestation \u2013 are partly to blame, but somewhat paradoxically so is the lack of yellow fever in these areas, due to previous intervention efforts. This has led to large numbers of non-immune adults, who never had the chance to build up any natural resistance to the disease, and are therefore ripe to fuel a new epidemic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It can be a formidable task to deliver simple, effective healthcare in particular economic settings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The worst situation that we can create is a sort of halfway house where the risk of infection is reduced so that many people remain unexposed to yellow fever, and yet the likelihood of recreating the conditions for the disease to prevail remains high. That this can happen despite the best efforts of the World Health Organisation and other partners in the otherwise highly successful yellow fever initiative highlights how formidable a task it can be to deliver simple, effective healthcare in particular economic settings.</p> <p>The yellow fever vaccine has now been introduced in routine infant immunisation programmes in the majority of regions at risk in Africa and the Americas, and emergency campaigns in response to epidemic threats have been largely successful. But pockets of vulnerability remain, and it appears that the current stockpile is not sufficient to deal with possible outbreaks occurring in these areas.</p> <p>One can only hope that the issues raised \u2013 namely what is actually the minimum effective dose, how best to administer possibly partially efficacious doses to reduce the burden of disease, and how to improve vaccine yield \u2013 will better prepare us in our ongoing battle with this very old enemy.</p>",
  "<p>So, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/ryan-lochte-olympics-rio-us-media-dumbest-bell\">Ryan Lochte</a> the International Olympic Committee finally has its poster boy. Nothing says \u201cIOC, bitch!\u201d like landing in a host city, extracting personal glory from it, partying it up and then leaving the place more broken and out of pocket than you found it.

An economically struggling city, whose people made it vocally clear the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/rio-olympics-brazil-politics-zika-virus\">Olympics were unwelcome</a>, has spent much of its hosting period being dug at for failing to provide the five-star international tourist experience and immaculate security that today\u2019s modern Olympic tourist demands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5118e337994a661673abe830b951bd4f729b9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5118e337994a661673abe830b951bd4f729b9c9/312_344_1738_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Lochte shows his taste for gold as part of the US men\u2019s 4x200m team in Rio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Lochte shows his taste for gold as part of the US men\u2019s 4x200m team in Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Getz/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this sensitive climate, Lochte &amp; Co claiming to have been robbed by gun-toting pretend police officers underscores the idea the host city is a semi-lawless backwater where no one is safe. Even the apology he posted today is so extravagantly preposterous it can only have been written as a dare. \u201cIt is traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country,\u201d quoth Lochte of his trauma, \u201cwith a language barrier, and have a stranger point a gun at you and demand money to let you leave.\u201d Which is one way of describing the security guard telling them to pay for their vandalism.</p> <p>My only surprise is that Ryan didn\u2019t offer some kind of comic chaser to these antics \u2013 maybe claiming, Joker-style, to have been the one to turn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/why-has-the-olympic-pool-turned-green-the-good-news-is-its-not-urine\">diving pool green</a> in a daring midnight prank.

Sometimes you make decisions you later regret.

To watch the outraged commentators attempting to lay a glove on him is to imagine them doggy-paddling in the wake of his best freestyle time.</p> <p>Before the Games began, Ryan Lochte\u2019s post-Olympics plans consisted of moving to Los Angeles to become a celebrity. \u201cI see me being a designer,\u201d he mused. \u201cI see me being a model, I see me being a TV star.\u201d</p> <p>However much some may wish it to be different, I see none of these things being very much affected by his actions in Rio. After all, the self-styled civilised first world is the place where almost innumerable professional idiots have whole lucrative TV shows devoted to the comings and goings of their lives. It\u2019s what sets us apart from the animals, as I understand it.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t the point about people like Lochte that they get away with it? No matter how satisfying this story may superficially feel to all those who have loathed Lochte\u2019s frat bro persona since for ever, and who feel that this is somehow a comeuppance or him being found out in some cathartic way \u2013 it isn\u2019t.

Even some major supermarket chains, like Sainsbury\u2019s, which would have welcomed a ban on 2-for-1 junk food deals, have complained that Britain now needs compulsory targets for the reduction of sugar across the food and drinks industry. Its chief executive, Mike Coupe, says: \u201cNothing less will work.\u201d</p> <p>So why, confronted by her first big choice, has May gone with the lobbyists for big business, rather than the public health lobby? Is it because she privately agrees with the man she fired so robustly, Michael Gove, that Britain \u201chas had enough of experts\u201d?</p> <p>I\u2019m sure she would say certainly not, that it\u2019s all about jobs and the need for continued economic growth after Brexit. And certainly government ministers and officials were bombarded by industry predictions that interference with its God-given right to flog junk food to the lower orders would result in huge job losses and closures.

  "<p>At first they called it Grid: a \u201cgay-related immunodeficiency\u201d, which started to appear in New York and California in 1982. That year 853 Americans, mostly gay men, died of a syndrome that President Reagan\u2019s spokesman publicly dismissed as a joke. The next year it killed 2,304 people, and then 4,251. In the year 1985, more than 5,000 Americans died from complications from Aids, while a small group of activists and artists faced down governmental, medical and public indifference. \u201cThere are,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/05/nyregion/for-victims-of-aids-support-in-a-lonely-siege.html?pagewanted=all\">said one exhausted volunteer</a>, \u201cno success stories.\u201d</p> <p>No one has a fully convincing theory as to why gay men are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/08/gay-conspiracy-homosexual-culture-liberated-arts\">so overrepresented</a> among artists, writers and performers. But we are and, in the 1980s and early 1990s, Aids scythed through the American cultural landscape, wiping out a generation of creators and inspired others to mourn, memorialize, organize and fight back. <a href=\"http://www.bronxmuseum.org/exhibitions/art-aids-america\">Art Aids America</a>, an exhibition on view at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, revisits those harrowing, death-trailed years, and argues that Aids changed the course of art history, not only through its casualties but through the response it galvanized. (The show was first seen at the Tacoma Art Museum, in Washington state.) It is far from a perfect exhibition, but it is a powerful one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b4bbdd7b743f946eb7e185a4c1348fa2a772c64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b4bbdd7b743f946eb7e185a4c1348fa2a772c64/0_292_3520_2112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An installation view of Ray Navarro\u2019s work: the artist died aged 26.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An installation view of Ray Navarro\u2019s work: the artist died aged 26.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marisol D\u00edaz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is art here of such anguish and intimacy that it can be tough to take \u2013 and it should be. The photographer Duane Michals shot a gaunt young man laid out in a white funeral shroud, and captioned the image by hand: a father has prepared his dead son for burial. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/25/arts/robert-blanchon-34-conceptual-artist.html\">Robert Blanchon</a>, who would die aged 34, framed his own underwear like relics; Aids had left the young artist incontinent, and the stains on the briefs are at once a humiliation and a mark of holy suffering, like stigmata. In a scathing series of photographs from 1990, <a href=\"https://visualaids.org/artists/detail/ray-navarro\">Ray Navarro</a> paired saucy phrases about men\u2019s bodies with images of infirmity and pain: \u201chot butt\u201d captions an upturned wheelchair, and \u201cstudwalk\u201d a fallen Zimmer frame. By that year Navarro had gone blind and deaf; too ill to work, he turned to his friend Zoe Leonard to complete the installation. He died that year. He was 26.</p> <p>In the face of such awful suffering \u2013 not to mention the murderous moralizing of homophobes who considered Aids a deserved punishment or even divine judgment \u2013 artists of all sexual orientations and genders embraced narrative, emotion, even spirituality: techniques seen as anathema in the more conceptually driven late 60s and 70s. Robert Gober, one of the decade\u2019s most talented artists, is represented here by a plughole drilled into a white wall \u2013 an orifice, an obliteration \u2013 as well as a drawing of one of his sinks for absent, unclean bodies. They\u2019re pretty minor Gobers, honestly, and several other artists, among them Glenn Ligon and Paul Thek, are represented by smaller and more marginal works.

In art, however, there are distinctions, and museums would be dreary places if we said otherwise. Is all the art here great? Not by any measure. There are posters and placards that can only be called agitprop, a fair dose of ghastly painting, and a picture of flowers drawn with seropositive and seronegative blood.

  "<p>Say what you like about Metallica (they\u2019re very loud and can\u2019t hear you), but there is no denying that the world\u2019s biggest heavy metal band have never lost their ability to make an impact. Today they have released the first song from their long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/19/metallica-hardwired-to-self-destruct-first-studio-album-for-eight-years\">10th studio album, Hardwired \u2026 to Self-Destruct</a>, due in November. As has long been the case, the metal world is once again embroiled in arguments about whether or not Metallica have lost, regained or recklessly jettisoned the plot. Partly this inevitable eruption of opinions \u2013 both positive and less so \u2013 is because Metallica remain incomparably huge, with only Iron Maiden and Slipknot coming remotely close to their global status. But it\u2019s also down to a widely held belief that James Hetfield and co haven\u2019t made a genuinely great album in 25 years. As a consequence, every new music they make is subjected to intense scrutiny and compared to the seminal and legendary records the band made in the 1980s. The eight years since the release of Metallica\u2019s last studio album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/12/rockreview.metallica\">Death Magnetic</a>, have only heightened the anticipation for new songs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/apr/19/metallica-the-band-who-reinvented-metal\">Metallica \u2013 the band who reinvented metal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The band\u2019s audience seems to be roughly divided between those who love everything they do and those who have despaired over recent nonsense such as Lulu \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/27/lou-reed-metallica-lulu-review\">a virtually unlistenable collaboration with Lou Reed</a> \u2013 and the hapless concert film <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/03/metallica-through-the-never-review\">Metallica: Through the Never</a>. The new single, Hardwired, may not delight all fans, but it does at least suggest that Metallica have ironed out one or two problems. Specifically, the song is just over three minutes long and goes like the clappers from start to finish. This, long-suffering fans may argue, is what the band should have done on their last album, rather than forgetting how to edit their own material \u2013 resulting in anonymous, rambling dreck like the 10-minute instrumental <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuyZ4Bt73mg]\">Suicide &amp; Redemption</a>, instead of songs to rival old classics such as Whiplash and Battery. Hardwired is unlikely to become as loved as those early anthems, but the band do sound like a powerful heavy metal band at full throttle. The lyrics are a bit feeble, mirroring the clumsy angst and faux rebellion that has marred every Metallica album since Load in 1996, and too much mediocre water has travelled under this band\u2019s bridge for the song\u2019s title to be anything more than a handy slogan to imply edginess of some kind. But none of that really matters when the riffs are this sharp and brutal, the arrangement so neatly to-the-point and the band\u2019s individual performances so unfussy and precise. (Which also raises the question: has Lars Ulrich been practising his drums for once?)<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af232d386090027f9d28d0408ba1f522c1c91a92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af232d386090027f9d28d0408ba1f522c1c91a92/0_124_4464_2679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Hetfield of Metallica at Glastonbury in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Hetfield of Metallica at Glastonbury in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Short/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In most respects, Hardwired is the best thing Metallica have released in a long time. Unfortunately, the forthcoming album will be a two-disc, 80-minute monster with only 12 tracks. This means some very long songs \u2013 something Metallica haven\u2019t pulled off with any success in almost three decades. That news also means that Hardwired itself is something of a diversionary tactic. Most fans would explode with delight if the band released an album of 10 short, fast and furious songs, and preferably produced by someone with a faint clue about how metal records sound in the 21st century. Eighty minutes of meandering, half-hearted toss like the execrable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7SIYzXM6zA\">Lords of Summer</a> \u2013 a stand-alone tune released in 2014 \u2013 is not an appealing prospect, particularly if Metallica have stuck with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/popandrock16\">inexplicably inelegant and misguided production</a> they applied to 2003\u2019s St Anger and Death Magnetic. </p> <p>So, as ever, we cross our fingers and hope that Hardwired is no false dawn and that Metallica\u2019s 10th album will be something approaching a genuine modern classic. Let\u2019s face it, every metal fan on the planet will want to hear it anyway.<br></p>",

He espouses views that are both potentially dangerous and demonstrably false. For example, as we reported in this story, Roberts continues to argue that Nasa has manipulated temperature data in collaboration with every other relevant science agency including the UK Met Office and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. <br></p> <p>Normally, these views would simply not be reported. But as an elected parliamentarian, it is important that he is scrutinised and understood by the public. The ABC put him on the panel, but had Brian Cox on as well, who was well-equipped to refute some of what Roberts said. <br></p> <p>In the future, as Roberts continues to make demonstrably false claims, the Guardian and other media outlets will need to think carefully about how much attention to give him. The outrageousness of what he says makes for entertaining and very highly read stories. But is it a mistake to give him more air time than sensible (and potentially boring) politicians, just because he says such outrageous things?</p> <p><em>What do you think of Cox\u2019s interjection?</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T13:47:27.935Z\">at 2.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b7080de4b0c23bfed8b033\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T13:23:28.231Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More comments on the night tube and its implications.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81476735\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12972318\" title=\"View John O'Donnell\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12972318\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for John O'Donnell\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12972318\" title=\"View John O'Donnell\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">John O'Donnell</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81476735\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">19 August 2016 2:17pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Shift workers will be pleased, no more sitting with nutters on the night bus.</p> <p>I got on a night bus at 4:00am once, early work start.

Everyone BTL was praising this whole series, and sad that this (excellent) one was the last. More of this kind of thing, please, Graun!</p> <p>And the picture essay, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2016/aug/15/growing-together-an-allotment-picture-essay\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>That's Yer Lot</b></a>, was wonderful too. </p> <p>It was much discussed at our allotments, where we were very impressed by their plots. Just a pity this wasn't a Guardian Witness thing, or even with a comment thread - the other times there have been articles on allotment sites, the comments have added hugely to the whole thing. </p> <p>And allotments brings me to sheds.

  "<p>If we needed a reminder of the importance of taking climate change seriously, the floods in Louisiana are providing a big one on a daily basis. When it comes to the big environmental issues, our country\u2019s polarization is historically unusual, and it\u2019s already gone way too far. That\u2019s why the latest fight to break out in Washington over climate issues needs more attention.<br></p> <p>On 1 August, the White House Council on Environmental Quality issued a non-binding suggestion, formally known as \u201cguidance\u201d, to federal agencies to think about climate change when making decisions under a law called the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). What should have produced a shrug (or, hopefully, a cheer) caused a panic on the right that\u2019s only getting louder. <br></p> <p>Under Nepa, federal agencies have to account for the environmental impacts of taking major actions such as approving a mine permit, constructing or removing a dam or allowing a road near a protected habitat. These decisions are made by trained scientists and public servants with years of expertise and involve an unparalleled level of public input. By and large, they are among the most rigorously footnoted and well-supported decisions the federal government makes, and Nepa is one of the best vehicles the public has to express concerns about federal impacts on homes and communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/louisiana-flood-damage-recovery\">Louisiana left stunned by damage from '1,000-year' flood: 'It just kept coming'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The recent guidance suggests that federal agencies account for climate change in the Nepa process. If an agency were to follow the guidance in assessing the impacts of a new coal mine, for example, both the climate impacts of the mining operation itself and the climate impacts of burning the coal from the mine would be factored into the final Nepa analysis. </p> <p>If this strikes you less as an outrage and more as common sense, you\u2019re not alone. But you won\u2019t find many Washington Republicans agreeing with you. The chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop, a Republican congressman from Utah, said of the document: \u201cYou can kiss energy independence goodbye.\u201d Republican senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the leading climate denier in Washington, issued a statement refusing to accept the guidance\u2019s validity, claiming in part: \u201c[G]lobal climate change falls outside of the scope of Nepa so the guidance has no legal basis.\u201d They were not alone. </p> <p>This kind of all-hands-on-deck resistance to a non-binding suggestion that agencies acknowledge climate change is a sign of the times, but it\u2019s also a sign that Republican leaders have made compromise on climate issues impossible. In throwing away a once proud environmental legacy, the party of Donald Trump \u2013 the party that makes oil drilling the centerpiece of its environmental agenda and insists that climate scientists are just ganging up on Exxon to enrich themselves \u2013 is forfeiting its seat at the table when climate policy is inevitably made down the line. </p> <p>Setting the politics aside, Nepa is the perfect vehicle for considering climate impacts from both a policy and scientific standpoint. The guidance suggests that agencies look not just at what climate impacts a project will have, but what impacts climate change will have on the project. If we know that climate change is making a coastal area more susceptible to devastating floods or combining with pollutants to worsen asthma in urban areas, the guidance says a federal agency should take that into consideration when planning for the future. </p> <p>That\u2019s not just sensible \u2013 it\u2019s necessary. Taxpayers of every political stripe want government agencies to consider all the facts, not just a politically approved subset of information, when deciding how federal money will be spent and which programs are working in the public interest. Pretending that climate change isn\u2019t real was politically expedient in the past. Today it\u2019s dangerous for millions of Americans, and it dooms the Republican Party to irrelevance in climate discussions. </p> <p>Willful ignorance serves no one in the real world. That\u2019s the world the guidance to federal agencies is about: the world where our nation\u2019s fishermen are finding their livelihoods upended by climate change, where whole states like California are facing historical levels of drought, where major wildfires are now standard front-page news. That\u2019s the world the American people live in. It\u2019s the world our government\u2019s decisions should reflect.</p>",
  "<p>Shop vacancy rates in the UK have risen above 10%, partly due to a fall in pop-up shops. Our research found that the proportion of unoccupied retail units <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/fall-in-pop-up-shops-pushes-uk-retail-vacancy-rates-above-10\">rose to 10.1% over the quarter to July</a>, up from 9.6% in April. Small retailers with short-term leases have failed to convert them into longer term agreements.</p> <p>However, we should not panic or overreact to the vacancy rate increase recorded in July. To some degree it was inevitable given the time of year; while there was an increase in the number of short-term leases over the past year, many will have been leased for a period of a year or less, and Q3 (July to September) is the natural turnaround time for retailers, falling between the start of the summer and peak pre-Christmas trading. </p> <p>The emergence of the short-term lease has undoubtedly been positive for many locations and for many smaller and independent retailers. It means the barrier to entry has been reduced, delivering a viable way for independents, or even multiples, to test new ways of trading.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the natural churn rate will have been exacerbated by the drop in footfall and sales recorded in the first and second quarters (January to June) in the lead up to, and post, the EU referendum.</p> <p>Vacancy rates are a lagged indicator, following dynamic measures of performance such as footfall and spend \u2013 the primary indicators for retailers on which they base their future trading decisions. Once footfall and sales data have been reviewed, there is a time lag during which they notify the landlord of their intentions not to renew their lease before vacating the unit. The relatively poor and volatile footfall trends in 2016 will have proved a little too challenging for some of these pop-up retailers to commit to trade long term, particularly given the much discussed uncertainty around the economy. </p> <p>On the plus side,<strong> </strong>the number of unoccupied retail units is also an opportunity for town centres to deliver a more diverse offering and host retail tenants of greater relevance to their markets; where some retailers fail, others can be successful if their offer matches demand.</p> <p>This is where the independent retailer scores an advantage over their larger multiple counterparts; they can be nimble in the face of changing consumer demand \u2013 tweaking and shaping their product lines and store marketing \u2013 with a speed that multiple retailers often can\u2019t match due to more complex corporate structures.</p> <p>The internet has clear advantages for shoppers in terms of its convenience and global reach, so for many town centres the ability to deliver a unique and flexible offer, tailored to the specific needs of their shoppers, will ensure their longevity as successful retail destinations.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

  "<p>Marketing has become a tricky territory.

It also made marketing \u2013 and the chief marketing officers (CMO) \u2013 more important.

But then consumers started finding inspiration and shopping opportunities in places and at times that brands found baffling. Behavioural segmentation, which divides consumers based on what they think, feel and do and what they expect from products and brands, has become critical.

Chen pointed out that today\u2019s top brands grew rapidly thanks their engineering, not marketing. </p> <p>While a CMO doesn\u2019t necessarily need to know how to write code, the lesson is clear: understand the front-end user experience and back-end technology. Be able to spot a culture-shaping collaboration opportunity, recognise user flows and scenarios and understand what makes a great omnichannel experience.</p> <h2>Make the customer decision journey your mantra</h2> <p>Everything around consumers today shapes their expectations: Uber\u2019s convenience, <a href=\"https://www.helloalfred.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hello Alfred</a>\u2019s progressive personalisation or <a href=\"https://www.birchbox.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BirchBox\u2019s curated choice</a>. To guide their company in delivering on these expectations, a CMO needs to understand how their customers move through their experience with the brand and to connect the key decision-making points into a customer journey. Their job is then to design their organisation\u2019s functions to confidently deliver on it.</p> <h2>Bond with data</h2> <p>The best CMOs know what kind of brand interactions are the most popular, how regions and locations differ on their product and service preferences (does a search for a weekend getaway mean the same thing in New York and in London?), when to send a newsletter, an email or a mobile alert and which marketing actions have the biggest return on investment. </p> <p>All of this data informs marketing decisions, focuses the company and helps manage the market behaviour. Thanks to data, CMOs can now have impact on research and development, the production process and the value chain \u2013 not only on communications and messaging.</p> <h2>Practise being strategic and tactical</h2> <p>A successful CMO has to be able do everything from a coming up with a modern brand vision to its tactical execution, rollout plan and success metrics. Gone are the command centre days: CMOs have to get their hands dirty and stay involved throughout the entire global brand and marketing strategy.

So far those fears may be unfounded. According to the <a href=\"http://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/ \">Louisiana department of health</a>, four new cases of Zika were reported this week, but all were contracted during travel to affected areas.</p> <p>\u201cOur surveillance activities include working with hospitals and other healthcare providers who notify us if and when a possible Zika case is diagnosed,\u201d said Frank Welch, who heads the state\u2019s Zika response team. \u201cWe also work with mosquito control agencies throughout the state who conduct mosquito testing in areas of known human cases to determine if mosquitos in those areas are carrying the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The bigger threat comes from the West Nile virus, which struck the area a decade ago after Hurricane Katrina. Doctors are warning residents to watch out for symptoms: fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, shakiness. </p> <p>Meanwhile state officials gathered at the capitol on Thursday to sort out how to pay for the emergency response, which costs the state millions of dollars per day, and will likely run into the hundreds of millions. The state was strapped for cash and considering a short-term loan before the storm, and lawmakers met to discuss moving ahead with it as soon as possible. Some of the costs will be absorbed by help from the federal government, which has declared 20 of the state\u2019s 64 parishes to be major disaster sites. More than 60,000 people have registered for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).</p> <p>According to local officials, who have pressed for years to build a diversionary canal near Baton Rouge, much of the calamity and cost could have been avoided. The canal project was blueprinted but has been delayed since the 1980s. Its proponents say it would have prevented at least a quarter of the flooding if the US Army Corps of Engineers had acted sooner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/louisiana-flooding-natural-disaster-weather-climate-change\">Disasters like Louisiana floods will worsen as planet warms, scientists warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe see it over and over again in government,\u201d said US representative Garret Graves, who represents southern Louisiana. \u201cWe end up spending billions of dollars after, instead of millions before.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed canal would shunt floodwater from the Amite and Comite rivers to the much larger Mississippi river.

I think the storylines have suffered.\u201d </p> <p>Baker had good reason to fear CGI. The last couple of Star Wars prequels had seen his character become increasingly pixelated, meaning less work. \u201cBut there are certain closeup movements only I can do convincingly.

I guess it\u2019s a great way for them to make new friends, swap stories and compare merchandise. A fan recently brought a whole packet of Star Wars condoms to a convention.

It can be disturbing. Some fans lack boundaries, and I don\u2019t appreciate it when they wait outside my house. It can be pretty intense at times, but I shouldn\u2019t complain: they\u2019ve provided me with a decent pension.

This would create an offence of failing to prevent serious human rights abuses within a company\u2019s global operations.</p> <p>Such a law would make the company accountable for abuses unless it could show it had adequate procedures in place to prevent them \u2013 a strong incentive for companies to proactively ensure they respect human rights. This \u201cdue diligence\u201d principle has become standard practice for bribery.</p> <p>Even where the behaviour of Lonmin, Trafigura, Shell and others does not constitute a crime, nurturing a compliance culture for human rights would make it harder for abuses to drag on unchecked for years and would give victims a realistic chance of securing justice and redress. Almost every major economy in the world now criminalises companies for foreign bribery. But few have legislated for illegal acts that lead to serious human rights abuses overseas.</p> <p>If May is serious about tackling corporate crime, she will need to put in place stronger laws and enforcement. Otherwise corporate impunity will prevail and continue to stain the reputation of UK plc in many parts of the world.</p>",

But real women and men were victims of the attack on the Terrain hotel complex in South Sudan, which included gang-rape of aid workers, torture and looting.</p> <p>This was an abhorrent attack and it is important that journalists covered it. The attack raises concerns about the safety and security of aid workers in South Sudan, and highlights the increasing dangers that aid workers face worldwide as they work to help people in desperate need. Credit is due to the reporter for his persistence in tracking down witnesses and piecing the events together. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have had clients contact us who we haven\u2019t worked with for years, because they were re-triggered by the article</p> <footer> <cite>Natalie McCauley, counsellor, Humanitarian Wellbeing</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the way it is written does the survivors\u2019 courage a disservice. The survivors who came forward must be commended. They are incredibly brave women and men. Their experience and ability to speak so soon after the incident is a testament to their strength. Apparently they are receiving the support that they need from their organisations, which is fantastic news. Their voices will hopefully help to drive change in the sector to protect other aid workers.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t help but feel that Jason Patinkin, the writer of the AP article, shows a lack of empathy with the survivors and a lack of experience with reporting on rape issues. This inexperience threatens to undermine the important message that a properly drafted article on the attacks might have conveyed. <br></p> <p>Firstly, the level of detail is, in my opinion, salacious. (A subsequent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1Wwb5jXME\">report on the UK\u2019s Channel 4 news</a> similarly resorted to graphic recounts and a video of Terrain in disarray, rather than focusing on the broader issues raised by the attack.) \u201cWe have had clients contact us who we haven\u2019t worked with for years, because they were re-triggered by the article,\u201d said Natalie McCauley from <a href=\"http://www.humanitarianwellbeing.com/\">Humanitarian Wellbeing</a>, an organisation which provides counselling services to aid workers, who also felt the report included an unnecessary level of detail. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/29/aid-worker-rape-humanitarian-south-sudan-sexual-violence\">Aid worker: I was drugged and raped by another humanitarian in South Sudan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly, Patinkin\u2019s article breaks <a href=\"http://gbvaor.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/07/GBV-Media-Guidelines-Final-Provisional-25July2013.pdf\">guidelines</a> (pdf) for reporting on gender-based violence in humanitarian contexts. No mention of resources or support is provided in the piece. No gender-based violence experts were quoted or appear to have been consulted. It was a raw description of a charged sexual and violent attack on a group of expatriates and nationals in South Sudan \u2013 one that titillates and inspires fear, one that fails to provide context on either the broader issue of attacks on aid workers or even the conflict in South Sudan.</p> <p>I\u2019m also concerned that the survivors may be identified from his piece. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/29/aid-worker-rape-humanitarian-south-sudan-sexual-violence\">my own experience with rape in South Sudan</a>, I chose to go public. But no one should have that choice forced on them and within hours there was speculation about the identities in increasingly large circles among tight-knit humanitarian networks. Anonymity must be considered in the much larger context of a piece, and one must always err on the side of caution. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/20/secret-aid-worker-south-sudan-personal-attacks\">Secret aid worker: there is a new trend of sexual violence in South Sudan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, no forethought appears to have been put into the impact this will have on nationals in South Sudan. The article notes minute details about the uniforms of the attackers. For those outside of South Sudan, these details appear inconsequential. However, they are the insignia of a powerful and dangerous armed group of individuals in South Sudan, one that has already committed multiple gang-rapes on both expatriates and nationals over the past year, with utter impunity. By obliquely naming this group, every single national that was present at the attack is now placed in additional danger, and they are not offered the protective measures that expatriates have been. </p> <p>However, Paul Colford, AP vice president and director of media relations says:</p> <p>\u201cOur story was carefully reported and edited, and given the extreme sensitivity of the subject matter the reporting process included sharing the text with the anonymously quoted victims before publication to ensure that AP\u2019s report would accurately reflect their accounts of what happened to them and around them, and to ensure the article would not put them and their colleagues at risk. The victims have since expressed their appreciation for the story that AP published for a global audience.\u201d</p> <p>Setting aside concerns about the way Patinkin wrote the article, it does raise the issue of rape being used as a weapon against aid workers. So, what can be done to address the problem?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rape is usually ignored in trainings and the risk is downplayed</p> <footer> <cite>Sarah Martin, gender-based violence humanitarian consultant</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Security managers claim that rape, particularly when perpetrators are in armed groups, cannot be prevented, and that is why they don\u2019t raise it in training. \u201cI have heard that myth so many times from security personnel,\u201d says Sarah Martin, a consultant who has worked on gender-based violence issues in emergency contexts throughout the globe. </p> <p>\u201cRape is usually ignored in trainings and the risk is downplayed.

With an overwhelming number of organisations not having structures in place, it is essential to get a straight answer from them before something happens \u2013 how will you handle a case of rape?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/19/sexual-violence-aid-sector-ngo-action\">Sexual violence in the aid sector: what should NGOs be doing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trainings such as hostile environment awareness \u2013 often mandatory before being deployed \u2013 could do more by giving people a place to discuss their fears and give them some basic information on how (and how not) to talk to survivors.

  "<p>Australia\u2019s prospects of meeting its climate change targets have suffered a crucial blow with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/18/queensland-land-clearing-controls-face-defeat-with-former-labor-mp-voting-no\">failure of land-clearing reforms in Queensland</a>, the state\u2019s environment minister and conservationists say.</p> <p>A renewed surge in clearing is expected after Thursday\u2019s defeat of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/queensland-land-clearing-reforms-could-hinge-on-speakers-vote\">the Palaszczuk government bill</a> that attempted to restore controls on deforestation.

I am tempted to ask.\u201d</a> </p> <p>This was the outcry from, it must be said, a series of white, male, probably middle-class columnists to the news that the government digital service would be dropping Latin abbreviations from its style guide. They lamented what the world was coming to, and suggested that anyone encouraging this defunct language to move from endangered to extinct was proposing the most barbarous act of linguistic vandalism.</p> <p>In fact the<a href=\"https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/20/changes-to-the-style-guide-no-more-eg-and-ie-etc/\"> government\u2019s decision</a> was made to \u201cpromote the use of plain English\u201d and help visually impaired readers using web-reading programs, non-native speakers and those skim-reading. Moreover, it hardly heralds a slump in Latin learning. Initiatives like the University of Cambridge Schools Classics Project and the admirable<a href=\"http://classicsforall.org.uk/about/why-classics/\"> Classics For All</a> have led to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/latin-makes-surprising-comeback-in-state-schools-9677092.html\">more uptake of Latin in state schools</a>. Meanwhile, the Idler Academy has plans to launch an online course so that people can learn Latin on their mobiles.</p> <p>The surge of interest is gratifying to a language columnist (even one who didn\u2019t learn the subject at his Ofsted-failing comprehensive). Latin is endlessly fascinating, at the root of many words in English and other European tongues and builds bridges to the ancient world and its lessons. Should it, though, be taught in schools? Why not teach other forms of communication that could be more relevant: sign language, coding, living languages? The debate about Latin featuring on an already overcrowded curriculum continues <em>ad infinitum</em> (or to some, <em>ad nauseam</em>).</p> <p>Part of the problem is that the subject is still often used to signify an expensive education - the linguistic bowler hat to the flat cap of modern languages. It\u2019s the language of Eton, of entire Oxbridge graduation ceremonies, of Catholic clergy, of faded power, of traditional influence. See its knackered old relics on our currency, at unfeasibly posh dinner parties, outside and inside our courts and in almost all exclusive schools, though still only some state schools. It\u2019s the lexical equivalent of a barrister\u2019s wig: both fuddy-duddy and exotic, eccentric and archaic. </p> <p>There is a simple solution to this situation: teach Latin in all schools, or in none. But the argument to put it on the state syllabus doesn\u2019t seem strong enough. If we didn\u2019t have a curriculum crisis of modern language learning uptake, then I might suggest we learn the root of words such as <em tabindex=\"-1\">curriculum </em>on the curriculum. But as it is, Europeans are learning two or three modern languages fluently to communicate with their neighbours and trading partners and move things forward while linguistically we may as well be running around in loincloths ploughing up the earth with the arse-bone of a giraffe.</p> <p>Post-Brexit, this feels more significant than ever. Learn the languages of diplomacy, of trade, of culture \u2013 rather than the lingo of a lost empire. In a time of terrorism, the rise of China and of global cross-cultural challenges, wouldn\u2019t it be preferable we learnt Arabic, Mandarin, Urdu, Nigerian and other global languages? Developing intelligence is, of course, an important part of learning and vocational skills often come later on our life\u2019s educational journey. But so could Latin. It could also be woven into the existing curriculum by emphasising its presence in existing subjects - science, English, maths, history, modern languages - reducing its need to be a standalone school discipline for everyone.</p> <p>One of Latin\u2019s lexical hangovers has been to do that very posh thing of sweeping under the carpet any issues considered too grubby and earthy to be discussed frankly in polite company. So we say <em>in vino veritas</em> instead of: \u201cWhen I got pissed, I confessed I thought he was a douche.\u201d And we insert into text the word <em>sic</em>, the three-lettered bitchy Latin put-down which, between parentheses, signposts: \u201cDon\u2019t for one second assume that was my sloppy error, I\u2019m merely replicating verbatim the poorly spelled musings of the great unwashed.\u201d And we say <em>gratis </em>when we mean \u201clegitimate slave labour\u201d. And we say <em>alma mater</em> when we mean: \u201cI\u2019ll have you know my university was certainly not a former polytechnic.\u201d In this sense, Latin is a cryptolect: a secretive language, designed to exclude outsiders.</p> <p>Or, as Donald Clark<a href=\"http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/10-reasons-not-to-learn-latin.html\"> writes</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s a peacock\u2019s tail, the luxury of being able to ignore utility for superfluous acquisition of a useless and purely academic exercise. It says, subliminally, to hell with vocational subjects, I\u2019m not \u2018trade\u2019.\u201d<br></p> <p>Mary Beard did an admirable job of teaching Classics to teenagers with fewer than 5 GCSEs on <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/jamies-dream-school\">Jamie\u2019s Dream School</a>. She was asked twice by the same pupil why they should bother learning a dead language, and began her response: \u201cBecause the Romans were bloody interesting.\u201d When I contacted her for this piece, she sent me an email from China: \u201cLatin is the European language par excellence. It\u2019s the antithesis of \u2018little England\u2019. Communication and trade is one reason for learning a language. But not the only one. Languages also open up the cultures of our past. Imagine trying to understand Dante without knowing something about Virgil.\u201d Just.

It\u2019s hard to deny that knowledge of Latin has in the past formed a cornerstone of the cultural capital of the middle and upper classes. The fact that some blustery old white men like to throw the odd quote from Horace into their after-dinner speeches shouldn\u2019t be allowed to define for everyone what knowing Latin is or can be.\u201d</p> <p>At risk of becoming <em>persona non grata</em>, ditching Latin feels like a fair trade-off in an overcrowded curriculum - but it can still play a role as a <em>lingua franca</em> for those who want to take it up later in life. Especially now they can learn it from their mobiles.</p> <p><em>GaryNunn is a regular contributor to Mind your language. @garynunn1</em> </p>",
  "<h2>1) Leicester and Arsenal both need something on the board</h2> <p>The drawn-out hum of the transfer window, and the rigours of pre-season travel with dubious on-pitch benefits mean that, more than ever, August is a difficult month to draw judgments from.

Though Mark Hughes\u2019s side could only draw their first game, a visit to a promoted side \u2013 let alone one as accomplished as Middlesbrough \u2013 is a difficult first assignment, and City should expect a difficult afternoon. It seems almost inconceivable that Guardiola can do what he\u2019s doing \u2013 change individual positions and collective style \u2013 without negatively affecting results. His players are good, but nowhere near as good, relatively or absolutely, as those he had at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. </p> <p>It is one thing to build confidence, as he has done with Raheem Sterling, but elemental changes take time to master. The Premier League is different to La Liga and the Bundesliga, not just because it is more frantic, but because of the players its mid-ranking teams are now able to muscle out of other leagues. Stoke away \u2013 Hughes\u2019s Stoke, not Tony Pulis\u2019s clich\u00e9 \u2013 is exactly the kind of fixture where a team not yet in the groove might get punished. Except Guardiola specialises in achieving the almost inconceivable. He thinks of football differently to most people, perhaps to anyone in the game today, and inspires his players to unusual heights of performance and consistency. It will be a fascinating afternoon at the Britannia. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Daniel Harris<br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"><em tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/18/the-question-kevin-de-bruyne-silva-free-roles\">Jonathan Wilson: can De Bruyne and Silva prosper as \u2018free No8s\u2019?</a><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u2022 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/17/joe-hart-leave-manchester-city-long-term-move-barcelona\">Hart to stay at Manchester City unless right offer comes along</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e85ad7738004a232c7f45438fa8c355a80bc4a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e85ad7738004a232c7f45438fa8c355a80bc4a5/6_643_2064_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola will need time to get his message across to Manchester City\u2019s players.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4) Mazzarri and Conte renew their nasty rivalry</strong></h2> <p>The last time Watford beat Chelsea, Antonio Conte had five years remaining as a player at Juventus and Walter Mazzarri had yet to begin his tour of Italian clubs. Evidence suggests the latter will not be able to secure the Hornets a first victory in this fixture since 1999, but there is an animosity between the pair of managers that will make it a fascinating duel. \u201cI saw a lot of myself in him when I was at Reggina,\u201d Mazzarri wrote in his autobiography. \u201cSincerely, I thought: \u2018I like this guy.\u2019\u201d Yet when Mazzarri was in charge of Napoli and Conte was managing Juve, any chance of a friendly rivalry was scuppered. Mazzarri even accused Conte of \u201ccopying\u201d his tactics \u2013 as if three at the back was never used before or elsewhere \u2013 and there was an infamous meeting in 2013 when they refused to shake hands after a 1-1 draw in Naples.

Harry Kane dropped behind the Dutchman to form a more attacking 4-1-4-1, with Pochettino\u2019s other summer signing, Victor Wanyama, left to occupy the holding role. The switch quickly paid dividends as Spurs scored through \u00c9rik Lamela three minutes later and dominated the rest of the game, illustrating how Pochettino\u2019s signings will offer him greater tactical flexibility this season. The question remains as to whether the manager will be tempted to use both Janssen and Kane from the start, particularly in home matches against opposition Spurs are expected to beat \u2013 Crystal Palace\u2019s visit to White Hart Lane on Saturday may provide an answer. <strong>LO<br></strong><br><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/18/tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-football-schedule-congestion\">Pochettino rails against schedule congestion</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/18/liverpool-agree-to-sell-christian-benteke-to-crystal-palace-for-27m\">Crystal Palace agree \u00a327m fee for Liverpool\u2019s Benteke</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly/mixed-fortunes-for-shane-duffy-and-sergio-aguero-football-weekly-extra\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F278808617&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6) West Ham are ready to start new life in Stratford</h2> <p>There is not much to be said for a Europa League season that starts in July, but one thing it should do is facilitate the match fitness which gives a team the jump on its domestic rivals. For West Ham, that was made difficult by a fixture list that sent them to Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend; they lost to a late goal, not playing especially well in the process. Last season, on the other hand, Slaven Bilic\u2019s team began with a win at Arsenal, a performance which proved to them what was possible \u2013 even though, in typical style, the followed it up with successive home defeats. One of these came against Bournemouth \u2013 by four goals to three, <em tabindex=\"-1\"><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jewish-languages.org/jewish-english-lexicon/words/1507\">noch</a></em> \u2013 a result they daren\u2019t repeat this weekend, partly on principle but principally because Sunday marks the first domestic game at, er, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/aug/04/behind-the-scenes-at-west-hams-new-home-in-pictures\">\u201cLondon Stadium\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Moving is rarely easy for anyone, and football teams are no exception \u2013 Arsenal, for example, struggled playing at Wembley in the Champions League, and drew with Aston Villa and Middlesbrough before recording their first win at the Emirates. It takes time for a house to become a home, and for a stadium to become a ground \u2013 which is where that Europa League advantage comes back in. West Ham have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/04/west-ham-domzale-europa-league-match-report\">already won in Stratford</a>, and, given its strangeness, the experience of playing there might be easier for them than for Bournemouth. And, on top of that, they are managed by Slaven Bilic. He had his players suitably revved up for the final match at Upton Park, and Eddie Howe can be certain that the same will be so on Sunday. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">DH</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/18/juventus-serie-a-title-race-higuain-inter-napoli\">Juventus to dominate Serie A title race but there will be plenty of drama | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p><br><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/west-ham-olympic-stadium-capacity\">Ayew out for months after injuring thigh on his West Ham debut</a></em></p> <h2>7) Williams can provide knowhow to fill gap left by Stones<br></h2> <p>Ashley Williams was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/everton-sign-ashley-williams-swansea-city\">paraded at Goodison Park</a> last weekend and is likely to make his debut for Everton at The Hawthorns on Saturday, providing he is deemed fit enough to play. Signed to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-city-complete-signing-of-john-stones-from-everton\">the departing John Stones</a>, Ronald Koeman might argue Everton have made an upgrade in their defensive ranks, at least in the short-term. The \u00a335m difference in price tag between the two reflects Manchester City\u2019s investment in the future, but Koeman will immediately benefit from the top-flight knowhow and leadership of 31-year-old Williams, a defender arriving at the peak of his powers after a successful Euro 2016. </p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to bring in a strong player in the central defence position, a player who knows the Premier League and Ashley fits the bill for us very well,\u201d the Everton manager said of his \u00a312m signing. \u201cHe\u2019s an experienced defender and the kind of player we need in the team. He\u2019s a leader.\u201d Koeman used a back three against Tottenham in Everton\u2019s opening match, a system in which Williams thrived for Wales over the summer, and this may be the manager\u2019s preferred shape in solving their defensive problems \u2013 of the teams to stay up last season, only Bournemouth and Sunderland conceded more goals than Everton\u2019s 55.

Now it is more of a minimum requirement, but Burnley need their new \u00a37.5m signing from Anderlecht to settle in straight away, and it raised an eyebrow when David Jones, the man whose place Defour will effectively take in midfield, was allowed to join Sheffield Wednesday almost immediately. Jones started last weekend\u2019s defeat to Swansea and played 41 times in the 2015-16 Championship-winning campaign; Defour should be an upgrade but one in, one out does not seem a sound policy for a squad this thin and significant further surgery is still needed before the month is over. Liverpool, exuberant after last weekend\u2019s win at Arsenal if demonstrably brittle themselves, are not ideal opponents and beginning the campaign with two home defeats \u2013 the match was switched from Anfield due to the stadium\u2019s redevelopment \u2013 would add to the sense that Burnley already have a mountain to climb. Defour\u2019s star has fallen since he was linked with Everton and Manchester United earlier in the decade but if he can shine at Burnley there will be obvious benefits for player and club; the obvious concern is that, where in the past his addition would have been cause to celebrate, as things stand it probably will not be enough. <strong>NA<br></strong><br><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/18/burnley-sean-dyche-transfer-fees-steven-defour\">Dyche: top flight transfer fees are \u2018big for a club like Burnley\u2019</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/aug/16/david-squires-on-the-big-premier-league-kick-off\">David Squires on ... the Premier League\u2019s return</a></em></p> <h2><strong>9) Phelan deserves his long-awaited shot in the big chair</strong></h2> <p>The sartorial jokes were inevitable and stale.

And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/hull-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">they won!</a> Against the champions! With a squad of only 13 senior players! It is 21 years since Phelan took his first coaching role at Norwich and it is time he deserved a proper shot on the merry-go-round. So much time spent in the shadows has left questions over his capabilities \u2013 but working day-to-day with players for more than two decades provides sufficient evidence that he can survive. Considering the grave uncertainty behind the scenes at Hull \u2013 they are yet to sign a senior player since promotion and are unlikely to in the near future \u2013 Phelan should not be counting on being permanently appointed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/14/hull-city-mike-phelan-chinese-takeover\">Takeover talks are continuing</a> but the post is deeply unattractive for most, and Phelan is undoubtedly keen.

The latter scenario is more than familiar to Sunderland\u2019s supporters but David Moyes\u2019 reign at the Stadium of Light has begun with some optimism, and they were unfortunate not to make Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City bow a lot less pleasant last Saturday. Middlesbrough\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/middlesbrough-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">home draw with Stoke</a> fell similarly into the encouraging-but-room-for-improvement bracket; Aitor Karanka heads up a hardworking side that will match Moyes\u2019 team for industry and it would take an optimistic punter to expect this Tees-Wear derby to contain many goals. That match in 2008-09 \u2013 a 1-1 draw at the Riverside \u2013 saw such luminaries as Afonso Alves, El Hadji Diouf and Mido strut their stuff. This one may not look high on stardust but a quick comparison of present and past squads might suggest that, if nothing else, lessons have been learned since then.

Speculation ran wild: some columnists opined that Ford would be building a new railroad to the coast, or a new factory for his cars. Above all, they just wanted to know when he would be arriving.</p> <p>Officially, Ford\u2019s interest in Brazil was a business venture: the monopoly on Sri Lankan rubber maintained by Britain was driving up costs for his new Model A cars, so he wanted to find a cheap source of latex that would allow the Ford Motor Company to produce its own tyres, to cut costs. </p> <p>But Ford\u2019s vision ran much deeper.

In his day, Ford\u2019s name was every bit as evocative of the glimmering promise of technological revolution as Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 perhaps even more so.</p> <p>Within a decade of its founding in Dearborn, Michigan in 1903, the Ford Motor Company had revolutionised car production by introducing the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html\" draggable=\"true\">assembly line</a> \u2013 isolating tasks within the complex process of car assembly, allowing new models of his flagship vehicle, the Model T, to be cranked out faster than ever before, making the company a global success.</p> <p>Yet Ford\u2019s greatest innovation was arguably not mechanical, but social. He took pride in the fair treatment of his staff, and in 1914, to great fanfare, he proclaimed that all Ford workers would receive a daily salary of $5 (the equivalent of $120 (\u00a390) today).</p> <p>Ford believed fair treatment would make his workers more responsible citizens and, in the process, solidify a client base for manufacturers. The Rev Samuel Marquis, one the heads of Ford\u2019s employee relations office, once proclaimed that Ford\u2019s cars were \u201cthe by-products of his real business, which is the making of men\u201d.</p> <p>But some of Ford\u2019s social ideas were highly sinister \u2013 most <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/interview/henryford-antisemitism/\" draggable=\"true\">notoriously his anti-semitism</a>, which featured prominently in a newspaper he himself printed, the Dearborn Independent.</p> <p>He became increasingly convinced that his role in advancing society had to go beyond the factory floor, and encompass entire cities. While he succeeded in bringing some of his smaller urban planning concepts to life, his much larger project, a <a href=\"http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2013/01/post_89.html\" draggable=\"true\">massive manufacturing city to be built in northern Alabama</a> \u2013 75 miles long, with power supplied by damming the Tennessee river \u2013 never got off the ground.</p> <p>Eventually, Ford settled on a location for his ideal city that was a good deal further south than Alabama: the Amazon.</p> <h2>\u2018A work of civilisation\u2019</h2> <p>By the 1920s, the Amazon basin lay in shambles. At the end of the previous century, the region had benefited from a monopoly on global rubber production, skyrocketing demands, and easy transportation via the navigable waters of the Amazon river.</p> <p>Cities along the river had swelled with new residents seeking their fortunes, and had lined their streets with opulent new buildings. Belem, at the mouth of the river, became the busiest port in Brazil; upriver, Manaus became world famous for its decadent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/14/manaus-amazon-theatre-brazil-history-cities-50-buildings\">Amazon Theatre</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bdc4650fc33f60ee2f209d8ecbe7c7511658d780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdc4650fc33f60ee2f209d8ecbe7c7511658d780/51_182_844_415/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sawmill and Power House at Fordlandia\" width=\"500\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sawmill and power house at Fordlandia were abandoned in 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The collections of Henry Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the cultivation of rubber trees could not be standardised; placing them too close together exposed them to blight and parasites. And though these trees only grew natively in Brazil, it wasn\u2019t long before enterprising botanists decided they would try planting them in other tropical regions, where they had no natural parasites. </p> <p>The British began growing rubber in Sri Lanka, after a rubber tree\u2019s seeds were famously <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/10903662/The-man-who-brought-rubber-to-the-Far-East.html\">smuggled out of Brazil</a>. And by the beginning of the century, this produce was vastly outperforming Brazil\u2019s rubber crop. The Amazon basin, heavily dependent on proceeds from rubber sales, was devastated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are not going to South America to make money, but to help develop that wonderful and fertile land</p> <footer> <cite>Henry Ford</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fresh off the failure of his Alabama development, Ford grew fascinated with the economically ravaged Amazon as a potential site for a reboot of his utopian aspirations. He had reportedly first become interested by the area after hearing ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, a personal friend, tell of his journey down the river. Increasing rubber prices gave a practical aspect to his dream.</p> <p>In his utopian mind, Ford\u2019s plan for growing rubber in the Amazon was (as one state department official later described it) a \u201cwork of civilisation\u201d. He believed the values that had made his company a success would build character anywhere else on the planet. In 1928, he went as far as to <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-resources/popular-topics/brazilian-rubber-plantations/\">announce</a>: \u201cWe are not going to South America to make money, but to help develop that wonderful and fertile land.\u201d</p> <p>But the move also represented a certain disenchantment with his home country, and a desire to start from scratch in the blank slate of the Amazon jungle. \u201cThe force of industrial capitalism [Ford] helped to unleash,\u201d writes Greg Grandin in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/30/fordlandia-forgotten-jungle-city-grandin\">definitive history of Fordlandia</a>, \u201cwas undermining the world he hoped to restore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"830756fc143cd0642f1255cd127c956c656e832a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/830756fc143cd0642f1255cd127c956c656e832a/42_71_1115_669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fordlandia Dance Hall, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To attract workers to Fordlandia, Ford offered a range of services \u2013 including an 18-hole golf course and dance hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The collections of Henry Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1927, the economic justification for Ford\u2019s proposed incursion into Brazil had become less convincing. Britain\u2019s stranglehold on global rubber began to diminish, and his advisers suggested he would be better off purchasing rubber from local suppliers in Brazil. But Ford soon sent two of his most trusted men to reach an agreement with Brazilian authorities.</p> <p>The deal with the Brazilian state of Para was not exactly beneficial for Ford. He received rights to commercially operate a 5,625 sq mile tract of land on the Tapaj\u00f3s river, a tributary of the Amazon, for a total of $125,000. It was later revealed that Ford\u2019s men had given him something of a raw deal; by law, he could have obtained that land for next to nothing. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Ford now had all he needed to bring his ideals to life in the middle of the jungle. As Grandin notes: \u201cFord had the right to run Fordlandia as a separate state.\u201d</p> <h2>Ford\u2019s uphill battle</h2> <p>The site of Fordlandia had been chosen on top of a rise, to protect it from flooding. But this meant it was far enough inland that the cargo vessel chosen to haul construction materials could not pass through the rocky waters of the Tapaj\u00f3s until the rainy season. A crew assembled at the future site of the city in late 1928, angered by a rotting food supply, and revolted against its leadership.</p> <p>Materials didn\u2019t arrive at Fordlandia until early 1929. Construction finally began under the command of the Norwegian-born Einar Oxholm, who oversaw the laying out of Fordlandia\u2019s basic street grid. </p> <p>The city was built with a separate neighbourhood, the Vila Americana<em>,</em> for the American staff who worked there. Grandin points out that this development was separated from the areas intended for Brazilian workers. \u201cIt was offset a bit, similar to the relationship of suburbia to a city,\u201d he says. The Vila Americana had the best view of the city, and was the only section with running water; while the Brazilian workers made do with water supplied by wells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa654a1b5c70363a01e191e8a151cb3b01956d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa654a1b5c70363a01e191e8a151cb3b01956d69/0_0_5362_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of a derelict rubber factory, Fordlandia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior of a derelict rubber factory in the middle of the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city would come to feature modern hospitals, schools, generators and a sawmill. By the end of 1930, its landmark structure was complete: a water tower, utilitarian beacon of modernity for Ford\u2019s \u201ccivilising\u201d project.</p> <p>But it still faced an uphill battle. Clearing the jungle was excruciating work, and despite Ford\u2019s famously high wages, labour of the kind needed for the project was in short supply. Amazon wood, which Ford had initially hoped to sell at a profit until rubber could be produced in the territory, proved useless.</p> <p>The local press, initially friendly, turned on Ford and his project. Meanwhile, Ford\u2019s desire that the city remain alcohol-free proved all but impossible to enforce. Oxholm didn\u2019t last long as manager \u2013 the city would go through several managers in its first two years.</p> <p>Just when things appeared to be settling down in Fordlandia, violence broke out again on <a href=\"https://www.damninteresting.com/the-ruins-of-fordlandia/\">20 December 1930</a>. At the workers\u2019 cafe, in which skilled workers were separated from manual labourers, an argument between supervisor Kaj Ostenfeld and Manuel Caetano, a brick mason working at the city, quickly escalated. Workers rallied behind Caetano, vandalising the city, destroying generators, manufacturing equipment, and even their own homes. </p> <p>Fordlandia\u2019s managerial staff managed to escape by ship; they were eventually able to subdue the violence, but only by appealing to Pan Am air magnate <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989780,00.html\">Juan Trippe</a> to assist them by flying in Brazilian military personnel on one of his planes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73f052cbb62da3add8ae5bc670b7cc32f23d4b0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f052cbb62da3add8ae5bc670b7cc32f23d4b0f/0_28_3104_1864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Museum of Fordlandia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The drawing room in the museum that\u2019s housed in one of the former managers\u2019 homes in Vila Americana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After this low point, Fordlandia faced a turning point. Ford finally found a successful manager in <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/358392\">Archibald Johnston</a>, who turned the city around after the riot: paving the roads, finishing much of the city\u2019s much needed housing, and beginning work on access roads to connect Fordlandia with the massive territory Ford had acquired inland from the river.</p> <p>It was perhaps under Johnston that Fordlandia came closest to Ford\u2019s original ideal. He succeeded in bringing many of the amenities typical of American towns into the heart of the Amazon basin. The centrepiece was an entertainment facility that screened Hollywood films and also held dances. Health and education facilities were also improved. Johnson saw to it that many of Ford\u2019s behavioural edicts were put into place, including a strict diet (though the alcohol provision still remained hard to enforce), and an emphasis on gardening. </p> <p>But one problem remained: Fordlandia was not producing any rubber. Jungle foliage continued to be cleared, but efforts to plant rubber trees yielded discouraging results. The few trees that took root were quickly beset by blight.</p> <p>To combat this, Ford brought in expert botanist James R Weir, who infuriated Johnston by insisting on a number of extravagant planting methods, and then, in 1936, demanding the construction of a second plant within Ford\u2019s territory, called Belterra. Weir unceremoniously departed from Fordlandia a year later, without informing any staff of his intention to never return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18f6852dea6e024831a40ca8c77cf35e9934738e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18f6852dea6e024831a40ca8c77cf35e9934738e/56_195_840_504/500.jpg\" alt=\"Employee housing at Fordlandia\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By 1940, the plant employed 400 people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The collections of Henry Ford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having outlived their economic rationale, Fordlandia and Belterra<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>nonetheless persisted for nearly a decade. As Ford\u2019s car manufacturing operation became increasingly involved in the second world war effort, his holding in Brazil filled with American military personnel.</p> <p>By the time the war ended, Henry Ford was in poor health. Management of the company fell to his grandson Henry Ford II, who promptly cut into the company\u2019s ballooning costs by selling underperforming assets. Fordlandia was first on the chopping block.</p> <p>Ford II sold it back to Brazil for a fraction of what his grandfather had originally paid. The moment news of the sale reached Fordlandia, its American residents headed home, leaving its Brazilian residents wondering what had hit them.</p> <h2>A quiet death</h2> <p>In contrast to the excitement generated around its creation, Fordlandia\u2019s death was a quiet one. Equipment from the sawmill and generator was left to the elements and vandals over the years, rusting in the thick Amazon air. The iconic water tower still stands, though it no longer holds any water, and the Ford logo proudly painted on it has long since faded.</p> <p>In the past decade, however, Fordlandia has enjoyed something of a renaissance. Part of that is cultural: its history has been revisited in news articles, documentaries and even in music \u2013 Icelandic minimalist composer Johann Johannsson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/jr54/\" draggable=\"true\">released an album in 2008 inspired by the city</a>. After the population languished at under 100 for several decades, it has rebounded to about 3,000 people in recent years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/17/lost-cities-8-mystery-ahokia-illinois-mississippians-native-americans-vanish\">Lost cities #8: mystery of Cahokia \u2013 why did North America's largest city vanish?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cToday, most residents don\u2019t care very much about Fordlandia\u2019s history,\u201d says Christiane von Schwind, producer of a <a href=\"http://www.gebrueder-beetz.de/en/productions/modern-ruins-fordlandia\">short documentary about the city</a>. \u201cIf the population is rising, I\u2019m sure it has to do with economic reasons rather than the history or \u2018spirit\u2019 of Fordlandia.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there are those who still remember their time in Fordlandia. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2SpGRuwqA4\">2008 film about the city</a>, former resident Charles Townsend returns to the town with members of his family. Seeing one of the schools, he runs ahead of the camera, eager to chat with some of the children.</p> <p>\u201cWho here was born in Fordlandia?\u201d he asks the children in an easygoing Portuguese; they respond with cheers. \u201cI was born in Fordlandia too!\u201d he replies.</p> <p>Those children don\u2019t have the good fortune of attending a modern school, the way Fordlandia\u2019s first residents did. But in a way they are better off. Fordlandia was created as the brainchild of one of the world\u2019s most ambitious industrialists, and it failed. Perhaps it will do better as just an average town. </p> <p><em>Do you know of other lost cities throughout history?

When he\u2019s gone there will be no replacement, just a competing roster of normal scale humans beings. The Bolt persona above all will be missed; commercial catnip, but also an intriguing thing in itself. There is undoubtedly a real Bolt in there somewhere, some private part of himself that has remained discrete throughout the Bolt Supremacy, just as there is some clever misdirection in the party boy persona, the Swedish women\u2019s handball team schtick, the much-trumpeted chicken nuggets. The casual airs are an act of intimidation, a racing tactic. The playfulness with De Grasse in the semi-finals was a part of this, an invitation to blink first.</p> <p>Another odd thing: other sprinters like Bolt. No one resents him, or shows irritation at his theatrics. It isn\u2019t hard to see why. For a start Bolt makes them money. Tyson Gay has said his own revenues increased steadily as soon as Bolt started beating him, so profound was Bolt\u2019s effect on the entire sport. The wealth has been shared, if not the medals.</p> <p>Here he ran his last as an Olympic sprint finalist, although another world championships will follow. Some have even suggested that retirement will quickly pall, that his value is simply too great, his racing will too strong to depart even on a high. That remains to be seen. But in Rio this felt like the greatest of solo goodbyes for the greatest, and most fondly compelling of athletes.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f98fed244e592de791bffb30d3be5714490eacd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f98fed244e592de791bffb30d3be5714490eacd/36_393_4551_3063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bolt takes a bow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bolt takes a bow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:29:41.703Z\">at 4.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b67be0e4b062ce4d224c1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:25:00.960Z\">4.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brazil wins the first set in the men\u2019s beach volleyball final.</strong></p> <p>Alison and Bruno take it 21-19 from the Italian pair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31ffb3a382a422d429bc38701e21467ca64f7bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31ffb3a382a422d429bc38701e21467ca64f7bac/0_0_3496_2447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil\u2019s Alison Cerutti celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil\u2019s Alison Cerutti celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:26:39.934Z\">at 4.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b67b51e4b0178756b5e0cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:24:05.196Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>China has WON the women\u2019s indoor volleyball semi-final, three sets to one against Netherlands. </strong>It was 25-23 in the fourth set.</p> <p>They\u2019ll play Serbia \u2013 who earlier knocked out the USA \u2013 in the final.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b67ae6e4b0c23bfed8adca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:21:48.277Z\">4.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Seriously, this is too close.

The official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak about an ongoing probe.</p> <p>He said that around 6 am on Sunday, Lochte, along with fellow swimmers Jack Conger, Gunnar Bentz and Jimmy Feigen, stopped at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, a suburb of Rio where many Olympic venues are located. One of the swimmers tried to open the door of an outside bathroom. It was locked. A few of the swimmers then pushed on the door and broke it. A security guard appeared and confronted them, the official said. The official says the guard was armed with a pistol, but he never took it out or pointed it at the swimmers. </p> <p>According to the official, the gas station manager then arrived. Using a customer to translate, the manager asked the swimmers to pay for the broken door. After a discussion, they did pay him an unknown amount of money and then left. The official says that swimmers Conger and Bentz, who were pulled off a plane going back to the United States late Wednesday, told police that the robbery story had been fabricated.</p> <p>A spokesman for Rio 2016 meanwhile, defended the swimmers whose accounts of an armed robbery, saying they were just kids who were having fun and made a mistake. </p> <p> \u201cThese kids tried to have fun, they tried to represent their country to the best of their abilities,\u201d Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada told reporters said, without elaborating. \u201cThey competed under gigantic pressure.

I recall as a 13-year-old, (mildly enthusiastic about sports, but rubbish at anything other than rugby) the whole class doing the rounds of all the athletics events. My go at the long jump, and I\u2019m hurtling down my carefully-marked run-up when the teacher called out, in my final strides, \u201cYou look like a Sherman Tank, Williams!\u201d Completely put me off, but he wouldn\u2019t let me have another go, so my first and only recorded PB at the long jump was 8ft 6in\u2026.</p> <p> About a year later, playing volleyball in the gym (must have been raining), I managed, in the follow-through of an energetic smash attempt, to slap myself firmly in the danglers. Luckily no serious damage, just a fair bit of greenness about the gills and a lengthy time-out, during which the teacher (a different one) displayed his sympathy by remarking that at my age I ought to be completely familiar with my own tolerance for hard handling in that area\u2026.</p> <p> And later again, at rugby training, the teacher was demonstrating to the first-team pack some subtleties of track one and track two ball from the scrum, so installed himself as their hooker, and picked me to hook against him. This was a demo, so we non-first-teamers were really just there in place of the scrum machine that the school couldn\u2019t afford. Anyway, by chance, the first time the ball came in, I flicked my 1970s-budding-rock-bass-player long hair out of my eyes and caught the teacher full in the face (cheek-to-cheek, of course, in the scrum). I won the strike. Second time around, I did it on purpose and beat him again. Third time, the teacher got fed up \u2013 just before packing down, he did the old sniff and hawk and rolled a big green grolly out of the corner of his mouth into his beard, which he then rubbed up and down against my cheek as the scrum set. When I recoiled in disgust, he asked, \u2018Do we understand each other, Williams?\u2019. \u2018Perfectly, sir\u2026..\u2019 and the demonstration proceeded smoothly. The moral? Don\u2019t ever try to be clever with an old club player, even when he\u2019s a teacher\u2026.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5be9fe4b0178756b5dd5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:57:22.696Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Three game points to GB in the badminton... but the first is quickly saved with a dipping service return backed up with a smash. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5be51e4b062ce4d2248ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/barneyronay\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:56:36.875Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cFurther to Sean\u2019s update on the Triathlon, I can confirm from my beachside seat that it is inhumanly hot on Copacabana.

Admittedly there has been a few bright sparks such as Dipa Karmarkar finishing fourth in the vault final being India\u2019s first ever gymnast to reach the final. Sadly even her story illustrates why India do so poorly at the Olympics as she was persistently underfunded as she relied on using the discarded gymnastic equipment from the 2010 Commonwealth Games to train with. Whilst in Rio her own physiotherapist was considered surplus to requirements by the Indian Olympic association thus she had no physio throughout the Olympics to help her. So just looking into her story alone illustrates how money can breed about success and Indian gymnastics is still very far behind what I assume is the well funded British team which won all those medals this year.\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5b541e4b0c23bfed8aa4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:17:42.992Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cIn my humble opinion she should not be playing on,\u201d says the BC summariser, apparently more aware of the pain Li\u2019s in than Li herself.

Originally laid down with concrete slabs in the 1960\u2019s someone had the bright idea in the early 1980\u2019s to cover those slabs with the new single-strip rubber matting. The only problem was that due to wear-and-tear the joints between the concrete slabs had worn down a bit. So if ball pitched on the rubber mat in a spot that lay on top of a crumbling joint it would fly off in a random direction and with significant acceleration. Cue smart-arse show-off going into the net, and casually disdaining the need for a box, with a jaunty \u201cOh no, I won\u2019t need one of those sir...\u201d. The first fast ball sent down pinged off a joint, kept low, and drove straight into the said lad\u2019s bollocks.

As loudly as one dares in a stiff upper lip British sports day environment , I hollered to her to switch lanes, but nothing doing. She gamely finished fourth after running the full race in the outside lane and was soundly beaten by her decidedly less fit best mate. The whole farce of the day was compounded by the same teacher ringing the bell a lap too early on the 1500 metres for boys. This resulted in the leader diving and collapsing at the line in triumph only to burst into tears when seeing the rest of the field shoot past him to complete the final lap.

It was fondly called \u2018The Plunge\u2019. Essentially, you had to dive in and see how far you could float without moving anything, or breathing.</p> <p>While this sounds like a recipe for drowning, and is probably outlawed on \u2018Elf &amp; Safety\u2019 grounds these days, it was incredibly entertaining to watch. It was also uniquely well suited to the fat kids who were otherwise absolutely abject at swimming, given their ballast and sheer momentum would allow them to float further than their smaller, more svelte peers. [N.B. I wasn\u2019t one of those fat kids, and so never had the pleasure of competing in it, having thrashed myself in the more traditional events previously].<br></p> <p>I reckon they should make it an Olympic sport.\u201d<br></p> <p>The sadism they used to get away with in school was quite something.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s endangered water voles will reach new heights when they are returned to Yorkshire\u2019s Malham tarn for the first time in 50 years.</p> <p>Around 100 water voles will be reintroduced on Friday to the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/malham-tarn-estate\">National Trust estate</a> in the Yorkshire dales, home to England\u2019s highest freshwater lake, in what the trust says is the highest-altitude reintroduction of the species it has carried out in Britain.</p> <p>Immortalised as Ratty in Kenneth Grahame\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/09/100-best-novels-the-wind-in-the-willows-kenneth-grahame\">The Wind in the Willows</a>, the water vole is <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/water-vole\">Britain\u2019s fastest-declining mammal</a>. The animal was once found in nearly every waterway in England, Scotland and Wales, but is now thought to have been lost in up to 90% of these sites, clinging on in isolated pockets, coastal marshes and backwaters.</p> <p>The intensification of agriculture, pollution and development, plus poor riverside management, has brought about the loss and degradation of the riverbank habitat in which the voles live. But the sharpest declines in the past 30 years have been caused by the spread of the <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/american-mink\">American mink</a>. These animals have established themselves on the waterways after escaping from fur farms, and they prey voraciously on the water vole. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb63e7a5b9e687b73e5272e31aaee1c3be2be2e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb63e7a5b9e687b73e5272e31aaee1c3be2be2e5/0_0_4320_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water voles being transported to Malham tarn ahead of their release.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The water voles being transported to Malham tarn ahead of their release.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Rayner/North News &amp; Pictures Ltd for National Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reintroduction schemes, alongside programmes to control mink and manage habitats, are providing a lifeline for the species. Water voles have recently been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/27/water-voles-return-to-cornwall\">returned to Cornwall</a> after being declared extinct in the county, <a href=\"https://www.southdowns.gov.uk/water-voles-reach-south-downs-in-largest-uk-reintroduction-programme/\">to the South Downs national park</a> and to <a href=\"http://www.gwentwildlife.org/node/4062\">Gwent in south Wales</a>.</p> <p>The Malham voles have been <a href=\"http://www.watervoles.com/\">bred in captivity by a specialist agency</a> and will be released over five days into the fen area of the tarn, which is unique for its flora, fauna and geology. A glacial lake set among ancient limestone pastures and upland hill farms, it is home to rare plants and animals including stonewort, sheltering pea mussels and the three-spined stickleback. The tarn also provides food for diving birds such as great crested grebes.<br></p> <p>At 377 metres above sea level, it is England\u2019s highest freshwater lake, and this is the highest-altitude release undertaken by the National Trust. Previous upland releases have taken place at Duchray in the Scottish Highlands (up to 300m) and Brecon Beacons in Wales (154m).</p> <p>It is hoped the animals will recolonise the tarn and its surrounding streams, and play an important part in the ecosystem, grazing and burrowing into areas of the riverbank and allowing rare plants to grow, including mosses and liverworts that need patches of open habitat. The water voles will also act as a food source for predators such as barn owls and otters.<br></p> <p>Roisin Black, a National Trust ranger at Malham tarn, said: \u201cIn the rest of Europe, water voles are common. In Britain, the creatures are incredibly rare. We know water voles have thrived at Malham tarn in the past and, thanks to work by the National Trust, the habitat here is perfect for water voles again.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/11/englands-water-voles-in-desperate-decline\">England's water voles in desperate decline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The animals will spend two days in large cages on the fringes of their new home. On the third day, the doors will be opened, with food placed on rafts in the water to encourage the voles to leave the cages and burrow in the banks. After five days, the cages will be removed altogether. <br></p> <p>Rangers will monitor the health of the population, with a view to releasing a further 100 water voles in June next year. </p> <p>The reintroduction is part of a new <a href=\"http://www.3keel.com/sites/default/files/NAT037_YorkshireDales_VisionDoc_AW_LOWRES%20(1)_1.pdf\">land management approach agreed in 2015</a> for the 8,000 hectares of National Trust land in the Yorkshire dales. Farmers and partners will work with ecological processes to create a landscape that looks like the traditional dales but has a wider variety of natural habitats \u2013 moors, fields and woodlands \u2013 and better connections between them.<br></p> <p>Peter Welsh, ecologist for the National Trust in the Yorkshire dales, said: \u201cWater voles once played an important part in the ecosystem at Malham tarn. Reintroducing them to the tarn is just one of the ways we are working alongside our farmers and other partners to restore wildlife and natural processes in the Yorkshire dales landscapes we care for.\u201d</p>",

She may even buy some land. \u201cNo other job lets you earn this kind of money,\u201d says Kew, who earns of about 250 baht a day from her food stall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/01/outsourcing-pregnancy-india-surrogacy-clinics-julie-bindel\">Outsourcing pregnancy: a visit to India's surrogacy clinics | Julie Bindel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kew says she is not aware that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31546717\">Thailand banned commercial surrogacy</a> for foreigners last year. All she knows is that for this, her second surrogacy, her agency flew her to neighbouring Cambodia for the embryo transfer. \u201cI think I will also have to deliver the baby there.\u201d </p> <p>With surrogacy bans now in place in Thailand, India and Nepal, the business is being pushed across borders. </p> <p>\u201cMany would-be parents whose budget limits them to Asia have no other options than to try their luck in Cambodia, especially gay couples,\u201d says Sam Everingham, director of the Australian non-profit organisation <a href=\"http://www.familiesthrusurrogacy.com/\">Families Through Surrogacy</a>, which informs aspiring parents on overseas surrogacy options. </p> <p>Everingham has observed how agencies and clinics forced to close in Thailand simply moved their lucrative business into Cambodia, where infertility treatment was non-existent until two years ago.</p> <p>Today, clinics in the capital, Phnom Penh, are offering IVF and embryo-transfers, and agencies offer services for overseas couples. Some claim to be fully booked for months. Here, surrogacy packages start at $33,000 (\u00a325,400), compared with $90,000-$150,000 in the US.</p> <p>On agency websites, \u201ctravelling surrogates\u201d like Kew are advertised. But, like her, these women may lack clear information about the job they have signed up for. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to be aware that surrogacy is a foreign concept in Cambodia. No laws are in place to regulate the process, leaving both parents and surrogates unprotected,\u201d warns Everingham.</p> <p>For Preeti Bista, owner of the Nepalese surrogacy agency My Fertility Angel, the unclear rules and low costs are precisely what make Cambodia an attractive place to set up what she says will be an ethical surrogacy business. \u201cSince surrogacy has been put on hold in Nepal, I have both desperate surrogates and parents calling me non-stop, asking me if I can help them. I am now trying to do just that in Cambodia. The key is to provide transparency to all parties involved.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After they left I cried for three days straight \u2026 I miss this little girl like she is my own</p> <footer> <cite>Surrogate mother Por, from Bangkok</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bista has been accused of exploiting people\u2019s poverty and lack of options. She says all she does is to help people have babies \u2013 \u201cthe most beautiful thing in the world\u201d.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the money for poorer surrogates can be life-changing. The fee from surrogacy for Baimon, 33, a fish farmer, meant she and her husband were able to invest in a new commercial fish pond, south of Bangkok. \u201cI also bought new freezers,\u201d she says. \u201cFish prices are low, so the only way for us to survive is to invest.\u201d</p> <p> Baimon has delivered surrogate twins for two couples \u2013 the second C-section took place 4,000 miles from home, in Moscow. She is aware of the ban in Thailand and is hesitant about a third pregnancy, saying the new regulations make the endeavour more risky.</p> <p>\u201cWhy can we not protect surrogate mothers better instead of banning the practice?\u2019\u2019 she asks. \u201cNow we will lose all this money to other countries. But to some young women, making a family happy is still better than being a prostitute or dancing in the go-go bars.\u2019\u2019</p> <p> Por, a corn picker from a town five hours south of Bangkok, keeps a photo of her surrogate child. \u201cA big nose and light-coloured hair, just like her daddy,\u201d she whispers. \u201cAfter they left I cried for three days straight.\u2019\u2019 Even now, says Por, \u201cI miss this little girl like she is my own.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the heartache, the 33-year-old is eager to do a second commercial pregnancy. Filling 100kg bags of corn in the sun every day is hard work.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs a surrogate I feared the hospital visits and medicines \u2013 but still, life was easier,\u201d she says. In addition to the main fee of 250,000 baht, each month there was a payment of 15,000 baht, which the agency encouraged her to spend on healthy groceries. </p> <p> Besides the required hospital visits, Por doesn\u2019t recall any other instructions from her agency. She did not receive any counselling on the potential emotional toll of surrogacy, or any explanation on the legal (guardianship) papers she had to sign.</p> <p>\u201cOccasionally, my contact person would give me a call to check how I was feeling, but that was all.\u201d In the meantime, she was working in the fields and taking care of her own two boys. \u201cI will do it a second time, even if I have to travel to another country for it,\u201d she says, adding that she does it for the money, but also because the baby\u2019s Australian parents told her she had given them a precious gift.</p> <p> But how long Cambodia can be Asia\u2019s new surrogate haven remains to be seen. \u201cOnly one scandal has to surface and the whole thing will fall apart,\u201d says Bista. And when that happens, the agencies, clinics and travelling surrogates will pack their bags and head elsewhere. \u201cI am sure [they] will,\u201d she adds, \u201cbecause no matter how many bans there are, you can never make people\u2019s wish to start a family disappear.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Some names have been changed </em></li> </ul>",

Because most forced labour and human trafficking networks operate on a cross-jurisdictional basis, tackling this global challenge also requires action by businesses operating internationally.</p> <p> The act seeks to address this, not by threatening legal penalties on companies but rather by generating pressure from civil society, consumers and investors to initiate a substantial change in corporate behaviour.</p> <p> All organisations with a turnover of more than \u00a336m doing business in the UK are required to publish an annual statement setting out the steps they have taken to prevent slavery in their businesses and supply chains in the UK and overseas. But the government has left businesses free to decide for themselves what, if any, such steps to take and subject only to the judgement of the court of public opinion if they fail to take action. </p> <p> The success of this light touch approach will depend on companies that fail to take meaningful steps being named and shamed, and seen to suffer tangible reputational damage that causes customers and investors to turn away. Only the genuine threat of a severe hit to their bottom lines is likely to force less responsible businesses to take the necessary action. </p> <p> Whether the act makes a big difference will also depend on companies looking beyond their businesses and supply chains in the UK to their operations and suppliers overseas. </p> <p>Leading companies have developed broad frameworks to conduct deep due diligence focusing not only on their direct suppliers but examining all parts of their supply chain, right down to who picks the cotton, who sews the shirt and who mines the ore. Just as companies are already required to take all reasonable steps to know whether there is money laundering in their supply chain, they should do the same for slavery. </p> <p> The government must keep the actions of companies under close review and be ready to dictate more specifically what they must do and to impose tougher legal penalties if companies fail to act.</p> <p> The media and NGOs have a crucial role to play in highlighting serious shortcomings. A valuable starting point is the Transparency in the Supply Chain data bank to which businesses are encouraged voluntarily to submit their reports. This enables companies confidentially to admit when they find that their suppliers are using enslaved workers, facilitates comparisons of what companies are doing and will help to identify and reward best practice. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\">The UK's new slavery laws explained: what do they mean for business?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But the early signs are not promising: to date only about 100 of the 12,000 companies required to produce a statement under the act have submitted it to the data bank. And it is clear from the first statements to be published that there remains \u2013 to interpret their shortcomings generously \u2013 a widespread lack of awareness of exactly what businesses need to do to comply with the law and effectively to combat modern slavery. </p> <p> This raises hard-edged legal and practical questions. There is no one-size-fits-all easy fix. Organisations, including those headquartered outside the UK, need first to establish whether the law applies to them or to their subsidiaries, and to ensure that their statements are approved and published in accordance with the specific requirements of the act. They need to consider questions such as where to focus their resources, what changes may be needed to their policies and contracts with suppliers, what training should be provided to their staff, suppliers and agents, and how they can measure progress. </p> <p> More fundamentally, organisations need to consider how best to respond in the event that they find slavery in one of their suppliers (and, if they don\u2019t, whether they are looking hard enough). What would be the consequences of breaking the contract, not only for the organisation itself but for the workers of the supplier? If the contract was continued, how could the slavery be eliminated and what is their legal exposure for as long as the slavery continues?</p> <p>Previously, these may have been questions to which many companies could turn a blind eye. But that has changed. The new law, with the active backing of the prime minister, has significantly raised the reputational stakes.
