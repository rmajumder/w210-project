  "<p>Vultures are rarely viewed as the poster boys and girls of the natural world. They have repulsive eating habits and are strikingly ugly. Nevertheless, they play a critical role in maintaining the ecological health of many parts of the world.</p> <p>Vultures consume animal carcasses more effectively than any other scavengers and because their digestive juices contain acids that neutralise pathogens such as cholera and rabies they prevent diseases spreading. They act as dead-end hosts for numerous unpleasant ailments. But many ecologists are now warning that vultures across the planet are under serious threat thanks to habitat loss, deliberate and accidental poisoning, and use of the birds\u2019 body parts as traditional medicine cures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/rare-bird-being-driven-to-extinction-by-poaching-for-its-red-ivory-bill\">Rare bird being driven to extinction by poaching for its 'red ivory' bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All these risks will be emphasised by British photographer Charlie Hamilton James in a series of images that will be shown as part of the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-52.html\" title=\"\">Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition,</a> which opens at the Natural History Museum this week.</p> <p>His photographs of vultures \u2013 and the growing environmental risks that threaten to wipe them out \u2013 have won Hamilton James the exhibition\u2019s wildlife photojournalist of the year award.</p> <p>\u201cI like underdogs,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThat is why I like vultures. The trouble is that vultures are now under such stress in the wild \u2013 for several reasons. They are facing a massive catastrophe yet they do so much for the environment and do so much to contain disease.\u201d</p> <p>Vultures are one of the fastest declining groups of animals in the world. In India, all nine species of the bird are threatened with extinction, largely through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/07/european-vultures-threat-diclofenac-vets-spain-italy\" title=\"\">indiscriminate use of diclofenac</a>, a common anti-inflammatory drug administered to livestock but which is lethal for the vultures that eat the corpses of cattle.</p> <p>\u201cThere is now a real danger that a disease like rabies will spread because there are hardly any vultures left to clean up corpses left in the open,\u201d Hamilton James said.</p> <p>In Africa \u2013 where vulture losses are expected to reach 70% to 97% over the next 50 years \u2013 the causes are more varied. One key factor is poisoning, both accidental and deliberate. Poachers use poison to kill elephants and rhinos \u2013 and to kill vultures to stop them circling in the skies over dead prey and alerting gamekeepers to the presence of dead animals and the poachers. \u201cThat is a major threat,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23ad61ff35c5acaefab5a56c318bd6749c223cb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ad61ff35c5acaefab5a56c318bd6749c223cb8/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A market trader offers the body of a lappet-faced vulture at the Faraday muthi market in Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A market trader offers the body of a lappet-faced vulture at the Faraday muthi market in Johannesburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9  Charlie Hamilton James</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another factor in southern Africa is the use of vulture body parts in traditional medicine \u2013 known as <em>muthi</em> \u2013 as cures and treatments for a number of ailments and as sources of improved strength, speed and endurance.</p> <p>\u201cVulture brains are also dried, mixed with mud and smoked because it is thought that helps you see into the future,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p> <p>In one of his most telling images, a trader is seen selling the body of an endangered lappet-faced vulture at a muthi market in Johannesburg. \u201cThe market was full of bits of elephant, leopard, lion, snakes, owls, eagles and ostrich, as well as lots of plants,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p> <p>The skin of a pangolin, the most trafficked species in the world, is also visible in the photograph.</p> <p>Vultures can also be poisoned accidentally. Herders in Africa often lace dead cattle with poison in order to kill lions and other predators that raid their herds. The poison goes through the systems of both cattle and predator and is eaten by vultures, which then die.</p> <p>Habitat loss \u2013 caused by the spread of farming and city suburbs in Africa \u2013 is another critical factor in falling vulture numbers as is industrial and agricultural pollution. Power lines, which are spreading across the continent, also pose a risk, with birds flying into them on a regular basis.</p> <p>The crisis facing vultures is exacerbated by the fact that the birds develop very slowly. Vultures do not reach sexual maturity until they are between five and seven years old. They also breed slowly, with female birds laying only a single egg every one or two years. Each new chick is therefore critical to the survival of the&#xa0;species.</p> <p>Several conservation groups are now working to try to save the world\u2019s vultures, as is revealed in Hamilton James\u2019s photographs. They include the Namibian Vulture Project, which monitors endangered lappet-faced vultures in the Namib-Naukluft national park. The aerial survey takes four days and the plane travels 3,000km (1,865 miles).</p> <p>Active nests are identified and GPS coordinates sent to ground crews who check the nest with a car mirror extension \u2013 so as not to disturb any chicks \u2013 and then ring any they find.</p> <p>In South Africa, workers at the <a href=\"http://www.vulpro.com/\" title=\"\">VulPro</a> vulture conservation programme treat poisoned vultures with atropine and charcoal to try to help them recover. It is hard work, however. In 1922, the population of the local white-backed vulture was thought to be around 270,000. In 2015, it was 9,400. \u201cIt is a desperate problem,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p> <p><em>The Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, London, from 21 October to 10 September 2017</em></p>",

  "<p>Grocer John Papworth is trying to drum up custom at his fruit and veg stall in Chapel Market in Islington, north London, on a sunny Saturday morning. It is hard going. \u201cIt\u2019s the only game in the world where the price changes daily, he says. \u201cBut now, the pound being so weak is really starting to affect us. I don\u2019t like saying it\u2019s all because of Brexit [which he voted for], but the pound\u2019s fall has definitely made things much worse. Our suppliers have got to pay more, so we\u2019ve got to pay more.\u201d</p> <p>An elderly woman shopper overhears him and says: \u201cIt is all thanks to the people who voted Leave!\u201d At the other end of the market, Peter Fleming, a florist, points to his stock of potted plants which all came from the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s this week with the pound stuff that it\u2019s started to really bite. This week it\u2019s gone up 15%. If it gets any worse, we\u2019re going to have to start passing the cost on \u2013 or buying less. This is just the start \u2013 and all because we\u2019ve voted out.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few days, the downside of sterling\u2019s fall, driven at least in part by fears that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit, has begun to hit home not just across the floor of the House of Commons and in currency trading rooms but also on the high street.</p> <p>Midweek there was \u201cMarmitegate\u201d, when Tesco removed a series of products from its shelves<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/13/pound-sterling-brexit-price-row-tesco-unilever-live\"> in a dispute with its supplier, Unilever, over rising prices</a>. The consumer brands company briefly halted deliveries after the supermarket refused to stump up price rises of about 10% for a range of household products and groceries. A deal was eventually agreed and supplies resumed.</p> <p>Political messages caused currency gyrations that in turn hit consumers. Every utterance by a government minister about Brexit affected the markets. By Tuesday, sterling was down more than 18% against the dollar since 23 June. The pound sank to $1.213, down from $1.488 on the day of the referendum.</p> <p>It is not all gloom out there. The <em>Daily Mail </em>and<em> Daily Express</em> certainly don\u2019t think so. They point out that the stock market is way above its 23 June level and that the economy is in rude good health as we head out of the EU, though this view is not shared by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The <em>Mail</em> has branded those who warn of dangers ahead the \u201cBremoaners\u201d.</p> <p>But as Theresa May\u2019s government prepares for what looks like an exit from the single market, while denying MPs a say over the issue, it is not just remainers who are worried. In the Commons, in the rightwing media and among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\">business community</a>, new and in some cases surprising alliances are forming to fight for a soft landing.</p> <p>Even Conservative MPs who backed Brexit voiced their worries on Wednesday, siding with Labour, Liberal Democrat, Scottish Nationalist and Green colleagues. Anti-EU newspaper columnists in pro-Brexit papers were speaking out too, and in the high court a group of QCs warned that Brexit was being driven through in an unconstitutional, undemocratic way.</p> <p>The worries among politicians, businesspeople and opinion formers are broadly twofold: first, that MPs in parliament might be bypassed when the country decides what kind of Brexit we pursue; and, second, that May and her ministers seem so ready to ditch single-market membership in order to control immigration.</p> <p>The Labour MP Pat McFadden, a leading member of the Open Europe campaign that is battling to keep close ties with the EU, said: \u201cThis was the week when the reality of Brexit began to bite \u2013 in our economy, in our parliament and in our public debate. Issues that featured little before 23 June \u2013 like the value of the currency, the impact on prices, and what\u2019s at stake with the single market \u2013 have come to the fore.\u201d</p> <h2>What they\u2019re saying:<br>Rightwing commentators<br></h2> <p>After campaigning for Brexitand trumpeting the economy\u2019s resilience in its aftermath, some commentators on the right now sound queasy about bypassing parliament, ignoring the interests of the 48% who voted Remain, and turning our backs on the single market.</p> <p>Veteran columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/13/christopher-booker-misleading\">Christopher Booker</a> has been savage about the EU for decades but now appears worried that Britain is about to leave in a manner that will seriously damage the economy. On Monday he wrote that \u201cthose who have done their homework\u201d had worked out that \u201cthe only interim arrangement that could conceivably work is the soft Brexit option\u201d. His preferred version is to remain in the European Economic Area, then applying \u201cto join the two richest countries per capita in Europe, Norway and Switzerland, in the European Free Trade Area (Efta)\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f4905f14f85ae9256739e907a33a56bf16fd23a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4905f14f85ae9256739e907a33a56bf16fd23a1/0_0_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Moore said the 48% who voted Remain \u2018are not a negligible rump\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Moore said the 48% who voted Remain \u2018are not a negligible rump\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philip Johnston wrote in the<em> Telegraph</em> about the need to involve MPs: \u201cIf the \u2018will of the people\u2019 is to supplant that of parliament then we must move towards a plebiscite democracy and away from a parliamentary one. Is that what we want? The alternative is that the executive decides these matters on its own with no proper accountability. That really is a democratic deficit. Actually, let\u2019s not mince words. That\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d</p> <p>And the Eurosceptic sage Charles Moore, former <em>Spectator </em>and<em> Telegraph</em> editor, wrote: \u201cMay in her [conference] speech did not try hard enough to mingle the victorious and the defeated in the EU referendum. After all, 48% of those voting, including one Theresa May, lost. They are not a negligible rump. Nor \u2026 are they unpatriotic. They should not be outlawed from the next chapter of our island story.\u201d</p> <h2>Business leaders<br></h2> <p>Many leaders of big business were appalled by the Brexit vote but hadn\u2019t in their worst dreams imagined that it would mean leaving the single market. Ministerial talk over the past week has, however, made that seem increasingly likely, triggering sterling\u2019s fall. The period of post-referendum calm is over.</p> <p>Leading the chorus of concern last week was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/hard-brexit-risks-destroying-uks-open-economy-says-cbi-chief\">Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI</a>. \u201cWhat we have heard over the past few days, if you add up the messages, are signs that the door is being closed on the open economy, which has helped fuel investment. It\u2019s very clear from conversations we are having that the world is watching. International investors are watching. Companies here are watching. And they are reading a lot into the signals of this government about how committed they are to creating a strong economy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51684a3251b233f775a1b77830b7f52d6c9e3739\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51684a3251b233f775a1b77830b7f52d6c9e3739/1517_168_1475_1844/800.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, warned of signs the door was being closed on the open economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EEF (formerly the Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation) warned of disastrous results if the UK leaves the single market and shuts the door on EU migrants: \u201cRushing into a deal at any cost would be calamitous for business \u2026 We must protect access to the single market and the ability of businesses to hire and deploy staff as they need to.\u201d</p> <p>Car manufacturer Nissan received reassurances from the government that it would not be harmed by Brexit, and would not have to pull investment plans. But doubts persist.</p> <h2>MPs of all stripes<br></h2> <p>Surprising alliances were struck in the Commons last week, with Tory MPs, including some who backed Brexit, teaming up with Labour, Scottish Nationalist and Liberal Democrat colleagues.</p> <p>The Eurosceptic hard core who caused trouble for successive Tory leaders is being replaced by an equally awkward squad of soft Brexiters. Some want parliament involved, others stress the importance of the single market, and plenty want both.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewtyrie\">Andrew Tyrie</a>, the pro-Brexit Conservative MP who chairs the treasury select committee, told the House: \u201cWe want a high degree of access to the single market, in my view. To fall back immediately on World Trade Organisation rules would risk an economic shock and certainly an economic downturn, given the high degree of trade integration at the moment between Britain and the EU.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">Stephen Phillips,</a> the Conservative member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, who backed Brexit, emerged suddenly as a rebel. \u201cI and many others did not exercise our vote in the referendum so as to restore the sovereignty of this parliament only to see what we regarded as the tyranny of the European Union replaced by that of a government that apparently wishes to ignore the views of the house on the most important issue facing the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Labour sharpened up its act as Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras, and its new Brexit spokesman, argued that his party was not trying to stop Brexit but wanted MPs to be involved in deciding the least damaging route to the exit door. Plenty of Tories agreed.</p> <h2>Traders and consumers<br></h2> <p>Theresa May has reassured Leave voters that she will take Britain out of the EU by saying \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d but if people begin to think it also means rising prices, more expensive holidays and higher inflation, she may need to find another catchphrase.</p> <p>On Tuesday, ITV ran an item on its main evening news bulletin from a London market and canvassed views on the effect of sterling\u2019s fall on traders and shoppers. A fruit seller said he\u2019d had to push up the price of tangerines by 20%. \u201cAt the weekend it was \u00a31 a pound, now we are having to go \u00a31.20.\u201d</p> <p>A florist said the price of flowers from the Netherlands had doubled in three months and she was concerned that she would lose business.</p> <p>This was before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/13/pound-sterling-brexit-price-row-tesco-unilever-live\">\u201cMarmitegate\u201d </a>, when Tesco removed products from its shelves in a dispute with its supplier, Unilever, which wanted to increase the price of its household goods and groceries by 10%.</p> <p>The governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/prices-to-continue-rising-warns-bank-of-england-governor\">Mark Carney</a>, said he would tolerate inflation going up \u201ca bit\u201d. Now market analysts expect it to rise from its current 0.6% level to above 2.5% over the next two years. With wages unlikely to follow suit, will hard Brexit still look like such a good idea?</p> <h2>Senior lawyers<br></h2> <p>Senior lawyers last week launched a case in the high court, arguing that ministers acting alone should not be able to trigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">Article 50</a>, the process that will lead to Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"adc449b525cad4b11aa3ae8e86eb73356b92c184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc449b525cad4b11aa3ae8e86eb73356b92c184/870_0_2323_2903/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller at the high court\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller arrives at the high court for the challenge to Theresa May\u2019s right to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They argued that parliament should be involved in that process and that it should not be done through the use of the royal prerogative, as currently planned.

Notification of a withdrawal inevitably leads to the removal of the rights of UK citizens, whatever they may be.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\" title=\"\">suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are re-examining \u201cmilitary options\u201d </a>in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about: post-Soviet Russia\u2019s determined drive to re-establish itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end.</p> <p>The foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up anti-Russian \u201chysteria\u201d and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street.

The gaffe underlined his inexperience and lack of judgment.</p> <p>But on Syria\u2019s plight, and particularly on war crimes allegedly committed during the relentless \u201cpulverising\u201d of Aleppo, Johnson had a point. His comments served to highlight the much bigger strategic, security and diplomatic problem: what to do about Russia.</p> <p>Military options are indeed being discussed again in Washington, from where Britain usually takes its cue. The key question is no longer how best to remove the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. It is how to stop the Russian military, Assad\u2019s main backer, which is held responsible, directly or indirectly, for numerous lethal aerial attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s destruction of a UN aid convoy</a>.</p> <p>So furious was John Kerry, the US secretary of state, at what he saw as Moscow\u2019s deliberate sabotage of the latest Syria ceasefire that he broke off bilateral talks with Moscow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\" title=\"\">Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of \u201cbarbarism\u201d</a>. But repeating a pattern of behaviour familiar in Ukraine, Georgia and other crises, an unabashed Putin refused to back down. On the contrary, he rapidly upped the ante.</p> <p>Within days of Kerry\u2019s move and official leaks that the White House was considering cruise missile strikes on Syrian military airstrips, the Russian defence ministry warned that Russia had deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 ground-to-air missiles in Syria. Any US bombing raids would be deemed threatening to Russian military personnel, who would respond accordingly. Moscow also <a href=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\" title=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\">doubled supplies to the Assad</a> regime\u2019s war effort.</p> <p>Almost simultaneously, Putin scrapped a US-Russia agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons and two other nuclear cooperation agreements. The deployment of short-range, nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe bordering Nato members Poland and Lithuania, was confirmed. And, not coincidentally perhaps, massive civil defence exercises were held inside Russia, in apparent preparation for a nuclear war.</p> <p>Just in case Washington had not understood how serious Russia was, officials also declared Putin was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam. It is hard to think of a more defiant, taunting message to the Obama administration than conjuring the spectre of a new Cuban missile crisis.</p> <p>Demonstrating that Moscow has other strategic partnerships that could be turned against Washington, Russian ships joined military exercises with China around the disputed South China Sea islands. It is also busily building up alliances with emerging powers such as South Africa and India, notably at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\" title=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\">Brics summit in Goa</a>, while courting traditional American allies such as Turkey and the Philippines.</p> <p>Sergei Lavrov, Putin\u2019s veteran foreign minister, was blunt. Russia would not be told what to do. Like it or not, it was once again a global force to be reckoned with. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/2485001\" title=\"\">Washington... cannot use the language of force, sanctions and ultimatums</a> with Russia while continuing to selectively cooperate with our country only when it benefits the US,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week, Putin himself took to the airwaves to deliver a similar message. Responding to a formal accusation by the US government that Moscow had launched a cyber warfare-style campaign to \u201cinterfere with the US election process\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\" title=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\">Putin denied</a> he was trying to help the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cThey started this hysteria, saying this [hacking] is in Russia\u2019s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d Putin said. His government would work with whoever won the election \u201cif, of course, the new US leader wishes to work with our country\u201d.</p> <p>This latter statement was chilling. Putin was plainly saying that Russia, no longer the post-Communist economic and military basket-case it briefly became under his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/russia1\" title=\"\">Boris Yeltsin</a>, does not need or seek American approval or agreement to take action in its own interests in Syria or anywhere else. If Barack Obama or his successor want to do business in future, then Russia must be treated as a global equal, not as an irritant or a spoiler or mere regional actor.</p> <p>Such assertions flatly contradict Washington\u2019s preferred narrative, namely that the west \u201cwon\u201d the cold war and Russia is no longer a great power. Hence, perhaps, American slowness to come to terms with a changed situation. But the grave implications of unravelling US-Russia relations are slowly sinking in across Europe, as always the nervous pig stuck in the middle. The German magazine<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\" title=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\"><em>Spiegel</em> recently suggested that Syria was the most prominent battlefront</a> in a new global war, more perilous even than the Cold War because the old power structures and rules are no longer in place.</p> <p>Yet any sort of western consensus over what to do about Russia remains elusive. Opinion is divided in Europe, where many countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, for example, oppose sanctions on Moscow in addition to those imposed after Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Poland and the Baltic states, threatened by the Kaliningrad deployment and border troop build-ups, demand a more muscular Nato stance. Neutral Finland and Sweden, troubled by Russian air and sea incursions, edge ever closer to the western alliance.</p> <p>The so-called Minsk group is due to make another attempt to advance a Ukraine settlement. But nobody is optimistic; the situation there is steadily deteriorating. Following the bad-tempered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/vladimir-putin-declines-french-offer-of-syria-only-talks-in-paris\" title=\"\">cancellation last week of Putin\u2019s visit to France</a>, EU heads of state are also due to meet on Thursday with Syria-related sanctions against Russia on the agenda. This, too, may prove a non-event.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, as Johnson splutters impotently and contradicts himself over no-fly zones, the Labour party claims against all known facts that there is some kind of equivalence between Russian and US actions in Syria. If opposition fighters vacate Aleppo (handing victory to Assad), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\">Labour suggests</a>, all will be well. Its script could have been written by the Kremlin.</p> <p>The challenge presented by Russia is one of the biggest facing the next US president. Some analysts say Putin is taking advantage of Obama\u2019s lame duck status to create \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in Syria. The Russian president is said to anticipate a further deterioration in bilateral relations if Hillary Clinton wins. The two have a history of personal dislike, dating back to Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. \u201cShe says she sees in him a cold-blooded, self-enriching KGB agent and a bully; he remembers how she appeared to encourage street protests against him in 2011,\u201d said analyst <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\">Leonid Bershidsky</a>. Speaking in August, Clinton described Putin as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotated/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism</a>\u201d \u2013 lumping him with Trump, German anti-immigrant xenophobes and hard-right populists such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>Assuming Trump loses, a Clinton administration has three possible courses of action. One is to acknowledge Putin has a fair case when he argues that the US, the EU and Nato ignored or trampled on Russia\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet era, accept that Crimea is lost and that Assad stays in power for the time being, and focus in future on pragmatic, one-off \u201ctransactional\u201d deals where interests coincide.</p> <p>A second approach is a longer-term variation on the first, containing Russia wherever possible, maintaining or toughening sanctions, and waiting for the departure of Putin and what some economists say will be Russia\u2019s inevitable economic collapse as its oil and gas runs out and international ostracism, corruption and a declining working-age population take their toll. The plan would be to re-set relations (again) with a post-Putin \u201cnew Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The third possibility, and one that seems most likely at this point given Clinton\u2019s policy positions, is that the US will move on to the front foot and purposefully confront Russia directly, not only in Syria but on a number of other areas, backed up by the possible use of military force.</p> <p>This prospect is fraught with danger, especially since Putin has shown repeatedly that he reacts badly to diktats and threats. When cornered, Putin does not back down. He escalates. He does not have a domestic electorate, critical parliament or independent media scrutiny to worry about. He disdains international opinion and international law. Despite last month\u2019s bust-up, Kerry and Lavrov met again on Saturday to try to agree another Syria ceasefire. But a lasting solution looks as far away as ever. If the past 15 years show anything, it is that Putin, like a marauding Red Army tank, has no reverse gear. Much in the Middle East, Europe and beyond now rides on what an untested Clinton, with an awful lot to prove, decides is the best way forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3/0_72_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line near Donetsk, Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line about 50km from Donetsk, Ukraine, as part of the demilitarisation agreement signed in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SYRIA</h2> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s decision not to intervene militarily after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons left the door open for Russia. By going to the aid of his long-term ally Assad, Putin saw a chance to expand Russian influence in the Middle East at American expense and secure military bases on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Fighting Islamic State terrorism was a secondary consideration. The US insists Assad must go, but its limited commitment so far means the non-jihadist opposition continues to struggle while civilians bear the brunt of the violence.</p> <h2>UKRAINE</h2> <p>Despite the US-orchestrated imposition of international sanctions on Russia, Putin shows no sign of reversing his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow\u2019s not-so-secret support for separatists in eastern Ukraine opposing the pro-western government in Kiev continues unabated, with renewed fighting reported last week. Peace efforts led by Germany in the so-called Minsk group have stalled. Given the US believes it is upholding an important principle of international law, a future Clinton administration is unlikely to recognise Russian-made \u201cfacts on</p> <p>the ground\u201d.</p> <h2>THE BALTIC FRONT<br><br></h2> <p>The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, the isolated enclave it controls on Poland\u2019s and Lithuania\u2019s border, is the latest move in a war of nerves along Europe\u2019s eastern flank. The Baltic sea has also become a contested area as Russian submarines and aircraft test western reactions. Nato has beefed up its defences, and Britain has pledged its support. But the uncomfortable question remains: would an American president</p> <p>go to war to defend Estonia?</p> <h2>CYBER <br>WARFARE<br></h2> <p>The US has formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to disrupt the American presidential electoral process. The suspicion is that Putin, who has been praised by Donald Trump, wants Hillary Clinton defeated and the credibility of the election result put in doubt. Trump has already claimed the poll is fixed against him. Putin denies involvement. But the affair resembles previous cyber attacks on countries that were blamed on government-backed Russian hackers.</p> <h2>THE UNITED NATIONS<br></h2> <p>The US and Putin\u2019s Russia have clashed repeatedly in the UN Security Council, most recently over Moscow\u2019s veto of a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The standoff has raised wider concerns about the effectiveness of the UN system when permanent members appear permanently at odds and its aid convoys are blown up. Russia is accused by the US of ignoring international law and of possible war crimes, and there are moves to refer it to the International Criminal Court.</p>",

Muslims are often labelled as oppressed or having boundaries on what they do, but it\u2019s not like that. People are really waking up to the opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, said Mirza, big brands have been cautious in targeting the Muslim market: \u201cThose that have offered modest fashion items, such as H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer and Uniqlo, have faced a backlash in the media.\u201d</p> <p>M&amp;S attracted criticism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/five-reasons-wear-burkini-annoy-french-cannes-mayor-muslim\" title=\"\">for its burkini range </a>earlier this year, even before the wave of bans on modest swimwear imposed by the mayors of French seaside towns. \u201cI understand how difficult it is&#xa0;for big brands. But they are taking tentative baby steps into the market,\u201d said Mirza.</p> <p>One mainstream brand that is exhibiting at the expo is Asda, which \u2013 like other major supermarket chains \u2013 sells halal meat and food products. Major multinational suppliers, such as Kellogg\u2019s, Unilever and Nestl\u00e9, have established halal lines to serve this emerging market.</p> <p>At Artisan, which won three awards in its first year, Imdad welcomed the growing awareness of big brands of the potential of the Muslim market. \u201cThey\u2019re jumping on the bandwagon, realising Muslims have money and want to spend it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great.

We now have six projects in five schools. Around 100 children have been involved, many having achieved GCSE and A-level in music, and several have secured places at some of the top universities, including Oxford.</p> <p>For many years we have funded tickets to enable mainly primary school children to experience live musical concerts \u2013 up to 120 at a time.</p> <p>What is really worrying is that it is noticeable that local schools have significantly reduced their staffing and spending on music because of continued Department for Education pressures on budgets and the focus on league tables. Music is disadvantaged in the current model, Progress&#xa0;8. As a result, maths and English are prioritised because they attract double points. The study of A-level music is being centralised and not available in a range of schools as it used to be.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the current government\u2019s education policy is short-changing children whose aptitude is towards the arts and music.

Amid the chaos of the traffic, there is that rare thing: silence.</p> <p>Over the past two months, at least a dozen cities in the western state of Maharashtra have exploded in an unprecedented outburst of popular uprising from the Maratha community, made up of the landowning farmer castes. The Marathas comprise a third of Maharashtra\u2019s 114 million population. <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-reservation-hc-gives-state-six-weeks-to-compile-data-supporting-its-case/story-LlKYFOwDzCBjjkig7R6WAJ.html\">Their marches</a>, which started with a few hundred thousand protesters, now gather millions in a different city almost every other weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/pink-ladoo-project-handing-out-sweets-challenging-gender-prejudice-india\">How pink sweets are challenging gender prejudice in south Asian communities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marches are silent until the end, when the crowd stands to sing the national anthem before dispersing. During the demonstrations, young women approach politicians with a list of demands. Organisers say the biggest march will be held in Mumbai, the state\u2019s capital and the country\u2019s financial heart, in December.</p> <p>The silent protests began in July after the gang rape and murder of a 15-year-old Maratha girl in the village of Kopardi, allegedly by \u201cuntouchable\u201d Dalit men. The incident stirred up anger in the Maratha community, who argued that the police and media were neglecting the case in the interests of political correctness.</p> <p>In India, for generations, low-caste Dalit people were considered \u201cdirty\u201d in the Hindu caste system and were not allowed to eat, marry or mix with higher castes. Lower castes were forced into menial or unholy jobs such as cleaning the sewers or working with leather. High-caste people would have to undergo a cleansing ritual if they accidentally touched a Dalit. After independence in 1947, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/india-caste-system-70-anniversary-independence-day-untouchables\">caste was formally abolished</a>, but continued to be one of the most important identity markers, especially in rural India.</p> <p>Maratha activists argue that if the girl had been Dalit, and her alleged rapists and killers had been high-caste men, the narrative would be far more appealing to politicians and journalists, who want to be seen as champions of the underdog Dalit community. Discrimination, they say, has now swung in the opposite direction: Dalits enjoy the benefits of affirmative action in jobs and universities, while farmers face neglect from successive governments.</p> <p>\u201cThe media show that the victims are always Dalit, and the perpetrators are all Maratha,\u201d says Dyanesh Maharao, a Maratha activist. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really like that. When that poor girl died, the police didn\u2019t even bother to file a report until this week, almost three months after the attack.\u201d</p> <p>The Marathas are so neglected that when the first march happened, in the city of Aurangabad, none of the major local newspaper or television outlets bothered to turn up, says Bhaiya Patil, a 28-year-old activist who has become the social media manager of the movement. \u201cThere were 500,000 people in the street and no one was interested. There was no footage, no cameras, no coverage. That\u2019s why we turned to social media. We started posting our own pictures and video and suddenly everyone started listening. It gave us our voice.\u201d</p> <p>People come from all over Maharashtra for the marches. Some drive, others take buses and travel hundreds of miles to show solidarity. \u201cPeople come with whatever they have. Some donate money, others bring bottles of water to distribute to the crowds. Some of the farmers, who are very poor, can\u2019t give anything, so they bring rice, because it\u2019s the only thing they have to contribute,\u201d says Patil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41fb3024ee13250a7cbea01d7bbb919560a2970b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41fb3024ee13250a7cbea01d7bbb919560a2970b/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baramati protesters speak out at the end of the march.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baramati protesters speak out at the end of the march.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bhaiya Patil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The silent marches have quickly turned a centuries-old caste issue into a <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/india/maratha-kranti-morcha-owes-its-success-to-social-media-not-mainstream-media-3022242.html\">social media sensation</a>. Live feeds from the marches quickly populate Facebook and Twitter. A drone is sent up to capture images of the crowds from the sky. For Patil and his army of 2,000 Twitter users, who each have multiple accounts, it\u2019s easy to turn a tweet into a trend. \u201cSocial media has really made these marches what they are. It has brought the Maratha people together,\u201d he says. Their demands go far beyond wanting the hangman\u2019s noose for the alleged killers of the girl from Kopardi. \u201cThe Marathas\u2019 voice has been suppressed for a long time. It was a divided community, but what happened in the village united us,\u201d says Patil.</p> <p>Marathas are traditionally landowning farmers. Their status would have meant they were much richer and more powerful than the Dalit castes. But the rapid increase of India\u2019s population since independence means that, over generations, large farmlands have been divided into smaller plots to share between brothers, leaving each Maratha son with less land to farm than his father had.</p> <p>Four consecutive years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/27/india-drought-migrants-head-to-cities-in-desperate-search-for-water\">drought</a> have ruined harvests and left farmers without water even to drink or wash. Marathwada, a Maratha-dominated region of Maharashtra, was one of the worst hit places in India. Doctors delayed surgeries and schools had to close down; in many villages water was available only once in nine days.</p> <p>Without banks to borrow from, farmers had to turn to loan sharks and borrow at high interest rates, which increased financial instability. Maratha farmers were severely hit, and the effects rippled through the entire community, even those who had moved away from their villages to the cities. Some farmers took their lives.</p> <p>The marches are silent, but their demands are loud and clear. The movement brings together the economic and social grievances of millions of people across Maharashtra. They want reforms in the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which they argue is unfairly used against higher-caste communities.</p> <p>They want to be included in the list of \u201cother backward castes\u201d, which gives welfare benefits to listed castes and which politicians change every election season to win votes. The Marathas also want loan repayments cancelled and a fund for drought-hit farmers.</p> <p>\u201cAt one of the first marches, we saw that many women had come, too, and we didn\u2019t want any violence,\u201d says Patil. \u201cSo we decided the marches would be silent. That way they would be peaceful. We don\u2019t want to disturb the peace of the cities, but we want our demands to be heard. We even have a team of volunteers at the back of the procession, who sweep up the streets after the crowds pass through. We want people to say, look, five million people came and went, but not one stone is out of place.\u201d</p> <p>The marches bring together various Maratha factions. Pravin Gaikwad, the chief of the Sambhaji brigade, a Maratha activist group, calls the protests \u201cthe Maratha Arab spring\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an awakening in the Maratha community,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd one of the main reasons is that our own leaders have failed us. Politicians such as Sharad Pawar [chief minister of Maharashtra], for example, are known as strong Maratha leaders. But in reality they do little for the Marathas. They go to all the big functions and festivals of the other communities so they can win their votes, but they never come to our events, they never ask us what we want. We have been overlooked. Nobody, no politician, has done anything for us.\u201d</p> <p>Desertion by the political class is part of the problem. Even worse for the Maratha farmer, Gaikwad says, are the effects of globalisation and environmentalism. \u201cIt is very simple. Say I need to build a dam to irrigate my fields. To build that dam, I need to cut down a forest. I understand that global warming is a problem, but without that dam, my children won\u2019t have food to eat. This is a big problem for farmers.</p> <p>\u201cThe rich countries \u2013 America, Europe and Australia \u2013 they have already developed. After developing they figured out that global warming was a big problem. So now, they are blocking our development. The rich countries are making laws through international green tribunals, and putting pressure on us to reduce our carbon emissions.</p> <p>\u201cThere are trees literally in the middle of our highways that we can\u2019t cut down just because they are so old. It means there are dozens of deaths on that road every year, just to save that old tree. Our country is an agricultural country. But nobody cares about the farmers. We have put up our demands, and we will march until they are met. The politicians are not helping. Now they\u2019ve started paying attention, asking to meet with us. But what is the use of having tea with the chief minister? We want our farmers to be looked after and we will keep marching until they are.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A little more than two years ago, I was in the kitchen with my friend, Julia Jones, in a state of helpless sorrow. My father, John, was still alive then, although he was in his desolating last stages. His slow-motion dying had gone on for months and would continue for several more. While it endured we half wanted him gone, and when it ended, of course we wanted him back \u2013 a living ghost rather than a dead man who might haunt us but would never return.</p> <p>My father\u2019s drawn-out death lasted nine months: he went into hospital as someone living well with dementia; he came out quite lost and broken, and all the love in the world couldn\u2019t have found him or put him together again.</p> <p>It was Julia who suggested (and why hadn\u2019t I thought of this before; why hadn\u2019t it been obvious?) that carers of people living with dementia should have the same right to accompany them in hospital as the parents of sick children: that they should be welcomed by the bedside, to feed them, talk to them, hold their hand, stroke their hair, meet their gaze, be their memory, keep them safe, take them home whole. And after my father died, it was the <em>Observer</em> \u2013 which had 50 years earlier championed the demand by parents to be able do just that for their children \u2013 which gave me a place where my voice could be heard, and where sorrow, guilt and regret could be redeemed into change and rescue.</p> <p>My father was beyond all help, but there are thousands of men and women with dementia who go into hospital each year and who come out diminished, through no fault of nurses and doctors, but because hospital is a hazardous place for those who are frail.</p> <p>It was nearly two years since I wrote the piece in the <em>Observer</em> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/29/nicci-gerrard-father-dementia-hospital-care-elderly\">launched John\u2019s Campaign</a>. Founded and run by Julia and me, its aim is simply that <a href=\"http://johnscampaign.org.uk/#/\">carers should be made welcome in hospital</a>. Its beginnings were in a kitchen, but it is now part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/25/dementia-need-not-be-a-death-sentence\">a great movement </a>for more enlightened and compassionate care for those with dementia.</p> <p>At a conference last Wednesday dedicated to the campaign, tribute was paid to the paper\u2019s honourable tradition of giving a voice to the voiceless, power to the powerless, hope to those in despair. The hall was full of generous people who had helped us on our journey \u2013 people with influence and connections, NHS leaders, consultants, chief nurses, heads of charities \u2013 but at the heart of the conference were the people whose voices are not usually heard, whose sorrow and anger and passion get drowned out in the great noise of the world.</p> <p>As James Munro, chief executive of Patient Opinion, said: \u201cListening is the beating heart of healthcare\u201d and in the act of listening \u201cboth speaker and listener are changed\u201d.</p> <p>In a session entitled \u201cVoices\u201d, 10 people, many of whom had never spoken in public before, courageously told of their experiences and were listened to. Sometimes what they said was hard to hear. Their stories, both the ones of anguish and the ones of kindness and optimism, illustrated why we started the campaign.</p> <p>Tommy Dunne, who lives with dementia, described what it feels like to be in hospital, a \u201cstrange place surrounded by strangers\u201d, where something tight squeezes your arm and something cold is put into your mouth; where a chicken pie is placed in front of you and then taken away, a mug of tea loudly offered and then removed; where, startled and scared, \u201cyou become dehydrated and delirium sets in \u2026 and the quick decline in your health begins. Yet no one knows or understands why.\u201d</p> <p>Several carers \u2013 partners, children, grandchildren, people who, as one of them had it, were the \u201cvoice and the memory\u201d of the person with dementia \u2013 spoke about their experiences of heartbreak.</p> <p>Teresa Canale-Parola\u2019s partner, John, was 60 when he died. The hospital in which he spent his final days was too far away for her and her daughters to visit regularly, and \u2013 in spite of their battle to get this reversed \u2013 there were strict visiting hours, so that for much of the time he was quite alone. In his dementia, John had become violent and was placed under a mental health order. He was medicated and, even when he was placid, he was restrained.</p> <p>He stopped eating and drinking. Soon he could no longer walk. Thirty-five days after his admission, Teresa had a call to say his health had deteriorated: she and her daughters found John, by now starved and badly dehydrated, \u201crestrained in a chair, dying\u201d . It was a brutal way for a man to go.</p> <p>The death of someone with advanced dementia can be a sad blessing for those who have loved them, restoring that person to all the selves they have ever been \u2013 but a bad or lonely death makes mourning painfully difficult, full of anger and regret and terrible failure, of almost unendurable memories of distress. Not to be with them, not to comfort them, not to rescue them from abandonment and fear, not to accompany them up to the threshold.</p> <p>Alongside stories of anguish, there were ones of hope: a junior geriatrician (of whom I am the proud aunt) spoke about being part of a cultural change in hospitals. Liz Charalambous \u2013 a nurse who has been fighting to get unrestricted visiting for carers for years \u2013 said that \u201cone day we will look back in astonishment\u201d at the time when carers were not made welcome.</p> <p>Rebecca Myers, a health professional whose mother had dementia at a cruelly young age, spoke movingly about the \u201cpragmatic empathy\u201d that lies at the heart of healthcare: \u201cOne human being connected to another, in the moment, in the environment, for a shared purpose \u2013 to take care, of and with, each other.\u201d</p> <p>And Theresa Clarke, a former nurse from Northern Ireland now living with dementia, spoke with clarity and spirit about how people with the condition \u201cneed to be part of the conversation \u2026 not just spoken about, like an object, but talked with and to\u201d. She certainly did not like her diagnosis, she said, and being left in hospital was \u201cdeadly, like being in deep space\u201d, but she urged us all to remember that \u201cwe can live well with dementia, we can still contribute to society, our family and the world beyond\u201d.</p> <p>Seeing Theresa, this diminutive firecracker of a woman, hearing her talk, hearing Tommy\u2019s vivid account, was a forceful reminder that people with dementia \u2013 who we often reduce to statistics, to costs, to problems, even (horrible words) to \u201cbed blockers\u201d, are not \u201cthem\u201d but \u201cus\u201d, valuable and human and precious, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/28/alzheimers-orwell-prize-societys-ghosts-johns-campaign\">stories to tell and voices to be listened to</a>.</p> <p>The session ended with Kate Kellaway, of the <em>Observer</em>, beautifully and tenderly describing her father\u2019s last weeks. Her words, republished here, illustrate the ideals of our campaign and show how, up and down the country, nurses and doctors are bringing extraordinary compassion and empathy to the lives of people who are vulnerable, and to their deaths: to live as well as we possibly can; to have, as they say in Ireland, a gentle passing.</p> <h2>\u2018My dad\u2019s care made us believe in the goodness of people\u2019<br></h2> <p>My father died five months ago at Whittington hospital in Archway, north London \u2013 he\u2019d had a fall, broken a hip, had an operation, recovered and been discharged. Then he had another fall and had to be readmitted and it turned out he\u2019d had a silent heart attack. He was 90. He had for some time suffered from chronic kidney disease.</p> <p>So \u2013 a medley of misfortunes, including, towards the end, dementia. He had an intermittent belief he was back in the war and that there was a soldier in the bed next to him \u2013 he was determined to know the soldier\u2019s name. I helplessly selected \u201cJim\u201d, which seemed to pacify Dad. But, of course there was no bed and no soldier other than Dad himself, gallantly fighting on.</p> <p>When it was clear he was dying, the Whittington found him a room to himself. And that was just the first of the blessings of being in that hospital during Dad\u2019s final three weeks.</p> <p>The care was, in every way, exemplary. The staff were happy to waive visiting hours without question. We could come and go as we pleased and sit up all night with Dad if that was what we wanted to do. The number of visitors at any one time was left to our discretion.</p> <p>My brother, sister and I were bowled over by one nurse in particular and the compassionate intelligence with which she grasped the emotional picture. Sam Hunt talked to Dad with warmth, respect and gentle humour. She tried to find out how he was feeling. At one point, he admitted he was frightened and she listened, smiled and reassured. And she reassured us too \u2013 she made us believe in the goodness of which people are capable.</p> <p>The doctor, Dr Mitchell, was outstanding \u2013 a model of intelligence, sympathy and tact. She was exceptionally clear in her information \u2013 impressive, in particular, in telling us what she was not sure of as well as informing us about whatever she knew.</p> <p>Towards the end of his life, Dad had given us instructions about not prolonging his life unnecessarily \u2013 we had power of attorney. The staff listened to us but as Dad became less and less able to speak, Dr Mitchell never neglected to address him first: \u201cMr Kellaway, I\u2019m just talking to your daughters about how we can try to make you more comfortable\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The palliative care team was first rate: educating us in the art, or science, of dying comfortably.</p> <p>And when Dad gently breathed his last \u2013 it seemed to me that it resembled what a friend of mine once described as pushing your boat out \u2013 I was with him, and when he was gone, it was the nurse and doctor I embraced. They had retained the necessary professional distance and yet had allowed us to feel, if only for a moment, that they were \u2013 almost \u2013 family.</p> <p><strong>Kate Kellaway</strong></p>",
  "<p>If Scotland\u2019s players adopt a similarly confident approach as their manager at Wembley next month, tales of this nation\u2019s latest qualifying woe may be hugely exaggerated. Whether through the belief that he now has nothing to lose or otherwise, Strachan has emerged from the aftermath of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovakia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">harrowing 3-0 loss</a> in Slovakia to speak in enthusiastic terms about what comes next.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I just think I am the best man to go down there with the group and get a result,\u201d Strachan insisted.</p> <p>Plenty of people disagree, of course. Tuesday night\u2019s reverse in Trnava means the Scots have taken just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-2018-qualifiers/table\" title=\"\">four points from three matches</a> against Malta, Lithuania and Slovakia. There is a widespread understanding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/12/gordon-strachan-owes-scotland-step-down\" title=\"\">Strachan will depart the international scene</a> if his players do not return from England with victory. Evidence of progress is sparse, arguably to the point of not existing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovakia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\">Slovakia sink Scotland to pile pressure on Gordon Strachan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Strachan has benefited from a curious narrative. That is, it should somehow be entirely his decision whether to remain in his post as opposed to the Scottish FA applying pressure. Scotland have gone from supposedly needing four points from October\u2019s double header to the latest \u201cwhat if\u201d surrounding a Wembley victory.</p> <p>\u201cI love this job,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cI love working with the people, I love bumping into supporters and I get a great response from them. I love dealing with my backroom staff, with the SFA staff. It\u2019s a fantastic, fantastic job.</p> <p>\u201cDo I fear the sack? No, I don\u2019t fear the sack because I\u2019m 59, I\u2019m all right, I\u2019ve got loads to do in my life. I have absolutely no fear of the sack because life is good for me. I live in a good world. The only thing I want to do is make people happy.</p> <p>\u201cDo I fear not working with these players? Yes. Do I fear not working with the staff? Yes. I do not fear getting the sack because really, when I wanted to do this \u2026 I\u2019ve been so lucky in football to get to places that people only dream of in football.</p> <p>\u201cMy thought was how do we get these players, this staff, these fans, everybody to a tournament. That would be the disappointing thing, my only fear is not being able to achieve and help people get to places that I know it\u2019s a fantastic thing and fantastic place to be. So getting the sack? There is no fear of that. I would be selfish if I ever did think: \u2018I don\u2019t need this.\u2019 That would be really selfish.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through it all as a player, when your back is against the wall. I\u2019ve had it as assistant manager. As a manager. There\u2019s been times when life seems a bit harsh. We are the lucky ones. The ones who can play the game, get together, be a group and enjoy the challenge of taking it on again.\u201d</p> <p>Inevitably, the Scottish buildup to 11 November in London will largely focus on Strachan himself. \u201cI can understand people will say that, that is what you have to deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a real problem to me because when I get back into the environment with the players and the enthusiasm and professionalism that they bring I lose myself. I have to make sure it doesn\u2019t affect them because sometimes players can feel for a manager too much and that can affect them.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s key recurring failing is hardly difficult to spot. The loss of cheap goals undermined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/09/scotland-euro-2016-gordon-strachan\" title=\"\">hopes of qualification for Euro 2016</a>, a problem that has reappeared during the opening stages of this World Cup campaign. Strachan has to reassess how to deploy an obdurate defence against the caretaker Gareth Southgate\u2019s side. \u201cEngland always need a result badly with the pressure that is put on them,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cThe two teams need a result badly. We have set ourselves back; we are over par compared to what you might have thought we should have done, so we need to start getting birdies.</p> <p>\u201cLooking at it now, it will benefit us greatly if we can make sure we don\u2019t lose a goal down there because at this moment in time we have to score two at least to win a game of football. I know there were games we won 1-0 but we had to rely on goalkeepers.\u201d</p> <p>To continue with his own golfing analogy, Strachan is rapidly running out of holes. Just as Scotland would always cherish victory over England, their manager categorically requires it.</p>",

  "<p>The old adage in sport is that it\u2019s better to be lucky than good, and it applies as well to being a treasurer. Regardless of whether or not you consider Peter Costello a good treasurer, he sure as heck was a lot luckier than those who followed him. But now Scott Morrison may himself be about to get lucky.</p> <p>Once the mining boom of the early 2000s kicked into gear, so too did large amounts of revenue \u2013 but, importantly, it was unexpected amounts of revenue.</p> <p>Each year, the Treasury makes estimates of how much revenue it will raise, based on certain economic parameters such as employment and wage growth (good for estimating income tax) and the value of the Australian dollar and of the prices of commodities such as iron ore and coal (good for company tax).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/coal-price-rally-raises-australian-hopes-but-it-wont-last-say-economists\">Coal price rally raises Australian hopes \u2013 but it won't last, say economists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the six years from 2002-03 to 2007-08, the Treasury continually underestimated how much tax it would raise, because it continually underestimated just how much better those parameters would be.</p> <p>For example, purely due to the parameters being better than originally expected, revenue for the 2005-06 budget was $33.7bn more than originally expected, and in the final two years of Peter Costello\u2019s stint as treasurer, the final revenue result finished respectively $50.3bn and $62.5bn better off.</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t just because the Treasury was being wrong three years in advance.</p> <p> In between Costello delivering his budget speech for the 2006-07 budget and the final result, an extra $26.2bn of unexpected revenue came into the government\u2019s coffers.</p> <p>Think on that.</p> <p>In the space of a year, an extra $26.2bn of revenue was raised, not due to increasing the tax rate or adding new taxes, but purely because things turned out better than was expected.</p> <p>Now that is luck.</p> <p>In the six years from 2002-02 to 2007-08 an extra $188bn in revenue was raised due to the economy and commodity prices performing better than originally anticipated.</p> <p> Then came the global financial crisis. </p> <p>Between Wayne Swan delivering the 2008-09 budget and its final result, purely because the economy slowed, $19.2bn less revenue was raised than expected.</p> <p>And it was not just Swan who was unlucky \u2013 Joe Hockey suffered as well.</p> <p>In the seven years from 2009-10 to 2015-16, a total of $196bn revenue was written down because each year the economy kept performing worse than the Treasury thought it would.</p> <p>The main reason was the collapse of iron ore and coal prices. From September 2011 to the end of 2015, the price of iron ore fell 76% and coal by 58%.</p> <p>Scott Morrison, however, might find himself rather luckier than Wayne Swan or Joe Hockey.</p> <p> \u200b A restriction of coal production in China and an improvement in building construction in China \u200b has caused an increase in demand for coal at the same time supply has been reduced. This has meant the price for coking coal (used in steel production) from Australia has risen from $93 a tonne for the September quarter to $200 a tonne in the December quarter.</p> <p>Deloitte Access Economics estimates that for every US$1 a tonne price increase, revenue increases by $65m.

In November 2007, Patrick Walsh was on a tour in Isla Guadalupe when a shark wedged itself through the bars of the cage. Walsh, like Chan, used an escape hatch to exit the cage while waiting for the shark to get out. </p> <p>\u201cIt just snapped this cage to pieces, it was like it was made out of balsa wood,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2obQ4kTNcc\">Walsh told Animal Planet. </a></p> <p>Yet Walsh said the incident would not deter him from his love for sharks. \u201cI was back in the water 15 minutes after the accident,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Chan had a similar reaction.

  "<p>They went to Kigali to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and take 0.5C out of future global warming, and the 170 countries that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\" title=\"\">successfully negotiated an amendment to the Montreal protocol treaty</a> agreed to get rid of 90% of them. Not bad for four days and three long nights of hard work.</p> <p>The Kigali deal on HFCs is in fact fiendishly complicated and has taken years to negotiate in various technical and political forums. The final agreement, announced on Saturday morning caps and reduces the use of HFCs in a gradual process beginning in 2019.</p> <p>More than 100 developing countries will start taking action from 2024, a date that has sparked concern from some groups that the changes will be implemented too slowly. A small group of countries, including India, Pakistan and some Gulf states, pushed for and secured a later start \u2013 2028 \u2013 on the grounds that their economies need time to grow. But that is three years earlier than India, the world\u2019s third-worst polluter, had first proposed.</p> <p>The result was achieved thanks to several factors: an ambitious scheme to give countries different time scales in which to phase out HFCs; major chemical and food companies accepting change; the determination of US secretary of state John Kerry to agree a plan before the presidential election; and developing countries agreeing to invest heavily in new technologies.</p> <p>Rich countries, including the US, Japan and Europe, will start phasing out synthetic HFCs in 2019, China in 2024, and India and less ambitious countries in 2028. The deal reflects countries\u2019 differing levels of development. Because nearly all HFCs are made by a handful of giant western chemical companies and are used in air-conditioning units and cooling systems made and sold in rich countries, it was relatively easy for their governments to put pressure on a single global industry. Alternatives such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO<sup>2</sup> are widely available, safe, approved and on the market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"949bb4d70e188b88e38714c31e42e656e9688175\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/949bb4d70e188b88e38714c31e42e656e9688175/0_250_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HFCs are mainly used in air-conditioning systems in rich countries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HFCs are mainly used in air-conditioning systems in rich countries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitra Louvrou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worldwide use of HFCs has soared in the past decade as rapidly growing countries such as China and India adopted air-conditioning in homes, offices and cars. But HFC gases are thousands of times more destructive to the climate than carbon dioxide, and scientists say their growing use threatens to undermine the Paris accord, agreed last year by 195 countries.</p> <p>The deal will make little difference to rich countries. The EU had already started to phase out HFCs and since 2011 had banned their use in cars. Many global food and drink companies \u2013 Coca Cola, Pepsico and Unilever among them \u2013 have already started to replace fluorinated gases with climate-friendly and natural refrigerants, which are more energy-efficient and can save money.</p> <p>The new agreement is welcomed by many chemical and manufacturing companies because it gives them green kudos and market advantage over inferior products made in poor countries.</p> <p>But it was much harder for India, China and other developing countries to strike a deal. Their companies have relied on old refrigeration and coolant technologies, and will now have to invest in R&amp;D and upgrade or replace factories and equipment.</p> <p>Just as in wider climate talks, they accepted that they are part of the problem and may be on track to become the main HFC users, but insisted that, like climate change itself, this is primarily a western problem foisted on them.</p> <p>The deal keeps the Paris agreement on track and is a vital step towards reducing global emissions. Coming on the heels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\" title=\"\">a new deal to cap aviation emissions</a>, and just weeks before the shipping industry sets about cleaning up its act and UN climate talks resume, it is overwhelmingly positive.</p> <p>But the Kigali meeting need never have happened. HFCs were widely recognised as powerful greenhouse gases many years ago, and though governments deliberately missed the chance to eliminate them in 1987, they agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and protect the ozone layer.</p> <p>The ozone hole is slowly recovering, and HFCs are now seen as just a small part of the climate change problem. If only it took just a few nights of negotiations to eliminate fossil fuels, too.</p>",

Inevitably they come up against people like me who say, \u2018Sorry, that is not working and I am not prepared to do that\u2019 because I don\u2019t think it will work. So there was a tension.

Now it\u2019s 89%. Secondaries 66%, now it\u2019s 78%.

He was not, for instance, in favour of getting rid of all local education authorities or forcing all schools to become academies, as Gove\u2019s successor, Nicky Morgan, tried to do earlier this year before she dropped the plan because of huge opposition. \u201cI didn\u2019t see much point in banging headteachers over the head who were running very successful schools within a local authority and saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to become an academy\u2019.

Wilshaw recalls thinking as a young teacher in the 1960s how wrong it was that the job of education secretary was not seen as a top Cabinet slot. Even in the 1980s that was still the case. \u201cI remember Ken Baker saying to me that when he was transferred from the Department of Environment to Education it felt like a demotion, like moving from Arsenal to Charlton Athletic.\u201d</p> <p>Now, however, as he prepares to leave Ofsted, he sees big dangers on the horizon. One is that too many multi-academy trusts are poorly run, failing to intervene when their schools are underperforming, replicating the failures of local authorities.</p> <p>Some have built up financial surpluses, and spent the money on \u201cconsultancies\u201d not children. A few who run them have abused the system, awarding contracts with schools to their own companies. \u201cThere are some rogues out there who use the greater freedoms that are given to headteachers and chief executives to line their own pockets. We have seen examples of that.\u201d</p> <p>Even more worrying to him, though, is the determination of new prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">Theresa May to expand the number of grammar schools</a>. Wilshaw believes this risks reversing all the progress of recent years, and creating social division as well.</p> <p>He turns May\u2019s own rhetoric about wanting to govern for everyone against her. \u201cI came into teaching and I came into this job to raise standards for all children, not just for the few. By their very nature, grammar schools are for the few, otherwise why have them?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Which great education system has selection at 11?

Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s end of conference speech is supposed to be her most important of the week, but south of the border her speech on Thursday threatening a second independence referendum if Scotland gets forced out of the single market is the one that people will remember from this week. It may well be that in Scotland it is the one that resonates too.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Hello, Andrew. Firstly, thanks very much for your coverage. I think we've now hit a point where the reactions need to be divided into 'domestic' and 'UK' reactions. In Scotland, the speech on Thursday was just a clear statement of what we already knew: there was a bit more detail but no change in Scottish govt policy since the morning after the Brexit vote. But in London you haven't been following that debate, so it was big news to you. </p> <p>For Scottish people the use of the word 'home rule' today was an intriguing straw in the wind, to me at least way more interesting than Thursday's announcements. That's parking the SNP's tanks on Labour's lawn and claiming to be the heirs of devolution, while merging the notions of indy /FFA / devolution. And for us, hospitals and the care system aren't boring compared to the indy/not-indy debate: it's what governments (and nations) are <i>for</i>. The chance to pursue more inclusive, i.e. non-Tory, policies is the reason why people actually want independence or home rule in the first place.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>FFA is full fiscal autonomy.</p> <p>There were two references to home rule in the speech. This one:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I know there is still much to do.</p> <p>Much to do in the next phase of Scotland\u2019s home rule journey.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this one.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our home rule journey has given us new confidence. </p> </blockquote> <p>That is all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for your comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58025ac8e4b047a4eaafcd3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T17:05:56.906Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Gavin Kelly,</strong> chief executive of the Resolution Trust and a deputy chief of staff to Gordon Brown in Downing Street, also thinks Nicola Sturgeon has discovered her inner Blairite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GavinJKelly1/status/787326708194082816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Choice &amp; flexibility in childcare.

Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s end of conference speech is supposed to be her most important of the week, but south of the border her speech on Thursday threatening a second independence referendum if Scotland gets forced out of the single market is the one that people will remember from this week. It may well be that in Scotland it is the one that resonates most too.</p> <p>After more than nine years in office in Scotland it is getting harder (although by no means impossible, given the limits on the Scottish parliament\u2019s power) for the SNP to explain away poor public services, and there was evidence of that today, in Derek Mackay\u2019s Today interview (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5801f112e4b0160123895fd9#block-5801f112e4b0160123895fd9\"> 10.42am)</a> and the reception John Swinney got at an education fringe (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-58022583e4b047a4eaafcc3c#block-58022583e4b047a4eaafcc3c\"> 1.50pm)</a>. And you could detect some evidence of this too in Sturgeon\u2019s speech, which was notably free of boasting. Instead it was pragmatic and workmanlike (and probably all the better for that).</p> <p>At the heart of the speech was a series of solid, but mainstream and detail-light policies. The best passage came when Sturgeon was talking about failings in the care service, and the need for children to be loved. (\u2018My view is simple: every young person deserves to be loved.\u201d) She tied this in well with her theme of \u201cinclusion\u201d, although a lot of her comments on children in care could have come straight from a speech by David Cameron on life chances. The announcement on NHS funding raised the question of what hospital units might have be to be cut as part of this reconfiguration. And, for someone from England, the announcement on childcare was interesting because of the tacit admission that choice at present is not a strong feature of Scottish childcare provision. Championing choice as she did sounded a bit Blairite, although of course Sturgeon would be horrified if anyone saw it like that.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon announced plans to extend the small business bonus, so that from April an extra 100,000 business premises do not pay business rates.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-58023f28e4b01ffb8ffcbf52#block-58023f28e4b01ffb8ffcbf52\">3.38pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She announced a reform of the way childcare services are provided, with an emphasis on giving parents more choice.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5802402de4b047a4eaafccbf#block-5802402de4b047a4eaafccbf\">3.43pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She announced an independent and far-reaching review of the care system.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5802418de4b047a4eaafccc8#block-5802418de4b047a4eaafccc8\">3.49pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She announced an extra \u00a3500m for primary care by 2021.</strong> This will happen because the proportion of health spending going on primary care will be increased, up to 11%.

He thinks it\u2019s a flawed idea. Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First of all, the taxation burden referred to in the motion is a matter for local authorities, not individual schools, with councils paying business rates on all schools under their control. Charitable status would therefore represent a significant saving for local authorities which could certainly free up more money for education spending. So far so good.</p> <p>The trouble is that business rates are paid to the Scottish Government which also provides the vast majority of councils\u2019 cash. Charitable status for around 100 private schools costs the Scottish government about \u00a310m a year, so imagine the figure for 2500 state schools.</p> <p>If the government could promise not to claw back this money by reducing education funding then that would be one thing, but the money will surely have to come from somewhere.</p> <p>Furthermore, if the government is indeed willing to finance a significant increase in education spending \u2014 such as would be achieved by non-domestic rates exemptions \u2014 then why not simply hand over the money right now?</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58022748e4b047a4eaafcc40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T13:02:28.480Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more on the debate earlier on the vote to give charitable status to state schools in Scotland.

By educating their children at private schools they benefit from about \u00a390m of tax breaks annually. </p> <p>Effectively we have a situation just now where the state subsidises educational segregation and class privilege. The system as it stands also perpetuates educational inequality and that has a knock on effect on child poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>He highlighted the case of Fettes College, where fees are around \u00a324,000 a year, which he said benefited from an 80% reduction in non-domestic rates while providing bursaries for 2% of pupils. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The system at the moment means that elitist private schools which serve the rich, the privileged and those that are already advantaged in life\u2019s race enjoy charitable status while state schools serving the wider population, which undoubtedly provide a public benefit, do not. </p> <p>It is time for state schools to be treated equally with private schools. It is time for our hard-pressed state schools to have this glaring anomaly removed, it\u2019s time for a level playing field for Scotland\u2019s children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Several delegates said it would be better just to remove charitable status from schools. One of them, <strong>Peter Henderson</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re going about this the wrong way round. Remove charitable status for private schools to level the playing field. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Sutherland revealed that his branch of Newington and Southside had twice put forward a draft resolution calling for the removal of charitable status for private schools but it had not got through the SNP\u2019s standing orders and agenda committee. </p> <p>Sutherland also said the Scottish government has rejected removing charitable status from private schools. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A couple of years ago a young lady through the petitions mechanisms through the Scottish parliament lobbied the Scottish government and the Scottish parliament to have charitable status removed. </p> <p>It was rejected because our Scottish government said there was insufficient evidence for a review of the charitable legislation relating to private schools.

But that is an almighty if. Britain\u2019s leading psephologist, <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/boundary-changes-which-mps-stand-to-lose-their-seats\">John Curtice</a>, kicked off the discussion [at a Prospect fringe at the conference] by summarising the polling on independence since the Brexit vote, which many nationalists had hoped would steel Scots\u2014who voted to stay in Europe, and now face being dragged out by English votes\u2014to make the split with the UK that they had ducked from making two years ago. Curtice, however, had dispiriting news. Few Scots, he said, cared all that much about Europe, and in fact a significant chunk of SNP voters had actually voted \u201cLeave.\u201d Yes, some people\u2014perhaps one in 10 of all \u201cNo\u201d voters in 2014\u2014were now more inclined to vote for independence next time around, but a rather similarly-sized proportion of 2014 \u201cYes\u201d voters had gone the other way. Either they preferred to be part of a Britain that was out of the EU, or they were increasingly nervous about the economics in the uncertain post-Brexit environment. Put it all together, and Scotland has barely swung at all.</p> <p>The SNP MP Kirsty Blackman was frank in admitting that here the party faces phenomenal challenges with the sequencing of the referendum, in particular. If it rushed now\u2014to exploit the full shock of the Brexit vote moment and the cross-border division that it revealed\u2014London would be able to pretend that it would deliver all sorts of things from its negotiations with the EU. It might be impossible to secure both border control and single market access at the same time, but London could\u2014for the moment\u2014continue to bluff its way through and insist that it can have the best of all possible worlds, spinning its way through Indyref2 just as the Leavers did in the Brexit campaign. But if Scotland waits until the UK truly knows where it stands before deciding its future, then the UK will actually be out. The SNP would then have to explain how it would negotiate an independent Scotland\u2019s place back in Europe, and would\u2014without special treatment\u2014have to accept both the euro and membership of the Schengen passport-free zone. All of which would greatly complicate the \u201cYes\u201d side\u2019s pitch.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/border/2016-10-14/nicola-sturgeon-marches-her-snp-troops-towards-the-top-of-the-indyref2-hill/\"><strong>Peter MacMahon, the ITV Border political editor, assesses on his blog the chances of Nicola Sturgeon pushing ahead with her second independence referendum threat.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the UK government makes an offer to the Scottish government, who will judge whether this is enough to protect Scotland\u2019s interest.</p> <p>It looks like the final arbiter of that will be the First Minister.

Here are extracts from her speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My name is Laura and I have been living with multiple sclerosis for nine years. And the fact that I am standing here conference giving a speech means that I am one of the lucky ones. </p> <p>It has become clear to me that many people living with MS have been using cannabis to help with the symptoms of that condition. In fact, it\u2019s one of the worst kept secrets at the hospital. All of these people risk a criminal record, unlike in Australia, Chile, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and some US states.</p> <p>We as a developed Western nation are fast becoming behind the times. </p> <p>In fact, a report publishd on 13 September this year by a cross-party group of MPs and peers has called on the government to introduce a system giving patients access to cannabis for medical reasons and to decriminalise the growing of small amounts at home for the same purposes.</p> <p>However the law as it stands in the UK means that cannabis is a class b drug, and the current penalty for possession is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both, and for supply and production up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p>Now, I don\u2019t think someone in pain should be criminalised for trying to ease that pain. </p> </blockquote> <p>Brennan-Whitefield said that MS sufferers could now get a drug called Sativex which contains cannabinoids (cannabis ingredients). But it was not widely available and a private prescription cost \u00a34,250, she said. \u201cDoes that sound fair to you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>She said she was only proposing to decriminalise cannabis for medical use, and that it was not just MS sufferers who might benefit. Cannabis could help with arthritis, cancer, Chron\u2019s disease, epilepsy, and palliative care, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given that these people who are suffering pain - and I can assure you, those who are willing to use cannabis have in most cases exhausted every other option - is it not unreasonable to criminalise them? I am talking about some of the most vulnerable people in society who may have had the added misfortune of going through the DWP\u2019s inhumane assessment procedure for disability benefits. To be then branded criminals, for trying to have a quality of life?</p> <p>I know what it is to suffer pain. And, be in no doubt, if it came to it, I would not hesitate to ease that pain in any way I could because that is a natural instinct.</p> <p>But if my condition were to deteriorate to that stage I would be reliant on other people to help me: my friends, my family, and most of all my partner Stephen who I really don\u2019t thank enough for the care that he gives me.</p> <p>A drug conviction has very real consequences, serious consequences for your future prospects and your employment prospects. I think that now is the time to show that we are the party of compassion and common sense and it is now that we should be sending out a message to those people that we hear you and we are not shying away from this issue as Westminster is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is Brennan-Whitefield making her speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CLEARUK/status/787250463355863040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BRILLIANT work by Laura Brennan-Whitefield <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurapoppet\">@laurapoppet</a> at SNP Conference <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNP16?src=hash\">#SNP16</a> on medicinal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cannabis?src=hash\">#cannabis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndOurPain?src=hash\">#EndOurPain</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rNHKSBTqZw\">pic.twitter.com/rNHKSBTqZw</a></p>&mdash; Cannabis Law Reform (@CLEARUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CLEARUK/status/787250463355863040\">October 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58020854e4b0160123896045\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T10:43:48.850Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP delegates call for cannabis to be decriminalised for medical use</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Delegates have overwhelmingly backed the resolution saying cannabis should be decriminalised for medical use.</p> <p>This does not mean this will happen in Scotland because this is a matter for the UK government.

Without the central bank\u2019s multibillion-pound quantitative easing (QE) programme, the economy was almost certain to tip back into recession, hurting the pensions industry far more by depressing the value of the assets in their funds.</p> <p>But MPs on the work and pensions committee are not so sure. The spillover effects of Threadneedle Street\u2019s \u00a3435bn QE scheme have come under intense scrutiny since the vote to leave the EU, which spooked global markets and triggered another cut in interest rates.</p> <p>Critics, including the former pensions minister Ros Altmann, have argued that low <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/bank-of-england-attacked-50-pension-contributions\" title=\"\">interest rates and QE are the root cause of the ballooning deficits in the UK\u2019s \u00a31.5tn final salary pension plans</a>. They have also depressed the payouts from defined contribution schemes, which have replaced final salary schemes in most companies and now account for around \u00a3600bn of occupational pension scheme saving.</p> <p>MPs will know the situation is getting worse, not better, after figures from the consultancy Hymans Robertson showed the deficit in occupational pension schemes soaring to \u00a31tn after 23 June.</p> <p>Frank Field, the committee\u2019s chair, is concerned about the pensions crisis, but not only for its impact on savers. He is worried about a knock-on effect for companies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/28/frank-field-accuses-sir-philip-green-of-asset-stripping-bhs\" title=\"\">having witnessed the destruction of high street retailer BHS</a> and the hollowing-out of its pension scheme. And he is also concerned about the longer-term effect on pay should companies find themselves shovelling their funds into final salary schemes, leaving only a fraction left for wage rises.</p> <p>BT has a deficit estimated at 21% of its total value on the stock market. It is still able to pay workers a 2.5% wage rise and declare its intention to invest \u00a36bn in the telecoms network. Defence manufacturer BAE Systems is in a worse position: it has seen the gap between the assets and liabilities in its pension fund grow to 40% of the company\u2019s value.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7db35507ab2e0a53edc5408fd5f5952f93cc681b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db35507ab2e0a53edc5408fd5f5952f93cc681b/0_0_1581_949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Field: worried about the knock-on effects of pension deficits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/tesco-supermarket-sales-rise-profits-tumble\" title=\"\">Earlier this month, Tesco said its pension deficit had ballooned from \u00a33.2bn</a> in February to \u00a35.9bn, with much of the fall due to the panic after Britain voted to leave the EU. Tesco has denied that the need to divert cash to fill this huge black hole will lead to cuts to the dividend or the wage bill. Nonetheless, the pressure to take drastic action is building.</p> <p>The City, unsurprisingly, is focused on the lack of money left in the corporate kitty to pay shareholder dividends and for profit-enhancing investment. Investors fear the Yorkshire-based plastics maker Carclo could be a harbinger of doom, after it became one of the first groups to warn that its growing pension deficit might prevent the board from not just cutting the dividend, but from giving any payouts at all to shareholders.</p> <p>This referendum fallout mimics the problems faced by companies in the aftermath of the Great Crash. Then, in 2010, BT\u2019s pension deficit was \u00a39bn. It subsequently improved to nearer \u00a36bn. Now it is \u00a39.9bn.</p> <p>Trade unions have attacked employers that, in the first instance, closed final salary schemes to new members and then later reduced the benefits to make payouts more affordable.</p> <p>From the employers\u2019 point of view, both moves came to resemble sticking plasters as the deficits carried on increasing. The Pensions Regulator tightened the screw, forcing them to increase contributions, often to above 50% of each worker\u2019s salary.</p> <p>Members of the Unite union at the UK\u2019s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) are due to hold a ballot on Monday over strike action to prevent the closure of their pension scheme to new and existing members. This shutdown of the entire scheme means employers need only honour existing pensions contracts. No more rights can be accrued.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/unions-threaten-battle-with-royal-mail-over-pension-scheme-change\" title=\"\">Royal Mail</a> and Post Office workers are battling a similar move, which will result in 40-year-olds who might have expected a retirement income of \u00a338,000 a year getting nearer \u00a318,000, some of it from the defined contribution scheme that they will pay into for the rest of their working lives.</p> <p>The Communication Workers Union has already held a one-day strike of Post Office workers against the move and last week asked the government to intervene. But like all other attempts to prevent employers rolling back 50 years of improving pension rights, the momentum is in the opposite direction, thanks to the gap between available assets and the costs of providing a pension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/pensions/giv-1406p53KxiodQhXj/\" data-alt=\"uk Pension deficit\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/pensions/giv-1406p53KxiodQhXj/\">uk Pension deficit</a> </figure>  <p>Increasing life expectancy, especially among men, has dramatically pushed up liabilities. Meanwhile, pension pots have struggled to make gains.</p> <p>The stock market has increased strongly this year and passed its previous peak. But that means investors have only just clawed their way back to a level reached 16 years ago.</p> <p>In the meantime, most schemes have shifted their investments into bonds \u2013 a move driven by regulations that have forced schemes to put their money in less risky places. A bond has a greater claim on the assets of a bust company or government and is therefore considered safer than stocks and shares.</p> <p>But since the crash, the safest bonds have become the most coveted investments in the world. Not only have pension funds needed to buy them to satisfy regulations, but central banks have bought them as part of their own QE programmes.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s QE scheme is dwarfed by the $4tn bought by the US Federal Reserve. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have also filled their own vaults with government bonds, in effect becoming the biggest single lenders to their respective governments.</p> <p>The aim of QE is to drive down the long-term interest rates that govern the charge for borrowing on products like five-year loans and 25-year mortgages.</p> <p>In the UK, five-year loan rates are not far above mortgage rates and those rates are back where they were before the crash, albeit minus the crazy teaser offers that help tip several banks over the&#xa0;edge. This bonanza for borrowers means the years since 2010 have been lean for savers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b1f45179dad92a6b8b9d3f4199eb9cbe21136e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b1f45179dad92a6b8b9d3f4199eb9cbe21136e7/207_1073_4421_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baroness Altmann thinks QE is to blame for the UK\u2019s ballooning pension deficits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baroness Altmann thinks QE is to blame for the UK\u2019s ballooning pension deficits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baroness Altmann\u2019s argument is that depressing bond yields to reduce interest rates, without mitigating the effects on pension schemes, is creating spillover effects that harm the economy. As firms put more and more cash aside for people in final-salary schemes, there are fewer funds for the defined contribution plans they have switched workers into. There is also the suspicion that wages have taken a hit, with British companies pegging average rises at half the Bank\u2019s predicted 4% for the last three years.</p> <p>The only group that has assuredly escaped so far are the shareholders. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/top-uk-firms-paid-five-times-more-in-dividends-than-into-pensions\" title=\"\">A study by the consultancy LCP showed that FTSE 100 companies paid five times more</a> in dividends than they did pension contributions in 2015. The \u00a313.3bn paid into defined benefit pension schemes was dwarfed by the \u00a371.8bn in payments to shareholders.</p> <p>Broadbent would rightly say that was not the Bank\u2019s decision. But the dilemma remains, as Jon Hatchett, a partner at Hymans Robertson, says: \u201cPost Brexit, the number of UK workers that won\u2019t be able to retire with an adequate income&#xa0;has increased from two-thirds to three-quarters.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers thrown out of final salary schemes into money purchase arrangements receive around 10% less than they would have before the referendum.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s base-rate cut in the panic after the referendum made that situation worse. Given what has happened to sterling since, its threat since then to go even lower needs to be questioned.</p> <h2>Questions for Threadneedle Street</h2> <p>Five questions MPs should ask the deputy governor of the Bank of England Ben Broadbent</p> <p><strong>Has the Bank estimated the impact of rising pension deficits on the finances of corporate Britain?</strong><br>Deficits in the UK\u2019s final salary schemes reached \u00a31tn after the Brexit vote, according to pensions consultancy Hymans Robertson. The pensions regulator says companies must top up ailing funds from their profits. Some companies have been given longer than 20 years to do this, but are still struggling to make the payments. Cuts in pension payments to retiring workers are widespread. Some firms have warned they might be forced to cut dividends.</p> <p><strong>Does the Bank accept that quantitative easing has boosted the finances of the already wealthy and hit those worse off?</strong><br>The Bank said in a 2012 paper that QE, which involves buying corporate and sovereign debt, has boosted property prices and share prices as the proceeds of those purchases were invested in the housing markets and stock markets. Analysing the effects of QE, the Bank said that the top 5% of households owned 40% of the assets, which means these people have been the primary beneficiaries of the boost in property prices and stock market gains following the financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p><strong>What can the Bank do to help those who are locking into annuities (retirement incomes bought from insurance firms) since QE?</strong><br>Thousands of retirees have purchased annuities, which provide a retirement income for life, at low rates. An annuity will buy an income of around \u00a33,500 a year for every \u00a3100,000 saved, depending on the additional benefits such as index linking to inflation. If the Bank raises interest rates, annuity rates could rise, but those who have already bought one would be left worse off for the rest of their lives.</p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t QE meant to be an emergency measure to stave off an economic depression</strong>?<br>Quantitative easing involves purchasing billions of pounds of government - and now company \u2013 debt from banks. Initially it helped prevent the banks going bust and, according to critics, has already become redundant. The Bank has since claimed that extra doses of QE - it reached \u00a3435bn in August - can support the economy and boost wages. However, wages have yet to rise to a point where the Bank feels it can reduce QE or increase interest rates.</p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t QE supposed to push up wage growth to between 3% and 4%?</strong>.<br>Wage growth has remained stuck at around 2%. QE should have tightened the labour market \u2013 by leading to more people being hired \u2013 and then increased wages as firms fought over a dwindling pool of available workers. That has not happened. The Bank expected that unemployment falling to 5% would trigger higher wages, but it has already gone down to 4.9% without the expected boost to pay.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>\u2018Los Angeles is so massive, confusing, beautiful, harsh and strange that it almost defies you to make work about it,\u201d says the photographer <a href=\"http://gregoryhalpern.com/\">Gregory Halpern</a>. \u201cIt is an impossible project in a way.\u201d In his intriguingly titled new book, <a href=\"http://www.gregoryhalpern.com/zzyzx.html\"><em>ZZYZX</em></a> \u2013 named after a village on the edge of the Mojave desert in Saint Bernardino County \u2013 Halpern has created a California of the mind, a place both real and metaphorical, familiar yet alien.

I want to always leave room in the pictures for the viewer\u2019s thoughts and projections.\u201d</p> <p>Born in 1977, Halpern studied history and literature at Harvard, before completing a postgraduate degree in fine art at the California College of Arts. His previous books have included <a href=\"http://www.gregoryhalpern.com/omaha.html\"><em>Omaha Sketchbook</em></a>, another less heightened journey into the American landscape, and <a href=\"http://www.gregoryhalpern.com/eswm.html\"><em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em></a>, a collaboration with the photographer <a href=\"http://www.ahndrayaparlato.com/\">Ahndraya Parlato</a>, comprising of images taken on the solstice or equinox.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f1541e06b0626cbfc640c3fa2c91b60fe410c24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1541e06b0626cbfc640c3fa2c91b60fe410c24/0_0_1962_2400/818.jpg\" alt=\"Couple pulling along possessions in carts and prams in Los Angeles\" width=\"818\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I just came upon this couple and it turned out they were moving into a friend\u2019s house ... the image of them walking and pulling their possessions seemed mysterious and timeless. Plus, nobody walks in Los Angeles.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregory Halpern / Webber Gallery Space</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halpern spent five years on <em>ZZYZX</em>, often travelling to locations in California he picked at random from Google maps. It took him another year to edit the results, trawling though an estimated thousand rolls of film, about half of which were shot in the final year after a Guggenheim grant enabled him to live in California for a time. \u201cI was struck constantly by the beauty and the harshness of the environment, by the sunshine and the smog, the vast space of the desert and the choking traffic of the cities,\u201d says Halpern. \u201cEven the light in Los Angeles seems compromised: there\u2019s a beautiful haziness to it caused by the pollution in the air.\u201d</p> <p>That unreal light is one of the defining aspects of Halpern\u2019s Californian photographs, falling on landscapes and faces, heightening the sense of unreality outsiders often detect in LA. The British documentary photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/21/in-flagrante-two-review-chris-killip-thatcher-sea-coal-north-east-england-northumberland-industrial-\">Chris Killip</a>, who taught Halpern at Harvard, says he has broken away from \u201cthe sanctified cliched reverence\u201d of traditional American landscape photography and \u201cseems able to connect with this massive subject in ways that others cannot\u201d. In one striking image, Halpern frames a black-stemmed Joshua tree, scorched by a forest fire, against earth and sky, its spiky golden leaves insisting on life even amid this deathly environment. In another, a raised hand, its open palm tattooed with seven stars, shades an unseen face from the unforgiving glare of the Californian sun. The stars, Halpern adds, could refer to a biblical quotation from Revelation 1:16.</p> <p>Earlier working titles for the book included Babylon and Kingdom, but Halpern\u2019s publisher, Michael Mack, advised against them, thinking rightly that they were too symbolic. Many of Halpern\u2019s images, though, would be apocalyptic if they weren\u2019t so formally beautiful. That beauty is troubling in a different way, when it is applied to the portraits of the homeless and the struggling that punctuate the book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b298f05ae39d3879a05106986b81244c0367c84b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b298f05ae39d3879a05106986b81244c0367c84b/0_0_1946_2400/811.jpg\" alt=\"Man holding his palm up with seven stars tattooed on to it\" width=\"811\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The guy reached up like this and I instinctively photographed it.

Again, it is about the reality and the mystery of the images, and, to a degree, about the questions they raise. There\u2019s a picture of a homeless guy lying on the grass laughing, but is it a happy image or a sad one? Then, there\u2019s the viewer\u2019s reaction to it \u2013 is it mean? Is it exploitative?\u201d</p> <p>Halpern, one senses, is still grappling with the meaning of his work. <em>ZZYZX</em> is certainly a departure from the quieter observational style of his earlier work. \u201cI see <em>ZZYZX</em> as part of a continuum but edging a little closer towards fiction,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is fiction, but it has that element of being more somehow than the real \u2013 more beautiful, more ugly, more complicated and contradictory. Like LA itself, in fact.\u201d</p> <p>In a recent talk given at his London gallery, Webber, where images from <em>ZZYZX</em> are <a href=\"http://www.webberrepresents.com/gallery/\">currently on show</a>, Halpern discussed his often obsessive working methods. Once he was on a flight from Buffalo to Los Angeles, he recalled, when the pilot announced they were flying over a forest fire that was visible below. From his middle-aisle seat, Halpern couldn\u2019t see it, but when he landed in Los Angeles, he immediately hired a car and drove 90 miles back to where it was raging in order to photograph it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dc4db565a08f7adc89efdcb6f4535f2ae4b9bd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dc4db565a08f7adc89efdcb6f4535f2ae4b9bd1/0_0_1920_2400/800.jpg\" alt=\"blackened joshua tree in the desert\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In California, there is an element of dread that makes you feel the whole place could be on the edge of extinction. That\u2019s there in the city but in the natural world, too. The constant threat of fire and the attendant lack of water is another example of the strange extremity of the place.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregory Halpern / Webber Gallery Space</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Images of fires and their aftermath are scattered throughout the book, another metaphor for the dread that haunts the Californian dream. The book\u2019s title, though, comes from a village built on the promise of California\u2019s scarcest commodity \u2013 water. The village Zzyzx, pronounced zye-zix, was formerly called Soda Springs after a natural spring there, but was rechristened by a mineral water pioneer, Curtis Howe Springer, in 1944. The eccentric Springer named it after what he claimed to be the last word that could be spelt in the English language.</p> <p>\u201cThe word has a dystopian, futuristic aspect,\u201d says Halpern, \u201ceven though it came out of a utopian dream that Springer had while squatting the land for three years. He somehow willed the word and the place into being. That notion of manifest destiny is there still in California, but also the sense that it\u2019s the end of the dream. You get there and you can go no further. You are faced with yourself and your life, but just in a more beautiful setting.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mackbooks.co.uk/books/1142-ZZYZX.html\"><em>ZZYZX is published by Mack (\u00a335)</em></a><em>.

  "<p>They went to Kigali to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and take 0.5C out of future global warming, and the 170 countries who successfully negotiated an amendment to the Montreal Protocol agreed to get rid of 90% of them. Job done. Not bad for four days and three long nights\u2019 work.</p> <p>In fact, the Kigali deal on HFCs, announced on Saturday morning, is fiendishly complicated and has taken years to negotiate in different technical and political forums. It was only struck by an ambitious agreement to give countries different timescales to phase them out, alongside major chemical and big food companies accepting change, the personal determination of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, to get a deal before the election and developing countries agreeing to invest heavily in new technologies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\">Climate change: global deal reached to limit use of hydrofluorocarbons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rich countries, including the US, Japan and nations in Europe, will now start phasing out synthetic HFCs in 2019, whereas China agreed to peak emissions in 2024, while India and less ambitious countries chose 2028.</p> <p>As such, the deal reflects countries\u2019 differing levels of development. Because nearly all HFCs are made by a handful of giant northern chemical companies and are used in air-conditioning units and cooling systems made and sold in rich countries, it was relatively easy for their governments to put pressure on a single global industry. Besides, the alternatives, like hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO<sub>2</sub>, are widely available, safe, have been approved and are on the market.</p> <p>The deal will make little difference to rich countries. The EU had already started to phase out HFCs and since 2011 had banned them being used in cars. Many global food and drink companies, like Coca-Cola, Pepsico and Unilever, have already started to switch fluorinated greenhouse gases with climate-friendly and other natural refrigerants that are more energy-efficient and can save money. The new agreement is welcomed by many chemical and manufacturing companies because it gives them market advantage over inferior products made in poor countries, as well as green kudos.</p> <p>But a deal proved much harder for India, China and other developing countries to strike. Their companies have relied on old refrigeration and coolant technologies, and they will now have to invest heavily in R&amp;D and upgrade or replace their factories and equipment. Just as in the wider climate negotiations, they accepted that they were part of the problem and possibly on track to become the main HFC users, but they insisted that, like climate change itself, this was primarily a western problem foisted on them.</p> <p>The deal has been widely welcomed because it keeps the Paris agreement on track and is an important step towards reducing global emissions. Coming on the heels of a new deal to cap aviation emissions, and just weeks before the shipping industry tries to clean up its act and the UN climate talks resume, it is overwhelmingly positive.</p> <p>In fact, the Kigali meeting need never have happened. HFCs were widely recognised as powerful climate-warming gases many years ago and governments deliberately missed the chance to eliminate them in 1987 when they agreed the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFC gases and save the ozone layer. </p> <p>The ozone hole is at last slowly recovering and HFCs are now seen as just a small but important part of the growing climate-change problem. If only it took just a few long nights of negotiations to eliminate fossil fuels too.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>The borrowed landscape is an old trick. It\u2019s a Chinese concept that takes scenery from the environment around you, so that your garden doesn\u2019t necessarily look bigger, but is enhanced. There were several levels: the distant borrowing of a mountain view or the sea; adjacent borrowing of a lovely roof or a fine bit of architecture; upward borrowing of sky and clouds; or the downward borrowing of rocks and ponds.</p> <p>The idea of borrowed scenery got quickly adopted into Japanese garden principles and, for that matter, pretty much every other landscape design movement in history. It makes sense to look beyond if there\u2019s something worth looking beyond for. But what if your adjacent borrowing is the neighbour\u2019s pants on the washing line or a&#xa0;wall of ugly yellow bricks?</p> <p>The obvious answer is that you screen out eyesores, but this comes with challenges. A&#xa0;good screen will ideally be evergreen, and that limits choice. A mature evergreen hedge of yew, box or holly will be expensive, and requires&#xa0;a lot of love to make sure it settles in well. You also need to stay the right side of laws concerning how high an evergreen or semi-evergreen hedge can grow (no more than 2m). Fast-growing specimens such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/07/leylandii-neighbours-dispute\">leylandii</a> are ugly and often regrettable.</p> <p>Above all else, a hedge or large tree in a&#xa0;small garden takes up space, creates shade and competes with other plants. Still, these downsides may be paltry compared with your existing view. Large shrubs can be an excellent substitute for a tree.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach\">Ken Loach</a> sits with his hands clutching his chair for dear life, his head shrinking into his shoulders, a skinny question mark of a man. Never did a man appear so diffident. And then he opens his mouth.</p> <p>Loach has spent the past half-century making films that shake with anger, and is just about to release his angriest yet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\">I, Daniel Blake</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/ken-loach-cannes-2016-palme-dor-win-i-daniel-blake\">winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at the 2016 Cannes film festival</a>, is about a man broken by the British benefits system. His doctor says he is too sick to work after a near-fatal heart attack, but the Department for Work and Pensions decides he is not entitled to sickness benefit. Blake finds himself trapped in a downward spiral after his jobseeker\u2019s allowance is suspended, because he is thought not to be trying hard enough to find the work he is unfit to do. The film is so spare and spartan, it could be a parable. It is also immensely moving \u2013 particularly a scene in a food bank, when a young mother Blake has befriended breaks down in a manner that borders on the feral.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/21/meet-the-real-daniel-blakes-ken-loach-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58fjn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2826140\"            data-video-name=\"Meet the real Daniel Blakes \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5809eecde4b005f21833bc43\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/21/161021RealLifeDanielBlake_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/21/161021RealLifeDanielBlake.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979151&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/21/meet-the-real-daniel-blakes-ken-loach-video\">Meet the real Daniel Blakes</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cAngry? Mmmmmmm,\u201d Loach says so quietly it barely registers. He talks about the people he and his regular writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-laverty\">Paul Laverty</a> met while doing their research: the young lad with nothing in his fridge who hadn\u2019t eaten properly for three days; the woman ashamed of attending food banks; the man told to queue for a casual shift at 5.30am, then sent home an hour later because he wasn\u2019t needed. \u201cThat constant humiliation to survive.

Loach orders coffee and croissants. Meekly, of course, but his meekness is deceptive: even when ordering coffee, he knows exactly what he wants. \u201cI\u2019ll have a little glass of tap water, please, and a tiny drop of cold milk, thank you. Yes,\u201d he continues, \u201cwe met so many people who had been humiliated and destroyed and lost all sense of being able to hold their own in the world.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, I, Daniel Blake can be seen as a companion piece to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/04/cathy-come-home-rings-true\">Cathy Come Home</a>, Loach\u2019s seminal 1966 film about a young family\u2019s descent into homelessness, which resulted in a parliamentary debate and raised public awareness of homelessness. But while Cathy led to real social change, Loach predicts people will not be outraged by Daniel: they will accept it as normal that a man should be cheated out of benefits by the state, or a young single mother has to move from London to Newcastle to find herself a scrap of a home.</p> <p>Whose world would he rather share: Cathy\u2019s or Daniel\u2019s? \u201cThat\u2019s a complicated question. In the world of Cathy, we still had the main elements of the welfare state in place, even though they were being eroded. People were still employed directly by the health service. We still owned the gas, the electric, the water, the railways. As a world to live in, Cathy\u2019s was more congenial, with a stronger sense of social responsibility. When she was shown as homeless, people were angry about it. Now society is nowhere near as cohesive. The consequences of Thatcher and Blair have eroded the sense that we are responsible for each other, that we are our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keeper. So in that sense I prefer the days of Cathy.\u201d</p> <p>In the 60s and 70s, Loach belonged to small leftist groups: the Socialist Labour League (forerunner of the <a href=\"http://wrp.org.uk/\">Workers Revolutionary Party</a>), the <a href=\"http://www.internationalsocialist.org/\">International Socialists</a>, the International Marxist Group, all critical of both western capitalism and the Stalinism of the Soviet Union. They\u2019d swot up on Marxism, debate it intensely and tell anybody who\u2019d listen that capitalism was unsustainable: it would devour itself, and the working classes in the process. But it was all guesswork. At the time, the ready availability of jobs and a relatively well-funded welfare state suggested capitalism was actually doing just dandy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are getting the sense that the world cannot be sustained like this, that we really have to change things now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s only now, Loach says, that the collapse they predicted is coming to pass. \u201cWe said that every crisis means more demands on the working class, more exploitation, but we were saying it in the abstract. People weren\u2019t imagining zero-hours contracts, agency work, food banks. Who would have thought in the 60s that it would be acceptable and normal to starve unless you got charity food? It\u2019s grotesque that we now accept this.\u201d</p> <p>He gives a brilliantly simple explanation as to why capitalism will ultimately fail society, particularly in a globalised world: \u201cEach corporation is trying to get more sales through lower prices, therefore profits reduce, therefore they have to find the cheapest labour wherever it is, therefore capital can never be stable.\u201d</p> <p>Despite everything, Loach is an optimist. \u201cI think people are getting the sense that the world cannot be sustained like this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe impulse behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syriza\">Syriza</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\">Podemos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> in the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is that another world is possible. There is a sense that we really have to change things now.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>I first interviewed Loach 23 years ago, soon after he made the film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnkJmYo6sjE\">Raining Stones</a>, written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/24/my-tv-hero-jim-allen\">Jim Allen</a> (with whom he collaborated until he died in 1999), about a man who cannot afford to buy his daughter a communion dress and involves himself disastrously with loan sharks. It was classic Loach territory: exploitation, the indignity of unemployment, the resilience and humour of working-class people. I remember walking through Soho and Loach stopping to buy us a punnet of strawberries from a market stall, while telling me pity was a rightwing construct: the answer to all setbacks, as <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/About/Our-History/Key-People-in-Labor-History/Joe-Hill-1879-1915\">the great American trade unionist Joe Hill</a> said, is, \u201cDon\u2019t mourn, organise!\u201d</p> <p>I recently watched <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557251/\">The Big Flame</a>, Loach\u2019s 1969 TV film about 10,000 Liverpool dockers staging a work-in. In the film, one docker strums the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Kxq9uFDes\">Joe Hill</a> on his guitar, while another explains that Hill\u2019s famous line was delivered when he was facing the firing squad after being framed for murder. Today, Loach argues that the struggle to organise is made tougher by the fact that so many workers are technically self-employed and not part of a collective. Again, he quotes Joe Hill at me.</p> <p>Critics say Loach\u2019s weakness is that he has never changed: he is still delivering the same Marxist sermon he was half a century ago. His fans argue that this is his strength. Loach himself, now an unlikely 80 years old, would ask why on earth he should change when the system remains the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf1b6e516bc61cbb4c3fa70acaf2e6ba898b9527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1b6e516bc61cbb4c3fa70acaf2e6ba898b9527/0_0_2712_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Ken Loach's 2016 film I, Daniel Blake, showing Briana Shann, Hayley Squires, Dave Johns, Dylan McKiernan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loach\u2019s latest film, I, Daniel Blake: \u2018I prefer the days of Cathy,\u2019 he says.

At school, he represented the Tories in a mock election. \u201cI don\u2019t think too much should be made of that,\u201d he says. I had assumed he was playing devil\u2019s advocate, or it was just a passing teenage whim, but no, he says: these were the values with which he was brought up. Loach\u2019s father was an electrician who became a foreman in his factory in Nuneaton \u2013 a classic working-class Tory, he says. His mother was a hairdresser. When Loach\u2019s father was asked to join the staff and become a manager, he refused, because it would mean a monthly payment into the bank rather than weekly cash in a brown envelope. (He hated the idea of being in debt, and always wanted money to hand.) He was a bright, shrewd man who had passed the grammar school exam but didn\u2019t go, because his mother couldn\u2019t afford the uniform. He read books about the great barristers and dreamed of a future in law for his son.</p> <p>Young Kenneth was clever and ambitious. He went to grammar school (a form of education he despises because it plucks a few working-class kids out of their lives to \u201csucceed\u201d, leaving the others to fail) and had a voracious appetite for learning. He would sneak-read Shakespeare under the sheets when the bedroom light was supposed to be out. The family took the rightwing Daily Express, and Loach would read it cover to cover, never questioning its values. As far as he was concerned, it simply reflected the world. \u201cI adopted the Tories like you adopt a team,\u201d he says, embarrassed. How long did he adopt them for? \u201cProbably until I was 19, when I went into the RAF.\u201d</p> <p>After the air force, he went to Oxford University to study law. He became active in the drama society, performed sketches with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dudley-moore\">Dudley Moore</a>, started to direct, slacked on the academic front, graduated with a third and decided his future lay in the theatre. His father was devastated.</p> <p>Loach had always wanted to act. \u201cI had that bee in my bonnet since I was 15.\u201d Did he have a role model? \u201cI remember seeing an old actor called <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/458331/\">Marius Goring</a> play Richard III, and thinking that was the bee\u2019s knees. There were probably echoes of that in what I tried to do.\u201d Was he any good? He giggles. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly say. Well, I got away with it.\u201d Even today, you sense he believes he could have been a contender. His wife Lesley, usually loyal beyond the call of duty, has told me he was a hopeless ham, the kind of actor he would be least likely to cast in his own films. Is there a bit of him that prickles at this? \u201cOf course. But who knows?\u201d</p> <p>He got a job as assistant director at Northampton rep. \u201cI thought I could still play a part or two, but the director obviously had no confidence in me. I didn\u2019t even get a part in the pantomime, so I thought maybe I\u2019d better stick to directing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73e90ca488e23506aea0bff1cac95f7c9f551c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73e90ca488e23506aea0bff1cac95f7c9f551c4/0_0_3096_2062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Ken Loach with Eric Cantona on the set of the 2009 film Looking For Eric.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Eric Cantona on the set of 2009\u2019s Looking For Eric.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1963, he moved to the BBC as a trainee director and before long was directing the police drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWflrCrwUSw\">Z-Cars</a>.

I think he thought I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. To know what you were talking about, you had to work where he had, and have dealt with the people he dealt with, and faced the rigours of just not seeing the sunlight.\u201d</p> <p>Who took most pride in his achievements, his mother or father? \u201cI think they shared a pride. He wouldn\u2019t go in for praise, but he\u2019d acknowledge it had happened. He\u2019s a working man from the West Midlands. People are quite reserved. There were no metropolitan hugs in the 1950s, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d</p> <p>Although his work on Z-Cars was praised for its new dirty realism (accepting that the police could be prejudiced or even corrupt), Loach didn\u2019t feel it was real enough, so he went back to first principles and analysed the films he most admired: the Czech new wave and the Italian neorealists. \u201cIn these films, people are just being, not performing. And what I was doing was getting performances I didn\u2019t believe. So I learned from my mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>He took his craft to pieces and rebuilt it, borrowing some techniques (using natural light whenever possible and casting nonprofessional actors alongside professionals) and establishing new ones of his own (shooting chronologically; feeding the storyline to actors bit by bit, so their reactions are real; combining improvised shots with closely scripted ones). It is perhaps this level of realism that distinguishes his films more than anything: Cathy, wonderfully played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924576/\">Carol White</a>, looks shocked when her child is taken away because the actor was; ditto <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZB0i0NzOe0\">the boy who cries in Kes when he is caned</a> on the hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12e2fa910bfff8ae422b56050315c143d3133982\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12e2fa910bfff8ae422b56050315c143d3133982/0_155_2096_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor David Bradley holding a kestrel in Ken Loach's 1969 film Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bradley in 1969\u2019s Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the mid-60s to the end of that decade, everything Loach did created headlines and set agendas. It wasn\u2019t just that the films looked and felt different; the subject matter was radical, too. <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/\">Up The Junction</a> started a debate about backstreet abortions, The Big Flame about workers\u2019 rights and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafCuwBBVM8\">Three Clear Sundays</a> about the death penalty. This run culminated in 1969 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kes\">Kes</a>, the film based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/barry-hines-author-behind-kes-dies-kestrel-for-knave\">the Hines novel</a> about a working-class boy whose love for a kestrel brings him out of his shell. Loach\u2019s film is as unsentimental as it is heartwrenching, as brutal as it is beautiful, and features one of the funniest football scenes in the history of cinema when the games teacher, played by Brian Glover and kitted out in a Bobby Charlton top, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9nDHupVqVw\">insists on taking a penalty that never was</a>.</p> <p>But in 1971 Loach\u2019s world collapsed. He was driving on the outside lane of the M1 when a car on the inside lane lost a wheel, crashed into Loach and pushed his car into the upright of a bridge. His five-year-old son Nicholas was killed, Lesley\u2019s grandmother also died, and Lesley was left fighting for her life. Loach didn\u2019t work again for more than a year. \u201cWe lost a child, and then your whole personal\u2026 Everything you have about you is concentrated on that loss. So you don\u2019t have the emotional space or strength to do anything other than just grieve, and that\u2019s a long process.\u201d</p> <p>His sentences become stubbly and broken when he talks about it. Loach will refer to his son or his child, but tends not to use his name. Does he find it difficult to say? \u201cWell, I always have, yes... Nicholas.\u201d He says the name so quickly, you could miss it. \u201cBecause the wound is so deep. And I think that\u2019s part of the problem. We probably have never been able to grieve and resolve things. I think now there are processes that would encourage you to express your grief and to reach some reconciliation with it. At the time we didn\u2019t, despite trying to be clever about other people\u2019s situations. At one level we were conscious that it had to happen, and at another we were too wounded to begin it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0ba811a58d21273a64627a9ed647c8d8c7a753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0ba811a58d21273a64627a9ed647c8d8c7a753/0_0_4957_3926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Film director Ken Loach on set in 1980\" width=\"1000\" height=\"792\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loach on set in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Farrell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he returned to work, it was in an unlikely way, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388278/\">adapting Chekhov\u2019s short story A Misfortune for television</a>. He went on to make the epic TV series <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/467647/\">Days Of Hope</a>, covering the period between the first world war and <a href=\"https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/8565/The+1926+general+strike%3A+nine+days+of+hope\">the national strike of 1926</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpBuFqWeSs\">The Price Of Coal</a>, about a mining disaster; but his film career floundered. Even the most devoted fan found 1981\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082678/?ref_=tt_rec_tti\">Looks &amp; Smiles</a> painfully miserable, and Loach says he made a mess of the only other film he made in the 80s, <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/film/fatherland\">Fatherland</a>.</p> <p>As well as a loss of confidence, there was another problem: Loach kept getting banned. In 1983 he made <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1417974/\">Questions Of Leadership</a>, a series that asked whether workers were being betrayed by trade union officials, but Channel 4, which had commissioned it, refused to broadcast it, saying it was unbalanced. His 1984 film <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/which-side-are-you-on\">Which Side Are You On?</a>, about striking miners\u2019 songs and poems, made for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/13/melvyn-bragg-south-bank-show\">Melvyn Bragg\u2019s South Bank Show</a>, was shelved by London Weekend Television for being too political. In 1987, his production of Jim Allen\u2019s play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/23/fiachragibbons\">Perdition</a>, which examined an alleged collaboration between Zionist leaders and the Nazis, was cancelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/max-stafford-clark\">Max Stafford-Clark</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/royal-court-theatre\">Royal Court theatre</a> just 36 hours before opening night. By the late 80s, he couldn\u2019t get anything commissioned, let alone shown, for love nor money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/14/ken-loach-comes-clean-about-his-mcdonalds-job\">To his eternal shame</a>, he made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwa8B0g6TI\">a commercial for McDonald\u2019s</a>.</p> <p>In the recent television documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/05/versus-life-and-films-ken-loach-documentary-review\">Versus: The Life And Films Of Ken Loach</a>, the film-maker comes across as mild and lovable \u2013 until he talks about those who betrayed him. On screen, he describes Stafford-Clark as a coward, and the ferocity of the attack is shocking.</p> <p>You\u2019re not afraid of making enemies, are you, I ask. It depends, he says. \u201cMy mum was a peacemaker, and in personal things I tend to do that, because I can\u2019t deal with personal conflict. I find that horrible.\u201d Loach and Lesley have four surviving children, two of whom \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/31/jim-loach-oranges-and-sunshine\">Jim</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd1bcfcd3\">Emma</a> \u2013 are also film-makers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t argue with the people you rely on and trust, and care for, and cherish, because the cost would be too great. But step outside that and face the world, <em>come on</em>!\u201d</p> <p>I rephrase my earlier question: is he afraid of making enemies in public life and politics? \u201cNo, because they <em>are</em> enemies. When we did those films back in the 80s, the rightwing trade unionists and the rightwing Labourites and the people who joined them were out to destroy what I\u2019d done. They did destroy what I\u2019d done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"252b6f026eeed40cd89b37e7bb8b64a70e434644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/252b6f026eeed40cd89b37e7bb8b64a70e434644/0_0_6022_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Ken Loach film The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"567\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wind That Shakes The Barley, winner of the 2006 Palme d\u2019Or.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he ever feel he\u2019s too unforgiving? \u201cNo, because you\u2019ve got to be clear it\u2019s not personal, but if somebody consciously sabotages something because they are afraid of the consequences, that is unforgivable. And particularly in our business. If you\u2019re a politician, you can see there might be times when, to secure the greater good, you have to take a backwards step. That is a matter of tactics. But for people who make films or who are journalists, our function is to say these are the underlying ideas and principles. And this is what people have got to be judged on. That is at the heart of the play that Max Stafford-Clark killed, and was at the heart of the documentaries that the Labourite rightwingers censored.\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever think his career was over? \u201cYes. Towards the end of the 80s, I started to think about going back to the law, even though I had no qualifications and a very bad degree. I just didn\u2019t know what to do. Teaching film, I suppose. We had to take out loans, living a bit hand-to-mouth.\u201d He stops, apologetically. \u201cI mean, it was middle-class poverty! We were still in a house. But I couldn\u2019t see where I fitted in.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Next day, we meet again, this time at Loach\u2019s office. At the top of the narrow stairs is a framed poster for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099768/\">Hidden Agenda</a>, the 1990 film about state terrorism in Northern Ireland that heralded his comeback. Naturally, it caused a stink. Loach was accused of being an IRA propagandist and a British traitor by the film critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Alexander Walker</a>. It was also the first Loach film produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-o-brien\">Rebecca O\u2019Brien</a>, and the two have worked together ever since.</p> <p>He has continued to make film after film since then, winning award after award. At the heart of every movie, all made on small budgets and drawing on a hotchpotch of British and European money, there has been a cause; from the <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/membership-content?referringContent=news/2016/jul/15/looking-back-the-spanish-civil-war&amp;membershipAccess=PaidMembersOnly\">Spanish civil war</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/screen/story/0,6903,595331,00.html\">Land And Freedom</a>) to the Contra insurgency against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/06/1\">Carla\u2019s Song</a>), from trade union rights in the US (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/27/1\">Bread And Roses</a>: the only film he has made in North America) to Ireland\u2019s war of independence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/23/3\">The Wind That Shakes The Barley</a>) and, most of all, the struggle for work, dignity and justice (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107920/\">Raining Stones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sweet-sixteen\">Sweet Sixteen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/sep/25/lastnightstvitsafreeworl\">It\u2019s A Free World</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1998/nov/08/features.review7\">My Name Is Joe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/03/angels-share-ken-loach-review\">The Angels\u2019 Share \u2013 basically all of them</a>).

He prefers his actors to come with no baggage: the less familiar the face, the more believable the story. The one celebrity he has cast is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/eric-cantona\">Eric Cantona</a>, the eponymous hero of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-looking-for-eric-cantona-ken-loach\">Looking For Eric</a>, but Loach made the exception because Cantona plays himself in a one-off foray into magic realism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"194115de9608fbba1a922447c2bc5587acfb5356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194115de9608fbba1a922447c2bc5587acfb5356/947_91_2262_1956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Film director Ken Loach with wife Lesley Ashton (on left) and producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien at the 2010 Cannes film festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"865\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With wife Lesley (on left) and producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien at the 2010 Cannes film festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since Jim Allen\u2019s death, most of Loach\u2019s films have been written by Paul Laverty. At the occasional parties Loach reluctantly hosts (his 70th birthday, his 80th earlier this year), old collaborators such as producer Tony Garnett and writer Roger Smith mingle with newer ones. As he says, he doesn\u2019t fall out with friends and family easily.</p> <p>On the mantelpiece in the office is a monobrowed mask of Cantona, a picture of the three-legged dog that features in I, Daniel Blake, and the two Palme d\u2019Ors he has won (the first was for The Wind That Shakes The Barley). Above one is a red dog collar. I ask what it is. Loach giggles: \u201cThat\u2019s the Palme Dog, an award given to the most impressive dog in a film. We were given a lifetime achievement award for three-legged dogs.\u201d</p> <p>Now I\u2019m staring at <a href=\"http://www.movpins.com/big/MV5BMTI3MjA0NDA1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1NDgwMw/ricky-tomlinson-in-riff-raff-%281991%29.jpg\">a photograph of a naked</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ricky-tomlinson\">Ricky Tomlinson</a> in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100491/\">Riff-Raff</a>, playing a builder who has just treated himself to a shower in a posh apartment block he is working on. There always seems to come a point in a Loach film where a character sticks two fingers up at authority \u2013 whether in the form of Tomlinson\u2019s bottom or Daniel Blake graffiti-ing his name on the jobcentre wall. \u201cIt\u2019s a toss-up which is the more potent symbol of resistance,\u201d Loach says. \u201cRicky Tomlinson\u2019s backside or Daniel\u2019s graffiti? People fight back. People are not docile victims. In rightwing art, films, books, whatever, they like the poor as victims, because that is the politics of charity \u2013 the lady of the manor going around on Christmas. \u2018The poor are always with us, the order of society is fixed and we have to be kind to the poor.\u2019 Leftwing politics argues that poverty is a by-product of class society, and that people will resist it, and it is that resistance we want to value, to show, to celebrate. So Daniel Blake is not a supplicant, he\u2019s a man of dignity.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>First thing in the morning, I feel about 85.

He\u2019s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiative.\u201d In Trump\u2019s conclusion, \u201creporters of the New York Times, they\u2019re not journalists, they\u2019re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton\u201d.</p> <p>The Republican nominee denounced the media in more abstract terms in his rally in Charlotte, insisting that the press was responsible for \u201crigging the system\u201d as well as the coming election.</p> <p>The Republican nominee also insisted that he could not have sexually harassed Jessica Leeds, a businesswoman who said Trump groped her on a 1979 flight because Leeds was unattractive. \u201cBelieve me \u2013 she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.\u201d </p> <p>The candidate\u2019s campaign also <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/10/14/trump-camp-puts-forward-witness-to-refute-sex-assault-claim/\">rolled out an eyewitness</a> who claimed that he was sitting across from Leeds and Trump and that nothing ever happened. The witness, Anthony Gilberthorpe, an Englishman who would have been a teenager at the time that he said he was flying first class on the domestic US flight, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tory-child-abuse-whistleblower-i-3848987\">has also claimed</a> that he procured underage male prostitutes for British MPs and that Margaret Thatcher covered up the scandal.</p> <p>A campaign aide told the Guardian that Gilberthorpe was \u201cjust the beginning\u201d in their effort to fight back against the allegations of sexual misconduct.</p> <p>Trump denied all accusations against him and suggested that women coming forward might be motivated for \u201cfinancial reasons\u201d. He told the crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina, \u201cthese allegations are 100% false. They are made up, they never happened. When you have met tens of thousands people as I have ... it\u2019s not hard to find a small handful of people make false smears for personal fame, maybe financial reasons.\u201d</p> <p>The controversy over Trump\u2019s sexual misconduct towards women was launched last Friday when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">a 2005 tape emerged</a> of the Republican nominee discussing kissing and grabbing women by the genitals without their consent. After repeated questioning during Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">eventually said</a> that he had never engaged in such actions.

Referring to the second presidential debate in St Louis, he said: \u201cI\u2019m standing at my podium and she walks in front of me, she walks in front of me and when she walks in front of me, believe me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d Later, in Charlotte, he added of his opponent that \u201cshe was the most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency of the United States and her specialty has been, as you see over the years, it\u2019s character assassination\u201d.</p> <p>The Republican nominee eventually reverted to standard lines from his primary campaign after his teleprompter broke down on Friday night at a rally in Charlotte. Trump laid the devices on the stage before returning to old chestnuts, including his attack on the Obama administration\u2019s concern over climate change. \u201cObama thinks global warming is our biggest threat. I happen to think it\u2019s nuclear warming,\u201d Trump said. He also went to jab at former rival Jeb Bush, using the epithet \u201clow energy\u201d while going on a tirade about primary opponents who signed the RNC pledge to support the eventual nominee but are now not backing Trump.</p> <p>The day after Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/look-at-her-i-dont-think-so-trumps-defence-is-to-demean-his-accusers\">spoke in ominous tones</a> about global elites and Hillary Clinton meeting \u201cin secret with international banks,\u201d President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/politics/obama-cleveland-trump-come-on-man/\">bashed those comments</a> in a campaign trip to Cleveland. \u201cThis is a guy who spent all his time hanging around trying to convince everybody he was a global elite,\u201d Obama said, laughing. \u201cTalking about how great his buildings are, how luxurious and how rich he is and flying around everywhere. All he had time for was celebrities and now suddenly he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s a populist out there.

I take absolutely no satisfaction in what is happening on the other side with my opponent,\u201d Clinton said at a stop at a campaign office in Seattle. \u201cI am not at all happy about that, because it hurts our country, it hurts our democracy, it sends terrible messages to so many people here at home and around the world.

Divisions are being deepened that we\u2019re going to have to try to heal.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton has no public events scheduled Saturday as both candidates prepare for the final presidential debate to be held Wednesday in Las Vegas. Trump will speak at an event at a Portsmouth, New Hampshire, car dealership before holding a rally in Bangor, Maine. </p>",
  "<p>I struggle to think a more perfect union of medium and message than <strong>HyperNormalisation</strong>, Adam Curtis\u2019s new film for the BBC iPlayer. Though he\u2019s spent the best part of four decades making television, Curtis\u2019s signature blend of hypnotic archive footage, authoritative voiceover and a seemingly inexhaustible appetite for bizarre historical tangents is better suited to the web, a place just as resistant to the narrative handholding of broadcast TV as he is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/09/adam-curtis-donald-trump-documentary-hypernormalisation\">Adam Curtis continues search for the hidden forces behind a century of chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Safe in the knowledge that his audience now has the ability to pause and rewind at will, Curtis crafts a mammoth labyrinth of political storytelling in the film, his follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d epic Bitter Lake. Launching on Sunday, his 165-minute opus makes a feature of its sheer unwieldiness, as Curtis veers from social history to conspiracy theory via the odd rambling bar-room anecdote, like a man who\u2019s two-dozen browser tabs into a major Wikipedia binge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKUN1a2AHE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bvKUN1a2AHE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He argues that an army of technocrats, complacent radicals and Faustian internet entrepreneurs have conspired to create an unreal world; one whose familiar and often comforting details blind us to its total inauthenticity. Not wishing to undersell the concept, Curtis begins the film with a shot of a torch shining limply into a thicket, so that viewers find themselves literally unable to see the wood for the trees.</p> <p>From there, HyperNormalisation tracks a course to the present day, allowing Curtis to weigh in on Trump, Putin and Syria. But those expecting a snappy crash course in our chaotic world (\u201cYou won\u2019t believe how this veteran BBC film-maker explains the Islamic State! What happens at 156:34 will shock you!\u201d) clearly aren\u2019t familiar with his methods. The film may address some of today\u2019s most critical global issues, but it also allocates space to Jane Fonda, the fall of the Soviet Union and a supercut of pre-9/11 disaster movies. And unlike Curtis\u2019s earlier work for TV, HyperNormalisation refuses to drop the kind of storytelling breadcrumbs that might anchor a viewer in its overarching narrative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/24/adam-curtis-bitter-lake\">Adam Curtis: 'I try to make the complexity and chaos intelligible'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, the film embraces the peculiarities of online viewing, trusting that its audience \u2013 if confused \u2013 will skip back 20 minutes to refresh their memories, or supplement Curtis\u2019s argument with research of their own. If its colossal running time means it\u2019s unlikely to be watched in a single sitting, each viewer must decide for themselves how exactly to navigate the experience. For all Curtis\u2019s apparent dogmatism, it\u2019s his audience who have the final say.</p>",
  "<p>In my loft there is a red plastic B&amp;Q toolbox filled with makeup no longer fit for purpose, but that I\u2019ll never, ever throw away. There\u2019s a dried-out Body Shop eyeliner pen that my mother put in my Christmas stocking circa 1989, which I wore with cut-off Levi\u2019s and a lycra bodysuit to Cardiff\u2019s Square club. There\u2019s a pot of Clinique face powder in an unsuitable shade of pink that I saved at least six weeks\u2019 pocket money to buy before realising it made me look embalmed. There\u2019s the Rimmel lilac eye palette I was convinced made me appear 18; the apricot lip balm bought for me by fourth form squeeze Hywel White; and the Mary Quant eyeshadows I found in a dusty box in a discount chemist and thought I\u2019d won the lottery.</p> <p>These aren\u2019t just products. This isn\u2019t just a toolbox. It\u2019s a time capsule, and everything in it takes me back to a moment \u2013 a hope, a mistake, an achievement. These unassuming bits and pieces each have their own significance and collectively add up to something as potent as any long-lost cassette compilation. They\u2019re my beauty mixtape.</p> <p>Just as we chart life\u2019s journey through music, food and places, I also attribute the same importance and sentimentality to the beauty products I saw, touched and smelled all around me. The flipping of a lid on a bottle of <a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/lotion/johnsons-baby-lotion\">Johnson\u2019s baby lotion</a> immediately takes me back to my grandmother\u2019s living room, my clean pyjamas warming on the fireguard, the soothing hum of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj2y\">Antiques Roadshow</a> and the rattle of a twin tub washer in the background. I don\u2019t just remember my first kiss: I remember the Miss Selfridge Copperknockers lipstick smeared messily over my cheeks afterwards. My first ever gig was notable not only because it was The Smiths on their last tour, but because I\u2019d stolen my mum\u2019s Rimmel lipliner and <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/GIVENCHY-Ysatis-Eau-de-Toilette-Spray-30ml_35269/\">Givenchy Ysatis</a> perfume for the evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afc10799394d493104f6041c8b8aaeafce4fd5ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afc10799394d493104f6041c8b8aaeafce4fd5ea/24_24_4853_6066/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 30s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A memorable beauty product transports me to my nan\u2019s backstreet curl-and-set parlour, my teenage cabin bed, a school disco or my wedding day. It\u2019s the perfumes that gave us backbone for important job interviews that stay with us, the makeup chosen for a first date, the little luxury bought with a first pay packet. These are some of the lotions, potions, creams and powders that mean the most to me.</p> <h2><strong>Chanel No 5</strong></h2> <p>In perfume-nerd circles, saying that Chanel No 5 is your favourite perfume is as obvious as declaring Shakespeare and the Mona Lisa your favourite playwright and painting. But sometimes things simply are the best; there\u2019s no use being contrary.</p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t like No 5 (and many people don\u2019t: smell is a wholly subjective business), you should still respect this remarkable 94-year-old perfume \u2013 arguably the most recognisable beauty product of all time. It was created by the extraordinarily clever and talented Russian-French <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Beaux\">perfumer Ernest Beaux</a>, who made up 10 versions, numbering them one to five and 20-24. Superstitious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Chanel\">Coco Chanel</a> chose five, her lucky number. She packaged it in a typically unfussy flacon, inspired by men\u2019s toiletries and adorned with nothing more than a square label and simple type \u2013 a pretty subversive move in itself, at a time when luxury perfumes came in big, blowsy balloon-atomisers.</p> <p>The scent itself \u2013 powdery, fizzy, sexy and refined \u2013 is magnificent, whether or not it\u2019s your particular bag (impressively, it remains the world\u2019s bestselling scent).</p> <p>For me, though, it goes way beyond smell. Outside my immediate family, the most enduring relationship of my life has been with No 5. I discovered it at 12, and wore it with vintage Levi\u2019s and Smiths T-shirts at school discos; I spritzed it over my uniform when I ran away from home three years later. It moved to London with me when I had nothing but a PE bag\u2019s-worth of belongings; it lost my virginity with me, it came on my driving test. Naturally, it was a guest at my wedding. Some years later, broken, confused and tearful, I considered no other fragrance for my father\u2019s funeral.</p> <p>Nowadays, I wear No 5 perhaps once or twice a month (I love perfume too much to be monogamous); but when I have a big work day or a special occasion, I unfailingly turn to its strength, unflappable appropriateness and soft, welcoming femininity. No 5 is my backbone in a bottle, the loaded pistol in my knickers; with it, I am instantly bolstered and prepared for whatever life throws at me.</p> <h2><strong>Ponytail holders</strong></h2> <p>Does the word \u201cbobble\u201d mean anything to anyone under 35? I worry that it doesn\u2019t. For the rest of us, bobbles were hair elastics twisted into a figure 8 and clamped in the middle with metal.</p> <p>At each end was a brightly coloured plastic cube or ball, fed through the tightly-wound elastic loops to secure plaits, ponytails and bunches in place. Bobbles were sold by the pair in chemists and newsagents, on little perforated cards that were torn off a large display \u2013 just like Big D pub snacks, only without the underlying Page 3 boobs.</p> <p>My father, recently left by his wife, was tasked with doing my hair for school. He was so woefully inept that I spent each morning standing on a chair, listening to him swear as bobbles pinged, snapped and ricocheted, one after the other, out of his hands and against the kitchen wall.</p> <p>Marc Jacobs has often tried to revive the bobble \u2013 at both his own Marc label and while at Louis Vuitton \u2013 and each time, I\u2019ve been bemused at the willingness of fashion fans to pay more than \u00a3100 for something my father was ultimately forced to buy weekly from a local cash and carry.</p> <h2><strong>Mac Spice lip pencil</strong></h2> <p>When someone sits down to write the history of the nineties, they should do it in Mac Spice lip pencil. This reddy-brown liner became the Canadian-born brand\u2019s first hero product and was <em>the</em> makeup accessory of the supermodel era; it graced a hundred glossy magazine covers, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/oct/02/ethicalliving\">Linda Evangelista</a> was never without it (I\u2019m told she always conveniently needed to pee before shooting, then snuck on some Spice in the ladies\u2019 loo if the makeup artist had failed to). It became the look for a generation of girls like me, who thought it the height of sophistication to wear a lip pencil five shades darker than the lips it outlined.</p> <p>After making a pilgrimage to buy my first Spice in Harvey Nichols (Mac\u2019s only UK stockist at the time), and having nicked my mum\u2019s peach Covergirl lipstick, I debuted the look at a <a href=\"http:\">Salt-N-Pepa</a> concert in Newport leisure centre. The band failed to show up, but I didn\u2019t care because I felt a million dollars.</p> <p>Spice subsequently accompanied me to acid house clubs, to gigs and on dates with inappropriate men. It accessorised Kooka\u00ef hotpants, Lycra frocks from Pineapple, smiley T-shirts and red Kickers. I teamed it with fishnets, a velvet choker and a beret, and imagined myself in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_von_Unwerth\">Ellen von Unwerth</a> photoshoot. I wore it with jeans and a wide headband and felt like Bardot; with a football shirt and Adidas Gazelles, and thought I was Christy Turlington on the John Galliano catwalk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33477a5c3e1b47c94c421d67f79d887bcb63d364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33477a5c3e1b47c94c421d67f79d887bcb63d364/71_230_4836_6045/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes 40s look\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 40s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was far from any of these things, but now look back on Spice without a moment\u2019s regret: it\u2019s still an often-used part of my kit \u2013 though now I wear it with a matching lipstick and not a gloss the colour of Elastoplast.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Max-Factor-Creme-Puff-Powder-Compact_1542857/\">Max Factor Cr\u00e8me Puff</a></h2> <p>This powder is one of the first makeup items I was ever really aware of. As a tiny girl, I would sit next to my grandmother on the bus and, as we neared our destination, watch her reach into her handbag for a gilt Stratton compact housing a pan of Cr\u00e8me Puff. She\u2019d sweep the sponge over her nose and chin briskly before clicking it shut, but just long enough for the strong, sweet baby powdery-smelling particles to scent the whole top deck.</p> <p>That smell, unchanged in six decades, still does strange things to me. It smells of my nan, yes, but mostly Cr\u00e8me Puff just smells unapologetically of makeup (much as Dior lipstick does, or Bourjois powder rouge), at a time when makeup often smells of nothing at all.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t pretend to be state-of-the-art; it\u2019s an old-fashioned formula that made Hollywood actresses Ava Gardner, Vivien Leigh and Jean Harlow appear luminous on set. It continues to do the job extremely well today (though, sadly, its nostalgia is misplaced in a Caucasian-only shade range). It\u2019s perfect with retro red lips, black flicks and falsies; its full, layerable coverage also makes it a great way to skip foundation on a more natural face \u2013 just brush over moisturiser and concealer. It\u2019s a product I use rarely, but I would never pack a full kit without it. Sometimes, it\u2019s the only thing that will do.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/haircare/johnsons-baby-shampoo\"><strong>Johnson\u2019s baby shampoo</strong></a></h2> <p>My love of this product is merely notional, since I don\u2019t recall ever having it in the house as a child, despite two babies arriving after me. The first shampoo to use amphoteric cleansing agents, so gentle that they didn\u2019t sting the eyes, it seemed like something that would belong to the kind of family who had a purpose-decorated nursery, a wallpaper border to match the moses basket, a savings account opened and a school place lined up for a newborn. It wasn\u2019t for big chaotic families like ours, prone to bathing babies in the kitchen sink, complete with Fairy Liquid bubble beard and within reach of the bread knife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd334d425f18f2fa90ee44c637b0f4554e5d906b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd334d425f18f2fa90ee44c637b0f4554e5d906b/0_349_4912_6140/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes 50s look\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 50s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was decades later that I used <a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.co.uk/product/johnsons-baby-shampoo\">No More Tears</a> to wash my makeup brushes, and bought some in readiness for my first baby, when just owning the right supplies made me feel in control. Using it, I momentarily felt like a proper mum, despite the fact I was entirely at sea. I think this is why Johnson\u2019s has been deeply loved since 1936: when the disorienting, confusing, guilt-ridden, anxious (and ultimately wonderful) experience of motherhood strikes, it stands nobly by the side of the bath, as reassuringly experienced as a nanny, making you feel that everything will be OK.</p> <h2><strong>Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask</strong></h2> <p>Oh, Sisley, with your aloof, impenetrable French packaging, unknowable department store counters and your bonkers price tag that makes you inaccessible to the vast majority of beauty lovers: I wish you weren\u2019t so damned lovely. This is the mask used by supermodels after six weeks of sleepless and over-made-up skin. It\u2019s the mask reserved by makeup artists for only the best magazine covers and their gold-band clientele. It\u2019s the mask I give to women at their lowest ebb, when divorce, bereavement or illness has ravaged the body, mind and soul. Rich, luxurious, gentle and soothing, a 10-minute session with Black Rose Cream Mask is like your most well-off girlfriend taking you for a four-hour lunch and three bottles from the lower half of the wine list.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Old-Spice-Original-After-Shave-150ml_1323/\"><strong>Old Spice Original</strong></a></h2> <p>Launched in 1938, this is the smell from the backseat of my grandad\u2019s brown Austin Allegro as he drove me to Little Chef for the giddy treat of jumbo cod, chips, banana split and a free lollipop for clearing my plate. Its warm, not-too-strong but lasting spiciness is the smell of daytrips to Tenby, of candy-stripe brushed flannel sheets from the market, of a tiny metalwork room made from a cubby-hole under the stairs. It\u2019s the smell of the armchair where we took Sunday naps during the rugby, had cuddles and belly laughs in front of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149542/\">Victoria Wood\u2019s As Seen On TV</a>, where my grandad sat patiently as I stood on a stool behind him, tying bows, plaits, jewels and clips into his white hair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95c15dbddfd80abe9fc7b48b72631e5955a54eba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c15dbddfd80abe9fc7b48b72631e5955a54eba/365_529_4046_5057/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes models the 60s look.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 60s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old Spice is the scent of him trying to teach me long division when everyone else had lost patience, of very gentle flirting with the checkout ladies at Kwik Save, of seemingly endless chats with every Indian and Pakistani immigrant in Blackwood to practise his beloved Urdu and Burmese, learned during his time in Burma during the second world war. It\u2019s the smell that filled a silent room whenever I asked what had happened to his friends there. Old Spice is the smell of his old shirt worn over my ra-ra dress to wash the car, of well-thumbed Robert Ludlum novels, of huge cotton handkerchiefs, of an often empty wallet, of the green zip-up anorak bought via 20 weekly payments from the Peter Craig catalogue. Old Spice was there when I first saw Madonna on Top Of The Pops, when the miners went back to work, and when we sat under blankets at military tattoos, both of us weeping like newborns. Its absence was felt acutely when I last saw his face, eyes closed in the room of a hospice; when I got married and when my babies were born.</p> <p>Unlike so many other scents of my youth, Old Spice Original remains a gorgeous fragrance in its own right. I revere it not least because, as its early ad campaign asserted, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t be here if your grandfather hadn\u2019t worn Old Spice.\u201d</p> <h2>Sali Hughes\u2019 guide to four era-defining looks, decade by decade</h2> <h2><br></h2> <h2>How they wore it in the 1930s</h2> <p>The 1930s was a big decade for innovation. Elizabeth Arden invented her legendary <a href=\"http://www.elizabetharden.co.uk/elizabeth-arden-eight-hour-cream-skin-protectant-50ml/10026014.html\">Eight-Hour Cream</a> (a thick, medicinal-smelling moisturiser for the complexions of humans and the hooves of racehorses); <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Revson\">Charles Revson of Revlon</a> introduced the first opaque coloured nail lacquer and, consequently, the concept of matching lips and nails (the latter had previously been painted with transparent gloss); it was also the decade <a href=\"https://maxfactor.co.uk/heritage/the-max-factor-story\">Max Factor</a>, the man who invented the word \u201cmakeup\u201d, released Pan-Cake, the first matte, skin-coloured foundation, developed to flatter movie stars in previously challenging Technicolor. Ninety years on, it remains the world\u2019s fastest- and largest-selling single makeup to date.</p> <p>The 30s face was deliberately top-heavy: brows were shaved off and replaced with ultra-thin domes of brown pencil to make eyes appear huge, almost owl-like. Cheeks were flushed with creme rouge worn so high as to practically skim the undereye, while lips were made smaller in a rosebud shape. The overall effect \u2013 gloriously showcased by stars such as Josephine Baker, Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy and Marlene Dietrich \u2013 was extremely soft, romantic and feminine, despite the increasing emancipation of women and the trend for more androgynous haircuts and bone structures. It was a look that proved enormously influential in the 1970s, particularly to designers such as <a href=\"http://www.celiabirtwell.com/heritage/biography/\">Celia Birtwell</a> and Biba\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/biba,-barbara-hulanicki/\">Barbara Hulanicki</a>.</p> <h2>How they wore it in the 1940s</h2> <p>The makeup of the 40s is what most of us regard as a classic Old Hollywood look: matte, flawless complexion, sharply sculpted face contours, elegant black liner flicks, wide, pillarbox-red lips and soft-set hair. Its clean, bold, graphic simplicity worked beautifully on film, but also, for ordinary people: makeup was rationed throughout the decade, so the fewer products that were needed, the better (no makeup at all would be unthinkable: even the government urged women to \u201cput their best face forward\u201d in order to boost soldier morale and remain jolly themselves).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The limited colour palette of red, gold, beige, black, white and rose makes everything look more tasteful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pencils were most easily acquired, so brows figured hugely. In the early 40s, they were soft, paler in tone and rounded to run parallel with arched socket line shadow. Later on, in part thanks to film noir, they arched sharply, in parallel with feline flicked liquid liner on the lids (painted that way to make actresses look sleepily seductive).</p> <p>Despite the fact that 40s makeup is so easy to date through films and stars such as Lana Turner, Ingrid Bergman, Olivia de Havilland and my idol, Elizabeth Taylor, it remains, I think, the least faddish and most timeless beauty look.</p> <p>Forties features look like themselves: a little exaggerated, but mostly enhanced in moderation. It\u2019s a womanly, rather than girlish, aesthetic. The limited colour palette of red, gold, beige, black, white and rose makes everything look more tasteful, more refined. I cannot think of a lovelier way to make up.</p> <h2>How they wore it in the 1950s</h2> <p>The 50s look is perhaps now the most recognisable period look, partly owing to the influence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\">Mad Men</a> (all coral lips and teased chignons), but also to 50s pastiche pieces such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/grease\">Grease</a> (bouncy ponytails and extra-long falsies).</p> <p>The decade was certainly a pivotal one for the beauty and consumer industries generally. This was when salon culture really took off: women across all economic groups routinely visited a professional for a weekly set, and it wasn\u2019t at all unusual never to wash one\u2019s own hair (which was now generally worn shorter for ease of maintenance between appointments).</p> <p>The rise of the working woman meant that makeup looks varied and became more colourful according to outfit (pastel green, blue or lilac shadows were popular), and increased office work (as opposed to manual and factory jobs) made manicures a viable prospect for normal women. The elegance of the 40s didn\u2019t disappear, but certainly became glossier and sexier thanks to Marilyn Monroe, Dorothy Dandridge and Jayne Mansfield.</p> <p>Despite this, it was still frowned upon for a woman to buy her own perfume: she should wait to be gifted it by a man. American beauty entrepreneur Est\u00e9e Lauder got around the problem <a href=\"http://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/13093/9493/Product-Catalog/Fragrance/For-Women/Youth-Dew/Youth-Dew/Eau-de-Parfum-Spray\">by disguising her new scent, Youth Dew</a>, as a bath oil and undercutting the elite French perfume houses by some distance. Fifties women bought with impunity, loved it and a beauty icon was born; you can still buy the original oil today.</p> <h2>How they wore it in the 1960s</h2> <p>Sixties makeup is so much a part of British pop culture that it\u2019s unfairly become a cliche: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/jan/07/celebrity-portraits-by-terry-oneill-in-pictures\">Terry O\u2019Neill\u2019s</a> iconic images of Twiggy, saucer eyes trimmed top and bottom with long, spindly falsies. But while it was certainly revolutionary and hugely influential, this mod-ish style was specifically known as the London Look and adopted almost exclusively by young people. In an era obsessed with experimentation and increased sexual freedom, makeup looks were inevitably a little broader and more diverse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Of course, the 60s were a game of two halves, albeit unequal ones</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For me, the most interesting developments were in France, specifically on Paris\u2019s Left Bank and as part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave\">Nouvelle Vague movement</a>. The aesthetic here combined the sophistication and womanliness of the classic 60s look with the bold chic of London. It flattened or ruffled the meticulous coiffs of the former, appropriated the monochromatic eyes of the latter, discarded all gimmicks, and made 60s beauty an altogether sexier and more grownup affair. Brigitte Bardot\u2019s bed head, thick black swooshes of liner and pale, almost invisible pout, and Anna Karina\u2019s thick fringe and polished complexion remain as sophisticated and relevant now as they did then.</p> <p>Of course, the 60s were a game of two halves, albeit unequal ones, and the late 60s aesthetic was altogether different. Most notable was the Laurel Canyon hippie look: practically no makeup other than brightly coloured facepaint and naive illustrations on festival-goers and hardcore flower children. 1970s disco could not come soon enough.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited extract from Pretty Iconic: A Personal Look At The Beauty Products That Changed The World, by Sali Hughes, published next week by Harper Collins at \u00a326.

  "<p>Could national populism have reached its high-water mark in western politics. Perhaps globally? It may be too early to say, but some signs point to a pushback against rampant xenophobia, bigotry and the ruinous fascination with strongmen. The indications are fragile, but without doubt they are there.</p> <p>Take the US, Germany and France. Donald Trump has had a more successful bid for the presidency than anyone could have imagined a year ago, but his campaign now seems on the wane, damaged by Republican defections and his ramblings on women. The political death of Angela Merkel has been pronounced many times since the 2015 refugee crisis but the chancellor, arguably Europe\u2019s most forceful voice on inclusiveness, simply has no obvious challenger ahead of Germany\u2019s 2017 election. As France heads towards primaries next month, it\u2019s a centrist figure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a> (not Nicolas Sarkozy, who has embraced far-right themes) who leads the polls. This makes it more likely that Marine Le Pen will be soundly beaten in the second round of next year\u2019s presidential election (which she is all but guaranteed to reach).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It might be that populists have over-reached, or that memories of a dark past have come to the fore</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such signals have global significance. The US remains the single most powerful democracy in the world. A Hillary Clinton victory in November would mean an entirely different global environment to the one that would emerge if the US were to end up with a presidency of the type imagined in the 2004 Philip Roth novel, The Plot Against America, in which the pilot Charles Lindbergh defeats Roosevelt in the 1940 election.</p> <p>Germany and France might form an unbalanced couple, but they stand at the heart of European politics: what happens in their elections will largely define what can be salvaged of the EU project \u2013 arguably much more than Brexit negotiations will do. Britain\u2019s current political travails are a seen as a side show in Europe at the moment.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the continent, there are yet more signs of pushback. In central Europe, often described as a hotbed of parochialism and intolerance, illiberal politicians aren\u2019t entirely having their way. This month Poland\u2019s nationalist, ultraconservative government had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/05/poland-signals-u-turn-total-abortion-ban-protests-video-report\">backtrack on plans to curtail abortion rights</a> after thousands of women protested on the streets. And Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/hungary-future-europe-far-right-viktor-orban\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>, suffered a serious setback when his referendum on EU migrant quotas failed because of low voter turnout. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">The electorate snubbed him</a>.</p> <p>This may be dubbed the era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">post-truth politics</a> and cynical autocrats, but new forms of resistance to bigotry are also emerging. It may be that national populists have overreached (Trump\u2019s racist and misogynist antics); or that memories of a dark past and the need to avert political catastrophe have come to the fore (Germans wanting to counter the far-right Alternative for Germany, French citizens worried about Le Pen). It may be that groups are rekindling the spirit of democratic mobilisation (Polish women and the anti-Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski grassroots, who are such keen demonstrators). It may be that voter apathy also sends a message about policies that stigmatise outsiders (Hungary).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does this sound too optimistic? Precisely because there haven\u2019t been many reasons for optimism recently, it\u2019s important not to ignore what is potentially promising. Likewise, it\u2019s important to see how the connections between international affairs and domestic politics may not all play out in the populists\u2019 favour. Authoritarianism has thrown its weight around in recent years, but right now it\u2019s going through a bad patch.</p> <p>Take Russia. Whatever allowances some in the west might have sought to make for Putin in the past, the Syrian tragedy has made this much more difficult. To claim that Russia\u2019s air assault on Aleppo\u2019s population is no different from western interventions against Isis not only flies in the face of documented facts, it smacks of intellectual and moral disorientation.</p> <p>Geopolitics feeds into politics. Which means there is cautious hope to be drawn from the fact that Putin\u2019s Russia currently finds itself more isolated than it ever has been (only Venezuela\u2019s autocratic regime voted alongside Russia in the UN recently). Russia has been an active backer of populists in Europe and in the US. Putin sympathisers now find themselves having to keep awkwardly silent over the scandal unfolding in Syria, or having to repeat a propaganda line that many citizens may find hard to swallow.</p> <p>This is not to say that national populists or their authoritarian backers are about to be defeated or disempowered. The fuel that powers the far right has yet to be exhausted. But from Clinton\u2019s lead to the surprising strength of Europe\u2019s political centre-ground, and with the novelty of Russia being discredited on many fronts, the picture is not just doom and gloom for the democratically minded. If this is an interconnected world, then the pushback against national populism may be stronger than we think.</p>",
  "<p>The future is a funny place to live. A few years ago, I bought a lamp controlled by Wi-Fi. \u201cNo more getting up and switching things on for me!\u201d I thought, smugly. It was only once I\u2019d bought the lamp that I realised how tedious it is to get your phone out, unlock it, swipe through to the right app, open it, select the correct lamp and switch it on every evening.</p> <p>So I struck upon a brilliant plan. I saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter\">Kickstarter</a> for a physical button that links to your phone via Bluetooth and connects to Wi-Fi-enabled objects. I bought that, too, hooked it up to the lamp and stuck it on my wall.</p> <p>\u201cLook at this!\u201d I told my wife. \u201cNow I can turn it on without using my phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just spent \u00a3200 on a light switch.\u201d</p> <p>Since then we\u2019ve seen great progress in the world of home robotics, but is any of it actually life-improving? I decided to find out.</p> <h2>Test 1 <a href=\"http://www.myrobotcenter.co.uk/en_gb/entertainment-robots/surveillance-robots/sense-mother\">Sen.se Mother</a> home and family monitoring system</h2> <p>I have never read the robot marketing rule book, but I suspect page one simply contains the words \u201cDo not call your robot Mother\u201d. Because that\u2019s creepy, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s Norman Bates. It\u2019s stifling and overprotective. If there\u2019s a robot called Mother, then what does that make you? Is that what the robots want us to think: that we\u2019re all useless babies?</p> <p>Worse still, Mother is a vaguely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll\">matryoshka</a>-looking thing with a light-up face. You know it\u2019s working because it smiles at you. Two eyes and a mouth light up and leer at you in an unbroken rictus grin, day and night. During the testing phase, I found myself becoming more uneasy as evening approached, simply because I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of my living room being lit solely by the sinister glow of Mother\u2019s monstrous grimace.</p> <p>Why am I telling you what Mother looks like, rather than what it does? Simple. It\u2019s because I\u2019m still not entirely sure. It\u2019s the centrepiece of a range of keyring-sized sensors that you can use in any way you want. According to Mother\u2019s website, it will \u201chelp you feel better, gain peace of mind, know yourself and your environment and make life easier\u201d, but that all sounds like meaningless marketing hooey. Basically \u2013 and I\u2019m still only 75% sure I\u2019m getting this right \u2013 it monitors everything you do.</p> <p>Want to know how much you move about each day? Put a sensor in your pocket, and it\u2019ll track you. Want to know if your flatmate keeps going into your bedroom when you\u2019re out? Put a sensor on the door, and you\u2019ll get a text every time it opens. Want to see if anyone in your house is better at brushing their teeth than you, because you\u2019re some sort of psychopath? Put a sensor on everyone\u2019s toothbrush, and it\u2019ll measure the duration and regularity of everyone\u2019s toothbrushing activity, and then rank you. Want the Mother unit to make a weird noise whenever your kid plays with a specific toy, for no reason whatsoever? It does that, too, as well as solving all manner of other shriekingly mundane non-problems around the house.</p> <p>I did many of these things (except the toothbrushing thing, because I\u2019m an adult) but kept running into the same problem. Why? Why was I doing this? Why did I need to collect data about how much I move, or what happens when I\u2019m not here? I don\u2019t need a robot to tell me how well I\u2019ve been sleeping, because I\u2019m a normal person with a functioning perception of my own tiredness. And even its more useful functions, such as telling you when to take your medication, can be performed for free with the alarm settings on the phone you already own.</p> <p>Everything about Mother feels superfluous, apart from its nightmarish, unblinking, illuminated face, which is just upsetting. So if endlessly cataloguing your life into meaningless, context-free piles of data is your thing, buy Mother. If it isn\u2019t, and I\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t.</p> <p><em>\u00a3199.

One scene, however, has lived on; the one in which Bardem recounts an occasion when a knickerless Cameron Diaz performed an obscene act on his Ferrari\u2019s windscreen. Why am I telling you this? It\u2019s because I had the misfortune of operating the Ecovacs Winbot from inside my house while it cleaned my front window. But we\u2019ll come to that momentarily.</p> <p>I hate the Winbot. In theory, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s a large, heavy, suction-powered robot that\u2019s supposed to crawl all over your windows until they sparkle. In practice, it is a monumental pain in the arse. For starters, it requires a constant connection to a power source, which not only means you\u2019ll have cables trailing through your house, but also that you can\u2019t clean anything too far away from a plug socket.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the set-up, which requires the application of a cleaning cloth and a specific fluid right before you switch it on, preventing you from operating it from afar. If you have a regular-sized bay window, the whole thing becomes impossible to use: its turning circle is so great, it leaves a grubby line of dirt around the edges. Even if you take charge, overriding the automatic setting by using the remote control, it squeals and whines so alarmingly that you\u2019ll end up yanking it off the window and taking it indoors before the neighbours think you\u2019ve got a secret sex dungeon.</p> <p>Which brings me to how it looks from the other side of the glass. It\u2019s like a specific type of borderline-illegal Japanese pornography or, possibly, feeding time at the aquarium. You do not want to have the Winbot switched on if the vicar is coming over for tea. Bardem said of Diaz\u2019s car abuse in The Counsellor that, \u201cWhen you see something like that, it changes you.\u201d I know how he feels.</p> <p>Perhaps (and this is a big perhaps) if we lived in a place that had bigger windows, the Winbot would make a little more sense. There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8Us-KRVatU\">YouTube videos of it doing great work on patio doors</a>, for example.</p> <p>We do have spotless windows now. But this is because, in a fit of anger, I tore off Winbot\u2019s cleaning cloth and wiped them with it, using my own hands, like a caveman.</p> <p><em>\u00a3249.

In the end, we only had one, because I forgot that barbecues are expensive and disappointing and, if you\u2019re the schmuck who ends up doing all the cooking, extremely boring.</p> <p>My barbecue grill was dirty back then, so it pretty much borders on toxic waste a year later. It\u2019s blackened and lumpy and, I thought, doomed for the scrapheap. But the Grillbot promised to change that.</p> <p>Let me explain the Grillbot to you. It\u2019s a tiny circular robot, covered in rotating wire brushes. You pop it down on your barbecue, close the lid and let it do its business. However, where the Winbot is slow and methodical, this is absolutely frenzied. It\u2019s a terrier of a thing, a trapped chinchilla. It\u2019s a wasp in a jar, pinging about as fast as it can like a firework in a metal dustbin, bashing the dirt off the grill with sheer blunt force trauma. And, oh God, it\u2019s noisy.</p> <p>All this makes the Grillbot especially easy to like. It\u2019s so erratic, you can easily project a personality on to it: it\u2019s a scrappy kid, an overexcited toddler. I would love the Grillbot, were it not for the fact that it didn\u2019t actually clean my grill very well.</p> <p>It has three settings \u2013 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes \u2013 and even after half an hour of cleaning, it had only really scrubbed away at the top half of the grill. This is by design, since the Grillbot lacks the capability to clean the underside, but it\u2019s still less than ideal. The only way to solve it is to flip the grill and set it to work all over again. But that would mean subjecting everyone in the neighbourhood to a full hour of its berserk clanging, and even I\u2019m not inconsiderate enough for that.</p> <p>So I opted for plan B: taking the barbecue to the skip and cooking everything in an oven like an adult instead.

Partly because it was a radiator, and nobody in the history of the English language has managed to write entertainingly about radiators, but mainly because it arrived during the hottest summer in a decade, which isn\u2019t the greatest time to test a product that makes your house warmer. Still, here goes nothing.<br></p> <p>The SmartWave feels like a next-generation piece of kit. It\u2019s an electric radiator with an infrared sensor. Over a week, it monitors and registers all movement around it, slowly piecing together a picture of how and when each room is used. It then uses this information to switch itself on and off automatically.</p> <p>For instance, I start work at 6am. Over the course of its first week, the SmartWave grew to learn this, and started to heat my office at 5.30, to make it nice and toasty when I stumbled in each morning. In order to know it was working, I had to set it to a temperature warmer than the already quite warm ambient temperature of the room, which meant I had to spend the bulk of August eating Calippos naked in front of a fan; but that\u2019s hardly the SmartWave\u2019s fault.</p> <p>If you happen to break your routine by starting early or finishing late, the SmartWave\u2019s sensor will kick in to ensure the room is heated only when there\u2019s someone in it. And that\u2019s wonderful, because it\u2019s important to know you can transform any room in your house into an Amazonian sweat lodge in the height of summer simply by walking into it.</p> <p>In fact, I\u2019m so impressed with the SmartWave that I\u2019ve decided to get one of my own for the winter, when using it won\u2019t feel like some sort of terrible punishment for a crime I\u2019m not sure I committed.</p> <p><em>From \u00a3279.99.

It was one of the biggest disappointments of my life. The Roomba promised so much \u2013 I never had to vacuum again! \u2013 but delivered so little. Every day I\u2019d come home to find a giant plastic pizza choking on a shoelace, or stuck under a sofa, or banging into a wall again and again, with no discernible improvement in the state of my carpet.</p> <p>Rather than let this robotic idiot blunder around my living room for an hour a day, I decided to use a regular manual vacuum cleaner for 90 seconds once a week instead.</p> <p>The Dyson, though, is a vast improvement. It has a smaller footprint than my Roomba, so takes up less space. It runs on tank-style caterpillar tracks, so it\u2019s more manoeuvrable. It\u2019s more powerful, so it actually picks stuff up. And, best of all, I can control it from my phone. This means that if I\u2019m out, and my mum says she\u2019s coming over, I can press a button to send the Dyson into action and get a notification when its cleaning cycle has completed; I can rest safe in the knowledge that my mother won\u2019t know what a hideous slob I am.</p> <p>The texts from the vacuum are great in theory, but there are drawbacks. The first time I used it \u2013 after a torturous set-up that drove me to the brink of sanity \u2013 I soon received an error message. \u201cThere has been a problem,\u201d my phone said, which sent my mind into overdrive. Had it tipped over? Had it got snagged on a wire and pulled my television to the ground? Was something on fire? The lack of information was terrifying, like getting a text from a child reading: \u201cI\u2019ve been abducted, but try not to worry.\u201d I wanted to rush home and rescue it, the poor sweetheart.</p> <p>The error messages continue from time to time, but I have since used the Dyson enough not to worry. Error or no error, I know that things will be OK and my floor will be clean when I get home. My Dyson is quick and reliable, and smart enough to exorcise any lingering memories from the bad old Roomba days.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s starting to feel like part of the family; specifically the part of the family that we force into unpaid manual labour because we\u2019re too lazy to do it ourselves. It\u2019s Cinderella, basically, and I\u2019m an ugly sister. I will give this one up very, very reluctantly.</p> <p><em>\u00a3799.99.

This is because the Echo is very, very easy to use. It is basically a Wi-Fi speaker with a Siri-style assistant, but it feels like the butler you never knew you wanted. The Echo\u2019s personality is supplied by Alexa, another female robot, because apparently all robotics engineers have deep-set mummy issues. And you can ask her anything. Anything at all.</p> <p>At first, I guarantee that this will paralyse you. You\u2019ll find yourself looking up questions on the Amazon website. The first suggested question is: \u201cAlexa, why is the sky blue?\u201d So you ask that, and she tells you that the molecules of the atmosphere scatter blue light more than other colours.</p> <p>You then say, \u201cAlexa, play some Daft Punk.\u201d Miraculously, Alexa replies with, \u201cHere are the most popular Daft Punk songs from Amazon Music\u201d, and plays <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TOXw9zQCAc\">Fresh</a> from the Homework album.

She set alarms for me, reminded me to call my parents. The voice recognition is light years ahead of anything I\u2019ve used before. Soon I was calling out Alexa\u2019s name so casually that a visiting friend thought I was hiding a mistress in the living room.</p> <p>She slotted in so intuitively that I found myself wishing she could do more. I started asking the impossible: \u201cAlexa, turn on the TV\u201d, to no response. \u201cAlexa, where are my keys?\u201d The Echo now mainly functions as a world-beating music-delivery service, but in time requests such as this won\u2019t be beyond her.</p> <p>At one point, I got cocky and asked Alexa to pre-order the book I\u2019m writing, even though you can\u2019t yet make purchases on the Echo. Something got mixed up, and Alexa started playing a podcast I had recorded last year instead. Hand on heart, I spent 20 seconds convinced that Alexa had retrieved the manuscript from my laptop, finished it for me, and used my previous voice commands to piece together an audiobook. Now that would be a robot worth paying for.</p> <p>As it stands, the Echo is great. So great that I\u2019ve called my son Alexa twice, am going to do everything in my power to steal my test unit, and don\u2019t mind handing over huge wads of personal information to a faceless corporation.

Actually, I saw the movie at the time and wasn\u2019t astonished much. We were asked to be amazed that Yul Brynner, underneath his cowboy costume, was really a robot. It was like being asked to be amazed that when he played the lead in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/15/reel-history-king-and-i\">The King And I</a>, he was powered by a generator. He was that kind of actor: precise, but you could hear the valves fizzing.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t Yul\u2019s fault, and if he hadn\u2019t been so successful, I wouldn\u2019t dream of belittling him now. Elbows slightly extended to indicate the bulk of his lateral muscles, he carried himself with dignity right to the end. On location in Britain for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064328/\">The File Of The Golden Goose</a>, he had to arrive dramatically in Liverpool. They ran out of dough and pretended that London\u2019s Liverpool Street station was Liverpool, a pretence accomplished by covering up one end of a station name-plate with canvas. Yul, instead of downing tools, played the scene in full grimness mode, elbows dramatically flexed. Watching in awe somewhere in the cinematic dark \u2013 I was one of three paying spectators \u2013 I vowed that I would try to stay as cool as that when the god Chronos came for me.</p> <p>Showbusiness is tough, and anybody who breaks through deserves a nod of respect, especially when the river of time rises to wipe him out. That\u2019s why I so often give a polite mention to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/steven-seagal\">Steven Seagal</a>. Scattered all over the Los Angeles region, there are men pumping gas and washing cars who wanted to be Steven Seagal, too, but didn\u2019t have the magic.

Critics say Samarco \u2013 a joint venture between mining giants Vale and BHP Billiton \u2013 just wants to cover over the mess and reopen the mine.</p> <p>There\u2019s certainly a financial incentive to resume operations. In August BHP announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/bhp-makes-record-loss-after-commodity-rout-and-brazil-disaster\">record loss of $6.4bn</a> (\u00a35.2bn), due to the dam collapse as well as a slump in commodity prices. A month later Samarco said it wanted to restructure debts after <a href=\"http://www.samarco.com/en/investidores/\" rel=\"nofollow\">failing to make a $13.4m</a> payment.</p> <p>\u201cAll Samarco\u2019s effort is focused on a return to its activities and not on society and environmental recuperation,\u201d says Carlos Pinto, coordinator of a group of environmental prosecutors in the state of Minas Gerais, where the tragedy happened.</p> <p>Yet Da Silva says Samarco is doing a good job \u2013 and has quickly reopened roads and rebuilt a nearby bridge after the disaster. The company pays the rent for a nearby house where they live and has promised to build them a new home \u2013 just as it has agreed to build new communities to replace the villages destroyed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to hope for their goodwill,\u201d says Da Silva.</p> <p>Not all local residents share their optimism. Ivaldil de Souza, 73, farmed cattle on 300 hectares of land nearby until the mud flooded across his land and reached up to the veranda of the house. He has yet to receive an indemnity promised in August and is angry about the Samarco\u2019s planting of fast-growing plants to secure the mud around his house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb1d7d97248047723014270728f271e2e32c422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb1d7d97248047723014270728f271e2e32c422/0_0_4000_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivaldil de Souza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivaldil de Souza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dom Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey said would come and plant other things.

A Samarco spokeswoman says that planting on top of the mud was an emergency measure being monitored for its effectiveness to reduce erosion and the mud being swept away.</p> <p>Behind his house, where three metre-high tidemarks stain dead trees, Samarco workmen have secured the banks of a stream with netting and rocks, and rerouted it around what had been a lake.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did they change the river?\u201d De Souza asks.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In July, Brazil\u2019s federal environment agency Ibama published a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ibama.gov.br/phocadownload/noticias_ambientais/relatorio_fase_helios_operacao_augias.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> that criticised Samarco\u2019s environmental recuperation works and questioned its recovery of rivers, noting that at times their routes had even been changed. </p> <p>\u201cFrom the environmental point of view, this is worrying,\u201d says Gustavo de Oliveira, Ibama\u2019s general coordinator for recuperation in the area.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Samarco\u2019s spokeswoman said the company had recuperated 61 tributaries and endeavoured to keep to original courses. In some cases where the original route could not be found or the \u201chydrological dynamic\u201d determined a change, adjustments had been made. The company had spent 650m reais (\u00a3166m) on recuperation works by June this year.</p> <p>In March, Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton signed an agreement with the federal government for socioeconomic and environmental recovery work worth a total of around 20bn reais (\u00a35bn) over 15 years.</p> <p>The company will finance the recovery of 5,000 streams along the River Doce, reforest 10,000 hectares and restore another 30,000 hectares. In August it launched the Renova (Renew) Foundation to carry out the work. However, the agreement is now in legal limbo after a <strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>high court judge suspended the settlement. </p> <p>In May federal prosecutors in Minas Gerais <a href=\"http://fundaoinvestigation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched a separate legal action</a> for 155bn reais (\u00a340bn) in damages \u2013 a figure <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/may/04/bhp-billiton-compensation-brazil-dam-disaster\">based on the amount paid by BP</a> after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe tragedy of Mariana revealed a series of failures of planning, of control and of risk management,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement at the time. </p> <p>All parties have now begun a conciliation process. Samarco says it is continuing to meet the terms of the agreement while it awaits a resolution.</p> <p>And Samarco\u2019s problems are multiplying. In June, <a href=\"http://g1.globo.com/minas-gerais/desastre-ambiental-em-mariana/noticia/2016/06/pf-conclui-inquerito-da-tragedia-de-mariana-e-indicia-8-pessoas.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an investigation by Brazil\u2019s federal police</a> concluded the company knew the dam was at risk before it collapsed. Drainage was a problem, the report said, as was the constant heightening of the dam which was not properly monitored. The police recommended charges against eight people.</p> <p>In August, Samarco published an independent report commissioned from US law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. This deeply technical <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fundaoinvestigation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> concluded that the dam collapsed after the liquefaction of iron ore mining waste caused by the interaction between two types of tailings \u2013 sands and slimes \u2013 and \u201cunplanned occurrences\u201d during its construction and operation. A minor earthquake on the day of the disaster may have \u201caccelerated the failure process that was already well-advanced\u201d, the report concluded.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Samarco has already been fined 250m reals (\u00a364m) by Ibama and 112m reais (\u00a328m) by the Minas Gerais state government\u2019s environment agency, Semad. It is appealing all the fines and has yet to pay any of them, Samarco\u2019s spokeswoman says.</p> <p>More controversy surrounds Samarco\u2019s plan to secure the millions of cubic meters of mining waste still left in the complex \u2013 a series of dykes, of which three have been built.</p> <p>The fourth will flood part of the mud-covered area where the village of Bento Rodrigues once was.

The company says in a brochure for the Renew Foundation that it invested 9.1bn reais (\u00a32.3bn) in Brazil from 2011-2015 and paid 54% of tax revenues in the nearby town of Mariana.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon, unemployed men lounged around a colonial square in Mariana say tourism had failed to provide the jobs lost since Samarco stopped operating and people wanted to move on from the tragedy.</p> <p>\u201cThe city is divided.

The group blamed consumer ignorance and unjustified fears about contamination for failing to recycle containers used for bleach, household cleaners and other liquids. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe number of plastic bottles not being recycled is staggering and will increase further if we don\u2019t take action,\u201d said Alice Harlock of Recycle Now. \u201cHouseholders are often unsure if items are recyclable, especially from the bathroom, bedroom and living room.

On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/alibabas-singles-day-sales-up-60-to-94bn\">a single day in 2015</a> it rang up sales of \u00a39bn \u2013 double John Lewis\u2019s sales across the entire year. It will come as little surprise that the firm\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/19/jack-ma-profile-alibaba-powerful-humble-billionaire\">Jack Ma</a>, is China\u2019s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $29bn. So should we be junking Amazon and Argos and buying from AliExpress?</p> <p>After testing prices and delivery, my conclusion is \u2026 not for a long time yet. First impressions is that AliExpress is like Poundland on steroids \u2026 and then some. It is a gateway to every manufacturer in China, and flogs every conceivable consumer item at prices that fail to make any sense, especially given that delivery is usually included. Right now it\u2019s pushing Halloween: 66p for a full-size witch\u2019s hat; zombie scars for 72p; a scary clown mask (OK, maybe not) for \u00a36.82. Quite how a seller in Hangzhou produces and distributes it to your door for little more than the cost of a Royal Mail stamp is not explained.</p> <p>But Amazon it ain\u2019t. For a start, AliExpress is not a retailer itself, rather a giant marketplace for Chinese retailers to push their wares, with brands popular in the west notably absent. For example, try buying a laptop from Lenovo \u2013 a Chinese company \u2013 such as its Ideapad 100, which can be found on Amazon for \u00a3384. On AliExpress you can buy Lenovo motherboards, replacement keyboards, batteries etc \u2013 indeed almost everything to do with the laptop, except the laptop itself. At John Lewis, the electricals department is currently pushing GoPro Hero5 cameras, but on AliExpress they can\u2019t be found \u2013 although you will be offered page after page of GoPro steadiers, batteries, mounts and covers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/18/alibaba-and-the-40-facts-ipo\">Alibaba and the 40 facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But don\u2019t let that put you off entirely. Where AliExpress hits its stride is with the near-copies that Chinese factories knock out at ultra-low prices, and arguably ultra-low quality. There are no GoPros, but there are thousands of \u201csports action cameras\u201d starting at \u00a324, compared to GoPro\u2019s \u00a3159 at John Lewis.</p> <p>Are they counterfeits? Some are likely to be \u2013 while Alibaba says it is determined to stamp out the fakes, forums are littered with complaints around the issue. Even more worrying is the question of safety. There can be no guarantee that goods bought from outside the EU meet usual safety standards. It\u2019s not just electricals: children\u2019s toys bought directly from China may not meet European standards, and beauty products may contain harmful chemicals.</p> <p>Yet AliExpress has its fans. On a forum on the moneysavingexpert website one user says: \u201cMy purchase history from AliExpress is now over 150 purchases. I love it! My wife has a huge collection of office dresses from Ali, costing \u00a310-\u00a315, good quality and fit. Tools, many watches, trainers. One of my recent favourites? A set of real ceramic-blade kitchen knives at \u00a37.82 delivered!\u201d</p> <p>Others are much less enthusiastic: \u201cI will never ever buy again directly from China. Complete waste of time and money. Everything I\u2019ve bought has gone straight into the bin. Last item to be delivered stank so badly I am surprised Royal Mail delivered it! As they say \u2013 buyer beware,\u201d said another.</p> <p>But in an age when Amazon and Argos fight it out to deliver to your door within an hour, with talk of drone \u2019copter drops, the most striking thing about AliExpress is its delivery times. Most items are marked for delivery in 60 days\u2019 time. That\u2019s right: 60 days.</p> <p>That alone will mean that the bosses at Amazon and Argos are unlikely to be trembling at the challenge from AliExpress, for now at least.</p>",

There\u2019s something about the crumpled-duvet landscapes of emerald field and heathery fell, about encountering its sudden, Shire-like valleys threaded with muscular peat rivers, about stumbling across a ruined abbey at dusk or drinking well-earned beers by pub fires that forever sticks in the head and the heart.</p> <p>One of the national park\u2019s greatest pubs has to be the <a href=\"http://www.craven-cruckbarn.co.uk/\">Craven Arms</a> at Appletreewick (mains from \u00a38.95). Tucked into the fell above the river Wharfe, and the halfway point of a wonderful 11-mile circular walk from Grassington, it could go toe to toe with anywhere for the title of \u201cperfect country pub\u201d. Its standout feature is the \u201ccruck barn\u201d at the back, built by the owner using traditional materials and the first in the dale for 400 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f690001a9028c05de877bc3de3d4a683cf5783be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f690001a9028c05de877bc3de3d4a683cf5783be/0_99_5241_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Craven Arms, Appletreewick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Craven Arms, Appletreewick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reaching the Craven Arms from the village of Grassington is akin to drinking a neat shot of the dales. Cross the river by the photogenic Linton Falls before climbing up to the gorgeous hamlet of Thorpe through fields threaded with dry-stone walls. Carry on through meadows where lapwings \u201cpee-wit\u201d and a stray foot may startle a hare into pulsing flight, to reach Burnsall and what has to be the most photographed bridge in the dales. Cross the river and follows signs for Appletreewick, and find the Craven Arms close to the Mock Beggar Hall, an old monastic grange that testifies to the village\u2019s connection to nearby Bolton Abbey. Below the pub is a fantastic wild swimming spot.</p> <p>The five and half miles back are most atmospheric if you time it to arrive in Grassington at dusk. Return to Burnsall and then take the historic riverside path north-west, crossing the suspension bridge at Hebden. Along the way enjoy woodsmoke from farmhouse chimneys; the quiet grandeur of autumnal trees bronzed by late light, ground mist around their roots; the gurgling rush and calm of the river; and the unforgettable, far-reaching fells, alive with the bleats of Swaledale sheep, gradually bruising into black.<br><strong>Rob Cowen, author of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/common-ground-371780.html\">Common Ground</a> (Cornerstone)</strong><strong>, voted one of the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/11/readers-top-10-best-books-of-2015\"><strong>Guardian readers\u2019 top 10 books of 2015</strong></a></p> <h2>2 Nidd Gorge, North Yorkshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"872da68aa4408dce33df9efb8d36f69c61a09258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872da68aa4408dce33df9efb8d36f69c61a09258/125_144_4483_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nidd at Knaresborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nidd at Knaresborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: carriagesknaresborough.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 7</strong>\u00bd<strong><sup> </sup>miles<br></strong><strong>Time: 3</strong>\u00bd<strong> hours<br>Start/finish: Sustrans 67 junction with Bilton Lane (Google <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B000'48.6%22N+1%C2%B031'23.7%22W/@54.0135,-1.5254387,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.0135!4d-1.52325\">map</a></strong><strong>/OS Explorer 297)<br>Grade: Moderate<br>Refuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.carriagesknaresborough.co.uk/\"><strong>Carriages</strong></a><strong>, Knaresborough</strong></p> <p>Autumn\u2019s true glories are experienced through trees: the turning of leaves from greens to fiery yellows and reds; the wine-black clusters of berries and nuts on drooping branches; the musty smell of leaf litter as shafts of sun streak the damp earth.</p> <p>A mile from my home on the northern edge of Harrogate, a thickly wooded river gorge provides the perfect stage to witness the splendour of autumn.</p> <p>Enter the Nidd Gorge by following the <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-67\">Sustrans cycleway 67</a> from Bilton to the defunct Victorian viaduct that spans the river.

Today, a handful of fishermen catch whelks, scallops and lobsters, and the Ty Coch is the only pub. The landlord, Stuart Webley and his family are the beach\u2019s last permanent residents.</p> <p>An excellent circular (clockwise) walk to Porthdinllaen starts in the inland village of Edern (park by the Ship Inn). Take the footpath from the wooden footbridge next to the butcher\u2019s shop along the western bank of the Afon Geirch. Head north in the direction of the coast. Cross the stream in front of Porthdynllaen Farm and follow it until you meet the farm track, then hard left until you pick up the footpath again on the other side of the farmyard.</p> <p>Pass by the campsite at the farm and follow the river, now on its eastern bank, to the rocky beach at Abergeirch. Stone steps will take you to the cliff path \u2013 the Wales Coast Path. A colony of seals live off the rocks at Life Boat Bay. When mackerel are in season it\u2019s not unusual to see a pod of dolphins from the cliff. Rejoin the beach at Life Boat Bay and follow the coastal path to the Ty Coch.</p> <p>Proud to be a chip-free zone, the Ty Coch provides carbs in a superb list of bottled craft beers, two local tap beers and a revolving guest ale. The saloon is the beach, with a great view of Anglesey, though you\u2019d be surprised how many people can cram inside when it rains.</p> <p>After lunch continue along the beach to Morfa Nefyn, enjoying superb views of the Yr Eifl hills until the road meets the beach below the Cliffs pub. Walk straight over at the crossroads, then turn right at the T-junction and take the footpath along the B4417 back into Edern. An alternative that avoids the road is to cut back across the golf course and follow the coastal path back to Abergeirch.

Great jetties like a giant\u2019s extended fingers reach out into the river all around you, and then, having probably not seen a soul all morning, you arrive at a caravan park and then a pub in quick succession. You are just about halfway round the island by now. The pub is the <a href=\"http://www.thelobstersmackcanveyisland.co.uk/\">Lobster Smack</a>, which is pretty and wooden from the outside and cosy inside, with decent pub grub. I had the beer-battered cod and chips (\u00a39.79) accompanied by a pint of Blue Moon (without a slice of orange).</p> <p>If the landscape so far reminds you of every TV adaptation you\u2019ve ever seen of Great Expectations and you\u2019ve found it hard to shake off the image of Abel Magwitch being pursued across the mudflats, it\u2019s not surprising, because the Lobster Smack is the inn in the Dickens novel.</p> <p>Restored, press on round the island, following the sea wall with its vibrant graffiti, past the lure of amusement arcades and a small beach.

At Holkham, you can turn through the pines on to the vast beach and head back east to Wells, keeping an eye out for seals, oystercatchers and other shoreline birds.</p> <p>This is a particularly beautiful walk in autumn and winter, when there is more chance of encountering coastal wildlife. And even when it is busy, you can always find space and solitude on such an expanse of sand. My tip is to check the wind direction when you set out and do this walk whichever way round ensures that the wind is at your back on the beach.</p> <p>After a fresh-air buffeting, you may require some refreshment; follow the coast path up the channel to the port of Wells, where you\u2019ll find the <a href=\"http://albatroswells.co.uk/\">Albatros</a> moored on the Quay.

To the east \u2013 in fact the pub is within earshot of the waves \u2013 is the North Sea shoreline itself.

There are ample opportunities for parking in the village centre, including a pay-and-display car park. Then follow the coastal path all the way through the Winterton Dunes reserve and along the landward side of the dune crest. The dunes and woods on the landward side are great for fungi in autumn (including the beautiful if poisonous fly agaric) and sparrowhawks or buzzards in all seasons.</p> <p>After four miles you see the hamlet of Horsey with the Nelson Head. It is the first and only settlement north of Winterton. A clear track on the left, leading west into Horsey, takes you directly to it. For an alternative way back stroll by the sea and take in the fabulous gatherings of grey seals as you walk.

Now I can both exercise my right to roam on the same route, and stop off for lunch at the <a href=\"http://thebeehiveinn.co.uk/\">Beehive Inn</a>.</p> <p>The first leg of the Combs Moss circuit is a great appetite builder. It is easy to park at the top of Lightwood Road in Buxton and then follow the gravel track to the bridge over a small brook and climb the steep facing slope. Then the route heads north-east, following the boundary line and gritstone wall, known as Black Edge, that divides the heather moorland from the upland pastures.</p> <p>There is a sense of vast space, and glorious panoramas over the heart of the Peak District. Then, as you drop off the moor to the minor road above Combs Edge and make the last steep descent into Combs and the Beehive itself, you can see, way to the north, the darker contours of Kinder Scout and Blackden Moor.</p> <p>Avoid retracing your steps by undertaking a post-lunch slog up Ridge Lane and back to Buxton via the old Roman road, completing an eight-mile circuit. You are largely walking on an old gravel and even tarmac road, so the route is clear and the going good. It gets a little tougher with the years and over time I have seen the lapwings and curlews decline, yet the buzzards, peregrines and ravens are all increasing. The varied colours of autumn vegetation seen from this route are particularly rewarding.</p> <p>The fact that the Beehive pub is always busy despite being down a virtual cul-de-sac in the tiny hamlet of Combs, miles from the main road, speaks volumes for the friendliness of the staff and the reputation of its food and cask ale. It has a wood-lined interior with superb photos of local Derbyshire characters on the walls. There is an excellent range of traditional fare, but the generous Sunday roasts (\u00a310.95; the beef was particularly good last time) with heaps of fresh vegetables have long been a stock choice of my family. <strong>MC</strong></p> <h2>17 North Down Coastal Path, County Down</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"206d9e519eef1c2e4f88c8b19f28c54a075356d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/206d9e519eef1c2e4f88c8b19f28c54a075356d1/0_258_5128_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crawfordsburn country park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawfordsburn country park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 9 miles <br>Time: 4 hours <br>Start: Holywood station (Google </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B038'37.6%22N+5%C2%B050'21.3%22W/@54.6437771,-5.8414307,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.643774!4d-5.839242\">map</a></strong><strong>/OSNI Discover 15</strong><strong>)<br></strong><strong>Finish: Seacliff Road, Bangor (Google </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B039'56.2%22N+5%C2%B040'00.1%22W/@54.6656121,-5.6688897,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.665609!4d-5.666701\"><strong>map</strong></a><strong>) Grade: Moderate<br></strong><strong>Refuel: </strong><a href=\"http://saltydogbangor.com/\">The Salty Dog</a><strong>, Bangor</strong></p> <p>From busy marinas to quiet sandy beaches, this trip along the shore of Belfast Lough is a celebration of the coastal diversity a stone\u2019s throw from the capital.

Avoid temptation at the start, however, and instead follow the riverside path around the back of the restaurant.

Many politicians and commentators, she told her audience, had found \u201cyour patriotism distasteful, your concerns about immigration parochial, your views about crime illiberal, your attachment to your job security inconvenient\u201d. But the only mention of an elite came in an earlier passage about the many \u201cpeople in positions of power\u201d who behaved as if they had \u201cmore in common with international elites than with the people down the road, the people they employ, the people they pass in the street\u201d. And then she added: \u201cBut if you believe you\u2019re a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere.\u201d</p> <p>In one or two paragraphs, she had taken aim at various kinds of elites and allegedly elitist attitudes, some antithetical to others and the most awkward of them probably invented for the sake of political balance \u2013 for which politician or commentator has ever openly complained about the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of a worker\u2019s attachment to job security?</p> <p>Two broad categories had been conflated and confused. First came the rich and greedy international elite, who ran businesses that didn\u2019t pay proper taxes and treated their workers badly. Second came a social and cultural elite who peered down their noses at the illiberalism and flag-waving of the classes below.</p> <p>Both groups could be smeared as citizens of nowhere \u2013 \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d in the antisemitic jibe of Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union \u2013 but other than that they have little or nothing in common. Ruthless billionaires on the one hand, condescending academics on the other: together, May implied, they had alienated the larger part of an electorate that felt wronged and ignored.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new in her diagnosis. Shortly before he died in 1994, the American historian and moralist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/obituaries/christopher-lasch-is-dead-at-61-wrote-about-america-s-malaise.html\" title=\"\">Christopher Lasch</a> wrote an eloquent charge sheet against similar targets in his posthumously published book The Revolt of the Elites. He mainly described the United States, but his analysis illuminates many other parts of the world (including the land of Brexit) as well.</p> <p>What went wrong? Lasch: \u201cThe general course of recent history no longer favours the levelling of social distinctions but runs more and more in the direction of a two-class society.\u201d What he called the \u201cdemocratisation of abundance\u201d \u2013 the expectation that each generation would be better off than its predecessor \u2013 was giving way to a society of rising inequalities.</p> <p>How did this happen? When the idea that the masses were riding the wave of history faded away. The radical movements of the 20th century have failed, and the industrial working class, once the mainstay of the socialist movement, has been weakened to the point where, in some of its former strongholds, it barely exists anymore.</p> <p>Who are the elites? \u201cThose who control the international flow of money and information, preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher learning, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus set the terms of public debate.\u201d</p> <p>A Marxist could have written those last words; the Daily Mail, in its anti-Philip (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784214/Still-working-hard-Sir-Shifty-Philip-Green-relaxes-shore-family-luxury-yacht-docks-Monaco.html\" title=\"\">Sir Shifty</a>\u201d) Green and anti-metropolitan moments, could almost have written it.</p> <p>As a social critic rather than an ideologue, Lasch is hard to place on the left-right spectrum. Sometimes he might be depicting the present-day dilemma of a constituency Labour party in the north of England, as when he points out that the class once regarded as the most likely to support a revolution has many members with political instincts more conservative than those of their radical would-be leaders.</p> <p>Elsewhere he could be describing a way of London living that in 1994 still lay a dozen years in the future: \u201cAmbitious people understand \u2026 that a migratory way of life is the price of getting ahead \u2026 \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 suits them to perfection, conjuring up an agreeable image of a global bazaar \u2026 Theirs is essentially a tourist\u2019s view of the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Daily Mail\u2019s portrayal of remainers as truculent and bitter has a few grains of truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading Lasch at this time of crisis in British history is also valuable as a caution. He writes that when the common folk confront well-meaning initiatives from above, their resistance provokes an outburst of \u201cthe venomous hatred that lies not far beneath the smiling face of upper-middle-class benevolence\u201d.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think of myself as upper-middle-class, but that might be a caricature of my emotions when, say, I watch Brexiteers on Question Time. The Daily Mail\u2019s portrayal of remainers as truculent and bitter has a few grains of truth. Nobody can look at something they see as a catastrophe and not despair of the people who caused it.</p> <p>Speaking of whom, let us count the public schools and the frequent mention of the same university. Nigel Farage (Dulwich College), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/daniel-hannan-the-man-who-brought-you-brexit\" title=\"\">Daniel Hannan</a> (Marlborough and Oxford), Douglas Carswell (Charterhouse and UEA), Mark Reckless (Charterhouse and Oxford), David Cameron (Eton and Oxford), George Osborne (St Paul\u2019s and Oxford), Boris Johnson (Eton and Oxford), Michael Gove (Robert Gordon\u2019s College and Oxford), John Redwood (Kent College, Canterbury and Oxford), <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3636261/For-30-years-senior-Tory-BILL-CASH-derided-tirelessly-warning-EU-corrupt-superstate-dominated-Germany-events-prove-right-case-against-Brussels-behemoth.html\" title=\"\">Bill Cash</a> (Stonyhurst and Oxford), Matthew Elliott (Leeds Grammar and LSE), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> (Durham School and Oxford).</p> <p>That looks like an elite to me. More than that \u2013 it looks like a ruling class. In its whiteness, maleness and connectedness it could have ruled Britain in 1955. I imagine its members not as a caricature but as an old-fashioned cartoon: boys in school caps and short trousers lighting a little firework labelled \u201cSovereignty\u201d next to a huge pile of tinder marked \u201cAll Our Discontents\u201d. As <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8638598/Terry-Thomas-played-the-cad-toperfection.html\" title=\"\">Terry-Thomas</a> used to exclaim in the films of those days: \u201cWhat a shower! What an absolute shower!\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I think it is fair to say that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics\">Paralympics</a> have changed perceptions for the better in linking disability and sport. We have become used to watching elite athletes win medals and represent their countries in front of large crowds, and they just happen to use wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, or be of short stature, or have hearing and visual impairments.</p> <p>But what happens when we change \u201csport\u201d to \u201csex\u201d? Does awareness and education exist in the same way?</p> <p>Inclusive and accessible sex education certainly did not exist when I was at school \u2013 apart from, perhaps, putting a condom on a banana. We are aware that disabled women, in particular, are almost three times as likely to be sexually abused than their non-disabled peers and yet those of us with disabilities are still entering lessons and workshops that are not designed for us. There are few, if any, subtitled and audio-described videos, information is usually not easy to read or understand, and the bodies in these videos and photos rarely, if ever, reflect disability of any kind, further alienating those of us classed as less than normal, and often less than attractive.</p> <p>My twin sister and I were born 10 weeks early with cerebral palsy and I became a wheelchair-user at the age of nine after corrective surgery on my legs.</p> <p>Like many of my friends, I have been in situations where I felt vulnerable sexually, but one in particular was exacerbated by my disability. I am well able to stand up for myself, but I was in a taxi, with my wheelchair in the boot, and the taxi driver was totally inappropriate and very suggestive. Knowing that my disability hindered me in dealing with his approaches was horrible. I decided to keep talking politely to him in the hope that I could distract him through small talk, which I did, until he dropped me off.</p> <p>I reported him, but it highlighted the difficult situations you can find yourself in sexually if you have a disability.</p> <p>Children and teenagers are constantly told to respect themselves and others, but if you are disabled, it is likely that many of the adults in your life might never consider you as a sexual being, meaning that the usual safety advice and strategies are rarely discussed. You are doubly vulnerable if you can\u2019t physically remove yourself easily from an awkward situation.</p> <p>I have been fortunate enough to have great sex and talk about it, but it wasn\u2019t easy for me. Before losing my virginity pretty late, when I was 19, my main concern wasn\u2019t the act itself, but the positions that would be possible without causing a great amount of pain. I also worried that the passion would totally disappear after a bit of inevitable planning.</p> <p>There were very few helpful answers on the internet, so that left one avenue: laughing and crying with my auntie and sister on a Sunday afternoon as we went through possible positions together \u2026 no doubt a story that will surface should I ever get married.</p> <p>Although it was a giggle and it helped a lot \u2013 thanks, guys \u2013 it is also tragic that I had to get myself in such a panic over something that is supposed to be sexy and fun because I simply didn\u2019t know where, or who else, to turn to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people think that disability isn\u2019t sexy or, worse, having sex with someone who has a disability is seen as wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most people, disabled or not, go through a transition stage in which they are suddenly aware of others\u2019 attraction to them and their desire to be attractive in return. For me, this happened quite late and I tended to leave getting the guys to my sister, who was, I have to say, very successful at it (she is about to get married). Although I\u2019m over the moon for her now, I can see that I was pretty jealous of her victories with boys at the time.</p> <p>As I have got older, learned that necessary patience and had great sexual experiences, I have also grown in confidence, although I still have some way to go until I am as self-assured as I would like to be when it comes to romance and intimacy.</p> <p>Some people still think that disability isn\u2019t sexy or, worse, having sex with someone who has a disability is seen as wrong. There is also still a sense that if you have a disability, you are ill or frail, neither of which fit into the traditional idea of what we consider sexually attractive in our society.</p> <p>But change is coming and I am proud to be a part of that.</p> <p>My sexual experiences have resulted in an awareness of myself as a woman that no one can take away \u2013 and that is a great place to be, disability or not. But it is important to remember that those experiences don\u2019t come easily for young disabled people. For so many years, I have had more important things than being sexy to concentrate on. Other teenagers tend not to have to think twice about whether they are able to go on school trips, or prove they can go to university \u2013 physically travel there, rather than just reach the required academic standards, find accessible accommodation and work out travel arrangements.</p> <p>My confidence has been boosted enormously by taking control of my life, and this has helped me in my job as a travel writer. When I volunteered at London 2012, I sat next to Sebastian Coe at a press conference and asked him for 15 minutes of his time and all the contacts he could give me. He, in turn, mentioned me in his speech at the closing ceremony for saying that the Paralympic Games had \u201clifted the cloud of limitation\u201d for those with disabilities.</p> <p>I went on to do a two-year consultancy with MetroRio on accessible underground travel and wrote an accessible-travel guide to Rio de Janeiro with Lonely Planet in preparation for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I am the founder and one of the directors of <a href=\"http://mypurplecompass.co.uk/\">My Purple Compass</a>, a company that encourages people with disabilities to travel far and wide, journeying out of their comfort zones.</p> <p>I also work with <a href=\"http://enhancetheuk.org/enhance/\">Enhance the UK</a>, which, through <a href=\"http://enhancetheuk.org/enhance/the-love-lounge/\">the Love Lounge</a>, is providing the sort of information I would have loved as a teenager. Change is slow, but it is happening, and we are able to help others to discuss important issues, such as the positions and pain worry I had years ago, through to whether disclosing a disability on an online dating site is a good idea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/14/lets-take-the-initiative-to-start-a-sexual-revolution-for-people-with-disabilities\">Let's take the initiative to start a sexual revolution for people with disabilities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sex education for disabled children and teenagers must be taught in schools as a matter of course, and parents and other family members can play a big part by making it as important for disabled people as for everyone else. More sexually active disabled people in popular culture would also help to change all those perceptions of disabled people, and illustrate that we enjoy sex as much as anyone.</p> <p>Although being a disabled woman is currently what my work is based on, I\u2019m much more than a girl in a wheelchair. I have the same tatts, tinted hair and love of fashion as many women my age, and I hope that others see that as well as the wheelchair. I am learning that disability and sex are not mutually exclusive and I love the journey that comes with it.</p> <p><em>As told to Joan McFadden</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Help and guidance on sexual matters for people with disabilities is available at </em><a href=\"http://enhancetheuk.org/enhance/\"><em>enhancetheuk.org/enhance</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Hello, my name is Adam and I think I\u2019m guilty of being a self-serving arsehole. Truth can hide in full view. Bad things then happen because no one saw them in time.

Matt and I miss you so much.\u201d It\u2019s a scene that had played out many times when Helen was alive and was almost comfortingly familiar.

In the US, I would stay in swanky-wanky hotels, indulging myself as self-justified compensation for not being at home (a $25 bottle of bejewelled mineral water in one of Donald Buffoon\u2019s tasteless towers comes to mind).</p> <p>I am painting this vile picture because, after Helen was diagnosed but was still well, I think I was treating these trips like a mini-holiday from her illness. This nearly cost me the chance to say goodbye. I arrived home on a&#xa0;Friday to hear from her consultant. \u201cWe worried that Helen could have died on Wednesday \u2026\u201d This from nowhere, and more hit and miss news than it should have been. I\u2019d nearly failed to be with&#xa0;Millie and Matt on the dreadful journey of understanding and acceptance around their mum\u2019s deathbed.</p> <p>Now, months after Helen\u2019s peaceful passing with my holding her hand and talking of our love, I am still using the excuse of the facile crap of business imperatives to take time out from my grief and responsibilities. Why I see it now I don\u2019t know, but it is screamingly obvious and I hate myself. Before any kind, sympathetic soul thinks I\u2019ve done nothing really wrong, this is not even the bad bit.</p> <p>Far worse is the travelling\u2019s effect on the kids now that Helen has gone. When Millie says, \u201cWe miss you, Dad\u201d, she is sparing me the full truth of, \u201cWe miss you, Dad, but we absolutely hate someone else having to come to look after us because it re-sharpens the pain of losing Mum.\u201d</p> <p>So every time I make a yellow-bellied retreat under the guise of work, am I dragging the kids backwards to the grief of their mum\u2019s death?</p> <p>So complete is my sense of self-loathing that it makes the next bit a&#xa0;piece of cake. I\u2019ll never fly anywhere again for work or spend more than a&#xa0;couple of nights away from the children for anyone.</p> <p>I talk this through with a friend who works in HR, but not for my employer. \u201cYou realise you\u2019ll have no job?\u201d she says. \u201cClients won\u2019t make allowances, and your performance will drop off if you can\u2019t make the meetings.\u201d</p> <p>She is right, of course. My employers&#xa0;have been so supportive since Helen\u2019s death, but clients will reject a global bloke who fails to fly and&#xa0;doesn\u2019t deliver.</p> <p>The harsh but brilliant truth is that I really don\u2019t fucking care. Yet&#xa0;more bravado, but I&#xa0;really mean it. Cancer\u2019s masterclass in life\u2019s fragility, my insight into my own selfishness and the kids\u2019 upset, means it feels right because it is right.</p> <p>Counsellor Ruth looks at me wide-eyed when I tell her. \u201cAdam, your wife\u2019s died, and you\u2019ve bought a house, you are sweating it about your health and are choosing to endanger your job. Just how much more stress do you need?\u201d She sounds calm, but her eyes flash nutty-professor scale. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not. The die is cast. Awareness and self-loathing are powerful drivers and a new sense of purpose surges through me. I\u2019ll focus on nurturing the kids to be the people Helen hoped for \u2013 no less, in truth, than I promised her as she lay dying.</p> <p>I wonder what else I may be qualified to do. Maybe I will feel less gung-ho when money is tight, but now I\u2019m happy \u2013 this is the next step to our new life.

  "<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, my great-great-great-grandfather, <a href=\"http://www.winchesterguns.com/news/articles/150-years-of-winchester.html\">Oliver Winchester,</a> founded the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in New Haven, Connecticut. His pride and joy was the revolutionary Winchester repeating rifle, one of the first guns to fire rounds repeatedly, taking away the cumbersome need to stop and reload. The Winchester became an icon of the American frontier \u2013 used by cowboys, Native Americans, outlaws, sheriffs and even President Theodore Roosevelt. As the settlers went steadily westwards after the civil war, the Winchester was their weapon of choice \u2013 it became known as the Gun that Won the West, celebrated in celluloid numerous times by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu0h3GRBQ-U\">gun-toting John Wayne</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D5_0cMzFVw\">youthful Jimmy Stewart</a>.</p> <p>Used by the Turks in their 19th-century battles against the Russians, and by the Mexicans in their uprising against the French-backed emperor, the Winchester became known around the world. The company\u2019s officials were always wary of having a history of their beloved rifles written \u2013 we don\u2019t want dead buffalo and Indians on every page, observed my great-great-uncle Ed Pugsley, the chief engineer.</p> <p>My introduction to the Winchester came on a hot August afternoon in 1987, more than a century after Oliver Winchester had started manufacturing his rifles. Visiting my American relatives in Connecticut, we fired tennis balls from an adapted elephant gun into the sparkling waters of the Long Island Sound, just for the fun of it. My great-aunts, legend has it, would fire the tennis-balls at intruders who ventured too close to their family compound.</p> <p>We were having a high old time at the family compound in Branford, Connecticut, which had been built by Oliver\u2019s daughter Jennie and her husband, Thomas Gray Bennett. As a distant family member from London, I had a dim idea of what the Winchester repeating rifle was, having watched a healthy dose of westerns on TV during my early 70s childhood. And as a former air cadet in east London, I learned to fire a .22 rifle and a .303 \u2013 but always on a shooting range, in a highly restricted environment. And here were my relatives merrily shooting tennis balls into the blue yonder, with guns inside their summer houses \u2013 it was an introduction to the gun culture of America, so very different from that back home in Britain.</p> <p>My grandmother Molly, who inherited a not-inconsiderable sum of money as the great-granddaughter of Oliver, married an Englishman and left her family in New England for Cambridge, England. She was ambivalent about the legacy of the Winchester, and would occasionally grunt disapprovingly about gun money, shaking her head. As a child, she took me to CND rallies in Cambridge, and we watched deeply alarming videos about Hiroshima. A strange juxtaposition, the gun heiress turned fervent supporter of nuclear disarmament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9/768_141_2127_2741/776.jpg\" alt=\"Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CS Fly/Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That visit to my American clan stayed with me as I went off to university. I began to read all I could about Oliver Winchester and his rifles. He was born a penniless farm boy, trained as a carpenter building flying buttresses in churches, successfully patented a bestselling shirt collar, and then decided to invest his considerable cash in guns just as the US civil war was looming. When my husband and I moved with our sons across the Atlantic in 2004, my interest in all matters Winchester increased. We bought the caretaker\u2019s cottage on the family\u2019s summer estate of Johnson\u2019s Point in Connecticut, and the idea of writing a book about these mysterious descendants of yesteryear evolved.</p> <p>As I was learning about my Winchester heritage, I was reporting for the BBC on the phenomenon of mass shootings in America. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/sandy-hook-classroom-massacre\">Sandy Hook elementary school massacre</a> in 2012, when a gunman killed 20 young children, six adults, his mother and himself, I arrived to witness a scene of unbearable agony. In this picture-perfect Connecticut town, not far from where Winchester built his repeating rifles, Christmas trees had been put up in memory of every dead child. I stood outside the temporary mortuary where the bodies of the murdered six- and seven-year-olds lay, and wept, imagining how I would feel if my own six-year-old was inside.</p> <p>At school, my children learned what they called \u201chuddle drills\u201d \u2013 what to do if someone is having a really bad day, as my then seven-year-old son explained brightly. I told him reassuringly that I didn\u2019t feel that he would ever have to do a huddle drill for real. In the wake of Sandy Hook, Congress failed to pass even modest gun-control legislation, such as ensuring background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows.</p> <p>As the descendant of a dynasty created by manufacturing weapons of war, writing a book has forced me to examine my own feelings on the topic. One of our relatives, Sarah Winchester, was supposedly so racked with guilt and haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester that she started building a house in California because a medium advised her that endless building would appease the dead. Construction only stopped when she died. Thousands flock every year to the bizarre <a href=\"http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/\">Winchester Mystery House</a>, pulled in by the irresistible tale of guns and guilt. There is scant truth to the myth \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.</p> <p>I am fascinated by the Winchester legacy, but I don\u2019t feel responsible for or guilty about the past. I see our family as a thread in the tapestry of America\u2019s history. There is no airbrushing over the brutality of the settling of America\u2019s west, in which guns were central. The Winchester was deployed to kill Native Americans defending their historic lands \u2013 and yet they also used the rifle with devastating effect, most notably at General Custer\u2019s last stand. African Americans also embraced the Winchester as a defensive weapon in the bloody period after the civil war, in which lynching was common. \u201cA Winchester rifle should have a place of honour in every black home,\u201d as the civil rights crusader Ida B Wells wrote in 1892. And so the Winchester was used for many different causes during a violent period.</p> <p>As a soon-to-be dual US and British citizen, it is hard not to be struck by the starkly different approaches to gun control. When I was growing up in Britain, strict gun laws were passed in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/20/archive-1987-hungerford-massacre-michael-ryan\">Hungerford massacre in 1987</a> and then additional legislation was passed after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/14/dunblane-massacre-scotland-killing\">Dunblane school killings</a>. In the US, where the second amendment provides a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the debate is very different. Although opinion polls suggest the public supports controls on the sale of assault weapons and background checks for everyone who buys a gun, the National Rifle Association has so far lobbied successfully against these measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec/0_0_2693_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hillary Clinton is running in favour of what she calls commonsense gun control, while Donald Trump is staunchly against her proposals. Why such different approaches in two countries sharing a common language and heritage? Guns were embedded in the culture of America at the time of its violent revolutionary war against England, and used to expand the territory of the new nation.</p> <p>When the question of gun control in the US came up in the 1970s, the surviving Winchester relatives were staunchly opposed. But then they had never been fans of Uncle Sam having a say in their business. In the 1890s, when men at the Winchester factory were regularly blown up as they mixed the explosive primer used in the ammunition, my great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, perfected a system where the men mixed the primer using mirrors to keep themselves at a safe distance. He was most pleased to have kept meddling factory inspectors at bay through his own ingenuity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/25/kids-guns-and-the-american-way\">Kids, guns and the American way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, it was heavy-handed government-administered contracts that led to the end of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company as a family concern. When the first world war loomed into view, my great-grandfather, Winchester Bennett, was at the company helm. A highly strung man, he had suffered from nervous anxiety for much of his adult life and was nursed throughout by his devoted wife, Susan. Winchester, named after the gun, was not equipped to deal with the rigours of wartime production and had to leave the company just as the factory was gearing up to produce millions of rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of rifles for the allied wartime effort. Bennett was later treated for addiction at a Connecticut facility specialising in patients with psychiatric disorders.</p> <p>His father, Thomas Gray Bennett, though he was nearly 80, came back on to the company board at this time of personal and professional crisis. Thomas Bennett never approved of doing business with the US government, which insisted on fixed-price contracts. As the costs of labour and materials skyrocketed because of wartime demand, Winchester made less and less money. By the time the war ended, the company was millions of dollars in debt. A wild plan to diversify into selling products \u201cas good as the gun\u201d followed, and the company used the excess factory space left over from the war to manufacture ice-skates, penknives, fishing rods, washing machines, cutlery and all manner of household items. The scheme was a monumental failure and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company went into receivership in 1931.</p> <p>A special summer home is the legacy of the company for our generation. As I rake the beach for oyster shells, if I narrow my eyes I can conjure up the image of a cowboy out west galloping on his horse, his trusty Winchester at his side. The great-aunts have passed on now, but I can still hear the echo of their laughter as they fire the tennis-ball gun out into Long Island Sound.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Winchester: Legend of the West by Laura Trevelyan is published by IB Tauris, \u00a320.

  "<p>Large-scale batteries to store energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/hand-over-control-of-my-fridge-to-an-energy-company-no-thanks-say-brits\">devices that switch themselves off</a> are likely to be key technologies for keeping the UK\u2019s lights on while shutting down old coal and nuclear plants, an influential committee of MPs has said.</p> <p>The threat of blackouts has receded for this winter after scares earlier in the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/14/winter-electricity-blackouts-risk-recedes-says-national-grid\">National Grid said on Friday</a>, citing a reprieve for Yorkshire\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/02/eggborough-power-station-to-close\">Eggborough coal-fired power station</a>, as well as greater flexibility from companies with big energy requirements.</p> <p>But the respite will be brief unless further action is taken, warned parliament\u2019s energy and climate change select committee. The MPs recommend investment in two major areas: on the supply side, energy storage; and on the demand side, efficiency technologies that smooth out peaks in usage, for instance by switching devices off and on and running them at lower power at times.</p> <p>Angus MacNeil, chair of the committee, said: \u201cThe government must get a move on and encourage the energy market to embrace smart technological solutions like energy storage and demand-side response. There is an incredible opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in these disruptive technologies, yet our current energy security subsidies favour dirty diesel generation over smart new clean tech solutions.\u201d</p> <p>The committee also called for sweeping reforms to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/concerns-uk-electricity-market-reforms\">government\u2019s regulation of the energy market, which include a \u201ccapacity market\u201d</a> for ensuring there is sufficient electricity supply and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/reform-electricity-market-unworkable\">contracts awarded to suppliers through an auction</a>. While these systems were supposed to reward renewable energy companies and reduce the carbon emitted by electricity generation, in practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/diesel-farms-built-subsidies-national-grid-auction\">some of the main beneficiaries have been generators using diesel oil</a>, which is one of the dirtiest forms of generation but very flexible.</p> <p>Redrawing these regulations could benefit cleaner generation such as wind farms and solar power, as well as newer technologies such as large-scale batteries and systems to manage energy, called demand-side response.</p> <p>John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, backed the call for reform: \u201cThis report from a cross-party group of MPs is an urgent wake-up call for Theresa May\u2019s government. It\u2019s embarrassing that Britain, one of the world\u2019s leading economies, has to hand out taxpayer-funded subsidies to clunking old coal plants and highly polluting diesel generators to keep the lights on. The right mix of renewable energy, battery storage and efficiency measures offers a much better alternative.\u201d<br></p> <p>The technology available to manage demand and increase efficiency is growing fast, according to Friends of the Earth, and the cost of it is also falling. But government support \u2013 such as reforms of the current regulations \u2013 would increase its uptake, with beneficial effects. </p> <p>Simon Bullock, campaigner at the charity, said: \u201c[These technologies] are a massive economic opportunity for the UK. They\u2019re essential to build the smart, flexible, clean electricity grid we need in the 2020s, and they reduce our reliance on fossil fuel plants for backup power, and can help lower people\u2019s bills.\u201d</p> <p>Companies involved in demand-side response technology say that, after decades of development, it is now at a stage where it can play a big role in energy efficiency, which will help to reduce demands on electricity supply. </p> <p>Patrick Liddy, director of EnerNOC, one of the companies developing such tools, said: \u201cDemand-side response technology is mature [and] provides many benefits for the UK, including engaging heavy energy users such as factories, commercial property and public sector estates in keeping the network balanced. Current UK energy policy was originally written with generation in mind, so it\u2019s only right that now we have the demand-side technology available, [the UK should] evolve our approach.\u201d</p> <p>The report, entitled The Energy Revolution and Future Challenges for UK Energy and Climate Policy, is the last from the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/energy-and-climate-change-committee/\">energy and climate change committee</a>. The latter will be dissolved and future reports on energy and climate change will come from the committee that reports on the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/decc-abolition-major-setback-for-uk-climate-change-efforts\">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> (BEIS). </p> <p>That will mean far fewer parliamentary reports on the UK\u2019s energy and climate change policies than in the past, as the new BEIS committee will have a far broader remit, covering all of the UK\u2019s industry, business and commerce. Past reports, from a cross-party committee of MPs that was until last year <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-tim-yeo/136\">chaired by a Conservative former minister</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/17/national-grid-needs-overhaul-say-energy-committee-mps\">have often criticised government policy</a>.</p> <p>In the report, the MPs also warn that the risks of Brexit to the UK\u2019s energy supply must be taken into account as a high priority. They highlight, for instance, the risk that collective EU systems will be discarded - for instance, a collective agreement to help any nation at risk from a sudden shortage in gas supply, such as that which might be threatened from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for BEIS, responding to the committee\u2019s findings, said: \u201cThe capacity market ensures that our families have a secure energy supply at a fair price that they can rely on.</p> <p> \u201cWe are fully committed to a low carbon energy future and the potential benefits that new technologies such as storage could bring to this. However, for the capacity market to work effectively it relies on flexible technology that is ready to be deployed\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Fig trees can be found in many places in the world, their bright-green, fleur-de lis-shaped leaves providing a welcome dappled shade. In Britain, they grow abundantly, but seldom bear much fruit unless enclosed in a walled garden. The leaves, however, are exactly what I\u2019m after. In California, we wrap the large leaves around freshly caught fish to be grilled on an open fire or baked in the oven. In the sweet kitchen, we gently wash the leaves of any dusty pollen and dunk them into pots of cream or milk to infuse and turn into custards and ice-creams.</p> <p>The flavour of the fig leaf is difficult to describe \u2013 it is somewhere between a fig and a coconut.

It is a relative of rhubarb, and in many countries the whole groats are toasted and cooked like a delicious, fragrant rice. Milled, it is a tasty alternative grain flour.
