Researchers from WWF and the Zoological Society of London compiled the report from scientific data and found that the destruction of wild habitats, hunting and pollution were to blame.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/582932115227889/\" data-alt=\"Video\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F582932115227889%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders.</p> <p>The collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">Anthropocene, a proposed new geological era</a> in which humans dominate the planet. \u201cWe are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,\u201d said Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, in a foreword for the report.</p> <p>Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, said: \u201cThe richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse.\u201d </p> <p>He said humanity was completely dependent on nature for clean air and water, food and materials, as well as inspiration and happiness.</p> <p>The report analysed the changing abundance of more than 14,000 monitored populations of the 3,700 vertebrate species for which good data is available. This produced a measure akin to a stock market index that indicates the state of the world\u2019s 64,000 animal species and is <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6206/241.full\">used by scientists</a> to measure the progress of conservation efforts.</p> <p>The biggest cause of tumbling animal numbers is the destruction of wild areas for farming and logging: the majority of the Earth\u2019s land area has now been impacted by humans, with just 15% protected for nature. Poaching and exploitation for food is another major factor, due to unsustainable fishing and hunting: more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/worlds-mammals-being-eaten-into-extinction-report-warns\">300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction</a>, according to recent research.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/oct/27/worlds-wildlife-being-pushed-to-the-edge-by-humans-in-pictures\">World's wildlife being pushed to the edge by humans - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pollution is also a significant problem with, for example, killer whales and dolphins in European seas being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/uks-last-resident-killer-whales-doomed-to-extinction \">seriously harmed by long-lived industrial pollutants</a>. Vultures in south-east Asia have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/06/diclofenac-india-cattle-vultures\">decimated over the last 20 years</a>, dying after eating the carcasses of cattle dosed with an anti-inflammatory drug. Amphibians have suffered one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/16/amphibians-terrifying-extinction-threat\">greatest declines of all animals due to a fungal disease</a> thought to be spread around the world by the trade in frogs and newts. </p> <p>Rivers and lakes are the hardest hit habitats, with animals populations down by 81% since 1970, due to excessive water extraction, pollution and dams. All the pressures are magnified by global warming, which shifts the ranges in which animals are able to live, said WWF\u2019s director of science, Mike Barrett.</p> <p>Some researchers have reservations about the report\u2019s approach, which summarises many different studies into a headline number. \u201cIt is broadly right, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts,\u201d said Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University in the US, adding that looking at particular groups, such as birds, is more precise.</p> <p>The report warns that losses of wildlife will impact on people and could even provoke conflicts: \u201cIncreased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/10/agriculture-and-overuse-greater-threats-to-wildlife-than-climate-change-study\">Agriculture and overuse greater threats to wildlife than climate change \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, some species are starting to recover, suggesting swift action could tackle the crisis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/11/number-of-tigers-in-the-wild-rises-for-first-time-in-over-100-years\">Tiger numbers</a> are thought to be increasing and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37272718\">giant panda has recently been removed</a> from the list of endangered species. </p> <p>In Europe, protection of the habitat of the Eurasian lynx and controls on hunting have seen its population rise fivefold since the 1960s. A recent global wildlife summit also introduced new protection for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">pangolins</a>, the world\u2019s most trafficked mammals, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/wildlife-summit-cracks-down-on-illegal-rosewood-trade\">rosewoods</a>, the most trafficked wild product of all.</p> <p>But stemming the overall losses of animals and habitats requires systemic change in how society consumes resources, said Barrett. People can choose to eat less meat, which is often fed on grain grown on deforested land, and businesses should ensure their supply chains, such as for timber, are sustainable, he said. </p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,\u201d Barrett said. Politicians must also ensure all their policies - not just environmental ones - are sustainable, he added.</p> <p>\u201cThe report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cMy hope though is that we don\u2019t throw our hands up in despair - there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Last year the world\u2019s governments finally got their act together on climate change, agreeing to limit global warming to well under two degrees. To meet this commitment, we need a rapid global transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The fossil fuel age is over.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The new era, powered by renewable energy, will be swept in on a massive wave of investment. According to Beyond Zero Emissions\u2019 report, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://[http://renewableenergysuperpower.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Renewable Energy Superpower</a>, the world will invest $US28tn in renewable energy and energy efficiency in the next 20 years. </p> <p>But Western Australia risks being left behind. Here investors have poured more than $100bn into liquefied natural gas (LNG) over the past decade yet the state has little to show for it. Another $60bn is slated for LNG development, but with current low gas prices, the sense of that investment is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-21/lng-gas-bust-slashes-tax-revenues/7649336?pfmredir=sm\" rel=\"nofollow\">questionable</a>. Energy consumers fork out for coal-fired power that goes unused and endure endless debate about grid privatisation. Meanwhile Western Australia\u2019s electricity-related emissions are rising, just as almost all other states are managing to reduce them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/01/new-generation-wave-energy-could-it-provide-one-third-of-australias-electricity\">New generation wave energy: could it provide one third of Australia's electricity?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The irony is that Western Australia should welcome the dawn of the renewable energy era. The state\u2019s enormous resources of sunshine, wind and wave mean it could become a renewable energy superpower of the future. Our report shows how Australia\u2019s world-beating renewable energy resources represent a huge economic opportunity. Incredibly the report shows that in Western Australia alone, there is enough wind and solar, available at competitive prices, to provide almost 9% of the world\u2019s energy every year. In other words Western Australia has more renewable energy than fossil energy. </p> <p>There are in fact signs of life in Western Australia. For example, Perth start-up <a href=\"http://powerledger.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Ledger </a>is trialling software enabling neighbours to trade energy between homes \u2013 an Australian first. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/01/new-generation-wave-energy-could-it-provide-one-third-of-australias-electricity\">Carnegie Wave Energy</a> is conducting one of the world\u2019s most successful wave energy projects, generating power for the naval base on Garden Island. Carnegie has recently won funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) to help develop its CETO wave energy technology which could attract interest from around the world.</p> <p>Opportunities in the renewable energy era extend beyond the energy sector. In a low carbon world, a cheap and plentiful supply of renewable energy will attract energy-intensive industries. With its abundant mineral resources, Western Australia could become the world-centre for zero carbon metals like steel and aluminium. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/26/sorry-josh-frydenberg-gas-is-not-the-cleaner-alternative-to-coal\">Sorry Josh Frydenberg, gas is not the cleaner alternative to coal | Blair Palese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What can Western Australia do to seize this opportunity? Firstly, like <a href=\"http://www.act.gov.au/our-canberra/latest-news/2016/may/100-renewable-energy-for-canberra-by-2020\" rel=\"nofollow\">the ACT</a>, the government needs to set a target of 100% renewable electricity. Such a target will attract investment and stimulate development of local technologies that could be sold to the rest of the world. Secondly, the government should set up an innovation fund for the development and commercialisation of new energy solutions. With Arena\u2019s funding slashed, it is vital that the Carnegies of the future are not thwarted by lack of investment. </p> <p>The government should also call a halt to the expansion of the gas distribution network. There\u2019s nothing gas does for us that electricity can\u2019t do more efficiently. Government and business should work together to encourage the uptake of high-efficiency electric appliances such as hot water heat pumps. At the same time, electric transport should be promoted. BZE has shown that a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bze.org.au/electric-vehicles-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\">complete transition to electric cars in 10 years is affordable</a>, and would reduce dependence on foreign oil. </p> <p>The reward for this type of forward-looking policy would be investment, jobs and a head-start in renewable energy era.

If you spend your entire life on dry land, your chances of being attacked by a shark are precisely zero, assuming no aquarium mishaps or errant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado\">sharknados</a>.<br></p> <p>What we really need to do is adjust the number of shark attacks by the number of people who are actually around coastal waterways \u2013 the number of surfers, ocean swimmers, snorkelers, and so on.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/14/shark-nets-dont-enclose-swimmers-they-catch-and-kill-sharks\">Shark nets don't enclose swimmers \u2013 they catch and kill sharks | Leah Gibbs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are at least two surveys that cover these activities, the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4177.0\">Participation in Sport and Physical Recreation survey</a>, run by the ABS, and the <a href=\"https://sls.com.au/publications/\">National Coastal Safety Report</a>, published by Surf Life Saving Australia and conducted by Newspoll.<br></p> <p>Both reports vary wildly in their estimates of people participating in each activity, so I\u2019m going to use the ABS survey which, although it doesn\u2019t survey beachgoers specifically, has a higher sample size and far less year-to-year variation.<br></p> <p>Adjusted by the number of people participating in each activity shows the rate of shark attack per person is still quite small, but higher than the previous rate covering the entire population:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1NOaCl0nvdcGac7mlCrdBe2Mv5hy5mzkmqniXbY_WfS0\" data-alt=\"table: adjusted rate by activity\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1NOaCl0nvdcGac7mlCrdBe2Mv5hy5mzkmqniXbY_WfS0\">table: adjusted rate by activity</a> </figure>  <p>The adjusted rate also ranks diving and snorkelling higher than surfing, whereas surfing generally accounts for the highest number of shark attacks in total. And these figures would be still lower again if only looking at fatal attacks.<br></p> <p>The risk might also vary further with location, as <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/10/how-many-people-do-sharks-kill-australia-each-year\">certain areas have higher numbers of shark attacks than others</a>.<br></p> <p>One study that looked at the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941575/\">risk of shark bites in Western Australia</a> found the estimated risk varied considerably with region and activity. \u201cMetropolitan Perth beach summer/autumn bathing less than 25m from shore in water less than 5m deep\u201d was estimated as at least 50 times safer than cycling (based on the risk of a serious or fatal cycle crash), whereas \u201coffshore diving and surf sports off Perth, during winter/spring\u201d had a similar risk to cycling.<br></p> <p>So, given all of this, if you swim infrequently the chances of being attacked by a shark are higher than you might have thought but still miniscule. If you\u2019re a surfer, the chances are slightly higher again \u2013 but a shark attack is still a rare occurrence.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s close financial ties to Energy Transfer Partners, operators of the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline, have been laid bare, with the presidential candidate invested in the company and receiving more than $100,000 in campaign contributions from its chief executive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/25/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-arrests-journalists-filmmakers\">Over 120 arrested at North Dakota pipeline protests, including journalists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html\">financial disclosure forms</a> show the Republican nominee has between $500,000 and $1m invested in <a href=\"http://www.energytransfer.com/default.aspx\">Energy Transfer Partners</a>, with a further $500,000 to $1m holding in Phillips 66, which will have a 25% stake in the Dakota Access project once completed. The information was disclosed in Trump\u2019s monthly filings to the Federal Election Commission, which requires candidates to disclose their campaign finance information on a regular basis. </p> <p>The financial relationship runs both ways. Kelcy Warren, chief executive of Energy Transfer Partners, has given $103,000 to elect Trump and handed over a further $66,800 to the Republican National Committee since the property developer secured the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination.</p> <p>On 29 June, Warren made <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201610129032391099\">$3,000</a> <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201610129032391098\">in donations</a> to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.

  "<p>The leading constitutional lawyer George Williams has warned Australia\u2019s campaign finance system is \u201cbroken\u201d \u2013 and he has proposed a major overhaul to ensure the federal system of donations and disclosure is no longer vulnerable to \u201cexploitation\u201d.</p> <p>In a submission to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/turnbull-government-launches-sweeping-inquiry-into-donations\">a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the last federal election, and the adequacy of Australia\u2019s donations and disclosure regime</a>, Williams proposed a \u201cholistic\u201d overhaul, including imposing caps of $5,000 on political donations, real-time disclosure, banning foreign donations when the source is \u201cexclusively foreign\u201d, caps on campaign expenditure, and a boost to public funding.</p> <p>Williams, the dean of the faculty of law at the University of New South Wales, warned it was \u201cwidely accepted among experts and others that Australia\u2019s system of political finance law is broken and open to exploitation and undue influence\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/23/truth-in-politics-stamping-your-foot-about-cold-blooded-lies-isnt-enough\">Truth in politics: calling out 'cold-blooded lies' isn't nearly enough | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis can give rise to a form of soft corruption in which money may be given in return for access and the potential to bring about undue influence on decision-making and policy development,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a system is clearly not in the interests of the Australian community.\u201d</p> <p>Williams references the two high court cases that are most commonly cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/australian-political-donations-how-hard-would-it-really-be-to-clean-up\">to make the case that it\u2019s constitutionally difficult to limit donations</a>, and he suggests reform can proceed along the lines he proposes, \u201ctaking into account the legal constraints\u201d.</p> <p>He also used his submission to recommended lowering the voting age to 16, and urged the Turnbull government to resist calls to legislate a truth in political advertising provision.</p> <p>Truth in advertising has been added to the terms of reference for the donations inquiry because that change is being sought by Nick Xenophon. Xenophon was unhappy with some of the advertising directed at his NXT party in South Australia during the 2016 federal election.</p> <p>The Coalition has also complained volubly about Labor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/07/mediscare-campaign-didnt-worry-my-electorate-says-christopher-pyne\">Medicare anti-privatisation campaign</a> during the campaign.</p> <p>Williams argued there were two main problems with truth in political advertising laws \u2013 the first was the law might prove unworkable in practice and the second was the law could easily infringe the implied freedom of political communication.</p> <p>He acknowledged truth in advertising provisions existed in South Australia, the Northern Territory and in some countries overseas, but he said the regimes were very narrowly based.</p> <p>Williams noted the SA electoral commission wanted the regime repealed on the basis it undermined the independence of the state agency by necessitating decisions about who was right and who was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it may be possible to frame truth in political advertising laws that are both constitutionally valid and enforceable, any such provisions would have to be cast in very narrow terms with only a small scope for application,\u201d Williams said.</p> <p>\u201cProvisions of this nature would likely serve little more than a symbolic purpose.\u201d</p> <p>He also argued in favour of two changes widening eligibility to vote.</p> <p>The first involved lowering the voting age, which would lower some of the barriers to persuading distracted 18-year-olds to enrol to vote at a time when they are leaving school, and leaving home.</p> <p>\u201cPeople under 18 can leave school, get a job, drive a car and pay taxes. They can also enlist in the Australian defence forces, become a parent, and, in exceptional circumstances, get permission to marry. If the law permits them to undertake these activities, it is hard to see why they cannot also vote.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is often argued that 16-year-olds lack the knowledge about how government works to enable them to vote ... this can be true, but these problems are not limited to this age group.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said lowering the voting age would not mean imposing a compulsory vote on teenagers. He suggested participation should be voluntary.</p> <p>He also said Australians should be allowed to vote even if they live overseas on a long-term basis. Electoral law prevents people voting if they have resided overseas for six years.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia\u2019s electoral system should recognise the reality that Australia is increasingly integrated into global systems, including by way of movement of its citizens,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is desirable that these people have the opportunity to remain strongly connected to Australia, including by voting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If ever you wanted evidence that we are in a bizarre economic environment, you only needed to see that when the latest inflation figures came out on Wednesday, the annual growth of 1.3% was deemed high enough to have financial markets all but ruling out the chances of an interest rate cut next week.</p> <p>The latest consumer price index figures released yesterday by <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6401.0Main+Features1Sep%202016?OpenDocument\">the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> showed quarterly growth of the CPI was 0.7% and the annual rate was 1.3%.

The 0.7% growth was the fastest for 3 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Inflation growth - conusmer price index\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SY9Te/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the reality is that was due largely to an exceptional 19.5% increase in the price of fruit after flooding in the major growing areas reduced supply. If we excluded food and non-alcoholic beverages from the figures, the CPI would have only risen 0.5%.</p> <p>The Reserve Bank, whose board meets to decide on interest rates on Tuesday, will pay the CPI increase no mind at all when it comes to making its decision. Instead it will look at the underlying inflation growth rates of the \u201cweighted median\u201d and \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d.

And you have to wonder given how low interest rates are right now, whether another rate cut would have much impact.</p> <p>Low inflation is a symptom of both low prices via goods and services that are tradeable (that is their price is largely set overseas) and from the non-tradeable sector.</p> <p>While the price growth of tradeable prices is generally more erratic, the current 1.7% growth of the non-tradeables items suggests very weak demand within the economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual inflation growth - tradables and non-tradables\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mxI1R/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>One area that reflects the state of the economy, with weak wages and tepid full-time employment growth, is rental prices.

  "<p>The statement that follows is highly unfashionable, yet is nonetheless true: one of the things modern Britons can be proudest of is their country\u2019s achievements in international development. Thanks to British aid and development over the last few years, two million more girls are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/helping-girls-get-an-education-in-pakistan\" title=\"\">attending school in Pakistan</a>.

Looking for a&#xa0;field in which the UK is a world-beater? Aid&#xa0;is&#xa0;certainly one. Britain is among a handful of countries to have hit <a href=\"http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm\" title=\"\">the UN\u2019s target</a> of giving 0.7% of its national income <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/foreign-aid-which-countries-are-the-most-generous\" title=\"\">to overseas development</a>. And the creation in 1997 of the Department for International Development has given Britain a repository of expertise heeded around the world. To find some of his <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/10/britain-the-soft-power-superpower-of-global-liberalism-boris-johnsons-conservative-conference-speech-full-text.html\" title=\"\">beloved \u201csoft power\u201d</a>, Boris Johnson should trundle a short distance up Whitehall to the DfID offices.</p> <p>It is worth spelling this out, partly because there has been a chorus of protest for months in parts of the media, complaining of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3510811/Stop-foreign-aid-madness-12bn-taxes-splurged-hand-outs-terrorists-killers-care-UK-s-spending-Foreign-Aid-sign-petition-now.html\" title=\"\">foreign aid madness</a>\u201d: a campaign complete with outlandish examples, some \u201csimply incorrect\u201d stories (according to DfID officials) \u2013 and convenient silence on the positive case for spending on aid. Incredibly, the new secretary of state for international development appears to sympathise. Before taking up the job, Priti Patel called for DfID to be shut down. Since moving into the post, she has talked about aid money being squandered. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/09/priti-patel-new-special-adviser-robert-oxley-critic-uk-foreign-aid-spending-target\" title=\"\">appointed as one of her aides a luminary of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance</a>, an organisation that can always be relied on to provide a cheap quote to a Sunday newspaper about some aid \u201cscam\u201d or other. And this week she threatened to cut funding to organisations such as the World Bank. If one of Britain\u2019s proudest recent achievements is its leadership on development, Ms Patel stands on the verge of&#xa0;a massive act of national vandalism.</p> <p>It matters all the more because talks are under way at the OECD in Paris directed at legitimising the diversion of development aid into the private sector. That is not inevitably a bad thing, except that the record of the private sector on schools and healthcare is at the least patchy, and there is not much of a private sector in the very poorest places.</p> <p>Challenged last month by fellow MPs to quantify how much aid money is \u201cstolen or wasted\u201d, Ms Patel could not. She says she wants to spend aid money on the \u201cworld\u2019s poorest people\u201d while also delivering it \u201cin our national interest\u201d, promoting trading relationships. That implies her focus will be on <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mic\" title=\"\">middle-income countries</a> such as India and China: giant economies with cash to buy British goods and services.</p> <p>It was those countries that her predecessor, Justine Greening, deemed too rich to deserve British aid. In the late 1990s, the UK broke the old corrupt rules which stated that rich countries give poor governments money to buy things (notably arms) from rich countries. That old regime embroiled Britain in scandal and left poor countries with dams and military hardware, no help for ordinary people. Ms&#xa0;Patel appears to hanker for that era.</p> <p>Theresa May is committed to maintain aid spending; Ms Patel is, at the moment, prevented by law from doing trade-for-aid deals. But the positive case for aid is not being made. Unmentioned go the obligations that Britain has to poorer countries, because of the damage it has caused through empire, climate change and pernicious supply chains. Perhaps hamstrung by the lobbying laws or the need to secure their own DfID funding, Oxfam, ActionAid and the like are mutely allowing the new minister and her supporters to trash the case for aid. How best to do development aid is always open to evaluation. That it needs doing should not be. The NGOs must get their act together, fast.</p>",

With an organized system, a successful, informative, professional campaign could be run.\u201d</p> <p>Her suggestion for how we reform our electoral process \u2013 that we ask the DNC and RNC to reform the process \u2013 is less compelling. In a segment on Morning Joe on Wednesday, she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time (was she joking?). And she\u2019s previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the District of Columbia should hold their primaries on the same day, a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by short-circuiting grassroots campaigns.</p> <p>The opening clip for <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/sheryl-crow-on-why-she-wants-shorter-elections-793881155772\">Crow\u2019s morning segment</a> certainly felt ironic. In it, former British prime minister David Cameron is seen ribbing President Obama about the stupidly long length of American elections. \u201cYou always look on at the American elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPW-wD74Bng\">Cameron says to Obama</a> in a news conference from April of 2016, adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it.

Two months later he\u2019d be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which \u2013 Brexit \u2013 almost nobody saw coming.</p> <p>Crow moved on to how toxic media discourse has become. \u201cThis petition is simply an appeal from a midwestern mom, a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the TV on and see something I\u2019m going to have to explain.\u201d</p> <p>Again the sentiment is relatable but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our Republican nominee for president actively brags about \u201cgrabbing\u201d women by the \u201cpussy\u201d; a fact which, it\u2019s worth noting, didn\u2019t come out until more than 500 days into the cycle.</p> <p>What Crow deems the \u201cstart\u201d of the election \u2013 Ted Cruz choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign \u2013 is not something the DNC or RNC can actually control. Nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends. Party committees do set the timetable for primaries, but even there they are in a constant tug-of-war with state governments, which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more attention.</p> <p>As for entreaties to focus more on policy, we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the environment, but we have furthered the national conversation around racism, xenophobia and, particularly, sexual assault, and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics. Since audio leaked of Trump bragging about it on 7 October, a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual misbehavior.</p> <p>That\u2019s not something I want America\u2019s kids watching either. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve loved covering \u2013 it\u2019s been emotionally and physically exhausting. But it\u2019s more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their ears.</p> <p>With all due respect, I don\u2019t think Crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle. Muting the television won\u2019t protect our kids from our reality. And reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the world, particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is disinformation, won\u2019t make it harder to fool the American public: it will make it infinitely easier.</p>",

They got a flea in the ear.</p> <p>The Wallonian saga shows only the power of provincial lobbyists in ruling the terms of trade, both within and outside the EU. No one can seriously applaud the licence granted to the Walloons to shut out the Canadians. Even in Brexit Britain, leavers and remainers alike favoured free trade. Their chief argument was over \u201ctrade in what, and with whom?\u201d</p> <p>That argument at least is starting to clear. On intra-European migration, May will be forced to concede virtually an open door to bankers, doctors, care workers, fruit pickers and other businesses dependent on foreign labour. It is simply not feasible to erect visa barriers round the UK\u2019s borders, whether along the Channel coast or around Fermanagh and Tyrone. Whatever May says, Brexit is unlikely to make much difference to migration statistics. Her leadership should start lowering expectations.</p> <p>On trade in manufactured goods, the&#xa0;totals at stake are small, but not so for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce78f36-ed2e-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4\" title=\"\">80% of businesses that are services</a> and particularly affected by <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/249969/TaskForce-report-15-October.pdf#page=17\" title=\"\"> non-tariff barriers</a>. While the EU market in services remains embryonic, to stay must be in Britain\u2019s interest. Everyone wants access to markets. Everyone accepts, and May concedes, that this means give and take. Give involves a surrender of control. There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In June the British voted narrowly to leave the EU. Barring a revolution, that will plainly happen. But beyond \u201cleaving\u201d, all is pollster conjecture. \u201cHard\u201d Brexit posits some EU relationship along Canadian lines. But even if a deal with Britain may be treated as more urgent, Wallonia shows how pressure groups can damage the public interest. In Britain\u2019s case, transitional \u201cdefault to World Trade Organisation\u201d tariffs would be costly to the economy and, on the Irish border, unenforceable.</p> <p>Any Brexit cloud has a silver lining. Taking the heat out of London\u2019s banking frenzy may be no bad thing. Devaluation can ease the strain of tariffs. Pending a storm of Wallonias \u2013 Germans on banking, the Dutch on pigs, half the EU on car assembly \u2013 ad hoc deals may be reached. But a cloud it would surely be. In the short term, there would be a net loss of business. Hence I cannot see how hard Brexit is in the nation\u2019s interest, political or economic. The virtue of the residual <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea\" title=\"\">European economic area</a> (EEA) \u2013 some version of the so-called Norway option \u2013 is that it would take Britain out of the EU politically, but leave in place a common market. Trade in goods and services would remain, but at the price of their regulation, and that would have to be paid for.</p> <p>Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration. As refugees, bank bailouts, recession and unemployment all testify, the EU and especially the eurozone are not a functioning confederation but a zone of German influence. Britain has decided to distance itself from that zone. It cannot divorce itself from the economy of its entire continent. Caution and common sense advise the EEA, \u201csoft\u201d Brexit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, do not mock the Walloons. Their flexing of political muscle reflects a widespread identity crisis among all the world\u2019s subordinate regions. From Scotland to Spain, from Ukraine to Turkey to Syria to the Gulf, the greatest threat to global stability \u2013 and its ally free trade \u2013 is sub-national separatism. The rebellion of local peoples against centralist power is everywhere.</p> <p>As Brexit stumbles forward, May should read the lessons of Wallonia. She&#xa0;should appease the Scots and others by granting them status in her impending negotiations. She is a remainer at heart. She may welcome a Wallonian card in her hand.</p>",

The other thing we shouldn\u2019t underestimate is a generation of families who are now going to see this impact with their children. It feels like a tip of an iceberg that we\u2019ve seen in terms of the devastation on those children and their families.\u201d</p> <p>The two philanthropic organisations, together with the Brazilian, US and UK governments, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/mosquitos-infected-wolbachia-bacteria-zika-virus\">announced $18m (\u00a314.7m) funding for an ambitious project</a> to release mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria in two urban areas of Brazil and Colombia. The bacteria renders the mosquitoes unable to transmit viruses. They breed with local mosquitoes, producing offspring with Wolbachia, a bacteria carried by 60% of insects that is harmless to humans.<br></p> <p>If it works, it will help limit not just Zika but also other flaviviruses, including dengue and yellow fever.</p> <p>There is a lot that is still not understood, including the human response to infection and what may happen in Africa, where Zika has been detected in the past, which means there may be a background level of immunity, explained Farrar. In the long run, he said, to end the threat will require not just Wolbachia \u2013 if it really does work at scale, about which he said he is \u201cin equipoise\u201d \u2013 but a vaccine as well.</p> <p>Zika, and <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/\">before it Ebola</a>, have driven home to the scientific community that technology is not the whole answer to pandemics.

But increasingly one of the exciting things in science and technology is what people call implementation science and social science. It is at anyone\u2019s peril if they think they\u2019re going to make a difference in the world and not deeply understand that aspect of the work.\u201d</p> <p>With Ebola, it was vital to understand the cultural traditions surrounding death and burial. With Zika, the Gates Foundation is very concerned about access to family planning, an issue it has made a global priority.</p> <p>Both Gates and Wellcome believe the world is moving in the right direction on pandemic preparedness. They point to good collaboration and the sharing of ideas between many organisations. The much criticised World Health Organisation (WHO) has, they say, an invaluable role in standard-setting, while philanthropic organisations, government, NGOs and industry are all talking and influencing each other. </p> <p>\u201cI believe we are going in the right direction. There is almost universal consensus,\u201d said Farrar. </p> <p>Increasing urbanisation, trade and travel will mean pandemics continue to happen. There needs to be sustained investment in public health \u2013 \u201cthe first line of defence for the world\u201d, said Farrar \u2013 and there needs to be commitment to research and development, both in technologies and the social sciences. Desmond-Hellmann added surveillance to that list \u2013 an area in which her <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2015/05/Child-Health-and-Mortality-Prevention-Surveillance-Network\">foundation is investing heavily</a>, so that \u201cthe world has what it needs for an early read-out\u201d when disease outbreaks occur.

This would allow him to borrow for investment and to provide support for the \u201cjust managing\u201d families (as Theresa May calls them) who will be squeezed by the continuing benefits freeze.</p> <p>Alternatively, should Hammond merely delay Osborne\u2019s surplus target by a year (to 2020-21), he would be forced to impose an additional \u00a39bn of tax rises or spending cuts. Were he to reject any further fiscal tightening, a surplus would not be achieved until 2023-24 - too late to be politically relevant. </p> <p>The most logical option, as the Resolution Foundation concludes, is for Hammond to target a current surplus.

In Germany, the craze has swept the nation, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/german-teenager-stabbed-trying-to-frighten-clown-mask-hammer-berlin-police\" title=\"\">16-year-old in clown costume getting stabbed</a>.

The policies were highly profitable for the banks but were often sold to customers without their knowledge or to people who were unable to claim, such as the self-employed. The Financial Services Authority began imposing fines on banks for the mishandling of PPI in 2006. It has become the most expensive mis-selling scandal in the UK, with a total bill so far of almost \u00a340bn.<br></p>\n     <p><br></p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lloyds has incurred the largest single bill for the scandal as it also owns HBOS, which it took over during the 2008 banking crisis.</p> \n<p>The charge for PPI was revealed as the bank reported <a href=\"http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/financial-performance/\">its profits for the first nine of months of the year</a>, which were 50% higher at \u00a33.2bn despite the PPI charge. In the third quarter, however, profits were down 15% at \u00a3811m.</p> \n<p>Listed among the charges taken by the bank was another provision of \u00a3150m for packaged accounts, where products such as travel insurance and roadside assistance policies are bundled up alongside current accounts.</p> \n<p>The taxpayer still owns a 9% stake in Lloyds \u2013 down from 43% at the time of the financial crisis \u2013 and the slump in its shares has forced chancellor Philip Hammond to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/philip-hammond-drops-plan-to-sell-cut-price-lloyds-shares-to-public\">abandon a plan to sell shares to the public at the discount</a>. Instead Hammond has signalled that the remaining shares will be sold to City investors on the stock market.</p> \n<p>The shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down about 2.5%, but regained their losses as analysts digested the implications for the bank returning cash to shareholders next year. The shares are still well below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought them during the crisis.</p> \n<p>Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, who in August apologised to staff for the hit to the bank\u2019s reputation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/lloyds-chief-antonio-horta-osorio-apologises-damage-caused-affair-allegations\">because of revelations about his private life</a>, said the sale of the remaining stake would not be his cue to leave.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am very happy at Lloyds. I \u2026 like the team here and I like the strategy,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took the helm in 2011 and immediately began the process of PPI payouts. Lloyds started with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/05/lloyds-loss-payment-protection-costs\">a \u00a33.2bn provision</a>, which at the time was thought to have been enough to tackle the compensation payouts.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe hard work undertaken in the last five years to transform and simplify the business has allowed the UK government to sell most of its stake in the group, returning \u00a317bn including dividends on its original \u00a320bn investment.

Culmer said there was no need for immediate action to cut the deficit. </p> \n<p>Analysts were watching for signals about the size of dividends to shareholders. Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said there was potential for payouts.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real highlight is a much stronger than expected capital generation, which means that management has reiterated its guidance for the group to deliver full-year pre-dividend capital generation equivalent to 1.6% of risk-weighted assets \u2013 around \u00a33.6bn or 5p per share \u2013 for the year as a whole,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio also reiterated remarks he made shortly after the EU referendum, hinting that Hammond should announce more spending on infrastructure in next month\u2019s autumn statement. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe strongly believe the economy requires a fiscal stimulus in terms of infrastructure and housebuilding.

I volunteered at a food bank and am amazed people think it's free food- when I volunteered you needed a referral to get some cereal, dried and canned goods. People are disgusting if they sneer or make derogatory comments about those who are forced to resort to them.

I saw one person with chronic incontinence being told they had to poo their pants in an interview, literally, as if they left their benefits would be stopped for 2 weeks and the toilet is 'just for staff'. Need to phone the DWP for help as you have no money and your benefits are delayed? That will be several 40 minute phonecalls, at full rate please. We might help you then - but if we request evidence, at least 50% of the time we will lose it, and then you will have to give us another 40 minute call to find out what happens....before sending it again and waiting. And there's alot more....one guy, for instance, very confused, with a serious mental health problem, walked 6 miles to my office as he could not afford the bus fare! He had lived for a week off one tin of beans. At first I told him I couldn't help. He collapsed crying. I contacted a colleague in another organisation who was, fortunately, able to secure the vouchers you need to get food at a food bank. You can get those from the job centre by the way. But no matter how worried they are the advisers are instructed not to tell you unless you ask. It is a national scandal in a country as rich as ours that we starve people!

I also have health problems of my own. I was on ESA, my daughter received DLA and we had tax credits. We got by together, she got what she needed, and so did I. Then earlier this year I missed an ESA appointment due to being ill. They took it off me completely. I have elevated it to tribunal and am still waiting for a date for my case to be heard. My daughter left college in July, meaning she is entitled to benefits in her own right now in the form of ESA. I no longer get tax credits or child benefit, or the meagre amount from her absent father in child support. I was so ill that I decided to ask social services to deal with my daughter's finances. She was entitled to her benefits from the beginning of September, yet we are still waiting for the DWP to make a decision. Then we have to wait for social services to assess her because she has to contribute to her care costs. She has had no money in almost 2 months. </p> <p>I am currently scraping by on income support. I do claim carer's allowance, but because she spends some time in residential care and some with me, I have to claim for the time she's with me. I have JUST got the carer's allowance money for the dates from May-August. I have to drive 120 miles a week to get my daughter from her residential placement to home and back, then she has a schedule of activities over the weekend which can't be changed as it would upset and confuse her too much. So for the last 7 weeks I have had to pay for fuel, her activities, food for us both and the usual bills out of the basic amount of income support that is meant to be just enough for one person to survive on. </p> <p>I was referred to the food bank 3 weeks ago when I broke down and admitted how hard it was getting. I had to miss one of my daughter's weekend visits because I simply couldn't afford it. Because of this, I miss out on a week's worth of carer's allowance, and she misses out on her DLA, which is also only payable for the time she spends at home with me. </p> <p>I was so grateful to the food bank, I was embarrassed but humbled, and I have worked hard on making the most of the donated food so not a scrap is wasted. I would like to thank them for all their hard work, they are doing such amazing work. But when the Welfare State was set up, it was supposed to be there to prevent this. It was designed to help those in most need, to stop them from starving, to give them a basic standard of life so that they didn't live in a tent on the streets. It was meant to help avoid poverty, malnutrition and unnecessary suffering. But this government has decided to open up that hole at the bottom of the ladder so that those people on the bottom rung can now be knocked off into the poverty that the Welfare State was designed to avoid. </p> <p>This is not about immigrants, it's not about junkies, it's not about lazy layabouts pretending to be sick and disabled, it's about ordinary people who worked in the steel works, or BHS, or any other business which has failed or been sold off by the government and their super rich cronies. People who have gone from highly trained and skilled jobs into having nothing. And it's about the government deliberately sabotaging the Welfare State, making it go slower and slower, cutting people off from the support they desperately need or making them wait for weeks with nothing so they end up in debt and struggling to feed their children. It's what they said they would do, offload as much as possible onto charities, no matter what suffering they inflict. </p> <p>If it wasn't for me having to make sure my daughter got what she needs, I wouldn't be here now. I've contemplated suicide, I've thought about stealing, I've even thought about prostitution because of this situation. In the end I sold clothes and other belongings to get a few quid to keep me going and make sure I don't end up in court as a criminal. I'm just an ordinary person, I'm not scum, I'm not a thief or a junkie, but when you are desperate you end up resorting to desperate means.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>It\u2019s almost impossible without help from friends and family<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86032618\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12161274\" title=\"View Steven Dixon\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12161274\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Steven Dixon\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12161274\" title=\"View Steven Dixon\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Steven Dixon</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86032618\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">23 October 2016 6:52pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I am representing a client who was on ESA for a while and has her final court appeal in a few weeks time.Whilst awaiting this appeal date she,like Daniel Blake in Ken Loach's movie,was not entitled to ESA.She was told she had to apply for Jobseeker's Allowance(JSA).<br />As she could not adhere to the claimant commitment.It was impossible for her to <br />jobsearch for 35 hrs a week,she was too ill to attend courses and she cannot use a computer due to severe disability in one hand.She had to withdraw her claim and went without money for nearly 4 months.<br />Luckily she had support from friends and family whilst her ESA was reinstated in the run-up to the appeal, but many people like the character Daniel Blake do not.<br />The appeal comes soon but it is unlikely my client will score the necessary 15 points to stay on ESA,so she will have no choice but to sign on JSA and will probably be sanctioned on week one. Damian Green from the DWP says he is taking a softer tone but at the moment we see very little of that.

  "<p>It sounds more like a day spa than an office: a mile of walking trails, a cafeteria serving locally grown food, views of nature from almost every room in the building \u2013 including the stairwells \u2013 and a wood-paneled lobby designed to absorb excess sound.</p> <p>Welcome to French manufacturing giant Saint-Gobain\u2019s North American headquarters. Since moving into the Malvern, Pennsylvania building in October last year, Saint-Gobain has kept notes on the effect of these features on its employees, and compared it to its previous office seven miles down the road.</p> <p>The company says it has seen a 97% increase in the average weekly number of potential customers between January 2015 and August 2016, compared to the same period the previous year. Saint-Gobain says its employees have also reported feeling more energetic since moving into the new building. Some 38% are now members of the onsite fitness center.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/10/office-beautiful-pretty-views-employees-productive\">Does a pretty office make a productive workforce?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even the implication that a greener, smarter work environment could impact the company\u2019s performance is proof enough that the changes are worthwhile, said Carmen Ferrigno, vice president of communications at Saint-Gobain. The Saint-Gobain office is featured in a new report from the World Green Building Council, a global network of national green building councils, which looks at how sustainably designed buildings can boost productivity and health in the workplace.</p> <p>The report, released Tuesday, examines how the green features of 15 buildings around the world are helping businesses save money and improve staff morale. Take Swedish construction and development company Skanska, which was able to cut sick days by two-thirds after it rebuilt its office in Doncaster, UK, improving indoor air quality, cutting down on noise levels and installing a central light well that increased the natural daylight in the building. The company was able to save \u00a328,000 ($34,209) in staff costs in 2015, and employee satisfaction grew from 58% to 78%.</p> <p>\u201cThe results are clear \u2013 putting both health and wellbeing, and the environment, at the heart of buildings is a no brainer for businesses\u2019 employees and their bottom line,\u201d said Terri Wills, CEO of the World Green Building Council.</p> <p>The report lays out a number of factors that the authors say create a healthier office environment and can help boost a company\u2019s earnings: good ventilation, natural sunlight, low noise levels, windows with views outside and a flexible work area that allows employees to be more mobile within the office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c214e08d0890a6c53cf4b16237d7f831405bc8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c214e08d0890a6c53cf4b16237d7f831405bc8e/0_476_7135_4281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The office campus includes over a mile of walking trails for employees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The office campus includes over a mile of walking trails for employees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeffrey Totaro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the report, when combined, these factors have an impact on the way people work. For instance, distracting sounds in the office, such as a computer or printer beeping, and loud conversations, can <a href=\"http://www.human.cornell.edu/dea/outreach/upload/FPM-Notes_Vol1_Number11.pdf\">negatively affect a person\u2019s mood and make it difficult for them to concentrate</a>, causing stress. Meanwhile, too much carbon dioxide in an office has been shown to <a href=\"http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2012/10/17/elevated-indoor-carbon-dioxide-impairs-decision-making-performance/\">impair decision making and make employees feel tired</a>. Exposure to sunlight also makes a difference: a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130603114000.htm\">2013 study</a> from Northwestern University found that employees that worked in offices with windows slept an average of 46 more minutes a night compared to workers in windowless offices. That\u2019s because sunlight helps to regulate the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, which tells our bodies when to sleep, eat and wake up.</p> <p>Saint-Gobain\u2019s 277,000 square-foot office took nearly two years to complete, and cost $80m. There were a few reasons for the move, said Ferrigno. For one, the firm wanted a space that showcased the building technologies from its family of companies and allowed its research teams to measure the impact of these products on a real workplace.

Only five countries were found to have met their 2015 targets: Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden and UK.</p> <p>Seamus Jeffreson, Concord\u2019s director, called on EU states to stopping inflating aid with spending that, he said, had dubious development impacts. \u201cThis is particularly true when it comes to refugee costs \u2013 an area where EU member states have a moral duty to do their part, but without diverting aid budgets,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The shape of EU aid last year was heavily influenced by the refugee crisis, said the report.

  "<p>Mexico City is in the mood for a fiesta and clearly has no intention of doing it by half. That Formula One has arrived in town is impossible to miss \u2013 the posters, the promotion and the beaming local fans are all too obvious. Better still there is a buzz \u2013 a throbbing sense of excitement and anticipation that is unique to venues where passion for the sport far outweighs crass commercialism or political agendas.</p> <p>On Wednesday, while the teams were unpacking in the paddock, Mexico City was revelling in their arrival, as well it might. Amid the exaggerated caterwauling of the doom-mongers fearful of dropping attendances and viewing figures, this weekend\u2019s race is part of an almost unparalleled success story from which F1 would do well to learn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/nico-rosberg-wins-mexican-grand-prix-f1\">Nico Rosberg leads home Lewis Hamilton to win F1 Mexican Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/nico-rosberg-wins-mexican-grand-prix-f1\">After an absence from the calendar of 23 years</a>, the Mexican Grand Prix returned last year with a bang. That the race was a dead rubber in the championship mattered not a jot to the fans and 134,850 of them packed the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez. Only Silverstone could boast a bigger attendance in 2015 and then only by a few thousand. More impressively, the numbers could have been higher. The circuit is located in a public park \u2013 limited both by space and by having the equivalent of listed status \u2013 so organisers were unable to construct more grandstands.</p> <p>To put the figures in perspective, the attendance at Bahrain in 2015 was 32,000; in Malaysia 44,611. It is what has happened here in Mexico City in 2016 that really stands out, however. New tracks traditionally suffer a second year drop-off on being added or returning to F1. Austria, for example, had a disastrous 20% fall in 2015 after coming back in 2014. In contrast, Mexico is already 99% sold out again and the numbers are set to be up on last year.</p> <p>History has its part to play in this passion for F1 \u2013 the circuit is named in honour of the brothers Rodr\u00edguez. In 1961, in his first race at Monza, Ricardo was the youngest driver to qualify on the front row \u2013 a record he held until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/01/max-verstappen-ferrari-f1-sebastian-vetttel-kimi-raikkonen\">Max Verstappen bettered him</a> at Spa this year \u2013 and raced for Ferrari in 1961 and 1962, taking best finishes of fourth and sixth from six races and a second at Le Mans in 1960. He was killed aged only 20 at his home grand prix in 1962 when the suspension on his Lotus 24 failed on the high-speed banking of the Peraltada \u2013 the awe-inspiring and daunting turn now truncated for safety purposes.</p> <p>His elder brother Pedro was even more successful, winning two grands prix, in South Africa and at Spa during an eight-year career in F1. He also won Le Mans in 1968, one of many victories in sports cars and was acknowledged as a master in the wet. Tragically he too died in an accident, at the Norisring in Nuremberg, in 1971. Both were formidable drivers and are still revered in Mexico, while the interest they engendered in the sport is palpable today.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/28/f1-mexico-gp-guide-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-autodromo-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k6f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2849109\"            data-video-name=\"F1 Mexico GP guide: everything you need to know about the Aut\u00f3dromo \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58133323e4b0219a00d39946\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028F1MexcioGPCircuitGuide_KP-30362987_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028F1MexcioGPCircuitGuide_KP-30362987.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028F1MexcioGPCircuitGuide_KP-30362987_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/28/f1-mexico-gp-guide-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-autodromo-video\">F1 Mexico GP guide: everything you need to know about the Aut\u00f3dromo</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The presence of two Mexican drivers on the grid \u2013 Sergio P\u00e9rez and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez is, of course, also a factor, but not one that can be taken for granted.

  "<p>During the debates on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/11/obama-administration-universal-healthcare-reform\">Obamacare</a> in 2009, Republicans picked up on a part of the bill that suggested the terminally ill should have access to voluntary end-of-life counselling sessions, paid for by Medicare. Sarah Palin, or a rhetorical genius in her employ, then decided to call such a session an obligatory \u201cdeath panel\u201d, a phrase that quickly went viral, and the proposal was eventually dropped. \u201cDeath panel\u201d was simply a lie, but it was also a fine example of <a href=\"http://unspeak.submarinechannel.com/\">Unspeak</a>: a cleverly engineered phrase that smuggles in a dubious argument. And for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/markthompson\">Mark Thompson</a>, former director general of the BBC and now CEO of the New York Times company, it is emblematic of what has gone wrong with modern political debate.</p> <p>We are living, his superb book argues, through \u201ca crisis of political language\u201d, characterised by lies, spin and demagoguery. Of course, as he acknowledges, people have been decrying the corruption of political language since politics began. But, he says, our circumstances are still \u201cexceptional\u201d, stemming from both changes in modern media and in the way politicians speak. So how did it happen?</p> <p>Thompson\u2019s historical account begins with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1979 election victory. Before then, \u201ctechnocratic competence remained the gold standard, and politicians on all sides generally continued to appeal to reason and the facts as they strove to win policy arguments\u201d. Thatcher\u2019s own rhetoric sounded new: \u201chard-edged, insistent, utterly sure of itself\u201d, which prompted increased bitterness and heat in public debates. Ronald Reagan, meanwhile, displayed an \u201cunrivalled command of every register of modern oratory\u201d. In the 1990s came the New Labour spin machine: as a BBC news editor at the time, Thompson recalls that \u201cthe weird combination of professionalism and paranoia with which the Blair government sought to guard its narrative felt new and decidedly alien\u201d.</p> <p>On the other hand, he notes: \u201cBlair\u2019s people believed \u2026 that the new tactics were the only credible response to an unremittingly hostile media environment. That claim was hard to dismiss.\u201d Thompson\u2019s own experience in the media is brilliantly deployed throughout for insight. Few other commentators on the subject can call on such depth of personally informed analysis. Working in New York in the 1980s, he noticed a new style of TV news editing that boiled everything down to \u201csoundbites\u201d. \u201cUrgent to the point of brutality, it was a style of editing which could deliver TV news of panache and immediacy \u2026 but it came at a price: everything had to be shortened and simplified.\u201d This style has since, of course, become the norm everywhere. And if such are the cramped containers in which politicians have to place their speech, you can hardly blame them alone for loading it with all the dubious tricks at their disposal. The glamour that attaches to \u201cforensic\u201d or adversarial instead of \u201canalytical\u201d journalism hardly helps either. (David Cameron once told Thompson that he didn\u2019t understand why anyone agreed to go on <em>Newsnight</em> any more: it was just a \u201csnuff movie for politicians\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cameron told Thompson he didn\u2019t understand why anyone agreed to go on Newsnight: it was a \u201csnuff movie for politicians\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thompson is a sharp and entertaining analyst of political language itself, drawing on terms from classical rhetoric. (\u201cDeath panel\u201d, he notes, is an enthymeme: an incomplete argument where listeners are invited to fill in the gaps.) He offers sardonic close readings of speeches by Thatcher and Reagan, Blair and Trump. Arguing for the Iraq war, Blair said that \u201cweakness in the face of a threat from a tyrant is the surest way not to peace but \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 to conflict\u201d. To this, Thompson responds: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to suggest that the \u2018surest way\u2019 to war is not to fight one. The surest way to war is simply to go to war, which is exactly what Tony Blair is now proposing.\u201d Occasionally Thompson does fall prey to political jargon himself, praising the \u201cdelicacy and grip\u201d with which Blair handled the death of Diana. (Grip?) And while he approves of the way \u201cgay marriage\u201d became \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d in public debate, he does not note that the real rhetorical clincher, in the US, was \u201cmarriage equality\u201d \u2013 itself just as much a brilliant enthymeme, or piece of Unspeak, as \u201cdeath panel\u201d.</p> <p>Discussions of political language often assume that George Orwell already had the last word on the subject with his 1946 essay \u201c<a href=\"http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/\">Politics and the English Language</a>\u201d. Thompson devotes an interesting critical chapter to it. Orwell\u2019s argument, he argues, is in thrall both to a discredited positivism (here, the idea that language could ever be a perfectly precise and neutral instrument), and to what Thompson calls \u201cauthenticism\u201d: the idea that the authenticity of the speaker is what matters most. Orwell thinks that the best way to fight back against the \u201ccloudy vagueness\u201d of the euphemisers is simply to use \u201cplain speaking\u201d. But, as Thompson notes: \u201cThis is unexpectedly close to the authenticist agenda of Donald Trump and the other anti-politicians.\u201d It is their apparent plain speaking, he suggests, that explains the success of Putin, Farage, Berlusconi, Trump et al.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/04/genius-donald-trumpspeak-steven-poole-words\">'Winning, winning, winning': the genius of The Donald\u2019s Trumpspeak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what can we do about it? Thompson calls for a new kind of political speech that he calls \u201ccritical persuasion\u201d: \u201c\u2018critical\u2019 in that it would consciously address, and submit itself to, its audience\u2019s prudential scrutiny.\u201d He advises politicians: \u201cTreat the public like grownups. Share some of your <em>actual</em> thinking about policy, including the painful and finely balanced trade-offs you face.\u201d</p> <p>The problem may be that, like full communism, critical persuasion will only work if everyone adopts it at the same time. The most charitable possible interpretation of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s awarding a score of seven (or seven-and-a-half) out of 10 to the EU during the referendum campaign, for example, was that this was a case of \u201ccritical persuasion\u201d, sharing his thinking about the painful and finely balanced trade-offs of EU membership. But it stood no chance against the \u201cTake back control\u201d enthymeme of the Vote Leave campaign.

  "<p>Ecuador has confirmed that oil drilling has begun under the country\u2019s Yasun\u00ed national park, one of the world\u2019s biodiversity hotspots.</p> <p>But the government claims that there has been only minimal disturbance to the Unesco biosphere reserve in the Amazon rainforest since extraction of 23,000 barrels of oil a day began last month.<br></p> <p>Ecologists, environmentalists and political groups in Ecuador and elsewhere condemned president Rafael Correa when in August 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/ecuador-abandons-yasuni-amazon-drilling\">he scrapped a pioneering conservation plan</a> to leave oil under the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) area of the park, in return for $3.6bn (3bn) compensation.</p> <p>Nobel prizewinners, Hollywood stars such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, UN general secretary Ban Ki-moon and conservationists had backed the ambitious plan when Correa first proposed it in 2007, but when after six years only $200m had been pledged by the international community, Correa said he had no option but to allow drilling to pay for poverty relief.<br></p> <p>Critics feared that oil would destroy Yasun\u00ed in the same way it had led to widespread deforestation and pollution across much of Ecuador and the western Amazon. Not only could oil workings fatally contaminate water and soils, but new oil roads would be constructed deep into the forest allowing hunting, deforestation and colonisation by people seeking land. </p> <p>In addition, said critics, it was likely that an army of oil workers would clash with the two semi-nomadic tribes of Waorani Indians known to be living within the national park. </p> <p>But in correspondence with the Guardian, the Ecuadorean government has claimed that a combination of the latest drilling technology and strict conditions on how the state oil company Petroecuador operates in the park has shown that oil exploitation is possible without environmental damage. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/yasuni_ecuador/giv-1406jyF0XtPw46yQ/\" data-alt=\"Yasuni map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/yasuni_ecuador/giv-1406jyF0XtPw46yQ/\">Yasuni map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cGas flaring is not allowed, which completely eliminates the negative effects of burning liquefied petroleum gas, CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The extraction technology of horizontal drilling allows multiple wells to be tapped from the same drill site, significantly reducing the amount of vegetation that must be cut down,\u201d said a spokesman.</p> <p> \u201cColonisation [by people] of the area is banned by the environmental license so the impact of construction and use of access paths is rigorously controlled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to the government, three oil pipelines crossing the Yasun\u00ed national park have been buried and the areas re-vegetated. \u201cThe access path for transport is four meters wide. It has tree canopy bridges to allow wildlife to cross above and has been designed with underground passages to allow the natural passage of water, aquatic life and land animals. The path is not paved in order to prevent soil contamination. Once the oil exploitation project is finished the route will be reforested naturally,\u201d the spokesman said. </p> <p>\u201cThe construction specifically avoids any interference in biologically sensitive areas such as old trees, salt lakes and nesting areas of sensitive species. Any evidence of colonisation by others represents a failure by the operator and therefore a risk of suspension,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Critics have responded that it is too early to say that the oil exploitation will not cause harm. \u201cThe government has not allowed any independent monitoring by scientists, journalists, or civil society. The well site is militarised, and aerial flyovers and images are prohibited,\u201d Kevin Koenig, Ecuador programme director at Amazon Watch, <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/10/exclusive-new-satellite-images-show-ecuador-drilling-next-to-yasunis-itt/\">told environment news site Mongabay</a>. </p> <p>Adrian Forsyth, director of the Washington-based Amazon Conservation Association, said it was only a matter of time before damage occurred. \u201cIt is well known that building roads into the interior of a national park comprised of rainforest with an abundance of rivers will inevitably lead to colonisation, deforestation, game depletion and continuing degradation of the very things national parks are designed to protect.\u201d</p> <p> But the government claims it has learned lessons from the rampant destruction that took place when oil was discovered and exploited by US companies in Ecuador in the 1950s.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to the Yasun\u00ed initiative, the awareness and commitment of the Ecuadorian population to the care of the Amazon, and the environment in general, has grown enormously. As a result, the Amazon in Ecuador is better cared for than ever before,\u201d said the government spokesman.</p> <p>\u201cThe alternative of having children without schools, without hospitals, without health infrastructure, without clean water, is not an alternative. No nation should allow its children to live without the basics for human dignity. If that is not an alternative for the UK, it is not for Ecuador either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Vice president, Jorge Glas, on a recent visit to the drilling site said: \u201cThis is the start of a new era for Ecuadorean oil. In this new era, first comes care for the environment and second responsibility for the communities and the economy, for the Ecuadorean people.\u201d </p>",

Working on the survival horror adventure <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/14/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review\">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>, Barlow introduced a character named Dr Kaufmann, a psychotherapist whose role, ostensibly, was to evaluate the mental wellbeing of protagonist Harry Mason. </p> <p>But that\u2019s not really why he was there. Dr Kaufmann\u2019s actual role was to psychologically assess the player. </p> <p>At key points throughout the terrifying narrative, the game provided a questionnaire inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits\">the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality test</a>, a method used by academic psychologists for personality research. Players would be asked things like: Are you a private person? Do you always listen to other people\u2019s feelings? In this way it was building a psychological profile of the player. At the same time, the system was also drawing data from how players interacted with the game world: how long they spent exploring each area before moving on; whether they strayed from clearly marked paths; whether they faced non-player characters while they talked. Every action had an effect on the narrative.</p> <p>\u201cMost scenes in the game had layers of variation \u2013 in the textures and colour, the lighting and the props,\u201d explains Barlow. \u201cCharacters also had multiple appearances and personality differences. All phone calls, voicemails and readable materials had multiple variations according to different profile slices. As you approached a door to a new room, the game was spooling in the assets, testing your profile and loading up the custom asset packages to assemble your own version.\u201d </p> <p>The idea was to draw in and then unsettle the player as much as possible based on their psychological traits. Characters, monsters and environments would all be subtly changed to reflect their own fears of aggression, enclosure or darkness. </p> <p>It was a personalised nightmare.</p> <p>Game designers have been attempting to learn, assess and react to player types since the days of Dungeons and Dragons. Richard Bartle, co-creator of the original MUD roleplaying game, formed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\">a taxonomy of players</a> in 1996, and his types \u2013 Achievers, Explorers, Socialisers, and Killers \u2013 have often been often used by designers to try to pre-empt and entice different player types. <br></p> <p>Over the last decade, however, the concept of truly reactive \u201cplayer modelling\u201d, in which the game learns in real time from each individual player, has become an important part of academic research into artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2004, AI researchers Georgios Yannakakis and John Hallam published<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.60.6629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\"> a seminal paper</a> detailing their work on Pac-Man. They created a modified version of the popular arcade game with the ghosts controlled by an evolutionary neural network that adjusted their behaviour based on each player\u2019s individual strategies. In the same year, PhD student Christian Thurau presented <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.2301&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">his own player modelling system</a> that used pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to teach AI characters how to move in a game world, based on watching humans play Quake II.</p> <p>In short: games were beginning to watch and learn from players.</p> <p>Many other other studies followed. In 2007, researchers at the University of Alberta\u2019s Intelligent Reasoning Critiquing and Learning group (under Vadim Bulitko) developed <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIIDE/2007/AIIDE07-008.pdf\">PaSSAGE (Player-Specific Stories via Automatically Generated Events)</a>, an AI-based interactive storytelling system that could observe and learn from player activities in a role-playing adventure. As the game progressed, the program sorted players into five different types (based on the <a href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/robinslaws/\">Robin\u2019s Laws of Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>) and then served them game events from a library of pre-written mini-missions. If they seemed to like looking for items in the game world, they were given a quest to find an object; if they liked fighting, they were given events that involved combat.</p> <h2>Super Mario gets personal</h2> <p>That system was interesting (and is still being evolved in the department), but it relied on hand-designed set-piece events, and only had a limited grasp on who the player was. Matthew Guzdial, a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Interactive Computing, is currently working on a more adaptable evolution of this concept \u2013 a version of Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Bros platformer that features a neural network capable of <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/418041/georgia-tech-researchers-train-computer-create-games-watching-youtube\">observing player actions and builds novel new level designs</a>, based on this data.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve successfully been able to demonstrate that the generator creates levels that match a learned play style\u201d, says Guzdial who collaborated with Adam Summerville from the University of California, Santa Cruz. \u201cPut simply, if a player likes exploring, it creates levels that must be explored; if a player speed-runs, it makes levels that are suited to speed-runing.\u201d</p> <p>Super Mario, it turns out, is a popular test-bed for AI researchers. It\u2019s familiar, it allows lots of different player actions in a constrained environment, and its source code is easily available. At the University of Copenhagen, AI researchers Noor Shaker, Julian Togelius and the aforementioned Yannakakis developed a slightly different experiment based on the game. This time players were asked to provide emotional feedback on each play-through, giving scores for fun, challenge and frustration; this input was combined with data drawn from watching them play (how often the player jumped, ran or died, how many enemies they killed, etc), and the AI program constructed new levels as a result.</p> <p>Over the last decade, Yannakakis and colleagues over at the University of Malta\u2019s Institute of Digital Games, where he currently works as an associate professor, have explored various forms of machine learning to estimate a player\u2019s behavioural, cognitive and emotional patterns during play. They have combined deep-learning algorithms, which build general models of player experience from massive datasets, with sequence-mining algorithms, which learn from sequences of player actions (like continually choosing health pick-ups over ammo). They have also explored preference learning, which allow an AI system to learn from player choices between particular content types (for example, preferring levels with lots of jumping challenges over those with lots of enemies). </p> <p>Not only have they used behavioural data gathered during play, they\u2019ve also used age, gender and other player details to inform their systems. Their aim isn\u2019t just to make interesting games, however \u2013 the AI techniques they\u2019re exploring may well be used in educational software or as diagnostic or treatment tools in mental health care.</p> <p>\u201cGiven a good estimate of a player\u2019s experience, AI algorithms can automatically \u2013 or semi-automatically \u2013 procedurally generate aspects of a game such as levels, maps, audio, visuals, stories, or even game rules,\u201d says Yannakakis. \u201cThe estimate can be used to help designers shape a better experience for the player. By tracking their preferences, goals and styles during the design process, AI can assist and inspire designers to create better, more novel, more surprising game content.\u201d</p> <p>For Julian Togelius, one of the foremost experts on AI games research now based at NYU, the next step is active player modelling \u2013 he envisages an AI level designer that doesn\u2019t just react to inputs, but is actually curious about the player and their preferences, and wants to find out more. </p> <p>\u201cThere is this machine learning technique called active learning, where the learning algorithm choses which training examples to work on itself,\u201d he explains. \u201cUsing this technique, you could actually have a game that chooses in what way to explore you, the player: the game is curious about you and wants to find out more, therefore serving you situations where it does not know what you will do. That\u2019s something that will be interesting for the player too, because the game has a reasonably good model of what you\u2019re capable of and will create something that\u2019s novel and interesting to you.\u201d</p> <h2>The games that feels your emotions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2e5d7001d3d4b1dcf27685e2e550c3c13c8f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2e5d7001d3d4b1dcf27685e2e550c3c13c8f0c/0_48_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Left 4 Dead games feature an AI Director that alters enemy types and threat levels depending on player actions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Left 4 Dead games feature an AI Director that alters enemy types and threat levels depending on player actions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valve Software</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, in many ways we\u2019re already seeing this kind of player modelling happening in the conventional games industry. Valve\u2019s critically acclaimed zombie shooter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/02/left4dead-review-xbox-pc\">Left 4 Dead </a>features an AI director that varies the type and threat level of undead enemies based on player activities in the game so far. With the arrival of free-to-play digital games on social media platforms and mobile phones, we also saw the emergence of a whole new game design ethos based on studying player data and iterating games accordingly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/02/facebook-games-zynga-ipo\">In its prime</a>, Zynga was famed for its huge data science department that watched how players interacted with titles such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, worked out where they were getting bored or frustrated, and tweaked the gameplay to iron out those kinks. The analysis of player metrics quickly became a business in itself with companies such as Quantic Foundry and GameAnalytics set up to help smartphone developers garner information from the activities of players.</p> <p>But these systems are commercially motivated and based around making game design bets on the activities of thousands of players \u2013 they\u2019re not about actually understanding players on an individual emotional level. </p> <p>That concept is definitely coming. Some AI researchers are shifting away from machine learning projects that watch what players do and toward systems that work out what they feel. It\u2019s possible to get an idea about a player\u2019s excitement, engagement or frustration from analysing certain in-game actions \u2013 is the player hammering the jump button, are they avoiding or engaging enemies, are they moving slowly or quickly? Simple actions can give away a lot about the player\u2019s state of mind. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jan/21/artificial-intelligence-ai-game\">Julian Togelius</a> found he was able to make informed assumptions about key character traits of test subjects by watching how they played Minecraft. \u201cWe asked them questions about their life motives then analysed the logs from the game,\u201d he says. \u201cTraits like independence and curiosity very strongly correlated with lots of things that happened in the game.\u201d</p> <p>So could an AI program study that data and change a game to tweak those feelings? \u201cThe major challenge is to relate content and [player] behaviour to emotion,\u201d says Noor Shaker, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who completed a PhD in player-driven procedural content generation. \u201cUltimately, we want to be able to identify the aspects of games that have an impact on how players experience them.\u201d</p> <p>Shaker is using a variety of methods for this purpose: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/09/the-ancient-origins-of-conciousness-todd-feinberg-and-john-mallet-review\">neuroevolution</a>, random decision forests, multivariate adaptive spline models are all complex machine learning toolsets that enable neural networks to gradually learn from and adapt to different player behaviours. </p> <p>\u201cMy work recently revolves around building more accurate models of experience, implementing interactive tools that allow us to visualise the expressive space of players\u2019 emotions,\u201d says Shaker. \u201cMost of the work I have seen so far, such as adaptation in Left 4 Dead, focuses on game difficulty and adjusting the behaviour of the NPCs according to relatively simple metrics of player\u2019s behaviour. I believe there are many other aspects to experience than difficulty and there are many more elements that can be considered to manipulate player experience than the behaviour of the NPCs. Recent research has shown that emotions such as frustration, engagement and surprise can be detected and modelled by machine learning methods.</p> <p>Shaker then, is interested in developing a video game AI system that understands not just how the player plays, but how the player is feeling as they play. Imagine a game that learns a player\u2019s emotional state and generates non-player characters and story fragments that it knows will hit them right in the heart. \u201cI believe data-driven automatic content personalisation is doable,\u201d says Shaker.<br></p> <h2>The game that stalks you</h2> <p>So far, much of this research has concentrated on how the player behaves within the game world. But that\u2019s not the only place to gather data. As consumers in the digital era, we\u2019re used to being profiled by major corporations: Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Google all use behavarioural targeting techniques to serve personalised ads and content to users. Advanced algorithms track our web-browsing activities via cookies and web beacons and learn our preferences. The data is all out there, and there\u2019s no reason why games makers couldn\u2019t use it too.<br></p> <p>In fact, AI researchers are already creating games that mine information from popular websites and bring it back for use in the narrative. Gabriella Barros is working on the concept of \u201cdata adventures\u201d with Julian Togelius, in which the AI gathers information from sites like Wikipedia and OpenStreetMaps to create globe-trotting point-and-click adventures in the style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F_(1985)\">Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego</a><strong> </strong>\u2013 except they\u2019re based in real locations and populated by real people. These data games are just the beginning, argues Michael Cook an AI researcher at Falmouth University.</p> <p>\u201cRight now they\u2019re interested in huge, open data platforms like Wikipedia or government statistics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can imagine in the future a game which takes your Facebook feed instead of a Wikipedia database, and populates the game world with people you know, the things they like doing, the places they visit and the relationships people have with one another. Whether or not that sounds like a scary idea is another question, but I can definitely see it as a natural extension of [the data game concept]. We already open our lives up to so many companies every day, we might as well get a bespoke, commissioned video game out of the deal.\u201d</p> <p>Copenhagen\u2019s Noor Shaker points out that privacy issues are a bottleneck with social media data \u2013 but then it\u2019s a bottleneck that Google and co have deftly circumnavigated. \u201cOnce we have the data, and depending on the source and type, natural language processing methods such as sentiment analysis could be used to profile and cluster players according to their opinion about different social, cultural or political matters,\u201d she says. \u201cStatistics could also be collected about games, books, or songs they already purchased, liked or expressed opinion about. All this information could feed powerful machine learning methods such as neural networks or standard classification techniques that learn profiles, discover similarity or predict personality traits.\u201d<br></p> <p>So now we\u2019re getting closer to the Black Mirror concept. Imagine something like The Sims, where the pictures on your apartment walls are photos from your Facebook wall, where neighbours are your real-life friends. Or, on a darker tangent, imagine a horror adventure that knows about your relationships, your Twitter arguments, your political views; imagine a horror game that knows what you watch on YouTube. \u201cIt is only natural to expect that game data can be fused with social media activity to better profile players and provide a better gaming experience,\u201d says Yannakakis. </p> <h2>The game that reads your mind \u2013 and body</h2> <p>Researchers can envisage a game that builds a detailed psychological and social profile of a player, from both their in-game actions and online footprint \u2013 but there\u2019s still a gap between this, and the horror game posited in Black Mirror, which performs an invasive neurological hack on the player. </p> <p>Brain-computer interfacing of this sort is still the stuff of bleeding edge medical research and science fiction. However, we\u2019re already seeing the use of devices \u2013 both in research and in consumer production \u2013 that can measure physiological states such as skin conductance and heart-rate variability to assess a player\u2019s emotional reaction to game content. </p> <p>Konami\u2019s 1997 arcade dating game Oshiete Your Heart, for example, featured a sensor that measured the player\u2019s heart rate and skin conductance to influence the outcome of each romantic liaison. <a href=\"http://www.flyingmollusk.com/nevermind/\">Nevermind</a>, released by by Flying Mollusk last year, is a biofeedback-enhanced horror adventure that increases the level of challenge based on the player\u2019s stress readings. Yannakakis and other researchers are also using off-the-shelf smart camera technologies like <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html\">Intel RealSense</a> and the emotion recognition software <a href=\"http://www.affectiva.com/\">Affectiva</a> to track a player\u2019s facial expressions and monitor their heartbeat \u2013 both indicators of a variety of emotions. Noor Shaker has studied how tracking a player\u2019s head pose while they take part in a game can tell us about the experience they\u2019re having. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/187755518\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/187755518\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Right now, these physiological inputs are mostly confined to research departments, but that may change. Valve, the company behind games like Portal and Half-Life and the HTC Vive VR headset has been experimenting with biometric inputs for years. Founder <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-valve-biometrics-blog-entry\">Gabe Newell predicted in 2011</a> that we would one day see game controllers with built in heart-rate and skin response detectors. A game supported by these sensors could easily present each player with different items, concepts or options to gauge a heart or skin response, adapting content on the fly depending on the reaction. Imagine a VR headset with sensors that measure skin heat response and heart rate. People are already <a href=\"https://diyhacking.com/digitising-human-emotions-virtual-reality/\">hacking this sort of thing together</a>.</p> <h2>The game that loves you</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_edkWos2BY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A_edkWos2BY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This all sounds terrifying, but it needn\u2019t be used in the way the Black Mirror episode does. There are benevolent, perhaps even beautiful, possibilities in the idea of games learning from players. One company looking into this potential is Mobius AI, a New York and UK-based starup developing a cognitive AI engine for developers. Co-founder Dr Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris is more interested in the potential relationships that could occur between players and AI characters who have the ability to identify and learn from individual players. </p> <p>\u201cWhat games really lack is that serendipitous kind of connection we feel when we meet someone in the real world that we get along with,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the ways this will happen is through games featuring AI-driven characters who truly understand us, and what we as individual players are expressing through the things we are actually saying and doing in the game.</p> <p>\u201cImagine, for instance, that you were the only one in the world who an AI-driven character could trust fully because the game could infer that you have similar personalities. This character could then take you down a unique experience, which only you have access to. It\u2019s a fascinating problem space, and a great challenge to think about how games could truly work you out \u2013 or rather, who you are pretending to be \u2013 by paying attention to not only what you\u2019re saying, but how you\u2019re saying it.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, Khandaker-Kokoris, who is also working on procedural storytelling game <a href=\"http://www.littleinvasiontales.com/\">Little Invasion Tales</a>, is more skeptical about the role of personal data mining in the future of game design. \u201cWe play games, often, to be someone who would have a different online history than our own,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then, we are partly always ourselves, too. We have to work out what it would mean in terms of role-play and the idea of a permeable magic circle.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s certain though, is that game creators and AI researchers are moving in the same direction: toward systems that provide content based on individual player preferences and activities. Games now cost many millions to produce \u2013 the assumption that enough players will react favourably to a single narrative, and a single experience, is becoming prohibitively risky.<strong> </strong>We live in an age of behavioural modelling and data science, an age in which Amazon is capable of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36773409\">building personalised video adverts in real-time</a> based on viewer preferences mined from the web. In this context, games that know you \u2013 that learn from you, that are curious about you \u2013 are almost inevitable.</p>",

  "<p>Ken Wiwa, who has died aged 47 after a stroke, was a journalist and author, adviser to three <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/20/nigerian-president-leads-tributes-to-oil-activist-ken-wiwa\">Nigerian presidents </a>and a campaigner for social and environmental justice. As the eldest son of the poet, human rights activist and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/ken-saro-wiwa-memorial-art-bus-denied-entry-to-nigeria\">Ken Saro-Wiwa</a>, he struggled as a young man to forge his own identity. But following his father\u2019s detention on a trumped-up accusation of murder, \u201cKen Junior\u201d, as he was widely known, became a powerful advocate for peace and reconciliation, keeping the territory of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/09/anger-environmental-in-oil-rich-polluted-niger-delta-ogoniland-ken-saro-wiwa\">Ogoniland</a> on the world stage as a symbol of the injustice of oil exploitation in developing countries.</p> <p>Born in Lagos, Ken was sent from Nigeria to Britain, along with his mother, Maria, and four siblings, and studied at Tonbridge school in Kent. He had a complicated relationship with his wealthy anglophile father, a traditional Ogoni leader who had worked for both the Nigerian federal and state governments post-independence in 1960, but who devoted his later life to a struggle for Ogoni autonomy \u2013 and to fighting Shell\u2019s presence in his homeland.</p> <p>High quality crude oil had been discovered by Shell in the small, 404 square mile area of the Niger delta close to Port Harcourt in south Nigeria in 1958. The elder Saro-Wiwa saw clearly that, rather than bringing wealth and prosperity, it had led to war, devastation, social division and the degradation of farm and fishing grounds.</p> <p>The flamboyant author, who expected his expensively educated son to return to Nigeria to continue his own political struggle for Ogoni autonomy, became increasingly a thorn in the side of Shell and the military government led by General <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-general-sani-abacha-1163944.html\">Sani Abacha</a>. Matters came to a head in 1994 when Saro-Wiwa led a peaceful revolt against the oil group. Shell was humiliated, forced to withdraw from Ogoniland and stop production in one of the world\u2019s most oil-rich regions.</p> <p>The Ogonis had won a great victory in their fight for self-determination, but the price of their rebellion was the wrath of the military dictatorship. In 1994, Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders were accused of complicity in the murders of four Ogoni chiefs. The nine were detained in a military camp outside Port Harcourt to be tried by a special military tribunal.</p> <p>Their detention and subsequent torture posed a personal dilemma for the young Ken. Father and son had been close, but by his teens Ken felt intimidated and unable to develop his own identity. So great was his need for independence from his powerful and charismatic father that in 1992, at the age of 23, he changed his name in London to be rid of what he later called \u201cthe straitjacket of identity my father was trying to impose on me\u201d.</p> <p>Becoming \u201cKen Wiwa\u201d, however, was not the liberating experience he had hoped for. \u201c[It] seemed flat and rather unimpressive next to the more colourful Ken Saro-Wiwa,\u201d he said. Tellingly, it took Wiwa two years to break the news to his father of the rejection of his name. When he did so, it was by letter to the military camp where he was being held. The elder man was furious, writing back: \u201cThere is no way in our culture that Ken Wiwa can be the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa\u201d.</p> <p>The dilemma was particularly acute because his father\u2019s detention took place just as his own career was taking off in the UK. Wiwa had become the Guardian\u2019s first online journalist, working with the New Media Laboratory, the groundbreaking forerunner of the paper\u2019s full entry into the digital revolution that was soon to engulf the industry.</p> <p>As the detention of the Ogoni nine became an international issue, with environmental and human rights activists, writers and politicians all appealing to Abacha for clemency, Wiwa found himself sucked ever deeper into his father\u2019s world of politics. In 1995, he gave up his job in journalism to dedicate himself to saving his father\u2019s life, travelling the world to lobby politicians and heads of state to intervene, and to mobilise public opinion. The result was that his father\u2019s name, which he had rejected, became a symbol of the emerging worldwide struggle for environmental justice.</p> <p>Abacha, however, was unmoved \u2013 and on 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the other Ogoni leaders were executed after the military tribunal found them guilty of murder. Their executions took place when Wiwa was in Auckland, New Zealand, to lobby the Commonwealth heads of state and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/nelson-mandela-obituary\">Nelson Mandela</a>, and triggered a worldwide outcry. The British prime minister, John Major, described it as \u201cjudicial murder\u201d, Mandela declared it a \u201cheinous act\u201d and world figures joined the condemnation of Abacha. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth.</p> <p>When the outrage subsided, many expected Wiwa to return to Nigeria to take up his father\u2019s mantle and lead the Ogoni struggle. But although his father had effectively been canonised, he again chose his own path. He had married Olivia Burnett in London in 1996, and the couple and their two sons, Felix and Suanu, went to live in Canada, where Wiwa became a writer-in-residence and a fellow at several universities and foundations, as well as a successful feature writer and TV and radio producer. In 2001, he published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shadow-Saint-Journey-Understand-Fathers/dp/1586420259\">In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son\u2019s Journey to Understand His Father\u2019s Legacy,</a> a moving memoir of a complex life lived between different cultures.</p> <p>Having at times felt isolated from Africa, Wiwa returned to his Nigerian roots. In 2005 he became a World Economic Forum \u201cyoung global leader\u201d and a member of the Africa advisory council of the Prince of Wales\u2019s rainforests project. The Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him as his special assistant on peace, conflict resolution and reconciliation in 2006, and Wiwa later worked as an aide in Abuja to presidents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/06/nigeria-president-umara-yaradua-obituary\">Umaru Yar\u2019Adua</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/goodluck-jonathan\">Goodluck Jonathan</a>.</p> <p>In 2009, he and the families of the other executed Ogoni leaders sued Shell in New York, accusing its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), of having collaborated in their executions. The case never went to full trial, with Shell offering at the last minute to settle out of court for \u00a39.6m. To this day, the company dismisses all claims made against it, saying it had attempted to persuade the Nigerian government to grant clemency.</p> <p>The landmark case was one of the first to see a multinational corporation accused of human rights violations, and confirmed that western corporations working in Africa could no longer act with impunity. It also paved the way for Shell to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/shell-announces-55m-payout-for-nigeria-oil-spills\">pay out over $50m in settlements</a> to around 15,000 Ogoni people for pipeline pollution episodes in Ogoniland in 2011.</p> <p>Wiwa finally resolved his differences with his father, accepting his flaws and attributing to him his strong political conscience, and moral compass. \u201cHis influence remains in everything I do, especially in my relationships with my children,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cI am much closer to him now, if that makes sense. In a way that\u2019s how it should be with fathers and sons \u2013 I had to get away from him to become my own man, and once I had done that, it was easier to appreciate him as a man and a father.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his wife and sons, and by his mother.</p> <p>\u2022 Ken Wiwa (Kenule Bornale Tsaro-Wiwa), writer and campaigner, born 28 November 1968; died 18 October 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2016.

Here are three key things it can do:</p> <h2>Provide role models</h2> <p>It can be a revelation to see women as leaders \u2013 or questioning those in power \u2013 especially given that media and political environments habitually sideline and attack women. Moreover, we have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/publications-and-resources/research/reports/media-and-political-participation\">growing evidence</a> that political debate and discussion shows inspire audiences to participate in their own communities. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the ladies ask questions of the officials, I become encouraged and proud of them</p> <footer> <cite>Woman in Afghanistan responds to seeing a woman question the president</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our recent research reports that those who regularly tune in to BBC Media Action\u2019s governance programmes are more likely to participate in politics than those who don\u2019t, even once other influencing factors such as demographics and interest in politics are taken into account. </p> <p>This is how a woman in rural Afghanistan reacted when she saw a woman from her area ask the then President Hamid Karzai a question on our political debate programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/asia/afghanistan/open-jirga\">Open Jirga</a>: \u201cI like her courage for asking. When the ladies ask questions of the officials, I become encouraged and proud of them.\u201d</p> <h2>Put gender on everyone\u2019s agenda</h2> <p>The media can take gender issues out of the private realm and put them on the political agenda. The Tanzanian political discussion programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/africa/tanzania/a-national-conversation\">Haba Na Haba</a> (Little by Little) does this by treating women\u2019s health topics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/23/why-do-a-million-women-still-suffer-the-treatable-condition-of-fistula\">such as fistula</a>, as political issues. </p> <p>But we need to go beyond this. \u201cApplying a gender lens\u201d is common parlance in women\u2019s rights circles \u2013 but how often does the news use this lens? Rarely. Development practitioners can help the media cover all stories in a way that\u2019s representative of both men and women\u2019s lives and experiences. As the senior producer of political debate programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where-we-work/africa/kenya/sema-kenya\">Sema Kenya</a> says: \u201cWe always made gender part of the programme. If it was on cross-border trade, we\u2019d think about if it affected women in a different way. We didn\u2019t crowbar it in. And gender issues weren\u2019t directed at women, they were just subtly raised.\u201d</p> <h2>Promote inclusion by disrupting norms</h2> <p>Political debate in the media often sends a strong message to women: this is not for you. So it is unsurprising that women are far less likely to watch the news than men. We have been contending with how to make programmes that imagine a new, more inclusive space, rather than recreate an elitist political one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nepal\u2019s <a href=\"http://bbcsajhasawal.com/en/\">Sajha Sawal</a> (Common Questions) debate show is experimenting with new formats. Instead of bringing people into a potentially intimidating studio environment, they take politicians out to communities to visit communal taps, tea shops and fields \u2013 places where women feel much more confident to ask questions. </p> <p>The media is powerful. It can reach millions of people, challenge rigid gender roles and empower both men and women. However, making programmes that transform how we see men and women is complex; there\u2019s no simple, universal recipe to follow. Presidential debates in the US show that having a woman in the race may represent enormous progress, but does not transform the debate. </p> <p>Whether or not women feel genuinely heard, fully valued and spoken to as equals is certainly no box-ticking exercise. And as the pundits deliver their verdicts on Clinton and Trump\u2019s performances, making programmes in which we not only see women, but actually hear them, will still be a work-in-progress. </p> <p><em>Josephine Casserly is a governance and rights adviser at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/mediaactioninsight/entries/703ec6e0-e8e1-4891-b614-752d48c678fc\">BBC Media Action</a>. </em></p> <p><strong>Join our community </strong><strong>of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>The time would come, Marx and Engels thought, when there would be only two classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and all people would align their interests with them. The economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guy-standing\">Guy Standing</a> is known for his descriptions of a different kind of class \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/01/voice-for-emerging-precariat\">the \u201cprecariat\u201d</a>, defined by the insecurity and instability of the work it performs. Its members are diverse: immigrant Uber drivers and millennial interns, part-time lecturers and the cleaners and couriers of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/26/will-we-get-by-gig-economy\">gig economy</a>\u201d, the old working class forced into temporary and casual labour. The capaciousness of the idea has been criticised, but that\u2019s also part of its appeal. The precariat is, potentially, the democratic majority. In his new book, Standing says such workers are increasingly conscious of themselves as a class, in part because they see clearly what they\u2019re not: rentiers.</p> <p>Rentiers get their income not from labour but from rent on assets that they own or control. The global elite profits not just from desirable property or money moved offshore, but also from \u201cintangible assets\u201d: financial instruments such as stocks, derivatives and securities, or intellectual property, including brands and patents. While economists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a> see capitalism necessarily tending towards rising inequality because of its own \u201cfundamental laws\u201d, Standing blames inequality on the \u201crentier capitalism\u201d that has flourished since the 1970s. This, he argues, has corrupted the dream of the free market. If capitalism is to work for the many not the few, what\u2019s needed is what Keynes called the \u201ceuthanasia of the rentier\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Power today lies not with those who control the means of production, but the 'technological apparatus'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Standing shows in relentless detail how the institutional architecture of modern capitalism is geared to benefit rentiers. When cancer drugs are overpriced, it\u2019s because monopolies in the form of patents are granted to private \u201cowners\u201d of inventions, who get rent from their manufacture. When governments break trade agreements, they can be sued, generating income for the litigating company. When you use Airbnb, you\u2019re not part of the sharing economy but of \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d, a term Standing uses to describe how digital platforms act as labour brokers, extracting rent from every transaction (often 20%, sometimes more). These and other new technologies have enabled the outsourcing and offshoring of production, ever greater capital mobility, and make corporations more fluid and flexible. Unlike in the past, power today lies not with corporations that control the means of production, but with those that control the \u201ctechnological apparatus\u201d. </p> <p>And governments are helping them. British corporation and wealth taxes are lower than income taxes, which favours rentiers. The privatisation of \u201cthe commons\u201d \u2013 from the water supply to parks to bus services \u2013 not only hurts those who lose subsidised access to them, but increases inequality by adding to the wealth of their new owners. The replacement of student maintenance grants with loans doesn\u2019t simply deny poorer students access to education and leave them with up to \u00a353,000 of debt; the Student Loans Company also wins.</p> <p>Even policies that appear to help the precariat end up favouring rentiers. When incomes are topped up through tax credits, employers lower wages \u2013 and pocket more themselves. In an age of mounting private debt and stagnating wages \u2013 where <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-3813659/16-million-people-working-age-100-savings-study-shows.html\">17 million Britons have less than \u00a3100 savings</a>, and house prices in England and Wales are on average nine times local annual incomes \u2013 tax breaks on savings, charitable donations and firms\u2019 debt repayments act as subsidies for the rentier class. The policies of the great recession, like the bank bailouts and quantitative easing, are likewise subsidies for the asset-rich.</p> <p>What is to be done? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\">Paul Mason</a> and others who use the idea of the precariat say that the same technologies now accelerating the new rentierism will free us from work in a postcapitalist future. Standing is less optimistic. Networks of information and ideas, he argues, are already lucrative sources of rental income. And work isn\u2019t disappearing, but simply changing \u2013 in contradictory ways that neither the \u201cpostwork\u201d theorists nor the \u201clabourism\u201d of the old left have grasped. The former ignore that the technologies that change work will increase inequality. Trade unionists and social democrats, Standing argues, have not yet dealt with the fact that today, as the nine-to\u2011five career declines, we do more unpaid work in proportion to our paid labour: we work out of hours, at home and when we look for jobs \u2013 work that may not be economically productive. Hourly wage rates have therefore fallen even more than statistics show. At the same time, the kind of work that was previously done for free in private \u2013 housework, or taking care of elderly relatives \u2013 has become low-paid labour for others. Low-paid work now is not in factories but care work in nursing homes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Work is no longer the road to riches, or even the way out of poverty. There may be more work, but it pays less</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Standing, what matters is that technologies are destroying the way our income and earnings have been distributed. A new \u201crental wedge\u201d has been created \u2013 between profits, which are growing, and ever more concentrated, and wages, which are falling and ever more uncertain. Work is no longer the road to riches, or even the way out of poverty. There may be more work, but it pays less. So the workplace should not be the site of struggle; the euthanasia of the rentier, Standing claims, requires more than powerful unions and higher minimum wages. That is why the \u201cenfeebled\u201d proletariat, too wedded to exhausted forms of social democracy, cannot lead a revolt. It falls to the precariat, the other group that doesn\u2019t benefit from rentier capitalism, to challenge it.</p> <p>Standing provides a compelling list of demands it should make \u2013 the regulation of labour brokers, the end of the \u201crent-seeking apparatus\u201d that is a flaw of the intellectual property regime and, crucially, a new income distribution system based around two pillars: first, an unconditional universal basic income \u2013 a policy advocated by both libertarian right and left; second, the institution of democratic sovereign wealth funds to pool and redistribute rental income. Together these would pave the way for a society in which waged work does not determine income, and rents are widely distributed.</p> <p>This is a fascinating book that builds on a lifetime of empirical research, but its politics are hard to pin down. Standing is not advocating the redistribution of work or common ownership of assets, or union politics (even though today\u2019s unions increasingly organise beyond the shopfloor). He wants policies that can mobilise defenders of free markets, too. Yet he sees rentiers as parasites producing nothing of value, and sometimes suggests only income earned through \u201chard work\u201d can be deserved. This is an idea long out of fashion: it slips easily into a quasi-Victorian moralising distinction between deserving and undeserving poor, and a glorification of work that produces real material goods. Standing doesn\u2019t go there, but implicitly inverts the categories to apply to a deserving and undeserving rich. It\u2019s not capitalist profits that bother him, nor does he differentiate between the divergent interests of small and large businesses. The problem is the idle speculator who gives nothing back.</p> <p>This is an idea with broad appeal. While the factory owner of yesteryear was involved in productive activities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> \u2013 sometimes described as a \u201cvampire squid\u201d \u2013 is not. But the contrast shows Standing\u2019s real concern: to purify and socialise capitalism, returning to a morality of rewarding hard work even as he rejects labourism. Capitalism, on this view, can be saved from the excesses of the vampire squid. For those who want its overthrow, Marx and Engels are still a better guide.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Corruption of Capitalism: Why Rentiers Thrive and Work Does Not Pay</em> is published by Biteback.

  "<p>I\u2019ve been an aid worker for the past two decades. When I started out in the mid 1990s humanitarian responses were characterised by giving too much too often and at too great a cost to the taxpayer. The institutional heart tended to rule the head resulting in a broadly scattergun approach to crisis with beneficiary households receiving different forms of assistance. Today, thankfully we\u2019re better at targeting aid where it will have the most impact. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The reinvention of the sector didn\u2019t end with professionalisation. We started to adopt other aspects of private sector</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the past our responses also tended to focus on alleviating short-term needs without addressing the fundamental structural and political challenges that exacerbated the crisis in the first place. For example, it took an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/oct/10/pakistan.india\">earthquake in Kashmir in 2005</a> for the government of Pakistan and international community to acknowledge that the impact of natural disasters would continue until such time as adequate resources were invested in preparedness and prevention. The Pakistan National Disaster Management Authority was duly established in 2007. The Mozambique floods of 2000 and 2001 had a similarly galvanising effect and led to the enhancement of regional monitoring and preparedness platforms. </p> <p>By adopting a more holistic approach the sector has become a vastly more competent responder to crisis than before. But the reinvention of the sector didn\u2019t end with long overdue professionalisation. We started to adopt other aspects of private sector management and readily imbibed their corporate culture. </p> <p>Here\u2019s how a response to a typical crisis unfurls today. Nowadays, almost as soon as a shock happens, it is recorded, broadcast, tweeted and shared on Facebook. Public consciousness stirs and the chief executives of humanitarian agencies (an increasing number of whom have political backgrounds), as well as the fee-paying membership of these organisations begin to query \u201cwhat are their respective agencies doing to alleviate the crisis?\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/20/botwana-droughts-dont-spell-disaster-el-nino-countries-take-note\">Droughts don\u2019t have to spell disaster. El Ni\u00f1o countries, take note</a> </p> </aside>  <p>CEOs need to show they\u2019ve determined their agency\u2019s role in the response quickly, so assessment teams are rapidly dispatched to determine what, if anything, they should do in response to the crisis. However, the rush to respond often jams up the market and leads to congestion. Agencies become in greater danger of duplicating each other\u2019s activities which, in turn, impacts operational efficiency and effectiveness, and reduces value for money. <br></p> <p>Middle-income country Lebanon is a prime example. In a country that is half the size of Wales, there are close to 100 humanitarian agencies appealing through the 2016 Lebanon Crisis Response Plan. Are all these responders required?</p> <p> The arrival of multiple partners is compounded by a lack of regulation surrounding who does what in a response. The competition for resources is fierce, and in today\u2019s increasingly corporate humanitarian sector agencies work assiduously to maintain market share. This is different from earlier times. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>CEOs of humanitarian agencies become bound by the same obligations as their counterparts in the private sector</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The language of business has become the language of aid and business practice has been adopted wholesale by humanitarian agencies. This is not necessarily a bad thing as these aid agencies are now better set up to offer far greater value for money to their two key constituencies: those in need of assistance, and those that provide the funding. <br></p> <p>But, in adopting business culture, the CEOs of humanitarian agencies become bound by the same obligations as their counterparts in the private sector. They are now answerable to boards of trustees and well-remunerated executive performance appears increasingly measured against turnover, be it the amount of funding generated, or the numbers of countries in which an agency is operating. <br></p> <p>Having established a presence in response to a crisis, humanitarian agencies only tend to leave once the funding dries up. <br></p> <p>Aid has become big business and big business has started paying attention. The <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/gha2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">2016 Global Humanitarian Assistance report</a>, for example, shows that $28bn (\u00a323bn) was allocated as humanitarian aid in 2015 (in 2009 it was $16.4bn). <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-rich-think-development-one-way-uk-gender-energy-sustainable-goals\">Why do rich countries think development should be only one way?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But, at the same time needs have deepened, and the cost of maintaining multi-year responses continues to outstrip available resources. The scale of need coupled with the relative lack of resources has led to fierce competition within the sector. Thus, the decision to respond when disaster strikes is no longer simply about how well placed an agency is to respond, but also the commercial and corporate risks that come from not responding. Will an agency\u2019s boards of trustees, members and donors be satisfied to learn that their inactivity stems from the knowledge that rival organisations have things covered? </p> <p>We\u2019ve come a long way in this sector; moving with the times, embracing technology and becoming slicker and more effective in responding to sudden onset emergencies. Future responses may be characterised by the collision between humanitarian and corporate values. The professionalisation of the sector and the adoption of some aspects of corporate practice has turned us into a better functioning, and eminently more capable and credible group. However, we must remain true to our history and principles, and not allow commercial factors to unduly influence what are essentially humanitarian considerations. </p> <p><em>Simon Little is a freelance consultant who has worked for the Department for International Development, the UN and the Red Cross.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Unintentionally, they timed their disbandment with the rise of music-forum discussions, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/\">Pitchfork\u2019s holy grail perfect-score verdicts</a> and the internet\u2019s tendency to give hearsay a bigger platform than concrete facts: Neutral Milk Hotel ended just when mythology became a crucial factor in propelling a band\u2019s reputation, and in the absence of anything to diminish them, their reputation simply grew and grew and grew.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbccea675113605a8c96a1c40184ac9bfb4c67b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbccea675113605a8c96a1c40184ac9bfb4c67b4/48_70_2026_2672/758.jpg\" alt=\"Neutral Milk Hotel\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hard to explain \u2026 Neutral Milk Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merge Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s not to say the 1998 album that made their name, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/03/urban.popandrock\">In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</a>, isn\u2019t a phenomenal record. Born from Mangum\u2019s bizarre, brutally heartfelt interpretation of The Diary of Anne Frank, it shuns reality and historical interpretations for surrealist imagery, Bulgarian street music, drone sections and a lifetime\u2019s supply of fuzz pedals.<br></p> <p>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea went on to inform the following decade\u2019s biggest alternative breakthroughs, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire\">Arcade Fire</a>\u2019s rousing collective cries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beirut\">Beirut</a>\u2019s well-travelled spirit. You can even hear the splintering emotion mirrored on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/24/bon-iver-justin-vernon-22-million-interview\">Bon Iver</a>\u2019s cabin-feverish debut, For Emma, Forever Ago. And the record is so crammed full of the frontman\u2019s subtle, autobiographical references, it\u2019s still being decoded 18 years on. By disappearing, they allowed word of mouth to set the agenda and In the Aeroplane attained the status of being the one indie record you had to hear. Mangum\u2019s unique lyricism, combined with his reclusion, only enhanced fever around the band. Perhaps Frank Ocean took a leaf out of his book when realising that the less you talk, the more people want to hear what you have to say.<br></p> <p>By the time the wheels came off, Neutral Milk Hotel were already enjoying cult status. One of the reasons they split is that Mangum found it hard to deal with the attention he started to get. \u201cJeff\u2019s a very private person,\u201d Bill Doss, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6hkVXpQYYg\">the Olivia Tremor Control</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/10/elephant-6-jeff-mangum-deerhunter\">told the Guardian</a>, \u201cand kids were freaking out over him. [They\u2019d] be following him around, these little packs of kids staring at him.

The band\u2019s early converts were on board for life, and shows soon had the status of being emotionally overwhelming, must-see experiences. But the group still enjoyed the freedom to write and record with little-to-no expectation, sharing communal spaces in Athens, Georgia; making music with zero regard for time of day or final product.</p> <p>That goes some way to explaining Mangum\u2019s sudden reluctance to pursue the project as soon as it took off. Involved in cassette culture and DIY collectives from an early age, music was a free-spirited outlet for him. Once he realised it was not what he had imagined it to be, he decided enough was enough. As he told Pitchfork, in a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/5847-neutral-milk-hotel/\">rare interview in 2002</a>: \u201cI went through a period, after Aeroplane, when a lot of the basic assumptions I held about reality started crumbling. I guess I had this idea that if we all created our dream we could live happily ever after. So when so many of our dreams had come true and yet I still saw that so many of my friends were in a lot of pain \u2026 I realised I can\u2019t just sing my way out of all this suffering.\u201d Given how many bands today tend to press on before fading out with a whimper, his decision to go out with a bang seems admirable. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"139fde92d306c4b0e31ec2bb46d30564da91644c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139fde92d306c4b0e31ec2bb46d30564da91644c/0_130_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NMH perform a reunion show at Fun Fun Fun festival, in Austin, Texas, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NMH perform a reunion show at Fun Fun Fun festival, in Austin, Texas, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Merrick Ales/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/23/neutral-milk-hotel-jeff-mangum-roundhouse-review\">Neutral Milk Hotel review \u2013 it's thrilling to have Jeff Mangum back from the brink</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/23/neutral-milk-hotel-jeff-mangum-roundhouse-review\">A reunion tour</a> in 2013 did little to tarnish the Neutral Milk Hotel legacy. Proceeds went to a charity aimed at improving the lives of Mongolian children, and they weren\u2019t billed beyond the hype in nostalgic festival headline slots. And by not caving in and releasing another record in conjunction with a tour, they helped keep things on their terms. Everyone\u2019s accounts of the reunion shows are wildly different. Depending on who you ask, these comeback gigs were either religious experiences or bitter disappointments. But most crucially, Neutral Milk Hotel remained a source of personal investment. Every one of the band\u2019s fans has their own epiphany, an individual account of the first time they were struck down by what they heard. By opening up these moments to a new generation, or simply those who missed the boat last time round, Mangum finally managed to hold the ropes of his band\u2019s mythology. </p>",
  "<p>Last year Ilana Taub\u2019s startup prevented more than 50 tonnes of apples, bananas, blueberries and raspberries from going to landfill by creating snacks from surplus fruit.

In partnership with Israeli packaging company Tipa, Snact has launched <a href=\"http://www.snact.co.uk/news/compostable-packaging\" rel=\"nofollow\">packaging</a> that takes six months to break down in garden compost. \u201cWe have found a way of being disposable without causing environmental damage,\u201d says Taub.</p> <p>Each year at least <a href=\"https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/EllenMacArthurFoundation_TheNewPlasticsEconomy_15-3-16.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">8m tonnes</a> (pdf) of plastic end up in the ocean and it is predicted that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the sea. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, when you think how much plastic has invaded our lives,\u201d says Taub. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and [food] safe, but not feasible in the long run.

The company is currently undergoing trials with several UK manufacturers.</p> <p>A major obstacle to the uptake of home-compostable plastics, however, is cost. \u201cIt is more expensive than traditional plastic, so tends to be used where it fits into the ethos of the product \u2013 deluxe, green or organic,\u201d says Andy Sweetman, marketing manager at Futamura UK, which produces home-compostable NatureFlex.</p> <p>There is also the issue of consumer understanding and uptake. Snact\u2019s packaging leaves consumers in no doubt with its \u201cthis bag is compostable!\u201d messaging, but not all companies make it clear. According to Sweetman, for example, who says Futamura has hundreds of companies using its home-compostable packaging including Nestl\u00e9 UK for its Quality Street wrappers, not all its customers promote the environmental credentials of their packaging.</p> <p>Beyond plastics you can stick on your own compost heap (or in industrial composters), manufacturers and scientists are also exploring other alternatives.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt32GgQGTcI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wt32GgQGTcI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Edible, biodegradable food packaging.

  "<p>The road on which Theresa May currently finds herself is well travelled. Most successful politicians rely on a kind of necessary deception, projecting authenticity and credibility while conducting business in the only way that political business can be conducted: by negotiation. On balance, but never enthusiastically, May thought Britain would prosper more as part of an imperfect EU than out of it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">In an informal session</a> with the global bankers Goldman Sachs, a month before the referendum, she stressed the financial value of membership and warned of the consequences of leaving the single market.

But at neither event did she suggest, as she did in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conference-panel-verdict\">conference speech earlier this month</a>, that curtailing free movement must take priority over membership of the single market, nor advocate, as her home secretary did, that employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">count their foreign workers</a>, or that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\">fate of EU citizens in Britain </a>might be a matter for negotiation. Quite the opposite in fact: in her on-the-record speech in April, she actually said that while free movement rules make it harder to control European immigration <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretarys-speech-on-the-uk-eu-and-our-place-in-the-world\">\u201cthey do not mean we cannot control the border\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Since 23 June, Mrs May has said scarcely a kind word about the EU. This is not necessarily dishonourable: her rhetoric has been aimed at persuading the 52% who voted leave that she feels what they feel. She is marching to their tune. A consequence of the binary choice of a referendum as opposed to the choice between programmes offered by a general election is that it appears to deliver a single message that politicians are obliged to honour. We are all learning how to manage the consequences.</p> <p>That is more or less the official line from No 10 this morning, in the wake of the Guardian\u2019s story about her private speech: \u201cWe are working to make a success of this new opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>But this is no way to rebuild the confidence of voters in the good intentions of politicians. May is overinterpreting the result, using it to construct headlines and justify policies that are not borne out by the subsequent analysis of the no vote \u2013 which shows that it was neither exclusively among poorer people, nor mainly motivated by anti-migration sentiment \u2013 and then using it to promote division. This is not leading, it is following.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>May is establishing herself as one of the most evasive of modern prime ministers. This is a lethal electoral strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Healing the divisions that the referendum exposed does not mean acting as if all the right was on one side. That is democracy as the tyranny of the majority. Often, it is clear that May does really understand that. On the steps of Downing Street as the new prime minister in July, she began by acknowledging the kind of institutional injustice that makes people feel powerless, and she talked persuasively of an economy that works for all. That is the tone of voice that the post-referendum country needs.</p> <p>May is already establishing herself as one of the most evasive of modern prime ministers. The psychologist Peter Bull <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/theresa-may-has-a-very-special-technique-for-avoiding-questions-67424\">describes her as a sphinx-like equivocator</a>, author of a new technique of never giving a specific answer to a direct question. This is a lethal electoral strategy.</p> <p>The Theresa May who talked to the smart kids at Goldman Sachs a couple of months earlier might have allowed her audience to influence her tone of voice. She might have thought that her words would remain unreported. But I think that was the authentic Theresa May. She should remember that authenticity is the quality voters most value. And she should reframe her message about Brexit to reflect her real concerns before she leads a car-crash departure with all the miserable consequences that she foresaw when she was talking the truth to the city slickers.</p>",

For you there was a new lifestyle (healthy food, physical changes, no drinking) and a huge responsibility. For your baby, it was the beginning of a life where their only guide for nine months would be their genes and the environment in your womb.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/29/dr-dillner-can-sleep-training-help-parents-and-children\">Should I sleep-train my child?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Your baby will have rapidly developed a sense of time from the rhythms in the womb, including your heart beat. They will also have had two sets of timing genes. The first set ensures they sleep, just like other animals. This very large set of genes is very robust indeed: every baby sleeps, and no disease or experience will change that. The second set of genes creates their 24-hour sense of time throughout the day, including waking and sleeping.</p> <p>Genes are, of course, a bit of a lottery. Although you may have a very distinct sense of sleep and the timing that suits your day (and night), your baby\u2019s genes are a mixture of yours and your partner\u2019s. Babies are different and have different sleep patterns, so the chance that their sleep patterns will match yours is very small.</p> <p>During pregnancy, your baby experienced the rhythm of night and day, sleep and wake, only through you. These messages are confused in pregnancy because your sleep patterns change for many different reasons (physical changes, baby\u2019s movements, needing to urinate more at night, tiredness and not getting enough sleep yourself). Your baby may have been soothed by the experience of you moving around during the day, and more active at night when you rarely moved. Throughout pregnancy, your good sleep will have helped your baby. We know that around the 32nd week of pregnancy, your baby sleeps too.</p> <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons why sleep needs to be a high priority for every pregnant woman; another is that sleep is vital for giving birth. Although being fatigued during pregnancy is normal, women who sleep less than six hours a night, on average, have longer labours and are 4.5 times more likely to have a caesarean delivery.</p> <p>At birth the need to feed dominates a baby\u2019s world \u2013 and that of its parents. Feeding is hard work for a baby, and makes them tired \u2013 so they sleep, rest and recover. Then the need to feed comes again, often in a pattern of every four hours or so. Babies have no established sense of night or day, and they tend to have cycles that are far shorter than 24 hours long. This is because their timing systems for the 24-hour day are not yet fully formed at birth, and they won\u2019t function consistently until a baby is about two to six months old.</p> <p>So the short answer to the question is this: babies don\u2019t sleep through the night because they can\u2019t.</p> <p>At between two and six months, a baby\u2019s timing systems should develop so that their sleep has clear patterns. A very recent scientific discovery has shown that although a baby\u2019s sleep, like an adult\u2019s, is divided into a time of dreams (REM \u2013 rapid eye movement sleep), and quiet deep sleep (non-REM), a baby has far more REM sleep than an adult. It appears this is necessary to consolidate a baby\u2019s rapid learning about the world, including their understanding of night and day. And for a baby, sleep is vital for brain development in other ways too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/sep/19/sleep-consultant-parents-train-babies-worth-paying\">Can't put the baby to bed?

Do we let them cry or not? Does breastfeeding help? How can we make sure they are safe?</p> <p>Most sleep advice for babies applies to the whole family. The difference is that babies have to learn the timing of day and night only from signals in the environment.</p> <p>Sunlight is the strongest environmental signal of all. Going outside is vital for your baby (and you) in setting your internal clocks to the same time. So the darker the bedroom, the better it is for sleep. In contrast, the light-emitting screens of televisions, phones or computer devices used before sleep, or \u201cnight lights\u201d during sleep, are not a good idea.</p> <p>Night is signalled by a fall in temperature, so cooler bedrooms are better. It is important to establish a regular pattern of waking and going to sleep, so the routine becomes familiar and pleasant.</p> <p>Breast milk contains the hormone melatonin, which signals your sleep time to your baby, just as it did during pregnancy, if you decide to breastfeed. In the early weeks a baby is likely to doze off for short periods during a feed. Carry on feeding until you think they have finished or are fully asleep.</p> <p>Guidelines are available for keeping babies safe while they\u2019re asleep: <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/getting-baby-to-sleep.aspx\" title=\"\">Helping Your Baby to Sleep</a> (NHS) and <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/\" title=\"\">Keeping Your Baby Safe (NIH) </a>offer good advice.</p> <p>Also, trust yourself: if you can\u2019t bear your baby\u2019s distress when they still wake up crying at 14 months, go to them.</p> <p>And try not to worry.

Country Garden is a company with social objectives and I think it\u2019s one of the things socialists should do \u2013 subvert capital and make sure it works.\u201d</p> <p>This year he was in Chicago as the guest of mayor Rahm Emanuel, and could not be more on board with fashionable ideas about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\" title=\"\">cities as hubs of innovation, diversity and progress</a>. Someone there asked why Birmingham didn\u2019t have its own foreign office.

But Clancy seems not only to be serious but also to think that Brexit may even help.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve [Birmingham] got 19 people in Brussels now,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously post-Brexit one has to reface the world, but I think if you\u2019re engaging in a proactive economic policy in relation to building inclusive growth in your city, that involves engaging with world capital. That\u2019s how diplomacy started in the very earliest days. We believe that city regions, city states indeed, are going to be far more powerful post-Brexit in terms of developing international trade.\u201d</p> <p>Clancy grew up in Stockport, the son of a nursery school headteacher and an electrician, and went from a Catholic grammar school to Keele University, where he studied English and law. He worked as a teacher and a solicitor, joined the Labour party when his daughter was born in 1989, and moved to Birmingham a year later to be near his wife\u2019s family.</p> <p>In 1997 he chaired Gisela Stuart\u2019s campaign when she won Edgbaston from the Conservatives, and he challenged Sir Albert Bore four times as Labour group leader before finally being elected last year. Bore stood down following a highly critical <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/kerslake-report-birmingham-council-must-radically-improve\" title=\"\">report by Sir Bob Kerslake</a>, commissioned in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/birmingham-childrens-services-run-trust-following-failures\" title=\"\">children\u2019s services failures </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/17/birmingham-schools-inquiry-hardline-sunni-islam-trojan-horse\" title=\"\">\u201cTrojan horse\u201d scandal,</a> when an investigation criticised Muslim-majority schools for promoting \u201csegregationist attitudes\u201d and a politicised version of Islam. The report called for a complete overhaul of the council, or \u201cprogramme of culture change\u201d, and, among other reforms, its children\u2019s services department is in the process of being spun off into a voluntary trust.</p> <p>A supporter of electoral reform on the left of his party, Clancy wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/economics-blog/2014/may/27/local-authority-pension-fund-reforms-john-clancy-secret-wealth-garden\" title=\"\">book </a>arguing that local authority pension funds should be pooled and forced to buy local investment bonds. Whether he voted for Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, he won\u2019t say: \u201cI think at the moment it\u2019s probably best to \u2026\u201d He stops and restarts. \u201cThat\u2019s something that happened over the summer\u2026 It needn\u2019t have happened, it shouldn\u2019t have happened and I think most people who were involved in the challenge now accept it was a grave error of judgment.\u201d Now he wants Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell to start paying attention to Labour\u2019s strength in local government, calling London plus the 10 Labour councils of the <a href=\"http://corecities.com/\" title=\"\">Core Cities group</a> the party\u2019s \u201cfirst 11\u201d. While the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d has had a near monopoly on devolution-related news, and Manchester mayoral hopeful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-not-afraid-of-challenging-labour-policy\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham has by far the highest profile of Labour\u2019s mayoral candidates</a>, Clancy thinks the change of Conservative leader and the sacking of George Osborne were good news for the \u201cMidlands engine\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/theresa-may-must-explain-her-vision\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s admiration for Joseph Chamberlain, mayor of Birmingham in the 1870s</a>, shared by her adviser Nick Timothy, was noted in the first days of her premiership. Communities secretary Sajid Javid\u2019s constituency is a mile and a half from Clancy\u2019s ward, business secretary Greg Clark is another supporter, and Clancy knows he will need such allies if he is to protect the region\u2019s automotive industry from potentially ruinous tariffs. About the trio of Fox, Johnson and Davis leading the Brexit negotiations, he has less to say, except (dropping his voice) that they make \u201can interesting band\u201d.</p> <p>He claims he didn\u2019t consider running for mayor of the West Midlands, \u201cgenuinely not for a moment\u201d. Since Labour\u2019s metro mayor candidates are all either current or former MPs, one wonders if he calculated that, as a local politician, he wouldn\u2019t win. But Clancy insists he wants to run Birmingham, the biggest local authority in Europe. The metro mayor will have a strategic role overseeing regeneration across the region. In budget terms, Clancy points out that his is the bigger job: Birmingham council\u2019s budget (including schools and social care across an area covering 10 parliamentary constituencies and 1.1 million people) is \u00a33.5bn, whereas the metro mayor\u2019s is \u00a336.5m. As Birmingham\u2019s leader, he will, in any case, be a big player on the mayor\u2019s team.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He calls London plus the 10 Labour councils of the Core Cities group the Labour party\u2019s 'first 11'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aside from an acute shortage of homes, the pain inflicted by cuts, and the disconnection from politics among working-class voters that Clancy believes was one of lessons of the EU vote, he says the council\u2019s biggest problem is that it \u201cthought it was the city\u201d. He suggests Chamberlain was a metro mayor before his time in understanding the city as a public-private partnership. He calls the West Midlands authority\u2019s plan to invest in mental health \u201cChamberlainesque\u201d, and says the new combined authorities are filling gaps left by the <a href=\"http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/regional-development-agencies.htm\" title=\"\">regional development agencies</a> abolished by the Coalition in 2010.</p> <p>Clancy is relishing headlines about people relocating to his city, along with the buzz of HS2, and says Birmingham is ahead of anywhere else in the way it runs its schools. He even has a positive spin on the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d debacle, and says the end-result was a sharpening of \u201cBirmingham values\u201d, but the council itself remains on shaky ground. Further recommendations from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/birmingham-improvement-panel-named\" title=\"\">panel appointed in 2015 by the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles</a>, to keep an eye on it, and ensure that Kerslake\u2019s recommendations are followed through, are expected shortly.</p> <p>Would he try to resurrect the idea of a mayor of the city of Birmingham?</p> <p>\u201cJoe Chamberlain wasn\u2019t a directly elected mayor: he was elected by city councillors. I don\u2019t think it particularly held him back, not that I\u2019m suggesting I\u2019m necessarily anywhere near that kind of level,\u201d he laughs.As for Clancy\u2019s global vision, he says: \u201cGlobal growth, capital and enterprise were offered to ordinary folk as a way to achieve their dreams, and turned out to be quite the opposite. You ended up with hollowed-out economies in big cities around the world. So the response has to be from big cities, in terms of industrial strategy, and in the UK that has to start from places like Birmingham.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> <p><br><strong>Age</strong> 54</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> Birmingham</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married, one daughter</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> St Bede\u2019s Roman Catholic College, Manchester; Keele University, English and law joint honours degree; Manchester Law School.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> December 2015-present: leader, Birmingham city council; 1985-2015 teacher, various comprehensive schools</p> <p><strong>Public life</strong> February 2002-present: elected Birmingham council member; served on several key committees, including education scrutiny, regeneration scrutiny, public protection and planning.</p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Co-author (with with industry professor David Bailey), Blogs from the Blackstuff (2010); The Secret Wealth Garden: Re-wiring Local Government Pension Funds back into Regional Economies (2014); regular business columnist for the Birmingham Post.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Stockport County FC and Aston Villa FC supporter, playing darts and campaigned to keep the pastime alive in Birmingham pubs</p>",
  "<p>Stroll along Copenhagen\u2019s waterfront and the horizon is punctuated by the smokestacks from the power station at the tip of Amager island. Construction has just begun on a replacement that will run on fossil-fuel free biomass when it opens in 2020. Beside the power plant, the final touches are being put on the striking aluminium facade of Amager Bakke, an incinerator that will double as a recreational space for the city when it opens next year \u2013 complete with an artificial ski slope running down its wedge-shaped roof.</p> <p>Both plants will be green totems for Copenhagen\u2019s ambitions to be the first city in the world to go zero-carbon by 2025, with the incineration plant claiming to be the cleanest burning building of its kind in the world.</p> <p>But they are also emblematic of something bigger: how industry is trying to transform into something cleaner and greener.<br></p> <p>The tagline for the <a href=\"https://www.a-r-c.dk/amager-bakke\">Amager Bakke</a> incineration plant, designed by the renowned Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), is that it will be \u201cpart of the city\u201d, providing social as well as physical infrastructure. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tate Modern was a power plant that turned into a museum. We are trying to make a functioning power plant \u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Bjarke Ingels</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alongside the all-weather ski slope, there will be a climbing wall to scale the 80m high structure, and a grass area on the roof for visitors to picnic on and enjoy the view over Copenhagen. It is a stark juxtaposition to the building\u2019s main purpose: where streams of trucks will deliver waste from across the city to be converted into electricity for the city\u2019s district heating system.</p> <p>BIG\u2019s founder, Bjarke Ingels, says Amager Bakke will marry art and science and \u201cchange public perceptions of what a public utility should be\u201d. Unlike London\u2019s former Bankside power station \u2013 reincarnated as the Tate Modern 20 years after it ceased to produce electricity \u2013 Amager Bakke will replace an existing power plant, adding public amenity without losing its original function, Ingels says. \u201cThe Tate Modern was a power plant that turned into a museum. What we are trying to do here is make a functioning power plant that also has these other elements.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f67d07d74abdbe56e5e1321b1afbf42fc3dd6dd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f67d07d74abdbe56e5e1321b1afbf42fc3dd6dd2/0_0_10267_6845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amager Bakke incinerator and ski slope nears completion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The incinerator and ski slope near completion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rasmus Hjortsh\u00f8j/Coast</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar transformation will take place a few hundred metres away, at the 45-year-old power plant, which currently runs on coal and biomass. The plant will be converted to run entirely on biomass and be reborn as \u201cBIO4\u201d in 2020. If Amager Bakke will serve as the city\u2019s ski resort, BIO4 will be a forestry attraction under architect Gottlieb Paludan\u2019s plans to cover the facade of the 46m high building with hanging tree trunks. The design won the Leading European Architecture Forum (Leaf) award this month.</p> <p>Frank Jensen, Copenhagen\u2019s lord mayor, says that the two plants were not situated away from the city because they need to feed into Copenhagen\u2019s highly energy-efficient district heating system \u2013 the most extensive in the world, covering <a href=\"http://www.c40.org/case_studies/98-of-copenhagen-city-heating-supplied-by-waste-heat\">98% of the capital\u2019s heat demand</a>. \u201cThe central location of our combined heat and power plants is important because it minimises the length of transportation of district heating and thus the heat loss,\u201d he says.</p> <p>J\u00f8rgen Abildgaard, the man in city hall in charge of realising Copenhagen\u2019s climate plan, explains that wind power and geothermal energy will secure Copenhagen\u2019s energy future in the long term. In the medium term, however, the power plant will use wood pellets so it can eradicate the use of coal, which currently powers more than half the district heating system. Coal is both a dirty fossil fuel and more energy intensive than wood.</p> <p>By converting completely to sustainably sourced wood pellets, the new Copenhagen system will not only be CO2-neutral but extremely low in the environmental pollutants sulphur dioxide (SO\u2082) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) \u2013 an important consideration given that the plant will be sited less than a kilometre away from homes.</p> <p>The wood pellets are sourced from waste wood that would otherwise rot and emit methane \u2013 and not from chopped down trees. </p> <p>Jesper Gottlieb, creative director of the architects behind the BIO4 power plant, says the educational function of the building was part of the brief from the city\u2019s publicly owned utility, Hofor. The public will be able to follow a nature trail up through the tree trunks to a viewing platform where they can see the workings of the plant and learn about clean and green energy.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f9001b65046caf07de0d5d0669f3208dd18964c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9001b65046caf07de0d5d0669f3208dd18964c/143_0_2257_1354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s Shenzhen East Waste-to-Energy Power Plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s Shenzhen waste to energy plant is set to become the world\u2019s largest when it opens in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Public education will also play a big role in the design of a state-of-the art <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2016/02/04/worlds-largest-waste-to-energy-plant-shenzhen-china-schmidt-hammer-lassen-gottlieb-paludan/\">incineration plant in Shenzhen in China</a>, which was recently awarded to Gottlieb Paludan and fellow Danish firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen.

It is a pressing issue for the city of Shenzhen, where late last year an illegal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/21/china-landslide-dozens-missing-shenzhen-construction-waste-collapses\">20-storey landfill site collapsed</a>, killing 58 people. </p> <p> \u201cWe are in a position where utility companies want to engage with people and show them that there are no dangerous substances coming out of their smokestacks,\u201d says Gottlieb.</p> <h2>Back to the future</h2> <p>According to BIG, sulphur dioxide emissions in Copenhagen\u2019s new waste treatment plant will be reduced by 99.5% and nitrous oxide by 90% compared with the plant it will replace.</p> <p>But Philipp Rode, executive director of the London School of Economics\u2019s cities programme, worries about having waste-to-energy plants so near a city, regardless of how advanced the technology to clean their emissions. \u201cIn the end these chimneys are still emitting something. We can\u2019t really square the circle.\u201d </p> <p>Copenhagen is an extreme example, he says, of the paradigm shift in the way many cities around the world relate to industry. In the 20th century cities began positioning industry \u2013 and the associated pollution, noise and heavy goods traffic \u2013 well away from urban centres.</p> <p>Now, Rode says, with cleaner technology and the rise of 3D printing, \u201cthere\u2019s no longer the enormous pressure to push these facilities out of the city. Instead there\u2019s excitement about maintaining diversity and keeping those [industrial] sites, and their legacy with it.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the end these chimneys are still emitting something.

Cities historically have been very, very wasteful. They export a lot of waste; they use and consume a lot of energy. Now they are looking at \u2026 correcting that historical inefficiency\u201d by importing those functions again.</p> <p>He says the BIG-designed waste treatment plant in Copenhagen shows how even an industry as notoriously smelly, loud and disruptive as a waste treatment plant can be situated in a densely populated urban setting. \u201cThey are quieter; you can control the odours, and you can create recreational space around it. I always hold this [Amager Bakke] up as an example of how you should think of waste-to-energy plants going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Nina Rappaport, author of <a href=\"http://www.verticalurbanfactory.org/\">Vertical Urban Factory</a>, which charts the history of factories in cities, says the first contemporary example was Volkswagen\u2019s Glaserne Manufaktur [Transparent Factory] in Dresden in 2001. </p> <p> VW was persuaded to site the 81,600 sq m factory in the middle of the city by the municipal government in a bid to create jobs in impoverished east Germany after reunification.</p> <p>The factory, and a similar one built by BMW in Munich, have become tourist attractions, allowing people passing on the street outside to see what is happening inside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/23/copenhagen-christiania-drugs-commune-future\">Paradise lost: does Copenhagen\u2019s Christiania commune still have a future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rode says German carmakers have only been able to site factories in city centres because they have outsourced the most polluting elements of manufacturing to countries like China. \u201cWhat you have are high-end components being put together with robotic machinery.\u201d</p> <p>But the fact that the BMW plant in Munich is sited next door to the company\u2019s headquarters is also significant, he says. \u201cIt tells you a lot about Germany, that sense of bringing management and workers closer and creating a nexus of exchange between researchers and the production line. That is part of the selling proposition of the cars \u2026 It\u2019s an extended version of a flagship store.\u201d</p> <p>Rappaport says innovations such as 3D printing have allowed high-end products to be made with smaller machines \u2013 and that many companies currently manufacturing in city centres are reusing sites that housed factories early last century, but broken into small units. </p> <p>She cites examples in London\u2019s Shoreditch and Kings Cross, and the former naval works in Brooklyn, but says it could make the most difference in former industrial cities like Detroit and Manchester which have been in decline. \u201cIt\u2019s a great model, but maybe not for the most expensive cities like London, New York and Paris, where the high cost of land may make it less viable. For former industrial cities that have the space and land \u2013 and need the jobs \u2013 it makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

Wednesday morning, as a reported 10,000 pro-Beijing demonstrators assembled outside Legco carrying red Chinese flags and placards that read: \u201cSay no to Hong Kong independence!\u201d, \u201cKick out pro-independence lawmakers!\u201d and \u201cHong Kong belongs to China!\u201d <br></p> <p> \u201cAs Chinese people, we have a duty to speak out,\u201d one protester, who gave his name as Wong, told the local television network iCable News. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are here to oppose the two running dogs in Hong Kong, who insulted all Chinese people around the world,\u201d said another, named only as Ku, according to Now TV. <br></p> <p>Inside the legislature there were chaotic scenes as Yau and Leung <a href=\"http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1292935-20161026.htm\">reportedly \u201cbarged\u201d into the chamber</a>, with the support of other pro-democracy lawmakers, in defiance of an order banning their admission to the morning\u2019s session. </p> <p>The session was subsequently suspended. </p> <p>With tensions rising fast, experts fear the former British colony could now be on the verge of a renewed phrase of political upheaval. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the political and social situation in Hong Kong is now going into another highly turbulent and potentially highly unstable period,\u201d said political scientist Sonny Shiu-Hing Lo.</p> <p>Lo, the author of Hong Kong\u2019s Indigenous Democracy, said he expected the conflict between pro- and anti-Beijing politicians to intensify over the coming months as Hong Kong prepared for the election of its new chief executive in March 2017.</p> <p>Street confrontations between police and anti-Beijing protesters were also now possible, Lo added, particularly if Yau and Leung were blocked from taking up their seats in Hong Kong\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>\u201cI think the situation appears to be quite volatile \u2026 All in all the situation in Hong Kong needs to be monitored very

But they\u2019re not the worst. The worst thing about Donald Trump is that he\u2019s the man in the mirror.</p> <p>We love to horrify ourselves with his excesses, and to see him as a monstrous outlier, the polar opposite of everything a modern, civilised society represents. But he is nothing of the kind. He is the distillation of all that we have been induced to desire and admire. Trump is so repulsive not because he offends our civilisation\u2019s most basic values, but because he embodies them.</p> <p>Trump personifies the traits promoted by the media and corporate worlds he affects to revile; the worlds that created him. He is the fetishisation of wealth, power and image in a nation where <a href=\"http://valuesandframes.org/\">extrinsic values</a> are championed throughout public discourse. His conspicuous consumption, self-amplification and towering (if fragile) ego are in tune with the dominant narratives of our age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they even cast their vote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the recipient of vast inherited wealth who markets himself as solely responsible for his good fortune, he is the man of our times. The US Apprentice TV show which he hosted tells the story of everything he is not: the little guy dragging himself up from the bottom through enterprise and skill. None of this distinguishes him from the majority of the very rich, whose entrepreneurial image, loyally projected by the media, clashes with their histories of huge bequests, government assistance, monopolies and rent-seeking.</p> <p>If his politics differ from those of the rest of the modern Republican party, it is because he is, in some respects, more liberal. Every vice, for the Republican trailblazers such as Ted Cruz and Scott Walker, is now a virtue; every virtue a vice. Encouraged by the corporate media, the Republicans have been waging a full-spectrum assault on empathy, altruism and the decencies we owe to other people. Their gleeful stoving in of faces, their cackling destruction of political safeguards and democratic norms, their stomping on all that is generous and caring and cooperative in human nature, have turned the party into a game of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/23/mortal-kombat-x-review-violent-but-charmingly-hammy\">Mortal Kombat</a> scripted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/reading-breitbart-news-steve-bannon-donald-trump\">Breitbart News</a>.</p> <p>Did Trump invent the xenophobia and racism that infuse his campaign? Did he invent his conspiracy theories about stolen elections and the criminality of his opponents? No. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/elizabeth-warren-trump-didnt-invent-the-rigged-election-myth-republicans-did/2016/10/18/921ac368-953b-11e6-9b7c-57290af48a49_story.html?utm_term=.c179cfb12635\">They were there all along</a>. What is new and different about him is that he has streamlined these narratives into a virulent demagoguery. But the opportunity has been building for years; all that was required was someone blunt and unscrupulous enough to take it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa6bcad86b5927c0b2bb50d979fc7a2f91b0e588\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa6bcad86b5927c0b2bb50d979fc7a2f91b0e588/0_15_306_317/306.jpg\" alt=\"The fourth US president, James Madison.\" width=\"306\" height=\"317\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fourth US president, James Madison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: White House/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor can you single out Trump for ignoring, denying and deriding the key issues of our time, such as climate change. Almost all prominent Republicans have been at it. In fact, across the four presidential debates, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/10/19/13342250/presidential-debates-climate-change\">not one question about climate change was asked</a>. Even when politicians and journalists accept the science, it makes little difference if they avoid the subject like the plague.</p> <p>America\u2019s fourth president, James Madison, envisaged the United States constitution as representation tempered by competition between factions. In the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp\">10th federalist paper</a>, written in 1787, he argued that large republics were better insulated from corruption than small, or \u201cpure\u201d democracies, as the greater number of citizens would make it \u201cmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried\u201d. A large electorate would protect the system against oppressive interest groups. Politics practised on a grand scale would be more likely to select people of \u201cenlightened views and virtuous sentiments\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the US \u2013 in common with many other nations \u2013 now suffers the worst of both worlds: a large electorate dominated by a tiny faction. Instead of republics being governed, as Madison feared, by \u201cthe secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority\u201d, they are beholden to the not-so-secret wishes of an unjust and interested minority. What Madison could not have foreseen was the extent to which unconstrained campaign finance and a sophisticated lobbying industry would come to dominate an entire nation, regardless of its size.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/elizabeth-warren-us-president-workers-rights-wall-street\">Elizabeth Warren is the US president we need, but can\u2019t have \u2013 this time | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For every representative, Republican or Democrat, who retains a trace element of independence, there are three sitting in the breast pocket of corporate capital. Since the supreme court decided that there should be no effective limits on campaign finance, and, to a lesser extent, long before, candidates have been reduced to tongue-tied automata, incapable of responding to those in need of help, incapable of regulating those in need of restraint, for fear of upsetting their funders.</p> <p>Democracy in the US is so corrupted by money that it is no longer recognisable as democracy. You can kick individual politicians out of office, but what do you do when the entire structure of politics is corrupt? Turn to the demagogue who rages into this political vacuum, denouncing the forces he exemplifies. The problem is not, as Trump claims, that the election will be stolen by ballot rigging. It is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the American people before they get anywhere near casting their votes. When Trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the system, he\u2019s right. The only problem is that he is the system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024women_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024women.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024women_KP-2166838.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Eleven women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The political constitution of the United States is not, as Madison envisaged, representation tempered by competition between factions. The true constitution is plutocracy tempered by scandal. In other words, all that impedes the absolute power of money is the occasional exposure of the excesses of the wealthy. What distinguishes Trump\u2019s political career is that, until recently, his scandals have done him no harm.</p> <p>Trump disgusts us because, where others use a dog whistle, he uses a klaxon. We hate to hear his themes so clearly articulated. But we know in our hearts that they suffuse the way the world is run.</p> <p>Because this story did not begin with Trump, it will not end with Trump, however badly he may lose the election. Yes, he is a shallow, mendacious, boorish and extremely dangerous man. But those traits ensure that he is not an outsider but the perfect representation of his caste, the caste that runs the global economy and governs our politics. He is our system, stripped of its pretences.</p>",
  "<p>There has been much debate about the Teaching Excellence Framework since it was initially proposed. Some have called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/04/universities-higher-education-research-bill\">for an outright rejection</a>, while others have come up with ideas about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jul/07/seven-rules-the-teaching-excellence-framework-should-follow\">principles</a> it should follow. But I am interested in how to design an effective system to measure and improve the quality of learning and teaching across the higher education system. What would that actually look like?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/04/will-the-teaching-excellence-framework-be-sexist\">Will the Teaching Excellence Framework be sexist?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are four things that need to be understood: </p> <ol> <li>We need to recognise that any form of measurement is expensive and so, to avoid wasting money, it needs to lead to improvements in practice. <br></li> <li>Crucially, we need to accept that no measure is precise. Metrics are sledgehammers rather than lasers and will, at best, offer broad indications of quality. Any high-precision instrument that we are offered will be lubricated with vast quantities of snake oil.<br></li> <li>We need to take account of what we know from more than 40 years of research into learning and teaching in higher education, but also what we know about how institutions respond when they are assessed on performance measures.</li> <li>We need to recognise that this involves designing an assessment system, rather than arguing over individual metrics.</li> </ol> <h2>Ingredients of a fit-for-purpose Tef</h2> <ul> <li>The criteria will be based on a research-informed view of high-quality teaching. We need a clear basis on which to include and exclude each criterion. There are a number of potential frameworks that could be used for this, for example, <a href=\"http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/7044/\">the Teaching and Learning Research Programmes 10 principles of teaching and learning</a> or <a href=\"https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/downloads/ukpsf_2011_english.pdf\">the UK Professional Standards Framework for Higher Education</a>. <br></li> <li>The individual metrics informing the assessment system need to be part of a collective and coherent system. This involves relating the metrics to the overall criteria and showing how they measure something that is identified as a necessary element of high quality teaching. <br></li> <li>The metrics should be measures of the quality of teaching offered, rather than the prestige of institutions or the profile of their students. To improve their scores, institutions would have to improve their teaching practices. <br></li> <li>The overall criteria should remain stable but the actual metrics should change every year. They should be drawn from a very large public bank of potential metrics. This is important so that institutions focus on improving the quality of their practices rather than fixing individual metrics.<br></li> <li>The judgments offered by the Tef should be relatively simple. They should be focused on the subject level rather than the institutional level because institutions can, clearly, have programmes of variable quality.<br></li> </ul> <h2>Lack of vision</h2> <p>Judged by these criteria, the current Year 2 version of Tef performs OK. In particular, benchmarking the metrics by students\u2019 entry characteristics and flagging statistically significant differences are improvements on university league tables. However, not focusing on the subject level is a major flaw in the Year 2 Tef\u2019s ability to offer valid indications of quality (although this is pencilled in for Year 4).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/sep/23/the-reward-for-good-teaching-we-can-push-learners-deeper-into-debt\">The reward for good teaching in universities? We can push learners deeper into debt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the impact of not basing the system on a coherent, research-informed vision of teaching quality becomes even more apparent in the discussion of future metrics. </p> <p>Measures that <a href=\"https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/dimensions_of_quality.pdf\">we know</a> do not relate to the quality of learning and teaching, such as contact hours or \u201cteaching intensity\u201d, are being <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/HEFCE,2014/Content/News/2016/HEFCE_Grant_Letter_201617.pdf\">pushed by the government</a>. Measures that we know are crucial, such as the expertise of teachers or the ways students are transformed by knowledge, are not even part of the conversation.</p> <p>The issue is that if the Tef is not based on a systematic view of high-quality teaching, then there is no basis on which to include or exclude potential measures of excellence. As a result, an opportunity to develop the quality of teaching across the sector \u2013 and give students more valid indicators of the quality of different courses \u2013 will be lost to ever-changing ministerial hunches about what good university teaching looks like. </p> <p><em>Paul Ashwin is professor of higher education at Lancaster University and a researcher in the ESRC-HEFCE funded Centre for Global Higher Education.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 October to say that the Tef\u2019s benchmarking is better than league tables, rather than some league tables.<br></p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Well... we were kind of dating the same guy. And it was filmed and put on TV \ud83d\ude02. From that first cocktail party, it was like this instant calibration between souls, as if we had known each other once before. Friendship ripened into something bolder, trust in a very strange situation was formed, and now every adventure we have rivals the other- and continues to make plans for itself. Yesterday I flew this beautiful woman to The Abrolhos islands for her 30th birthday!  I have to admit that I felt so so proud to be with her, my favourite person, celebrating such a momentous occasion on the water- a mutual love of ours. She is so confident in the ocean and in every adventure, as if every new experience is a winning of the lottery somehow; a chance to grow and learn and develop. To Tiffany, experience wins over the worldly acquisition of &amp;#39;things&amp;#39; every time- and I think this is why she is so open-minded, so accepting of others, so fun and so at ease with letting winds blow her towards a variety of opportunities. She&amp;#39;s helped me to disintegrate many of the ideals I&amp;#39;ve had that were harmful (about relationships, about career and &amp;#39;stability&amp;#39;) and for that I feel set free. Thank you for always asking questions (detective Tiff), for being curious about people, ideologies and the universe; for loving people with such a wholesome love that I don&amp;#39;t know if I would ever be able to emulate.

  "<p>Ian Derry was shocked when he got the news. A group of men had ransacked his company\u2019s factory and burned down several buildings. A decade of work, tonnes of produce, tens of millions of dollars invested in equipment \u2013 it was all gone in the span of a few hours.</p> <p>Derry is the director of africaJUICE, a Dutch company whose fruit processing plant in Ethiopia was one of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-unrest-idUSKCN1270MX\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost a dozen</a> factories attacked during the most recent outburst of protests by the Oromo ethnic group. Now foreign agri-businesses like his face a tough choice: stay, despite the risk, or leave and lose their investment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still assessing the damage but the losses are massive,\u201d says Derry. Since its launch in 2009, the company had grown its staff in Ethiopia to around 2,000 people and was bustling year-round with workers picking and processing passion fruit and mango. Now the plant looks like the set of a dystopian film. Rows of brand-new tractors are charred and unusable. The walls are black with soot and the ground is covered in dried-out juice and smashed computers. \u201cNo one could have seen this coming,\u201d says Derry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c196761e2827beb9e356eafa4db26893f16e276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c196761e2827beb9e356eafa4db26893f16e276/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rotting food\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers of africaJUICE, a Dutch owned, Ethiopia-based juice company, tossing fruit that has been damaged by protestors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zacharias Abubeker/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Political analysts beg to differ, saying Oromo dissent has been gaining momentum for decades.

The nation\u2019s economy has experienced an average <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ethiopia/gdp-growth-annual\" rel=\"nofollow\">10% growth</a> over the last decade but Oromos say development has come at their expense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/20/state-of-emergency-likely-ramp-up-repression-fractured-ethiopia\">State of emergency likely to ramp up repression in fractured Ethiopia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As <a href=\"http://www.et.undp.org/content/ethiopia/en/home/countryinfo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the vast majority</a> of Ethiopians work in the agricultural sector, their biggest grievance is the issue of land ownership. Since the mid 80s, Ethiopia\u2019s government has embarked on what it calls a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/22/ethiopia-villagisation-scheme-fails\">\u201cvillagisation\u201d programme</a> to help scattered farming communities access better services. Critics, however, say its main objective is to forcibly relocate Oromo families and sell their land to foreign agri-businesses. According to a study by the Oakland Institute, a US-based thinktank, \u201cvillagisation\u201d has increased food insecurity and disrupted the livelihoods of <a href=\"https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/sites/oaklandinstitute.org/files/miracle-mirage-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tens of thousands</a> (pdf) of Ethiopians.</p> <p>When Oromos demonstrate against it, they are often persecuted and brutalised. According to Human Rights Watch, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/13/ethiopian-forces-kill-100-protesters\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 500</a> protesters have been killed and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/16/such-brutal-crackdown/killings-and-arrests-response-ethiopias-oromo-protests\" rel=\"nofollow\">thousands</a> arrested since last November. \u201cThe recent attacks are not aimed at foreigners,\u201d explains Jawar Mohammed, head of the Oromia Media Network, which has been outlawed under the recent state of emergency measures, \u201cthey are only targeting companies that support the government in stealing land from Oromos\u201d.</p> <p>Yet africaJUICE and vegetable producer FV SeleQt \u2013 the other recently-attacked Dutch firm \u2013 insist their main goal is to help Ethiopia\u2019s development. According to their government, Dutch companies alone provide 70,000 jobs in the country. \u201cWe have a great relationship with the local community,\u201d says Bas Rensen, director of FV SeleQt. His company had only been exporting beans for a couple weeks when their farm was attacked, but was already supporting a local school. AfricaJUICE is a Fairtrade certified business and ran a free health clinic for its workers.</p> <p>Still, both companies have ties to Ethiopia\u2019s regime. The Ethiopian government owns approximately 10% of africaJUICE, while FV SeleQt\u2019s supplying farm, says Rensen, is run by \u201csomeone very close to the government\u201d. Both firms, however, say they were not aware of any land-rights issues where they operate and believe their political connections were not the reason behind the attacks. \u201cIt was purely bad luck,\u201d says Rensen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc5029d926d13475bbf4a74c128cabf424f4ad5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5029d926d13475bbf4a74c128cabf424f4ad5b/0_319_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burnt truck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A burnt out truck belonging to africaJUICE.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zacharias Abubeker/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ethiopia\u2019s government did not respond to multiple requests for comment but Marjolein Busstra, spokeswoman for the Dutch minister of foreign trade and development cooperation, says \u201cEthiopian authorities have assured us that they are giving the highest priority to protecting foreign companies\u201d. Security forces have been deployed to the site of the africaJUICE attack to provide safety during the clean up. </p> <p>Experts, however, warn the unrest is far from over. \u201cThe moment the troops leave, there will be new attacks,\u201d says Mohammed, who believes the best thing foreign companies can do is reach out to local elders and negotiate a deal for protection in exchange for land. </p> <p>Others believe foreign agri-business should leave Ethiopia altogether. \u201cIf they truly want to help the country, foreign companies should leave and show the government that abusing its citizens will not attract foreign investment,\u201d says Anuradha Mittal, executive director of the Oakland Institute. </p> <p>While everyone considers their next move, the Dutch factories remain closed. Cases of fruits and vegetables are left to rot while hundreds of workers get emergency food supplies as they wait without a paycheck. </p> <p>AfricaJUICE is determined to stay and has already begun to sell some fruit in the local market. Meanwhile, FV SeleQt is sourcing more produce from Kenya and Zimbabwe to meet demands and says it\u2019s too soon to make such a difficult choice. \u201cWe are just a business,\u201d says Rensen, \u201cwe can\u2019t change the world\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>It happened in a classroom, on the desks of the village school. It was dark, so the doctor operated on the women by torchlight. The procedure only took two minutes; many women did not even know that they had been permanently sterilised.</p> <p>That Saturday night, in January 2012, 53 women from the village of Kaparfora in the northern Indian state of Bihar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/15/uk-aid-forced-sterilisation-india\">had tubectomies over a period of two hours</a>, under the supervision of a local NGO. The school desks where the operations took place were never disinfected; the doctor never changed his gloves, and the medicines were past their use-by dates, violating a number of government guidelines. After the operations, the doctor left the school, ignoring the wails of the bleeding women in the classroom.</p> <p>Devika Biswas, a health activist from the region, who visited Kaparfora a month after the event on a fact-finding mission, says she was \u201caghast\u201d at the conditions she saw. \u201cI was feeling so bad. I thought, is this my country? Not a single woman was screened to see if there would be any complications.

The fact that the government has given so much of the responsibility for sterilisations to private organisations suggests how valuable a woman\u2019s life is.\u201d</p> <p>Barpanda has further stories of atrocities during the sterilisation drives around the country. \u201cIn Orissa, <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/odisha-doctor-uses-bicycle-pump-for-sterilisation/story-yIFEFxFXMOitR6nxTgr8aL.html\">they used bicycle pumps</a> in the operations because the doctors did not have up-to-date medical equipment,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Himachal Pradesh, one doctor did five surgeries and then <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/drunk-doctor-performs-family-planning-operation-on-five-falls-asleep-while-sixth-on-operating-table/\">passed out drunk halfway through the sixth</a>.

It also asked state governments to introduce quality control commissions to ensure high standards in family planning clinics and camps, but these bodies have not been established.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said the botched sterilisations were \u201ca one-off\u201d and were the exception rather than the rule. </p> <p>The ministry said it had made many attempts to improve standards at state-run sterilisation camps. \u201cThe government of India has formulated several manuals and regular updates for the guidance of the state governments and union territories to address all aspects of conducting sterilisation procedures. The government of India has also issued advisories to all the states and union territories to adhere to the standard operating procedures at all levels to prevent and pre-empt incidents that might adversely affect the health of clients due to sterilisation procedures. These have been extensively disseminated across states.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfac1b80d8ac1ccc3e8a2e4855ecdfc8fa6d8ab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfac1b80d8ac1ccc3e8a2e4855ecdfc8fa6d8ab0/0_0_3500_2452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women who underwent sterilisation surgery queue to receive food inside a hospital in the eastern Indian state of Chhattisgarh, in November 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women who underwent sterilisation surgery queue to receive food inside a hospital in the eastern Indian state of Chhattisgarh, in November 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The spokesperson said that the supreme court\u2019s decision to phase out sterilisation camps was \u201cin alignment with the government of India\u2019s own endeavour in that direction over a period of three years\u201d.</p> <p>Contraceptives were being offered free of charge to any couples wanting them, added the spokesperson, and the government is increasing access to family planning. </p> <p>But Biswas says she doubts the supreme court\u2019s order will make much difference. \u201cThe government is responsible \u2013 they are perpetual violators of the rights of women in this country, but I just don\u2019t think anything will change.\u201d</p> <p>Barpanda is more optimistic. \u201cThey\u2019ve already stopped the camps in Orissa,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was a really big thing for the supreme court to pass.

By an <a href=\"http://www.oddsshark.com/mlb/chicago-cubs-cleveland-indians-betting-october-25-2016-749662\">overwhelming degree</a>, World Series Game 1 winners tend to go to win the whole thing.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s obviously a lot of storylines going on tonight. There\u2019s the Cubs\u2019 108 year championship drought (you might have heard those of us in the media mention it every once and a while.) This has somewhat overshadowed the fact that the Indians haven\u2019t won since the more comparatively recent year of 1948. Considering that the Indians have made the World Series, for the first time since 1997, just months after LeBron James and the Cavaliers won the city\u2019s first NBA title, it feels like there wouldn\u2019t be a better time to break that title-less streak than the present.</p> <p>There\u2019s also slightly less \u201cfun fact\u201d-y subject matter to go, whether it be about Cleveland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/ontario-alcs-blue-jays-indians-chief-wahoo-offensive\">culturally insensitive logo</a> being plastered everywhere or the prominent role Chicago\u2019s closer Aroldis Chapman, mere months removed from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/ontario-alcs-blue-jays-indians-chief-wahoo-offensive\">a MLB-imposed suspension</a> for domestic violence, has played in this postseason. <br></p> <p>Because of all this, it\u2019s easy to forget that this isn\u2019t going to be a referendum on which team is easier to root for or on which franchise has the worst \u201ccurse.\u201d It\u2019s going to come down to, well, baseball. <br></p> <p>That starts with the starters. Indians manager Terry Francona is putting Corey Kluber (18-9, 3.14) on the mound against the Cubs\u2019 Jon Lester (18-9, 3.14), who he used to manage back when they were with the Boston Red Sox. (The Boston GM during that era? None other than current Cubs President of Baseball Operation Theo Epstein.

I could talk about how Cleveland\u2019s Terry Francona is a far superior in-game tactician than Chicago\u2019s Joe Maddon or that the Cubs starters should more than nullify the fact that Andrew Miller is the greatest postseason relief pitcher since Mariano Rivera.

  "<p>On the How to Dad YouTube channel, a shaggy-haired, bearded Kiwi bloke in a cheap branded black T-shirt, tatty blue shorts and bare feet offers \u201cinstructional\u201d videos on how to be a parent \u2013 with the help of his two young daughters.<br></p> <p>How to Hold a Baby \u2013 which delivers on its promise with 17 child-holding options including the baby Jesus and box of beers \u2013 has had 2.6m views. How to Make a Baby Clean the House has 1.6m. His videos now cover every aspect of parenting: from dressing a baby, changing a nappy and putting a baby to sleep, to How to Be a Kiwi Dad (\u201cAlways blow on the pie\u201d).</p> <p>That How to Dad bloke is 28-year-old Aucklander Jordan Watson. Mila, now three and a half, and Alba, one and a half, are his co-presenters. The project began \u2013 as such things often do \u2013 with a dopey idea. A mate at work had a baby on the way, so when his partner went out with their eldest daughter and left him with their four-month-old, Watson \u2013 a one-time landscaper who now works in TV production \u2013 grabbed his camera. He posted How to Hold a Baby online, tagged his friend on Facebook and went to bed. </p> <p>The next morning, he says, the YouTube notifications kept arriving on his phone: 50k, 100k, 150k. So he made a few more videos \u2013 and now there are dozens. The How to Dad Facebook page is heading towards a million fans, a 160-page book is due out this week, and a web video series is being developed. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just a typical Kiwi dad. Kind of taken to the extreme in the DIY style,\u201d says Watson, on a recent Sunday family walk, with the girls asleep in the stroller. \u201cPeople have just connected with it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d7e021a1d48bfc3e1486c149e8d04b4ae8ddfda8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7e021a1d48bfc3e1486c149e8d04b4ae8ddfda8/0_389_4142_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How to Dad presenter Jordan Watson with his daughters, Mila and Alba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How to Dad presenter Jordan Watson with his daughters, Mila and Alba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Watson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can\u2019t plan these viral videos, he says. \u201cI just think if I find it funny and it\u2019s a laugh for parents, it ticks the right boxes.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a fine tradition of the deadpan absurd in the New Zealand comic psyche, from Melbourne-based John Clarke\u2019s 1970s character Fred Dagg, to Flight of the Conchords, to the films of Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople). For Watson, it started with Billy T James. </p> <p>Growing up in Te Kauwhata in the Waikato dairy farming district south of Auckland, Watson\u2019s Maori father \u2013 \u201ca true MacGyver\u201d who refuses to take anything to a professional to get fixed \u2013 had a collection of comic strip books. One series was by James, who is still regarded as one of the country\u2019s greatest comedians 25 years after his death. He was famous for his unschooled but shrewd singlet-and-shorts characters. His father also had copies of the long-running farming comic strip Footrot Flats, which was subsequently made into a movie and musical. </p> <p>But when Watson is making a video he\u2019s not thinking of anyone other than that archetypal, rough-around-the-edges, DIY dad. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in all of us now,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as the camera turns on I must be just doing that classic Kiwi humour.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, sensibly, is staying out of it. \u201cShe\u2019s all for it, but she\u2019s all for not getting in front of the camera as well.\u201d Her absence from the clips, however, could inadvertently be encouraging commenters\u2019 admiration of Watson\u2019s dark good looks: \u201cYou look like if Kit Harrington and James Franco had a baby,\u201d one said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chill out, parents.

They\u2019re made of rubber; they\u2019ll be fine</p> <footer> <cite>Jordan Watson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Watson hoses down these comments, noting that one person thought he looked like \u201ca chubby Ryan Gosling\u201d. \u201cLadies must like the old bush shirt and messy hair,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Although How to Dad reveals the odd honest truth (in the book under Dadvice: \u201cSleep? Parents don\u2019t sleep\u201d), most of it is, of course, of rubbish practical use. As he told a New Zealand television channel, people sometimes privately message him asking for real parenting tips: \u201cIf anyone\u2019s taking this advice seriously, I\u2019m worried for you.\u201d<br></p> <p>Watson agrees it is often a tough job: \u201c90% of it as a parent you\u2019re making it up, and my videos make it look like fun, very carefree. But I\u2019m filming when my kids are in the best mood possible. I\u2019m like every other parent, having sleepless nights or trying to grit my teeth when they\u2019re trying to draw on the walls. But the videos, I remind myself and they\u2019re there to remind all parents, that you\u2019ve got to sometimes step back and have a bit of a giggle.\u201d</p> <p>Too many parents these days want to wrap kids in cotton wool, he says. Listen to How to Dad: \u201cChill out, parents. You don\u2019t have to take it so seriously. They\u2019re made of rubber; they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not rich yet, but Watson is working hard on building How to Dad into a global brand. Companies are coming forward to work with him and he has hired a local agent. He told a New Zealand television channel that a million views might earn him only $100. Product placement could be the way to go. \u201cThe more people that like the page, the more a company like Huggies might say, \u2018Hey mate. Hold up this packet in your next shot and we\u2019ll give you this,\u2019 and I\u2019m away laughing,\u201d he told the presenter with a grin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/thai-junta-google-youtube-remove-royal-insults-lese-majest-\">Thai junta asks Google and YouTube to remove royal 'insults'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Actually, he\u2019s not joking. Watson has posted videos from his sponsored trip to Singapore, and on his How to Dad Tips Facebook page is a video on \u201cdad data\u201d in which he mock-awkwardly reads a piece of paper: \u201cThanks to my mates at Virgin Mobile.\u201d Watson had no grand plans when he posted that first video, so why shouldn\u2019t he cash in a little?</p> <p>Right now, How to Dad is unstoppable. There\u2019s the book, and the web series How to Dad: Legend of the Gumboot (paid for by YouTube and the broadcasting funding agency NZ on Air) is likely to be out by March to coincide with the Gumboot Throwing Competition in Taihape (home of Fred Dagg). There\u2019s also the constantly updated Facebook page, and Watson says he is in talks with a US production company on a TV show idea. He\u2019s even looking to do merchandise for Christmas: How to Dad T-shirts and the like.</p> <p>A blokey empire awaits: \u201cThe world is How to Dad\u2019s oyster at the moment.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/humour-gift/How-to-DAD-Jordan-Watson-9781877505850\">How to Dad</a> by Jordan Watson is out 28 October through Allen &amp; Unwin</em></p>",

In this scenario, senate candidate Patrick Murphy upsets Marco Rubio in Florida and the Democrats end up with a 54-seat senate majority.

  "<p>Last year, on the occasion of Watford\u2019s promotion to the Premier League, Gino Pozzo gave Troy Deeney a watch. Not just any watch either, a Rolex, which the club\u2019s owner presented to the striker in acknowledgement of a great achievement: scoring 20 goals in three consecutive seasons.</p> <p>\u201cSince Troy did not get the trophy for player of the year from the Football League, I hope this compensates,\u201d Pozzo told the club\u2019s end-of-season dinner. \u201cI have been a bit surprised by the lack of recognition for the hard work our guys have done this season. Since we don\u2019t get the recognition from this league, I think we had better stay up.\u201d</p> <p>Pozzo might well find himself muttering the same words today. Watford are under investigation by the English Football League for the alleged use of a falsified document, relating to a letter allegedly supplied when Pozzo assumed full ownership of the club from his father, Giampaolo, in 2014. A guilty verdict would likely result in a fine. There is no indication the Pozzo family were aware of the letter.</p> <p>Such a development is a rare bumpy moment in an otherwise serene journey up the football ladder for Watford since Pozzo&#xa0;Jr took over. Indeed, success has been a hallmark throughout the 51\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s career, during which time he has carved himself a reputation as one of the most forward-thinking but also interventionist owners in football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/watford-premier-league-football-league\">Controversy over alleged fake financial document leaves Watford frustrated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Often described as the brains of the Pozzo clan, and hailed by Udinese\u2019s head of recruitment Andrea Carnevale as \u201cthe best owner in the world\u201d, Gino graduated from Harvard before becoming involved in the Serie&#xa0;A club, the family\u2019s first footballing purchase, in 1993. His time at the Friulani coincided with a decision to implement a meticulous global scouting system that soon became the envy of the world, unearthing players such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Medhi Benatia and Kwadwo&#xa0;Asamoah.</p> <p>It was also the son who persuaded his father to expand the family\u2019s football portfolio with the purchase of Granada in 2009. Then stuck in the third tier of Spanish football and burdened by debt, within three years under the Pozzos the club had made it to La Liga and&#xa0;profitability.</p> <p>The same pattern has been evident during Gino\u2019s time at Watford. His first season in sole charge brought promotion to the Premier League. Last term the club stayed up with ease and enjoyed a run to the FA Cup semi-finals. This year they sit in the top half of the Premier League table and have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a win over Manchester United</a> to their credit.</p> <p>Pozzo is based in England, having relocated from Barcelona with his Catalan wife after his move from Granada. He works out of Watford\u2019s Vicarage Road offices and their training ground that sits next door to Arsenal\u2019s in the Hertfordshire countryside of Colney. This already sets him apart from many owners in the Premier League, but his day-to-day involvement in the club goes far deeper than just the location of his desk and he has been personally involved in decisions that have surprised many in football.</p> <p>When Pozzo arrived at Watford he gave a rare interview in which he boasted that his family, contrary to Italian type, \u201calways create stability around a manager\u201d. In their promotion season, however, Watford went through four managers: Guiseppe Sannino, \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda, Billy McKinlay and Slavisa Jokanovic. Garc\u00eda resigned because of illness but McKinlay was sacked by Pozzo after just eight days and Sannino left less than a month into the season after winning four of the club\u2019s five league games. Rumours of discord in the dressing room abounded but there was a competing story; that Pozzo had struck after studying the training data and finding Watford\u2019s players ran less than anyone at their sister clubs. More recently, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores was removed this summer despite the club enjoying such a successful return to the top flight.</p> <p>Then there are the transfers. Gino Pozzo takes personal charge of overseas player recruitment at Watford and on his arrival made clear that he thought recruitment should not be the preserve of a manager. \u201cIf you are looking at the long term, especially in a smaller club,\u201d he told the Watford Observer, \u201cyou want to retain as much knowledge on how to recruit a player as possible. If you only give that to a manager, then once the manager leaves he leaves with all that knowledge. It is not the club\u2019s knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>That the club, or rather the family, are in possession of a lot of knowledge is well-known and evident by their subsequent activity. In the first year of Pozzo family ownership in 2012-13 Watford brought in 14 loan players, several from the sister clubs, in an act that prompted the Football League to change its rules on loans the following summer. Inter-Pozzo transfers have continued over the years, including Odion Ighalo from Granada and, this summer, Isaac Success, who made a \u00a312.5m transfer from the Spanish side at the same time as the club transferred ownership to a Chinese investment group.</p> <p>There have been other deals which have seen players acquired by Watford and immediately loaned out to the continent, such as Venezuelan prodigy Adalberto Pe\u00f1aranda, currently at Udinese, who has now been on the rosters of five different clubs at the ripe old age of 19.</p> <p>Other business has been even more unusual, one such being the summer 2014 signing of Juanfran. The Spaniard was bought from Real Betis for a hardly earth-shattering \u00a31.7m but was loaned out in the very same window to Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a for two years. This summer, at the end of that deal, the Spanish club bought the defender for just under \u00a33m.</p> <p>Since their arrival in the UK the Pozzo family have managed to steer clear of the spotlight (Gino has given only three interviews to the media in four years). But with this week\u2019s allegations that looks likely to change. Their model of ownership, however, looks very much set for the long term.</p>",
  "<p>Zac Goldsmith has resigned as a Conservative MP over the government\u2019s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow airport, describing it as the \u201cmost polluting, most disruptive, most expensive option\u201d.</p> <p>The Conservatives said they would not run against Goldsmith, who will stand as an independent in the byelection. But he will have to defend his seat against the Liberal Democrats, who will be eager for the chance to regain a foothold in south-west London.</p> <p>In his resignation statement, Goldsmith said he had carried out his threat to cause a byelection because David Cameron had promised seven years ago to scrap the Conservative party\u2019s support for further development of Heathrow with a \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d pledge.</p> <p>Speaking in his Richmond Park constituency, Goldsmith said: \u201cMy party\u2019s promise mattered. It\u2019s why my promise mattered. And it\u2019s why so many people in our community feel so let down.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be clear: this is not the end. The government has chosen the most polluting, most disruptive, most expensive option. But it has also chosen the option with the least chance of being delivered. The sheer complexity, cost and legal difficulties mean it is unlikely ever to happen. It will be a millstone round this government\u2019s neck for years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/qa-airport-expansion-in-london-what-will-happen-next\">Q&amp;A: Heathrow expansion \u2013 what happens next</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goldsmith had a 23,000 majority at the last election and is popular locally. But the seat was held by the Lib Dems before 2010 and their vote only fell back sharply after 2015 as voters deserted the junior partners in the coalition government.</p> <p>Earlier, Goldsmith told the House of Commons that Heathrow was \u201cdoomed\u201d and would be a \u201cmillstone around the neck of the government\u201d. The government hailed its plan to proceed with airport expansion as a sign of strength and decisiveness after years of delays. Theresa May told the cabinet it was a vital decision that had been ducked for too long. But she immediately faced a range of Conservative resistance after she decided to partially suspend cabinet responsibility to allow Boris Johnson and Justine Greening to express opposition to the plan once it was made public.</p> <p>Protests and legal challenges are expected to focus on air quality, noise and Britain\u2019s climate change commitments. The runway, which could be built by 2025, would lead to almost 50% more planes over London, bringing new neighbourhoods under the flightpath.</p> <p>Ministers sought to mitigate some of these criticisms by proposing a six-and-a-half-hour break in scheduled night flights and more stringent night noise restrictions. The scheme will take the form of a draft national policy statement, open to consultation in the new year and subject to a vote in winter 2017-18.</p> <p>Johnson immediately suggested in a television interview that the legal problems facing a third runway could prove insurmountable. \u201cI think the day when the bulldozers actually appear is a long way off, if indeed they ever materialise to build that third runway,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is the whole proceeding will be snarled up in legal objections of one kind or another and I just really repeat my point: do we want the greatest city on Earth, parts of it, to be transformed into a hell of airport noise? I don\u2019t think we do. I think there are far better solutions.
