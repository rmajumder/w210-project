A DCMS spokesman said more projects which had won funding would be announced in due course.</p> <p>As well as the relaxation of licensing laws, Number 10 announced a new government-backed deal with train companies will offer visitors the ability to book five scenic rail itineraries around the UK.</p> <p>May said in a statement that tourism would be an even more vital industry after the UK leaves the EU. \u201cThe British people\u2019s decision to leave the European Union creates real opportunities for growth and we will work in close partnership with the tourism industry, to ensure it continues to thrive as negotiations on the UK\u2019s exit progress,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cWe are making it easier for visitors to travel beyond London and experience all of the world-class attractions the UK has to offer, to make sure the benefits of this thriving industry are felt by the many and not the few.\u201d</p> <p>Karen Bradley, the new secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said the initiative would \u201cfurther strengthen tourism outside of London to ensure that growth from the sector is enjoyed right across the country.\u201d </p> <p>The sharp drop in the pound post-EU referendum has been a bonus for foreign tourists, making holidaying in the UK cheaper. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/tourist-spending-uk-surges-following-pounds-brexit-slump\">Last week it was reported</a> that tax-free spending had increased from visitors from Asia and the US.

  "<p>The government is to launch a tourism action plan including cutting red tape for B&amp;Bs and ready-made train tours as an increasing number of Brits take bank holiday breaks in the UK.</p> <p>Just over 5 million Britons are planning a staycation in the UK over the weekend, 6% more than last year, according to Visit England, the tourism promotion body, after a fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro in the wake of the EU referendum vote.</p> <p>The expected surge comes after a record-breaking first four months of the year for domestic holiday trips in England. From January to April Britons took 11m holiday trips, 8% more than during the same period last year, according to Visit England. They spent \u00a32.8bn, 22% up on last year, more than ever before.</p> <p>That continued a strong year in 2015 for staycations when the number of trips and the amount spent both rose 7% on the previous year.</p> <p>The prime minister, Theresa May, who chose to holiday in the Swiss Alps this month, said: \u201cTourism is vitally important to the UK and the sector goes from strength to strength. Our stunning scenery, centuries-old monuments and cultural traditions continue to draw visitors from both home and abroad.\u201d</p> <p>The government action plan will include internationally promoted rail travel deals, with five easily bookable itineraries that will help tourists get around the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/the-guardian-view-on-traingate-jeremy-corbyns-search-for-standing\">although it\u2019s not clear if they will be assured a seat</a>.</p> <p>There will also be changes to regulations to let B&amp;Bs offer visitors a welcome drink without the need for an alcohol licence, or to pick up guests from a station without applying to become a taxi service.</p> <p>Around \u00a340m of previously announced funds will also be awarded on Friday to a string of projects to help boost tourism in England outside London. Among the projects, money will go towards boosting golf tourism, increasing visitor numbers to Kent\u2019s gardens and gourmet restaurants, the south-west coastal path plus other rural areas.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be1a5f18751959e195231935e04f3bc5ec07a1e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be1a5f18751959e195231935e04f3bc5ec07a1e3/0_362_5480_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The south-west coastal path\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The south-west coastal path is one of the projects to get extra funding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The investment comes after turnover for small and medium-sized hotels, B&amp;Bs, cafes and restaurants in the UK rose 6.4% in the first half of this year, compared with last, with London experiencing the greatest increase in the number of new businesses followed by the south-east and the north-west, according to a Barclays survey.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/19/the-post-brexit-pound-how-sterlings-fall-affects-the-uk-economy\">An 11% drop in the value of the pound against the euro </a>means that a holiday within the eurozone will cost a family of four at least \u00a3245 more now than it would have done before Britain voted to leave the EU.

Official data shows that households are spending less on clothes and food but more on holidays, cars, entertainment and eating out.</p> <p>David McCorquodale, UK head of retail at KPMG, said retailers were now having to battle it out fiercely with holidays and other experiences for a share of people\u2019s spare cash. \u201cUndoubtedly people are spending more and more on experiences rather than stuff to put in the wardrobe. Just look at the rise in music festivals. People like experiences as they make you feel a bit better than you did before, rather than a new jumper,\u201d he said.</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>If there is one global political and economic lesson to be drawn from the Brexit experience and the rise of Sanders and Trump let it be this; we ignore the distributional outcomes of globalisation and unfettered market capitalism at our peril.<br></p> <p>Distributional concerns are the traditional preserve of the political left but the political right should now be just as concerned. As Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said: <em>\u201c</em>just as any revolution eats its children, unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>The rise of rampant income and wealth inequality in the developed world and the lifting of millions of people out of poverty in the developing world over the past 30 years can be seen as two sides of the same globalisation coin. It is an economic phenomenon economist Branko Milanovic has called <em>\u201c</em>the greatest reshuffle of individual incomes since the Industrial Revolution<em>\u201d</em> \u2013 and one with clear social and political consequences<em>.</em></p> <p>To be sure, globalisation has also delivered huge efficiency windfalls in developed economies. But the rapid increase of wealth and income inequality and structural changes brought on by pro-globalisation policies has left large sections of the community behind in Europe and the United States.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/08/global-inequality-may-be-much-worse-than-we-think\">Global inequality may be much worse than we think</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In their despair many have turned to extreme populists. Exhibit A is Donald Trump. </p> <p>Thankfully in Australia we haven\u2019t gone down the American road of a hollowed out middle class and army of working poor. Between 1995 and 2012 real median household incomes in Australia increased by 50%, a phenomenal result when you consider real median household incomes in the US actually went backwards over the same period. </p> <p>But there are concerning trends emerging in the Australian economy. </p> <p>Considerer this: since 2012 real median household incomes in Australia have stagnated. The Australian middle class is being squeezed. Now recent labour data confirms further wage stagnation and the casualisation of the Australian workforce \u2013 so this trend is likely to continue, and women and young people in particular will be worse off. </p> <p>Another example: Australia has long maintained a very high level of intergenerational social mobility. In other words, parents\u2019 income is not a strong indicator of children\u2019s income later in life. However the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/20/fewer-than-half-of-all-australians-could-be-homeowners-by-2017-report-finds\">newly released Hilda report</a> shows that in recent years income mobility has declined. </p> <p>While we are not yet seeing the mass public anger of the US and the UK, it is little wonder that many Australians are disillusioned and frustrated with their economic situation, and little wonder they are demanding that politics delivers change. As we are seeing in other developed countries around the world, if this disillusion and frustration is allowed to fester it will result in greater political instability and structurally constrain economic growth at a time when the global economy is already weak. </p> <p>The Chifley Research Centre report, Inequality: the facts and the future<em>,</em> which was <a href=\"http://www.chifley.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chifley_ResearchDocument_19.08.16-FINALV2a-min.pdf\">released this week</a> takes these challenges head on. </p> <p>The report advocates unambiguously for a wealth creation agenda based on a strong middle class.</p> <p>This is not some wishy-washy third way Davos fudge in which we are told the only response to inequality and globalisation is world class education and training. </p> <p>Instead the central premise of the report is that sustainable economic growth can\u2019t be built on a shrinking share of GDP going to working people.</p> <p>We need to enact policies that bring strong employment growth that brings discouraged workers into the labour force, lifts unemployed people into employment and raises relative wages for the lowset paid.</p> <p>The report rejects the fatalism inherent in conservative arguments that nothing can be done about growing inequality of wealth and income other than shrinking the role of government and giving tax cuts to corporate and wealthy individuals \u2013 a concept described as trickle-down economics and unfortunately synonymous with globalisation. </p> <p>The report recognises, as do the IMF and World Bank, that an economic plan based on claiming efficiency gains from globalisation while ignoring the adverse distributional impacts on large sections of the population is a recipe for weaker growth and greater political instability. </p> <p>So how can growth be accelerated in an inclusive way? </p> <p>Firstly, as the IMF recommends, Australia needs to increase quality investment in both physical and human capital to lift productivity and living standards. Our failure to invest in physical infrastructure and quality education is leaving a huge infrastructure deficit for our kids.</p> <p>As the IMF has concluded, debt funding physical infrastructure at prevailing low interest rates can lead to faster deficit reduction through higher growth, rather than indiscriminate spending cuts across the budget. Investing in infrastructure and long-term investment in education is precisely the assertive fiscal policy, rather than monetary policy, that is required to lift demand and productivity.</p> <p>We will rue the day we did not use this period of ultra-low interest rates to invest in infrastructure and put our people to work. Future generations will think us mad, and they will be right. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">Housing affordability, inequality, and our flatlining household incomes | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Secondly, there must be a fundamental commitment to a decent minimum wage and a fair sharing of productivity improvements between wages and profits backed by a strong and progressive tax system and targeted transfer payments. These policies deliver real income growth to low and middle income households. Put simply the demand that flows from low and middle income households is a source of growth not a consequence of it. </p> <p>Over the last 40 years the Labor vision of inclusive reform \u2013 market opening reforms, sensible fiscal and monetary policy in concert with a fair industrial relations system and a strong progressive tax and transfer system has been the dominant pathway forward. </p> <p>The 2014 budget tried to smash this model through the camouflage of a budget and economic emergency. The Turnbull government remains committed to its trickle-down economic policies; massive tax cuts for wealthy and powerful corporates and huge cuts to the social safety net. There is no question that Australia needs budget repair in the medium term but that can be achieved in an inclusive way.</p> <p>Put simply, we must grow together, not apart if the perils of rampant wealth and income inequality are to be avoided.</p>",

Robinson ignored the script, not because his club is owned by one of the richest men in Britain, Steve Lansdown, but because he expects his players to show the bloody-mindedness and grit he was renowned for during his career with Bath, and to aim higher.</p> <p>The season starts next month and few of Bristol\u2019s signings so far would amount to a tent signing, never mind a marquee, with the No8 Jordan Crane, a summer recruit from Leicester, namechecked by Robinson. \u201cHe knows all about a winning culture,\u201d said Robinson, whose side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/25/bristol-doncaster-championship-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">clambered back into the Premiership at the seventh attempt</a> after years of play-off final heartache.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not about surviving this season but looking up the table.

The company\u2019s technology is similar to a widely used and <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/a-pumped-hydro-energystorage-renaissance\">cheaper energy storage </a>setup that pumps water from a dam to an upstream reservoir when electricity prices are low. During peak times when electricity is more expensive, the water is drained back down to run through a turbine to generate power.<br></p> <p>Instead of an above-ground reservoir, Quidnet stores water underground. The company launched a pilot project this past year in Erath County, Texas, to demonstrate the concept. Mandell and his co-founder Howard Schmidt, an engineer with oil company Saudi Aramco, used an abandoned natural gas well, which runs 2,800 feet deep, into a reservoir that could hold 50k gallons of water. The project showed that after pumping water into the well for 12 hours, their technology could generate six hours of electricity.</p> <p>Quidnet\u2019s idea is so unusual that it still needs to overcome some technical challenges to make it feasible for a well-run, large scale energy storage operation. \u201cIn theory, this idea can be helpful,\u201d said Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its atmosphere and energy program. \u201cThe technology should work so long as the reservoir does not leak and so long as the outflow can be controlled and is fast enough.\u201d</p> <p>Choosing well-sealed underground reservoirs to prevent the pressurized water from leaking is one of Quidnet\u2019s biggest concerns. Mandell said the pilot project recorded far lower water losses than anticipated: 1% of the water per week instead of per day.</p> <p>\u201cWe were impressed with the team and \u2018pumped hydro\u2019 concept using geologic reservoirs,\u201d said Goldman.</p> <p>Next, Quidnet plans to run another pilot project, this time at an old geothermal well in northern Nevada. The well is 14 inches in diameter, larger than a typical oil and gas well, making it possible to inject a higher volume of water \u2013 and generating more power faster \u2013 at any time. The reservoir can hold up to 85k barrels of water, and produce 10 hours of electricity following a 14-hour charge.</p> <p>The new pilot project will store electricity from a <a href=\"http://energy.gov/lpo/blue-mountain\">geothermal power plant in Nevada</a> run by AltaRock Energy, where Mandell is also CEO. The power plant sells electricity to NV Energy, the largest utility in Nevada.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/27/tesla-powerwall-batteries-flow-lithium-energy-storage-revolution\">From Tesla's Powerwall to flow batteries: five facts about the energy storage revolution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevada is a good place to be for energy storage service companies. Nevada, along with other Western states like Oregon and Idaho, recently joined the<a href=\"http://www.caiso.com/Pages/default.aspx\"> California Independent System Operator (Caiso),</a> which manages the wholesale electricity market in the state. As part of the deal, the member states will receive excess solar energy from California, which they can store and use to provide round-the-clock clean electricity, said Mandell.<br></p> <p>Ultimately, Quidnet hopes to build its own wells in locations with a high demand for energy storage. Each of its projects will operate up to 20 wells, with each well measuring between 1000-5000 feet deep and capable of storing 35 megawatt hours of energy. The company is also working on software to automating a storage project\u2019s operation so that a project owner can run it remotely.</p> <p>An energy storage project could be <a href=\"https://gigaom.com/2012/01/04/how-to-compare-energy-storage-projects/\">measured in watts or watt-hours</a>, depending on what information a project owner wants to convey. The term \u201cwatts\u201d (a megawatt is a million watts) denotes how fast power can be charged or discharged at any time. A watt-hour refers to the amount of energy that can be stored or released in a given hour. </p> <p>The cost of building each well varies by depth, said Mandell, and Quidnet aims to build a project at $50 per kilowatt-hour of energy, a cost that will include the well, turbine generator, planning and securing permits. What\u2019s not included is the cost of drilling exploratory wells to identify the proper underground geology for storing water.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, the oil, gas and geothermal industries have already done this exploration work for us \u2013 there are hundreds of thousands of wells drilled all over the country that we\u2019ll use to tell us exactly where to install storage,\u201d he said.</p>",

Since the 2008 crash, what central bankers say and do has moved from the City pages to the front page. That is logical, given that the Bank of England created \u00a3375bn of new money through quantitative easing in the four years after 2009 and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15198789\" title=\"\">has just begun buying \u00a370bn of IOUs</a> from the government and big business. But the power and prominence of central banks today is also deeply worrying. For one, their multibillion-pound interventions have had only limited success \u2013 and it is doubtful that throwing more billions around will work much better. For another, politicians are compelling them to play a central role in our politics, even though they are far less accountable to voters. This is politics in the garb of technocracy.</p> <p>Next month is the eighth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Since then the US central bank has bought $3.7tn (\u00a32.8tn) of bonds. All the major central banks have cut rates; <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/828.aspx\" title=\"\">according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist</a>, Andy Haldane, global interest rates are at their lowest in 5,000 years. Despite this, the world economy is, in his description, \u201cstuck\u201d. This government boasts of the UK\u2019s recovery, but workers have seen a 10% drop in real wages since the end of 2007 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\" title=\"\">matched among developed economies only by Greece</a>.

In April, the IMF described the state of the global economy as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/\" title=\"\">Too Slow for Too Long</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Having thrown everything they had at the world economy, all central bankers have to show is the most mediocre of score sheets. When it comes to monetary policy, the old cliche almost fits: you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it avail itself of super-low interest rates to kickstart a sustainable recovery. Two forces appear to be at work. First, monetary policy has been used by politicians as a replacement for fiscal policy on spending and taxes, when it should really be complementary. Second, major economies \u2013 such as Britain after Thatcher\u2019s revolution \u2013 have become so unequal and lopsided that vast wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few who use it for speculation rather than productive investment. QE has pushed up the&#xa0;price of Mayfair flats and art by&#xa0;Damien Hirst. It has done next to nothing for graphene in Manchester.</p> <p>All this was foreseen by Keynes in his General Theory: \u201cI am now somewhat sceptical of the success of a merely monetary policy directed towards influencing the rate of interest. I expect to see the State, which is in a position to calculate the marginal efficiency of capital-goods on long views and on the basis of the general social advantage, taking an ever greater responsibility for directly organising investment.\u201d</p> <p>Eighty years on, it is time those words were heeded by policymakers. In Britain, that means using state-owned banks such as RBS and Lloyds to direct loans to those industries and parts of the country that elected and accountable politicians see as being in need. Couple that with a tax system that rewards companies on how much value they add to the British economy, and the UK might finally&#xa0;be back in&#xa0;business.</p>",
  "<p>It is hard to anticipate whether Turkey\u2019s unprecedented military incursion into Syria this week will change the dynamics of the multiple wars that have ravaged the region and put civilians through hell. If things already seemed complicated in the Middle East, they may have just become even more so. What started on Wednesday ranks as the largest Turkish military operation inside Syrian territory since the civil war began five years ago. A dozen tanks, reportedly followed by a bus transporting Syrian rebels, rolled into northern Syria to drive Islamic State forces from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/turkey-and-us-unite-to-oust-isis-curb-kurds-syria\" title=\"\">the town of Jarablus</a>, one of their last footholds on the Turkish-Syrian border. Today Turkey sent more tanks in and told the YPG Kurdish armed group it had one week to retreat from the border areas.</p> <p>Western anti-Isis coalition forces facilitated Operation Euphrates Shield with air strikes. It came days after a terrorist attack killed 54 people at a Kurdish wedding in Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border \u2013 highlighting both how exposed Turkey has become to the insurgency and the multiple pressures the Kurds face.</p> <p>Although Turkey carried out this operation with US back-up, its priority \u2013 evident in other recent foreign manoeuvrings, such as detente with Russia and overtures to the Syrian president, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-syria-idUSTRE7AL0WJ20111122\" title=\"\">having previously urged him to quit</a> \u2013 is to curtail the territorial ambitions of Kurdish combatants, some of which happen to be US proxies in the war against Isis. Turkey is in effect deploying forces in Syria with US support, with the aim of pushing back Kurdish groups that the US also supports. The US has equipped and trained local forces to fight Isis, under the label \u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\u201d. They are dominated by Kurds, but include anti-Assad rebels. Nuances easily get lost: united against Isis, these groups are less so when it comes to confronting Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces. Little noticed in Aleppo\u2019s plight is the fact that Syrian Kurdish fighters have played no small role in the siege of the city. The YPG has been more of a problem for the Syrian opposition than for the Assad regime.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s advance now puts these Kurdish groups under pressure, especially given its warming relations with Russia. Moscow may have qualms about Kurdish groups working tightly with the US and its protest against Turkey\u2019s move into Syria may have less to do with protecting the Kurds than keeping the upper hand in Syria\u2019s quagmire. As the Jarablus operation unfolded, US vice-president Joe Biden was in Ankara to attempt to woo Turkey back from Russia. Relations between the US and its Nato ally have been fraught since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-ankara-istanbul\" title=\"\">July\u2019s coup attempt</a>, but getting them back on track now seems a shared objective. So, having used Kurdish forces to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/isis-kidnaps-human-shields-manbij-syria\" title=\"\">take Manbij</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/us-military-photos-syria-soldiers-fighting-isis\" title=\"\">stalk Raqqa</a>, Mr Biden warned the YPG to move back across the Euphrates or lose US support.</p> <p>Syria is racked by multiple wars in which protagonists claiming to share common goals pursue their own distinct priorities. Turkey is part of the anti-IS coalition but wants to fight Kurdish militants in Syria as it does the PKK in its own south-eastern regions. Its role has shrunk from active intervention on multiple fronts to more narrowly defending its border. Even the renewed enthusiasm for Syrian rebels is not about toppling Mr Assad, but ensuring that the Kurds do not prop him up. Russia claims its military involvement is all about combatting Isis but has done much more to ensure the survival of the Assad regime. Syrian Kurdish groups have been \u201crecruited\u201d by the US against Isis, but their ultimate goal is to carve out an autonomous region. Anti-Assad revolutionaries have all along wanted to get rid of a dictatorship but are increasingly associated with radical Islamist groups, largely for a desperate lack of other options. The US has prioritised bombing Isis but at the expense of forging a solution to Syria\u2019s civil war, which has helped Isis grow. With its tanks, Turkey has played one more card in a multi-pronged war that has created immense suffering and has no end in sight.</p>",

It\u2019s sweltering again in south London but the rain we were warned about has, thankfully, not materialised. I\u2019m in a good mood because I\u2019ve just been to the dry cleaner\u2019s to drop a suit off for a wedding I\u2019m going to next week, and the man in there was just lovely. Service with a smile - it really is the little things in life that count.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019ve got to the ground and two curious things are going on in front of me. Firstly, Mark Footitt is warming up his fielding and throwing with his right arm. Huh? I\u2019d never noticed this before. I know Samit sometimes does this, and George Bailey is ambidextrous, but Footitt didn\u2019t strike me as the sort.</p> <p>The second thing is that Lancashire are warming up by playing a sort of walking-football thing. Now this is curious because I happen to know that <a href=\"http://www.alloutcricket.com/features/warm-up-games-with-gilo\">Ashley Giles, the King of Spain, has gone on record saying he doesn\u2019t like football as a warm-up</a>. Too many injuries. Ask Fidel Edwards. Anyway, the game has now ended, because Glen Chapple had a wild shot and it went into the OCS Stand. Clever.</p> <p>Anyway, we will have two Currans, Scurran and CurranT, batting when we start as Surrey look to <strong><em>turn the metaphorical screw</em></strong>. Elsewhere Yorkshire are looking to <strong><em>metaphorically hammer home their advantage</em></strong>, at Scarborough, although I understand there is <strong><em>a bit of weather about</em></strong>. Warwickshire are <strong><em>in the metaphorical driving seat</em></strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCDxmApyFyQ\">at the Riverside</a>, and Somerset are <strong><em>metaphorically fighting back</em></strong> against Hampshire. Imagine if they were literally fighting.</p> <p>In Div Two, Sussex had a bit of a stinking day in Cardiff, so it\u2019s about honours even, Kent are bossing Gloucestershire, and Northants are in charge on a road at, well, New Road. In the humdinger at the top, Essex overcame a rocky start to their first innings and are well-placed against Leicestershire.</p> <p>I will try and get some highlights of all that for your pleasure. I will also be doing rain dances, because there\u2019s a bit of the stuff about today. Anyway, as ever, lots of comments please, and play nicely. Most importantly: enjoy the cricket.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57beb3e7e4b048662988fefe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T09:04:35.884Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Morning all, </p> <p>Will is back at the Oval today.

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%.</p> <p><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf1645e4b0486629890140\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T16:02:23.821Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, adds his voice to those expecting a US rate rise in December:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Esther George of the Kansas Fed gave markets something to chew over, with yet another hawkish comment coming in a long line of Fed members keen to talk about higher rates. After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884/0_225_1704_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finn Dempsey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bef773e4b0568600c0434b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:33:27.015Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/uk-retail-sales-brexit-slow-puncture-not-car-crash\">UK retail sales show Brexit effect will be more slow puncture than car crash | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57befc81e4b0fe30498a4aff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:16:08.579Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US rates could rise shortly - Fed board member</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent.</p> <p>Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening.</p> <p>He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/768812018560303104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed&#39;s Kaplan on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC\">@CNBC</a> I&#39;m focused on fundamental drivers;

  "<p>How is it possible to explain why Ben Affleck, star of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, is sitting pretty in sixth place on Forbes\u2019 2016 list of the highest-paid male stars in Hollywood with a whopping $43m in fees, while Harrison Ford, who headlined Star Wars: The Force Awakens, languishes down in 20th position with just $15m in earnings over the past year? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/dwayne-johnson-top-earning-actor-hollywood-pay-gap-forbes\">Dwayne Johnson named world's top earning actor as Hollywood pay gap laid bare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ageism? Dramatically varied negotiating strategies? Old-fashioned notions of star power? All are possibilities, but none makes any real sense.</p> <p><a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/wb-batman-v-superman-faces-high-expectations-1201729887/\">According to Variety</a>, muddled superhero epic Dawn of Justice barely broke even at the global box office, despite pulling in $872m worldwide (the trade bible predicted it would need to make $800m, though that\u2019s not including funds from merchandise, TV screenings and so forth). Suicide Squad looks highly unlikely to surpass its DC expanded universe stablemate, and in any case Batfleck\u2019s part in the disappointing supervillain smackdown was a glorified cameo.</p> <p>The Force Awakens, meanwhile, is the third highest-grossing film of all time, with a planet-smashing $2.066bn in global receipts. So what exactly happened here?</p> <p>The answer perhaps lies in another bizarre anomaly: the paucity of Disney-based actors in the Top 20, despite two of last year\u2019s top five grossing films hailing from the studio\u2019s Lucasfilm and Marvel subsidiaries. There are only two Marvel actors in the Top 10, and that\u2019s if one counts seventh-placed Vin Diesel\u2019s monosyllabic performance in Guardians of the Galaxy. Robert Downey Jr, last year\u2019s Forbes No 1, is the other \u2013 now in joint eighth place with a mere $33m in earnings. Ford is the only Star Wars actor to make the top 20, and we\u2019ve already noted that he barely makes the cut.</p> <p>Is this a sign of Disney\u2019s plummeting status in Hollywood? Can the famous old studio no longer keep up with rivals Universal (Dwayne Johnson and Diesel\u2019s employers on Fast &amp; Furious 7) and 20th century Fox (third-placed Matt Damon\u2019s employers on The Martian) when it comes to paying its stars? </p> <p>In fact the exact opposite is likely to be true. The mouse house is simply benefiting from a focus on the cinematic universe model that has brought such success to Marvel, and now looks to be doing the same for Star Wars. And by doing so, it is slowly dismantling all that\u2019s left of the Hollywood star system in 2016.</p> <p>The key difference with these Hollywood megabrands is that audiences like to follow an overarching saga, rather than their key players. Would The Force Awakens have been any more successful had it starred Johnson, Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp \u2013 all members of the Forbes Top five? No, it would not.</p> <p>Would Avengers: Age of Ultron have scored even higher than its gargantuan $1.5bn box office return with 10th-placed Brad Pitt as the Hulk and Damon as Thor? The answer, once again must be in the negative. And Disney doesn\u2019t need them, because it is operating by different rules to its competitors, at least as far as its Marvel and Star Wars properties are concerned. </p> <p>Where rival studios have set out to secure star names in order to launch franchises or keep them afloat (Diesel and Johnson picked up huge paydays for Fast &amp; Furious, and Affleck was recruited to give the DC universe star power), Marvel has tended to focus on long-term, multiple-film contracts for its stars, most of whom are relative unknowns before they sign on and therefore have less bargaining power.</p> <p>Even Downey Jr, who topped last year\u2019s list with $80m, after negotiating a back-end deal for the Avengers films, was far from being an A-lister prior to winning the role of Tony Stark in 2008\u2019s Iron Man. And though it would now be hard to remove the Oscar nominee from the Marvel setup without damaging the brand, the studio\u2019s track record and ability to throw new superheroes into the mix on an annual basis suggests it would cope. </p> <p>Of course, Disney is a big company, and different rules seem to apply to some of its other franchises. Depp, fifth-placed on the Forbes list with $48m in earnings, is still flying high thanks to paydays from the upcoming fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie and fantasy sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/22/johnny-depp-named-hollywoods-most-overpaid-actor-by-forbes\">given he was also Forbes\u2019 most overpaid actor of 2015</a>, it remains to be seen whether these kinds of highly paid roles will be available to him in future.</p> <p>For Star Wars \u2013 Disney bought Lucasfilm from creator George Lucas for $4.05bn \u2013 the studio seems to be following the Marvel model. British duo John Boyega and Daisy Ridley <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/harrison-ford-star-wars-pay-force-awakens-cast-1201666236/\">were paid relative space peanuts for their leading turns</a> in The Force Awakens. And it\u2019s notable that returning icons Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are also absent from Forbes\u2019 recent lists.</p> <p>Ford is in some ways the exception that proves the rule. He was far less keen on returning as Han Solo than his fellow cast members from the original trilogy, and <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/harrison-ford-star-wars-pay-force-awakens-cast-1201666236/\">there were reports the studio had to pay as much as $25m</a> to convince him to take the controls of the Millennium Falcon again. Forbes suggests the true figure was considerably lower, given the 74-year-old apparently only earned $15m in total over the past 12 months. But doesn\u2019t that fee look like a bargain when you consider the paydays handed to some of Ford\u2019s fellow actors? Could any other studio have pulled it off?</p> <p>Affleck\u2019s earnings, in particular, keep nagging at me. Yes, he\u2019s a double Oscar-winner, but as screenwriter and producer, not as an actor. And ever since the Argo director was cast as Batman, there has been a sense that this was somehow too obvious, too cheesy a choice, that Affleck was the kind of A-list name studios would have shoehorned into a superhero suit in the 1980s or 90s, when Hollywood believed you only had to unite the right star with the right project to magic up billions at the box office. A Sly Stallone in Judge Dredd or Alec Baldwin in The Shadow, to put it another way.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Affleck\u2019s huge payouts over the past year hint that this relatively old-fashioned approach to film-making remains a big part of the Hollywood template.

  "<p>Drivers for Uber\u2019s food delivery service are planning a protest in the latest sign of discontent within the gig economy.</p> <p>UberEats riders will demonstrate outside the group\u2019s London headquarters on Friday after the company cut the amount it pays per delivery, which some drivers say leaves them at risk of earning less than the minimum wage. They are calling on the company to pay the independently backed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation\">London living wage</a> of \u00a39.40 an hour.</p> <p>The action comes after more than 100 moped riders and cyclists <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">took to the streets</a> to protest against pay changes at rival food courier service Deliveroo, eventually <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">seeing off an attempt</a> to force them to accept new pay terms.</p> <p>UberEats drivers, who earned as much as \u00a320 an hour during peak meal times when the service launched in June, told the Guardian they are now earning less than \u00a310, even at peak times. Off peak, drivers earn \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus a mileage payment between the restaurant where food is picked up and the drop location, minus a 25% fee taken by UberEats. </p> <p>The changeable rates mean that some are at risk of earning less than the minimum wage over the course of a week, according to pay records passed to the Guardian.</p> <p>All drivers are self-employed, which means that they do not receive holiday or sick pay, or any hourly wage while they wait around for orders.</p> <p>Imran Siddiqui, a scooter courier at UberEats, said: \u201cAlthough they speak of \u2018flexibility\u2019 the bosses at UberEats have been cutting pay since day one. We\u2019re telling them we need the London living wage. I\u2019d like to ask them: where is the freedom in poverty wages? \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get by, but it\u2019s been a race to the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Mags Dewhurst, the chair of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain couriers and logistics branch, which has been working with the delivery drivers, said: \u201cUber is becoming less and less rewarding to work for. It is reducing its rates during peak times as a response to piece rates.</p> <p>\u201cBy paying a piece rate, they are saying they only want to pay for work when they can make a profit out of it. They are saying work is only when someone is making a delivery, but people are providing a service to the company when they are standing around waiting for orders. Without that, UberEats wouldn\u2019t be able to function.\u201d</p> <p>On average, couriers take home more than the London living wage at meal times, UberEats said.</p> <p>Alex Czarnecki, the general manager of UberEats in London, said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to being the best option for couriers in London. Unlike other companies, we don\u2019t set shifts, minimum hours or delivery zones. Couriers can simply log in or out when and where they choose.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we\u2019ve seen hundreds of new couriers sign up in the last week alone. As UberEats grows, couriers are busier than ever. In fact, so far this week, couriers delivering lunch and dinner have made over 10% more an hour than they did in the same period last week. Our office is open and our team is always available to chat to couriers.\u201d<br></p> <p>At peak times, drivers now earn \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus a \u00a34 \u201cpromotion\u201d amount per job between 11.30am and 2.30pm, or a \u00a33 promotion between 6.30pm and 9.30pm, as well as the mileage payment. UberEats then takes a 25% cut.</p> <p>Drivers are upset as UberEats has been gradually cutting the promotion part of the fee as it takes on more people and becomes busier. UberEats said a driver would earn about \u00a37.60 for a peak time delivery if they travelled 1.5 miles.</p> <p>UberEats began recruiting delivery drivers this summer in an attempt to take on Deliveroo and grab a slice of the UK\u2019s takeaway food market.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based company, which began as a taxi-hailing app, initially offered a \u00a3100 signing-on fee to delivery partners, its term for bicycle and scooter drivers, to tempt them away from rivals.</p> <p>An ad campaign called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/uber-tells-story-drivers-riders-first-major-uk-ad-campaign/1397411#\">get there with Uber</a> sought to woo customers and drivers by suggesting that income from working for the company could help them start their own business.</p> <p>Uber\u2019s phenomenal growth has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/26/uber-expansion-meets-global-revolt-and-crackdown\">met with opposition</a> from traditional taxi services, leading to major protests and bans in some European cities.</p> <p>The company is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\">facing a legal challenge</a> from its drivers, who say they should be recognised officially as Uber workers, rather than counted as self-employed.</p>",

But due to government bounties and predator control policies designed to help ranchers, the last original Yellowstone wolf was killed in 1926. Then, over vociferous objections of ranchers, wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1995.</p> <p> \u201cToday there are an estimated 1700 wolves in the Northern Rockies,\u201d Dave said. \u201cThey are a keystone species.\u201d</p> <p> A keystone species is one that directly impacts the balance of the ecosystem. In Yellowstone, the extermination of wolves caused the elk population to explode. With no wolves to disperse them, elk chewed down the aspen saplings and willows along streams, which depleted the food source for the beavers, reducing their numbers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today, what visitors to Yellowstone most want to see \u2013 more than elk or buffalo or even geysers \u2013 is a wolf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fewer beavers caused a drop in beaver dams, which reduced the amount of cool, shaded water, which reduced the fish populations. Fewer willows caused a drop in migrating neotropical songbirds.</p> <p> \u201cEverything is connected,\u201d said Dave, poking the fire with a stick.</p> <p> Today, what visitors to Yellowstone most want to see \u2013 more than elk or buffalo or even geysers \u2013 is a wolf.</p> <p> That night, after days of hard hiking, I slept like a dead man. I awoke to a deep-throated howl. The roar was so close and so loud I thought Gaillard was having me on. I crawled from my tent to find him pumping the camp stove, his furred red face grinning ear to ear.</p> <p> \u201cQuite a wake-up call isn\u2019t it!\u201d he said. \u201cNot 50 yards away. Biggest wolf I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201d</p> <p> Envious, I scanned the valley. It was twilight, the stars still vanishing into a lavender sky, straight dead pines white with frost.</p> <p> I didn\u2019t see a wolf. I saw wild, open, primeval country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf73e11ca2ae44073f634f356fb2bba5d53875b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf73e11ca2ae44073f634f356fb2bba5d53875b4/0_30_1919_1151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> After that first howl, we assumed a portent silence. Wolves have an acute sense of hearing. I knew they were watching us right now, through the gloaming, but we couldn\u2019t see them. Like dogs and cats, wolves have a thin, reflective film inside their retinas, called the tapetum lucidum, which gives them night vision.</p> <p> Dave headed off to break a hole in the ice and fill our pot while I lowered the food bag out of the tree. A short time later we were standing over the dead coals of last night\u2019s fire, stomping our frozen boots, digging into our bowls of hot granola and watching the sunlight gild the surrounding summits.</p> <p> Then the gorgeous howl came back. This time it was much farther away and echoed across the still-shaded valley. Another howl answered it from the stony mountainside to the northwest, then another from the dark line of forest to the southeast.</p> <p> The wolves had triangulated us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black as night, the wolves looked right at me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> \u201cThis is the Delta pack,\u201d said Dave, \u201ccould be as many as a dozen.\u201d</p> <p> We were standing in the most remote place in the lower 48, two small, pink creatures inside a prodigious sanctuary. The wolves commenced to sing. Perhaps three or four in a group, a call and refrain. Dave threw his arms back like a preacher.</p> <p> \u201cNow this is Yellowstone!\u201d</p> <p> They howled together in thundering choruses, bringing music to the morning. Individual voices could be distinguished, just like in a choir. Numerous basses, two baritones, even a tenor trying out her young pipes. They ululated for perhaps five minutes, then abruptly stopped.</p> <p> I began glassing along a bank of trees to the south from whence the closest howling had come, stopping for some reason on a stand of spruce. I was studying the conifers when two huge wolves stepped out into the open. Black as night, they looked right at me, then loped off through the trees.</p> <p> I had so desperately wanted to get away, to escape \u2013 and I\u2019d done it. But now everything was inverted. Being there in the moment in the mountains with the wolves, I realized we actually hadn\u2019t gotten away from it all, we gotten right into the middle of it. The office and the asphalt are what felt strange now. We had hiked ourselves back in time into an environment that was once common and now barely exists, a place I had imagined to be silent and austere but was in truth songful and profoundly complex. </p> <p> And is this not the very point of a national park? To reveal a world in which humans are just another species in a beautifully intricate ecosystem. </p>",
  "<p>With a population of<a href=\"http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/mythbusters/3million-people-60million-sheep.aspx\"> 4.6 million</a> people and <a href=\"http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/mythbusters/3million-people-60million-sheep.aspx\">29.5 million</a> sheep, New Zealand has roughly six sheep for every person. And now, the wooly beasts are helping drive a new movement: farm-to-foot.</p> <p>Typically, most of our footwear is made from either natural materials (such as leather or canvas), or <a href=\"http://questions.sci-toys.com/node/65\">synthetic, petroleum-based materials</a> (such as rubber, plastic or cloth). Few manufacturers opt for wool, though. Yet, unlike other natural materials, wool <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12425658\">can absorb moisture</a>, is breathable and offers a sustainable alternative to rubber, making it perfect for use in footwear.</p> <p>Apparel companies are already taking note. Swiss brand <a href=\"http://www.baabuk.com/\">Baabuk</a> now sells wool sneakers; following a recent successful Kickstarter campaign for $170,000, the brand will launch its first US e-commerce site later this year. London-based <a href=\"https://mahabis.com/\">Mahabis</a>, which sells to American customers online, makes a wool slipper that transforms into an outdoor shoe with a detachable rubber heel. Head of content and partnerships at Mahabis, Alice Apsey, said the clever design has brought the company \u00a310m ($13.1m) in revenue in two years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/25/hemp-farming-legalization-bill-marijuana-industry-california\">Hemp is eco-friendly. So why won't the government let farmers grow it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most iconic wool footwear brand to date is Ugg, a US company with Australian roots, whose boots feature an exterior layer of sheepskin and a woolen interior. The boots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/30/ugg-the-look-that-refused-to-die\">became popular in Australia in 1970s</a>, particularly with surfers, who loved the fact that they could warm their feet instantly after coming out of the ocean. Back in those days, you could buy a pair of boots at a petrol station for $12. Now, Ugg has become a luxury brand. The boots sell for around $160 all over the US.</p> <p>Capitalizing on consumers\u2019 newfound love of wool footwear, two companies are now taking things a step further, working directly with sheep farmers in New Zealand to source high quality wool for a range of shoes \u2013 for both winter and summer.</p> <p>San Francisco-based <a href=\"https://www.allbirds.com/\">Allbirds</a> is redesigning the sneaker: a fine merino wool upper and base made from castor bean oil, a natural substitute for plastic and rubber. The shoe is washable and unbranded. Established by former New Zealand soccer player Tim Brown and renewable materials expert Joey Zwillinger, the company wants to create a classic shoe that\u2019s sustainable as well as stylish and durable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40ddfe29d50c7d91521455af07b13282a594af45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ddfe29d50c7d91521455af07b13282a594af45/147_0_1333_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allbirds co-founders: Tim Brown (left), a former New Zealand soccer player, and renewable materials expert Joey Zwillinger (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allbirds co-founders: Tim Brown (left), a former New Zealand soccer player, and renewable materials expert Joey Zwillinger (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allbirds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having seen his fair share of branded sneakers as a professional athlete, Brown wanted to eliminate the logos, produce a minimalistic design but still have a high-performance shoe. As a New Zealander, wool seemed like an ideal option given the surplus of material around him. So he applied for a grant from the New Zealand wool industry to determine what kind of wool would be best for a sneaker.</p> <p>The first prototype was made with \u201cmid-micron\u201d wool, which is thicker and harder to work with. Brown then transitioned to a super-fine merino fabric with a 12.5 micron diameter, much thinner and lighter than the mid-micron \u2013 the kind that is predominantly used in making fine wool suits. \u201cFrom prototype to current version, we ran countless tests to get the quality to where we balanced strength, softness and all of the other great qualities you get with merino, such as temperature regulation and wicking,\u201d says Zwillinger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/07/clothes-recycling-second-hand-waste-landfill-textile\">Would you buy patched up clothes to tackle textile waste?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wool acts as an insulator, making the shoe warm in winter and breathable in the summer. Plus, it controls odor naturally \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.woolrevolution.com/virtues.html\">wool fibers neutralize body odors thanks to their composition of fatty acids</a>, which have antibacterial properties and can absorb 35% of their own weight. Simply put, wool can soak up sweat and the odor that comes with it.</p> <p>Allbirds raised $119,000 in a Kickstarter campaign, and later raised more than $2m in venture capital funding. In March, the brand launched its washing machine-friendly wool sneaker via an online store. The shoe sold out in two months.</p> <p>Today, the company works with a mill in northern Italy, which turns the New Zealand wool into fabric. The shoes are then assembled in South Korea. A pair of Allbirds <a href=\"https://www.allbirds.com/\">retails for $95 online</a>, a price comparable to popular athletic brands such as Nike and Adidas. Allbirds declined to reveal how many shoes it makes or sells per year, but it did confirm its biggest market is in the US.</p> <p>While Allbirds is working with fine merino wool, Danish brand Glerups works with felted wool \u2013 also sourced from New Zealand farmers. <a href=\"http://glerups.com\">Glerups</a> is known for its calfskin and wool booties and slip-ons. Thick, cozy and durable, the shoes are made of a single piece of felted wool that is stitched onto a calfskin base. The brand is launching in the US later this year.</p> <p>Speaking from the Outdoor Retail show in Salt Lake City, Allan Timm, co-owner and director of Glerups, says that the shoes will be available at retailers such LL Bean, GarnetHill and REI this fall. They\u2019re already available for sale on the <a href=\"https://shop.nationalgeographic.com/product/clothing/men-s-clothing/footwear/men-s-danish-wool-travel-slippers\">National Geographic Store</a>.</p> <p>Conceived by a Danish couple in the late 1970s, Glerups originally only worked only with Nordic farmers, procuring wool from Gotland sheep, a breed native to southern Sweden. Nanny Glerup could sew only two shoes a day, and her husband, Ove, liked to maintain personal relations with all the farmers. Nanny\u2019s shoes slowly became popular in Copenhagen\u2019s shops.</p> <p>However, the company ran into trouble as it tried to scale up its efforts in the 1990s. Timm, who had been working with El Naturalista, a footwear brand in Spain, was inspired by the couple\u2019s devotion to their homespun enterprise. Using his global contacts, he built up the Glerups supply chain and, in 2005, the company relocated production from Scandinavia to Romania to reduce costs and ramp up production. They began producing 20,000 pairs a year, selling predominantly at fairs and brick and mortar stores in Denmark before eventually moving to an online store.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7390a69ee439c7fa8e5d40826b1ce8b7abf0e5d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7390a69ee439c7fa8e5d40826b1ce8b7abf0e5d9/0_50_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of wool Glerups.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of wool Glerups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glerups</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, Glerups are sold in 14 countries around the world at the rate of around 200,000 pairs a year. Timm says the company has grown by 20-25% over the last few years. This increasing demand is what led him to look for an easier-to-procure wool. He bought a plane ticket and spent a few weeks traveling around New Zealand, speaking to wool farmers. \u201cI was surprised to meet farmers who had been raising sheep for over 20 years but never got to see where the wool landed up,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Graham Sinammon, for instance, has been shearing sheep for the past 15 years. Situated at Meringa Station in New Zealand, he and his wife Tracy have never seen what happens to their wool. \u201cWe\u2019ve just loaded the wool on the truck and that\u2019s the last feedback we\u2019ve received pretty much, apart from how much it received at auction,\u201d Sinammon says.</p> <p>Both Glerups and Allbirds now work in conjunction with a part commercial, part co-operative group called The New Zealand Merino Company (NZM), which connects international brands to wool farmers across New Zealand and helps establish contracts between farmers and brands to ensure a consistent supply of wool.</p> <p>\u201cThis way they know they have a guaranteed customer, and how much money they\u2019ll get for it,\u201d Timm says. \u201cIt creates some security for the farmers.\u201d Recently, Timm brought the Sinammons a pair of Glerups to test out. \u201cIt\u2019s really satisfying to see where [the wool] ended up,\u201d Sinammon says.</p> <p>Brown, who grew up in New Zealand, says he\u2019s happy to see a resurgence in the country\u2019s wool industry. That said, the increased demand in wool footwear is unlikely to create a supply problem. Wool costs more \u2013 which is why big footwear manufacturers stick to synthetic materials. \u201cI don\u2019t see us running out of wool any time soon,\u201d he says.</p>",

He is not the first to create a foundation \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.barackobamafoundation.org/\">the Obama Foundation</a> is already at work \u2013 but he is the first to have a spouse run for the White House. Hence the uniquely awkward situation.</p> <p>Bill Clinton launched the public charity after leaving the White House in 2001. It sought to bring together governments, businesses and social groups to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing problems: health, climate change, economic development and opportunities for girls and women.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html\">The Washington Post</a> wrote last year: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation is an ingenious machine that can turn something intangible \u2013 the Clintons\u2019 global goodwill \u2013 into something tangible: money. For the Clintons\u2019 charitable causes. For their aides and allies. And, indirectly, for the Clintons themselves.\u201d</p> <p>More than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2bn in funding since its creation, <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_FOUNDATION?SITE=AP\">the Associated Press reported</a>. It has a staff of nearly 500 people.</p> <p>The foundation clearly means a lot to the 42nd president. Addressing staff recently, Bill Clinton commented: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of interesting things in my life, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done anything that I\u2019ve loved this much as this foundation.\u201d He admitted the prospect of scaling it down \u201cis like a root canal for me\u201d.</p> <h2>Has the foundation succeeded?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/team/lawrence-m-noble\">Larry Noble</a>, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, says: \u201cThe foundation does real work. It\u2019s not a sham organisation.\u201d</p> <p>It claims to have \u201cdramatically improved\u201d the lives of millions of people around the world. Clinton\u2019s supporters say it enabled the number of people receiving HIV/Aids medication to soar from 200,000 to 11.5 million and supported physical education programmes that helped more than 18 million students.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lauraseay.wordpress.com/bio/\">Laura Seay</a>, an academic who witnessed the foundation\u2019s work firsthand in east Africa, said: \u201cThe perspective that it is some kind of slush fund is based on a real misunderstanding of what the Clinton Foundation does. The Clintons don\u2019t take a salary from it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Seay was researching a PhD from 2005 to 2007 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/congo-child-soldiers-ntaganda-monuc\">where militias roamed</a> and few aid organisations ventured. She recalled how, with Clinton Foundation funding, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/democratic-republic-congo-optimism\">Heal Africa hospital</a> in Goma treated 60 HIV-positive Congolese children, most of whom survived. \u201cI know teens &amp; young adults who were kids then &amp; are alive today because the Clinton Foundation saved their lives when no one else would,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/texasinafrica/status/767779911696261120\">she tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Seay, assistant professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, adds in an interview: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation was the organisation that took the risk on this. What it showed was that in really difficult circumstances you can save a lot of lives and change the way a lot of NGOs think about conflict zones. It really was remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton also used his name to negotiate with international pharmaceutical giants to slash the price of HIV/Aids drugs, Seay argues.</p> <p>The foundation has been particularly active in Rwanda but not without criticism. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/us/politics/rwanda-bill-hillary-clinton-foundation.html?_r=0\">According to the New York Times</a>, in 2011 it successfully lobbied Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department to approve an unconventional medical training programme there. A dispute over the plan was mediated by Cheryl Mills, who spent five years on the foundation board before switching to the state department.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s banner event, the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting, is a forum for philanthropists to announce funding commitments including, in 2007, $2m to help build the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda\">Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village</a> for orphans of the genocide and Aids.</p> <p>Speaking by phone from Rwanda, its director, Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura, says of the foundation: \u201cIt seems to be doing some very good work in the country. Its work in health could be extremely beneficial.\u201d</p> <p>Support from the foundation is also a superb calling card for non-government organisations seeking other partners, he adds. \u201cHaving the Clinton Foundation name in the list of donors may encourage other funders to provide support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee3dd8b4dd1d3d6d207edf71831cf8328e58bb4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3dd8b4dd1d3d6d207edf71831cf8328e58bb4d/0_204_4777_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton speak during a student conference for the Clinton Global Initiative University on 22 March 2014, at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton at a student conference at Arizona State University in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt York/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>But is it transparent?</h2> <p>The foundation agreed to voluntarily disclose the names and donations of its contributors after Clinton was nominated to be secretary of state in late 2008, despite not being legally obliged to do so. It holds an A rating from <a href=\"https://www.charitywatch.org/home\">CharityWatch</a>, having spent 88% of its budget on programmes rather than overheads.</p> <p>Its list of donors includes Trump, who gave between $100,000 and $250,000 in 2009 and has attended a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative. One Clinton ally, noting Trump\u2019s demands for <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN10X18W\">a special prosecutor</a> to look into the foundation, says: \u201cAs a donor, Trump is calling for an investigation of himself.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/jennifer-granholm/clinton-surrogate-spins-clinton-foundation-defense/\">the Politifact website contends</a> that the foundation violated its memorandum of understanding with the state department with three significant omissions, including not reporting a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html\">$500,000 donation from Algeria</a> in 2010.</p> <h2>What is the main allegation now?</h2> <p>Pay for play.

It\u2019s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.\u201d</p> <p>The AP found that at least 85 of 154 people<strong> </strong>with private interests who either met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton also gave a combined total of $156m to her family\u2019s charities. Trump, struggling in the polls, sensed an opening and piled on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,\u201d he told a rally on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Giuliani fumed: \u201cIt is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the state department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>But Hillary Clinton insists that the data was cherry picked from a subset of her schedule. She told CNN on Wednesday: \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of smoke and there\u2019s no fire. This AP report? Put it in context, excludes nearly 2,000 meetings I had with world leaders, plus countless other meetings with government officials when I was secretary of state. It looked at a small portion of my time.</p> <p>\u201cIt drew the conclusion and made the suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great, Elie Wiesel, or Melinda Gates, or the Nobel prize winner, Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders. That is absurd. These are people I was proud to meet with, who any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with and hear about their work and their insight.\u201d</p> <p>However, there has also been a steady trickle of emails into the public domain that reveal how <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/clinton-foundation-huma-abedin-doug-band-227275\">donors sought meetings with Clinton</a> by trying to call in favours from the foundation.

Elizabeth Trudeau, a spokesperson for the state department, says: \u201cThe state department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.\u201d There is no proof of a quid pro quo or anything illegal.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/peter-schweizer/\">Peter Schweizer</a>, author of the book Clinton Cash and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, said: \u201cIt\u2019s naive to believe that people throw money at politics and don\u2019t expect something in return. They claimed there was going to be a wall between the Clinton Foundation and state department and this clearly shows there was communication between people at the Clinton Foundation and state department. There needs to be an investigation into exactly what happened and we also need legislation. We can\u2019t allow politicians to police themselves on these matters.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/22/bill-clinton-hillary-president-clinton-foundation-future-trump\">Clinton Foundation: Bill to quit board if Hillary becomes president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The foundation was a useful \u201cconduit\u201d for the Clintons to avoid the normal rules governing contributions to politicians, Schweizer adds. \u201cYou look at Huma Abedin who was on the payroll of both the Clinton Foundation and state department. I don\u2019t think \u2018inevitable overlap\u2019 involves dual payrolls.\u201d</p> <h2>So how does the issue look?</h2> <p>Not good, especially as it fills a new vacuum in the dog days of August in which Trump has managed to avoid his usual attention-grabbing gaffes. It gives the appearance, at least, of a blurred line and intersecting interests between the Clinton Foundation and state department.</p> <p>\u201cThe frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton,\u201d the AP report said.</p> <p>Scott Amey, general counsel at the <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/\">Project on Government Oversight</a>, said: \u201cI think this is an example that may not be illegal but certainly should have been handled with more communication to show there was no actual or apparent conflicts of interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, in giving money to the Clinton Foundation, did donors feel they deserved or were going to receive special access to Hillary at the state department? We don\u2019t know. Only time will tell. It seems some favours were called in and some minor efforts were made to provide access.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps some overlap between between the entities was inevitable. But Amey adds: \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes here is they didn\u2019t set up proper firewalls to prevent those blurred lines. I would be less sceptical if I had seen emails back from the state department saying: \u2018We can\u2019t do this, you should go through the official channels.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2485f2df79181a91d5b712f23ecec23f3611591f/0_122_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative on 22 September 2014 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton address the audience during the opening of the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2014 in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bill Clinton announced that, if Hillary wins the presidency, he will step down from the board of the foundation and it will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations.

  "<p>My friend Lynne Roper, who has died of a brain tumour aged 55, developed a love of water during her Devon childhood, and it never left her. Her early career was in the RAF and academia; when she moved on to become a paramedic, she fitted wild swimming \u2013 outdoors in natural surroundings \u2013 around her shift patterns, saying that water washed away the stresses of the job.</p> <p>Lynne had turned to wild swimming to regain her physical and emotional health after a double mastectomy. She immersed herself in rivers, the sea, and the friendships formed through water. For her, wild swimming was never about how far or fast you swam, or how cold the water. It was always about the experience itself, and the connection with the environment.</p> <p>Born in Tiverton, north Devon, Lynne was one of three children of Michael, a police officer, and Jenny, who left the police force to bring up Lynne and her two brothers. Lynne went to the Marist convent school in Barnstaple, sixth-form college in Devonport, and Plymouth College of Art before joining the RAF. She served for 12 years, during which time she saw duty in the first Gulf war, and completed tours in Germany, the Falklands, Canada, the US and Cyprus.</p> <p>In 1998 she completed a degree in film and media studies at Stirling University, undertook at PGCE at Wolverhampton University the following year, and taught in Stirling for a few years before returning to Devon and settling on Dartmoor.</p> <p>She gave many people the confidence to start wild swimming; her infectious smile, her ability to listen and her calm patience never faltered. She readily shared her ability to read water, her knowledge and her judgment. As a press officer for the <a href=\"http://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/\" title=\"\">Outdoor Swimming Society</a>, Lynne developed safety advice and liaised with the media to ensure the joy of wild swimming was not lost to stories of danger. Kate Rew, the society\u2019s founder, described her as \u201ca free-spirited, no-nonsense thinker who fought for what she thought was right\u201d.</p> <p>This was never more in evidence than when Lynne began writing a <a href=\"https://outofmybrains.org/tag/blogging/\" title=\"\">blog</a> about the brain tumour she was diagnosed with in February this year. When she learned she was terminally ill, she stepped up her efforts to highlight the impact of funding restraint on acute frontline health services and social care, and she was fearless in relating that directly to her own situation. Her writing was sensitive, frank, funny and clever. So was she.</p> <p>Lynne\u2019s dog, Honey, was also a very keen wild swimmer, her enthusiasm for joining Lynne in the water matched only by her appetite for the lunches of other swimmers. Many lost a sandwich or a pasty to the cause.</p> <p>Lynne is survived by her parents, her brothers, Ian and David, and extended family, all of whom she loved very much.</p>",

Essentially, you\u2019re making spaces so that you don\u2019t need those spaces any more.</p> <p><strong>Amaal Said</strong><br>I was writing about difficult things that I\u2019d been told to keep hidden because the women in my family weren\u2019t proud of it or they expected people to not understand. But I felt like I didn\u2019t have a choice, because staying silent would mean internalising a lot of shame about my own body. I didn\u2019t think it was fair to keep it all in, and so writing was an act to sort through and share those really heavy feelings. The incredible thing was being heard and being told that I wasn\u2019t alone. </p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>I used to write about really big, abstract things, probably because I was born in Tokyo and grew up in Beijing, and I always felt like that was my biographical tagline. I think finding communities of like-minded writers and women let me shed those preconceived notions about how my poetry should be. Now I\u2019m a lot more focused on documenting the intimate relationships in my life, like writing love poems, because I don\u2019t have to feel cliched if I\u2019m just going to read them in a room full of women. I\u2019m not as tokenised in a room full of women. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab77ebe45fe23c15efdcd295ce98f5c0c280189e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab77ebe45fe23c15efdcd295ce98f5c0c280189e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunayana Bhargava\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunayana Bhargava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Being typecast as \u2018the woman of colour\u2019</strong><br></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Amaal Said</strong><br>Being very visible in terms of being Muslim, wearing a hijab and getting on a stage, and then being expected to say a sort of thing or have a sort of voice and to write the poem about the news, right? To write the poem about war \u2026 That\u2019s not very fair on me, because I\u2019m just a girl and I\u2019m just going through my own stuff. </p> <p>Especially being introduced: oh, look, we have Amaal Said, her work is very tragic or her work is very devastating, and I\u2019m like: devastating for who? Because, for me, it\u2019s just something else that I\u2019m working through, it\u2019s not something that cripples me.</p> <p><strong>Rachel Long</strong><br>[There is] this expectation that [\u2026] you [\u2026] should write this kind of one-voice-for-all-black-voices and it should be female. You should be talking about your rough upbringing, your working-class background, stuff like that, which I didn\u2019t necessarily want to do. </p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I\u2019m so much more than just an Indian woman. I\u2019m [a woman] from a fairly difficult upbringing who also happens to do other kinds of things. I\u2019m really interested in surrealism, for example. I\u2019m really interested in piecing together surreal aspects of life. That\u2019s come through in my poetry now, where I can write about far more difficult, hard-hitting things and not feel guilty for eviscerating myself on paper and writing all of these horrible things that people are like, \u201cwow, how unfeminine, how unwomanly\u201d. Because I choose the metric of womanhood for myself and nobody else can tell me what is or isn\u2019t supposed to be feminine. </p> <p>A lot of men are poets before they even walk into the room, and they never feel like they\u2019re going to be typecast in any way, shape or form. The sad thing is the way that people have tokenised people of colour or women; they\u2019ve expected them to bring certain narratives and systematically only included them if they\u2019re going to bring those narratives to the table. So you end up in a double bind here because you\u2019re like: well, I\u2019m equally as human as my male counterpart, but I\u2019m only allowed airtime if I\u2019m speaking about the ways that I\u2019m not like them, and the ways that I \u201cearn\u201d my grief and my pain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac350eb1f7f1f0eb04ce9a8762985b496a8b6c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac350eb1f7f1f0eb04ce9a8762985b496a8b6c4e/0_0_5333_3546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Long\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Long.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Rejecting the male gaze</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I find that, a lot of the time, if a man were to come up to me and say something about how I lived through a domestic abuse situation or how I managed to grow up in a violent household, they would always commend me on managing to retain some level of femininity, some level of vulnerability and softness, as if I\u2019m still palatable because I can still manage to present myself in a really feminine way. Whereas women are better at being critical and putting you on the path to what your authentic voice is.</p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>A male artist can approach you under the guise of \u201chey, we\u2019re both creatives, it\u2019s an artistic collaboration\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s not! They just want to photograph you in a way they feel is attractive. Just thinking about the ego that comes with being a male photographer \u2026 It\u2019s them thinking: \u201cRena\u2019s not a person, she\u2019s a muse. Rena\u2019s not a partner, she\u2019s just a beautiful girl in my room, she\u2019s just a subject on the other side of the lens.\u201d Why are we not seeing close-up penis shots more often? Not that I want to [laughs]. Why are we so commodified? If you have to use a conventionally attractive naked woman to make your photo worthwhile, maybe you\u2019re just not a great photographer.

Because that belief gets chipped away. Read, read, read so much. Because you\u2019ll never be good if you don\u2019t read, you\u2019ll never be able to write well. Also, if you are the weirdo kid and you are on your own, you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s really hard \u2013 but make a community any way you can, even if it\u2019s a community of two. Use the internet, just so you\u2019ve got someone to bounce ideas off when you need it. That can add a lot to your confidence \u2013 somebody who likes your work, but whom you love and trust enough that they can critique your work as well. Because you\u2019re not going to get any better without realising that you do need critique.</p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>No matter what you\u2019re saying, people are going to tell you that there\u2019s no need for you to say it. There\u2019s no need for you to paint; there\u2019s no need for you to photograph; there\u2019s no need for you to write music, because in some way, shape or form, you\u2019re not going to be changing anything. That\u2019s all a big bargain game to make sure you never overstep your mark, never go out of yourself, never breach your remit as a woman working as a creative. So persevere to make sure you never let anybody tell you that you don\u2019t have a place in art. </p> <p><strong>Rena Minegishi</strong><br>Read more women. You will find a resonance so deep and so real once you read women poets, because they know exactly what you\u2019ve been through, they\u2019ve been talked down by male poets, they\u2019ve been erased from textbooks.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f933d371b83d173e7449cc5e1ebe62c3b31f262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f933d371b83d173e7449cc5e1ebe62c3b31f262/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunayana Bhargava\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunayana Bhargava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Owning the title \u2018artist\u2019</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Amaal Said</strong><br>I feel like I\u2019ve been fighting for the term \u201cartist\u201d for a very long time. People I\u2019ve grown up around have always tried to take away the artist label from me: you\u2019re just a daughter, you\u2019re a politics student, etc. You can\u2019t be more than one thing, but men can. For me, it literally took the publishing of the first book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/27/warsan-shire-young-poet-laureate-beyonce-lemonade-london\">Warsan Shire</a> released, Teaching My Mother How To Give Birth, to be able to break down to my mother that this is what I wanted to do.

Knowing that what I\u2019ve said and what I\u2019ve experienced from my little part of the world can touch you from across the sea is why the internet and YouTube are so incredibly important. As a young Somali girl, and as a young black girl growing up in a place where there were no community services or youth groups and the nearest cinema was 30 minutes on a bus, having a space on the internet \u2013 opening yourself up to a community, sharing your work with maybe a couple of people at first, and just growing the confidence \u2013 is what it took for me to be able to say: I can do this and I\u2019m not a fraud.</p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I think the whole metric of how we measure change is very masculine. It\u2019s done in a very aggressive, often violent way, that you need to break borders, upheave a whole structure in order to make a difference. But that\u2019s not true at all \u2013 a lot of people unionise through the smallest things that operate over the largest distances. So, for a lot of us starting out in poetry, it was really validating to start in a digital sphere, before upgrading to what were more personal, intimate venues where you\u2019d actually perform your work. I was reading about Beyonc\u00e9 discovering Warsan Shire through YouTube, through exactly the same medium any other woman of colour would be able to access another woman of colour who\u2019s reading poetry. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2f379d154ba965437b45cc674167ccda17a5113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f379d154ba965437b45cc674167ccda17a5113/0_0_1600_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Long\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Long.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amaal Said</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Representations and self-image</strong><br></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Rachel Long</strong><br>Amaal\u2019s not only doing something with women of colour in photographs \u2013 saying \u201cI am here, we exist\u201d \u2013 but also, crucially, her pictures are soft. They\u2019re super feminine. Often times, black women are portrayed like the mummy figure: big and huge; it\u2019s never soft. The black woman on TV is loud and brashy, she wears earrings and red hair and is really in your face. And so, through flowers and her photography, Amaal does the opposite. Even though you know that\u2019s not the way every black woman is, to see that [softness] in a photograph is stunning. </p> <p><strong>Sunayana Bhargava</strong><br>I had never felt comfortable in front of a camera, because I thought it was only going to magnify my flaws rather than finding something that I could like, but something about being in the hands of a woman that you really love and respect changed it from what would be such an interrogative experience. The idea that you could be with a woman and she could see beauty in you is an intensely vulnerable thing and something that requires a lot of trust. To be able to let Amaal take a photo of me and know that I\u2019m going to see it and I\u2019m actually going feel beautiful, is something that I think lots of women would feel is a massive thing, because they\u2019re constantly looking at distorted representations of themselves.

  "<p>If money talks, then one of the things it has been saying this summer is that investors are no longer interested in hedge funds. Investors withdrew $25.2bn from hedge funds in July, according to eVestments. This is the largest monthly redemption since February 2009, when investors redeemed $28.2bn.</p> <p>This news comes after investors withdrew $23.5bn in June. Overall, in 2016, hedge funds faced a net outflow of $55.9bn. According to Peter Laurelli, vice-president and global head of research at eVestments, 2016 could become the third year on record when investors took out more money than they put in.</p> <p>The main reasons why investors are taking their money elsewhere? Poor performance. </p> <p>\u201cInvestor redemptions from the industry continue to be driven by mediocre performance. Funds producing losses in 2015 are by far the primary source of outflows throughout the year into July,\u201d Laurelli wrote in his report. \u201cAdditionally, in both June and July, redemptions have accelerated from within funds producing losses in 2016. Funds reporting the 10 largest outflows in July have returned an average of -4.1% year to date, with average losses of -5.3% concentrated in the first quarter.\u201d</p> <p>Laurelli pointed out that some hedge funds were doing well \u2013 especially those who produced higher returns for their investors. </p> <p>\u201cThe 10 largest allocations in the last two months have gone to funds which have produced an average return of nearly 7% this year, and produced positive returns on average in 2015,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat we are forced to illuminate positive sentiment in the proverbial ashes, only illustrates the difficulty faced by many.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 hedge funds have delivered returns of 1.2% industrywide, while S&amp;P 500 delivered returns of about 7.6%, according to Bloomberg. </p> <p>The trouble for hedge funds started in 2015, when over the last three months, investors globally withdrew more money than they put in, according to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-message-to-hedge-funds-we-are-replacing-you-with-clones-1459348497\">Hedge Fund Research</a>. The research firm also reported that 979 hedge funds closed last year \u2013 most since 2009. </p> <p>The industry is expected to shrink further this year. According to Blackstone Group president Tony James, the industry might lose as much as 25% of assets this year. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a day of reckoning that we face here,\u201d James said during <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/hedge-funds-may-lose-quarter-of-assets-blackstone-s-james-says\">a May interview</a> with Bloomberg TV Canada. \u201cThere will be a shrinkage in the industry and it will be painful. That\u2019s going to be pretty painful for an awful lot of places.\u201d</p> <p>BlackStone is the world\u2019s largest discretionary hedge fund investor. In the second quarter of 2016, the firm allocated <a href=\"http://www.blackstone.com/the-firm/overview\">$68.6bn to hedge funds</a>.</p> <p>Despite the faltering performance and the varying investors, hedge fund compensation remains high.

Then, once the army re-took it, soldiers sexually assaulted at least three girls, Mandera was told by a victim after she escaped with her brother. \u201cI thought to myself,\u201d Mandera said, \u201cif I had been held up in the village I would have been raped.\u201d</p> <p>Rape, survivors said, is being used as a weapon of war. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of forcing the people of that area to go out,\u201d said Sam Siyaga, 34, a civil servant who escaped a nearby area. \u201cIt is very common.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9e40c161341903cb7be36c2d87999f9866157d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9e40c161341903cb7be36c2d87999f9866157d/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Siyaga, a 34-year-old civil servant from South Sudan, sits in a refugee settlement in northern Uganda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Sudanese refugee Sam Siyaga says rape is being used as a weapon of war to force people to leave areas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kingsley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armed groups have robbed people trying to escape, with men and young people sometimes prevented from leaving, and forced to join the fighting. To evade detection, some refugees described hiding in the bush for days on end, surviving mainly on leaves and wild cassava plants. Others waited near a main road until the arrival of a Ugandan military convoy, returning from Juba after rescuing stranded Ugandan expatriates.</p> <p>Neither the South Sudanese government nor the rebels inspired confidence, several survivors said after reaching safety. \u201cFor us in the communities, we blame all of them,\u201d said Peter Paul Odong, a headteacher from Magwi, as he dangled from the back of a truck just inside the Ugandan border. \u201cAfter the [peace agreement] was agreed, the conflict still continued. And that is both sides\u2019 fault.\u201d</p> <p>Amid this chaos, officials say, a wider mix of people has been sucked into the fighting than usual. Kiir and Machar fought for different factions within the country\u2019s liberation movement \u2013 and represent the country\u2019s two largest ethnic groups, respectively the Dinka and the Nuer. But many of the newly displaced are from smaller tribes, include the Madi. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen refugees from tribes and areas that we didn\u2019t see previously, which means the fighting has spread to the villages,\u201d said Kazungu.</p> <p>There has also been a worrying spike in unaccompanied child refugees, according to the charity <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/emergencies/support-our-emergency-fund\">Save the Children, which is appealing for donations to help care for the new arrivals</a>.</p> <p>Since early July, nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minors, or children separated from their parents, have arrived in Uganda, around seven times the number recorded during the first half of the year, Save the Children said. The youngest was five. Some came alone because their parents were forced to stay and fight. Others got separated amid the chaos of the situation, prompting <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/emergencies/support-our-emergency-fund\">Save the Children to begin a programme to reunite separated families, and find foster care for lone children</a>. </p> <p>\u201cMany of the separated children arrived in their school uniforms because there was no chance for them to go back home,\u201d said Tonny Kasiita, the NGO\u2019s acting team leader in one of the border provinces. \u201cThey just came with their teachers and classmates.\u201d</p> <p>In the rush to accommodate so many new children, many teenagers have yet to be placed in secondary education. But Uganda is otherwise comparatively<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/567414b26.html\"> generous to refugees</a>. Unlike countries such as Britain, Uganda lets refugees work as soon as they arrive in the country. Families are also given a plot of land, and equipment to build a new home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70660a08ef6a84a7b32cbf5c4b7e27ab0c79f731\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70660a08ef6a84a7b32cbf5c4b7e27ab0c79f731/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At Maaji refugee settlement in northern Uganda new arrivals are given a plot of land, equipment to build a home and the right to work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Maaji refugee settlement in northern Uganda, new arrivals are given a plot of land, equipment to build a home, and the right to work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kingsley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision is partly altruistic; several of Uganda\u2019s leaders were themselves once refugees. But it is also born of enlightened self-interest, says Kazungu. \u201cWe are not seeing refugees as a burden, but as part of the economic development of the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere they are, there is development, schools are built, health services are built, and they are also a market for the nationals. They buy food from the nationals, and nationals also buy from them.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/refugeeeconomies\">Research by Oxford University\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre</a> highlights the economic benefits of Uganda\u2019s refugee policies. More than one in five refugees in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, run businesses that employ at least one person \u2013 and 40% of those employees are Ugandans. </p> <p>\u201cOur research in the country highlights the positive benefits of moving beyond encampment and giving refugees basic socio-economic freedoms,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/people/alexander-betts\">Professor Alexander Betts</a>, the centre\u2019s director. \u201cRefugees become producers, consumers, entrepreneurs, employees and employers. They help themselves and their communities. The policy is not perfect but in offering basic autonomy to refugees, its offers a model from which other countries should learn.\u201d</p> <p>In the short-term, however, many of Uganda\u2019s newest refugees were just happy to find any kind of sanctuary. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to leave my home,\u201d said Ottoviana. \u201cBut what I want most of all, and what my children want most of all, is to live.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some refugees\u2019 names have been changed</em></p>",
  "<p>A newly deployed team of specially trained dogs have helped authorities in Tanzania seize a haul of elephant tusks, with conservationists hoping the canine allies can help significantly slow rampant poaching in the country.<br></p> <p>The dogs \u2013 Jenny, a Belgian Malinois, and Dexter, an English springer spaniel \u2013 discovered the four tusks at a property following a tipoff. A man was taken into custody over the ivory haul, which was initially missed by wildlife officials but found \u201cwithin a minute\u201d by Jenny\u2019s keen nose.</p> <p>The bust follows an 18-month training program that involved dogs being selected by Wagtail UK, a dog training school based in Wales, and flown to Tanzania\u2019s largest national park, Ruaha.

It\u2019s only a matter of time before we start to directly track poachers as well as find ivory through dogs.\u201d</p> <p>Tanzania has one of Africa\u2019s largest elephant populations and has become a target for poachers looking to supply the lucrative market for ivory in Asia. A census <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/tanzania-epicentre-of-elephant-poaching-census-reveals\">conducted last year</a> found that the country lost a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d 60% of its elephants in just five years, leaving Tanzania with around 43,000 pachyderms.</p> <p>The country has also proved dangerous to humans battling the ivory trade. Roger Gower, a British helicopter pilot, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/30/british-pilot-killed-by-elephant-poachers-tanzania\">fatally shot by poachers in January</a> as he was helping authorities track criminals.</p> <p>Despite a global ban on the international trade of ivory, the black market in tusks for trinkets and medicines has led to fears that elephants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco\">could be wiped out</a> in the wild.

  "<p>The 2016 Summer Olympics are over. Baseball is an Olympic sport again. <br>Left out of the Games in London and Rio, baseball (along with its pal softball) is set to return again in Tokyo in 2020. There is no commitment to the sport beyond Tokyo, however, which means the sport can\u2019t afford to blow its opportunity on the international stage. As big as the \u201cWorld\u201d Series claims to be, baseball\u2019s only truly global showcase comes when it\u2019s allowed to be seen every four years along with the rest of the big-time Olympic sports: track and field, swimming, dressage and the like. </p> <p>The sport needs to put on a show in Tokyo or it might not get another chance \u2013 and doing so will require participation from the best players in the game. Think about the excitement surrounding the 1992 Dream Team, only imagine Michael Jordan as a baseball player. OK, bad idea. But you get my point. </p> <p>Mike Trout, Kris Bryant, Mookie Betts, Clayton Kershaw, all in red, white and blue and taking on the best of the best from the other top baseball nations. Bat flips from around the world, chanting, brushback pitches, baseball\u2019s unwritten rules unwritten in every language. Host nation Tokyo might even feature a 46-year old, .300-hitting Olympian Ichiro. Everything about it sounds amazing.</p> <p>A star-studded tournament would get attention both in the US and around the world and the huge, enthusiastic crowds that would undoubtedly show up to the games in Tokyo would make the sport one of the Games\u2019 big stories. This would be far from the contrived World Baseball Classic, an event with no history. This new form of Olympic baseball would feature the best baseball players in the world playing in the ultimate global sports tournament, with hundreds of millions watching around the world (give or take a few tens of millions of millennials, right NBC?)</p> <p>The only problem is that Major League Baseball doesn\u2019t want to send its stars to the Olympics because the Summer Games happen just as the pennant chase heats up. The 2020 Games will run from 24 July to 9 August, holy summer days for those who worship baseball as it has always been. But this is old thinking that new commissioner Rob Manfred hopefully won\u2019t adopt. Manfred has already said he is open to reducing the regular season to 154 games. So cut eight games off the regular season in 2020, ditch the all-star game along with it \u2013 the wildly unpopular event earned record low ratings in July \u2013 and, abracadabra, we\u2019ve instantly found the two weeks we need to sell baseball to the world.</p> <p> There is no downside. The players who don\u2019t make an Olympic team get time to nurse injuries and rest up for the pennant chase, MLB can make the 31 July trade deadline into a multi-day, mega-hyped event, the game\u2019s best players will get to battle it out for their countries \u2013 while staying fresh for their U.S. teams \u2013 and maybe just win a few million fans the world over will fall in love with the sport. It\u2019s a win, win, win, etc.</p> <p>The safe bet is that baseball goes its regular route and fills the US Olympic roster with the usual retreads and nobodies. For who, outside of everyone, can forget the fearsome 2008 Team USA lineup with Nate Schierholtz, Jayson Nix and Taylor Teagarden? Or it can do something very un-baseball-like, go bold and try to sell the game to a new generation. </p> <p>The NHL has allowed its season to be interrupted for the Olympics since 1998 and ice hockey has been a huge part of the Games ever since. And this during the tenure of Gary Bettman. Gary Bettman. Does Manfred want his legacy to be that he was a worse commissioner than Gary Bettman? That\u2019s his choice. And there\u2019s only one good option for him and the sport: baseball must go all-in on the 2020 Olympics. <br><br></p> <h2>Video of the Week</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyejUGoTBTk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyejUGoTBTk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Oregon Little League coach Joel Jensen called timeout on Tuesday at the LLWS to tell his son that he loves him.

Feels like a lose-lose for Trump. <br><br></p> <h2>How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week? </h2> <p>While there is no particular Goose Gossage connection to this week\u2019s lesson in baseball\u2019s code, it does harken back to the fight the former Yankees reliever got into with teammate Cliff Johnson in 1979. That brawl left Gossage with a broken thumb, whereas this week\u2019s baseball punching left A\u2019s DH Billy Butler with a head injury thanks to team-mate Danny Valencia. </p> <p><br>The Butler-Valencia bout reportedly started when Butler told a shoe brand representative that Valencia was wearing a pair of off-brand cleats in breach of his contract. For this bit of teammate snitching, Butler received a punch to the face from Valencia. Sometimes baseball\u2019s code is confusing. Not in this case. Go out of your way to tell on a coworker and get punched in the face. That\u2019s common sense and karma.</p> <h2>Nine thoughts in order</h2> <p>1) It\u2019s still too early to determine who truly \u201cwon\u201d and \u201clost\u201d last month\u2019s non-waiver trade deadline, but there are definitely early contenders. Andrew Miller has been outstanding since going to Cleveland from the Yankees, posting a 1.69 ERA and 0.46 WHIP with two saves and 16 strikeouts in 10 and two-thirds innings. Watch him dominate the A\u2019s here on Monday night with three straight Ks to pick up the save in a 1-0 win. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WFNYScott/status/768055590715351045\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Schools back in.

He\u2019s hitting .149 under the careful watch of Magic Johnson in LA, including no home runs and no runs batted in more than 70 plate appearances. That\u2019s pretty tough to do. Even tougher to do? Injure yourself while getting room service. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/McCulloughTimes/status/767836765528915971\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Josh Reddick hurt his finger when his hand got caught in a door last night while ordering room service. &quot;This is rock bottom,&quot; he cracked.</p>&mdash; Andy McCullough (@McCulloughTimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McCulloughTimes/status/767836765528915971\">August 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>2) The Cardinals still have a hold on the last wildcard spot in the National League, but they\u2019re not making it look easy. Despite having the Best Fans in Baseball\u2122 St Louis somehow have the fourth-worst home record in all of baseball. That becomes a serious problem due to the fact that the Cardinals have a narrow lead over the Marlins and Pirates for that last wildcard spot and close out their season with six games at Busch Stadium \u2013 including Games 160, 161 and 162 versus Pittsburgh. Imagine a scenario in which the Cardinals go from a playoff position in the final week to missing the postseason completely thanks to gagging on that final homestand. Could they end their season by get booed off their home field by the Best Fans? This truly could be a dream season for Cubs fans.</p> <p>3) Yankees COO Hank Steinbrenner <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/18/hal-steinbrenners-unusual-reaction-to-yankees-youth-turn/\">told the New York Post</a> that part of what convinced him to go all-in on the team rebuilding was because Yankee fans on social media supported a youth movement. They no doubt did. Because the general consensus on social media about sports, politics/movies/music/gardening/whatever issue is dominating the news cycle sucks big time. In fact, it might just be the worst ever and the complete opposite must be done straight away. So expect Yankees fans on social media to be pushing for some veteran additions upon completion of the first three-game losing streak. </p> <p>4) The first place Dodgers currently have seven starters on the DL: Clayton Kershaw, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Brandon McCarthy, Rich Hill, Alex Wood, Brett Anderson and Scott Kazmir. That is more than $79m in payroll on the disabled list, meaning the Dodgers have to battle on with barely $185m worth of healthy players. Please keep them in your thoughts during this difficult time.</p> <p>5) The art of pitch framing has been around since the first catcher wanted to buy a call from the home plate ump, but it\u2019s only in recent years \u2013 beginning around 2006 with the introduction of the PITCHf/x pitching tracking system \u2013 that teams were able to quantify the skill and then compensate catchers who do it well. Now we are beginning to see catchers who grew up in this era arrive on the big stage of the Little League World Series. Expect this kid to receive a large bubble gum bonus from management. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-vine\"> <iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/5MY72UHaOHL/embed/simple\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><script async src=\"//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>6) Blue Jays slugger Edwin Encarnacion is being sued for more than $11.5m by a woman who claims he gave her STDs. His agent has said that the charges are \u201ccompletely inappropriate and meritless\u201d and that the designated hitter will \u201ctake every legal measure to defend himself against this meritless claim.\u201d The courts will decide that, but I think we can all agree that STD feels a bit outdated in modern baseball. Surely there is something like xSTD, STD+ or VORstD that can more accurately judge what Encarnacion did or did not give. </p> <p>7) With Derek Jeter retiring from baseball two years ago, A-Rod going out two weeks ago and David Ortiz leaving the game two months from now, there may be a lot of fans without a favorite player in the sport. If you are such a fan, consider filling that hole with Royals third baseman Cheslor Cuthbert. He\u2019s a 23-year old rookie batting .292 with 10 home runs. That covers the baseball part.</p> <p>Now for the much more interesting off-the-field component: the Venezuela native used a chunk of the $1.9m signing bonus he received in 2009 to buy chickens and now has nearly 300 of them waiting for him back at home. \u201cHe gets photos and videos and makes calls to their caretaker everyday,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article97360007.html\">his sister told La Prensa</a>. \u201cHe adores them.\u201d How can you not root for a man with a phone full of pictures of his pet chickens? And, please, people of Kansas City, try to consider the man\u2019s feelings. Don\u2019t eat your massive platters of barbecue chicken right in front of him. </p> <p>8) MLB released the postseason schedule this week. A few dates you\u2019ll want to keep open: </p> <p>\u2013 Tuesday 25 October: Game 1 of the World Series.</p> <p>\u2013 Wednesday 2 November: Game 7 of the World Series, if necessary.</p> <p>\u2013 Friday 7 October: four playoff games in one day with the NLDS Game 1s and the ALDS Game 2s.</p> <p>\u2013 Tuesday 4 October: postseason opens with the AL wildcard game.</p> <p>\u2013 Wednesday 5 October: Pittsburgh Pirates lose in the NL wildcard to team TBD. </p> <p>9) After each of the last three Summer Olympics, the football world has pondered if Usain Bolt could play in the NFL. Just last week, former coach Tony Dungy said he\u2019d use Bolt as a receiver to \u201cclear out one side of the field\u201d with his speed, while Falcons receiver Julio Jones said Bolt <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/08/why-usain-bolt-wouldnt-make-it-as-a-wide-receiver-in-the-nfl-according-to-julio-jones \">would struggle without the \u201cburst\u201d</a> he\u2019d need to get off the line of scrimmage.</p> <p>But why are we always projecting Bolt into football? Why couldn\u2019t he be a MLB pinch runner? And a late-inning defensive replacement to run down balls hit into the gap <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/5O6z2Lw1XvP\">Billy Hamilton-style?</a> Sure, it\u2019s improbable, but it seems more likely to happen than a football career. That reminds me, there\u2019s one more date coming up on the baseball calendar that you\u2019ll want to remember: Tim Tebow\u2019s baseball tryout is now set for 30 August in Los Angeles.</p>",

And the story can raise a discussion, in which they can explore and explain the way they feel about a situation.\u201d</p> <p>Being frightened by a book, said Kenny, \u201chelps forge resilience\u201d. \u201cThe world can be a scary place \u2013 children will get into situations where they\u2019re told off by teachers, or fall out with friends. Knowing how to confront fear is a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>The Book People\u2019s survey also found that while a third of parents avoided books with scary characters, 78% said that baddies helped children \u201cdifferentiate between good and evil\u201d, 53% that they helped children \u201clearn to cope with difficult situations\u201d, and 48% that they help conquer fears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/10/kermit-the-frog-scary-childrens-books-shaun-tan-gaiman-coraline\">Kermit the Frog and other terrors: the appeal of scary children's books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cChildren are often being wrapped up in cotton wool,\u201d said Kenny. \u201cRisk and fear are something we need in childhood.

  "<p>The EU and Turkey are poised for a fresh round of diplomacy in an attempt to keep their migration pact working, despite the rancorous downward spiral in relations since Ankara\u2019s crackdown on tens of thousands of people it says are supporters of the exiled cleric it blames for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/whats-happened-in-turkey-first-hours-of-the-coup\">failed military coup</a>.<br></p> <p>The two sides will reach a moment of truth in September, when the European commission is due to report on whether Turkey has done enough to gain visa-free travel to Europe\u2019s borderless Schengen zone, a linchpin of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa\"> migration deal</a>.</p> <p>A delegation of EU officials is expected in Ankara in the coming weeks to assess Turkey\u2019s progress, while a visit by the EU commissioner responsible for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, is also being discussed.<br></p> <p>The diplomatic move comes amid an increase in migrants crossing the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. In August, 109 people a day on average have been arriving on Greek shores, compared to 62 in July, although still far below January\u2019s tally of 2,000. The UN refugee agency warned that Europe could see a repeat of last year\u2019s chaotic mass arrivals, unless EU governments did more to help asylum seekers in the Middle East as well as resettling more refugees.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe feeling in Europe is that the problem has been solved,\u201d UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said. \u201cPeople have forgotten about the problem, because they do not see the immediacy of it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99945507e26f233104f45414758d7f1d29b91ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99945507e26f233104f45414758d7f1d29b91ec6/0_213_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, during his visit to the refugee camp of Lagadikia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, during his visit to the refugee camp of Lagadikia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around 50,000 people are stranded in Greece, many living in dire conditions in reception centres, not knowing when they will move on. Save the Children reported this week that Greek refugee camps were bursting at the seams: people are living in dirty and unsafe conditions, as camps lack sufficient drinking water, showers and toilets.</p> <p>Under the pact with Ankara, Europe promised an initial \u20ac3bn aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey, in exchange for being able to send back irregular migrants who had arrived in Greece. The deal was sweetened by the promise of visa-free travel for Turks throughout continental Europe.<br></p> <p>But even before the botched coup in Turkey, the deal had been hanging by a thread with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, insisting he would not re-write Turkey\u2019s counter-terrorism laws - a key condition of the visa deal.</p> <p>Officials from both sides working on the visa deal insist it is viable, despite deteriorating EU-Turkey relations in the aftermath of the failed coup. Selim Yenel, Turkey\u2019s most senior diplomat in Brussels, believes a visa agreement in October is still possible, although he said \u201cemotions are still very high\u201d.</p> <p>In the weeks before the coup, both sides had met to search for compromise on Turkey\u2019s anti-terror laws, which are so widely drawn that journalists and opposition figures are targets. \u201cWe have gone through a lot of wordings [on the counter-terrorism law] that would be appropriate for us and sufficient for the EU,\u201d Yenel told the Guardian. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finalised it but it is doable.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/whats-it-like-living-in-turkey-one-month-after-the-failed-coup\">What\u2019s it like living in Turkey one month after the failed coup?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe feel that if the commission gives a green light in its report in September, then the council [of ministers] will most probably go ahead and the assumption is that the European parliament will also say yes.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ambassador, who returns to Ankara in September, also said he couldn\u2019t imagine Turkey adopting the death penalty, which the EU opposes, arguing there was no majority in the Turkish parliament for capital punishment. Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/08/08/recep-tayyip-erdogan-western-leaders-prefered-to-leave-turkish-people-to-themselves_4979866_3214.html\">told Le Monde</a> that Turkey\u2019s parliament would decide if the death penalty is reinstated, in a wide-ranging interview, where he accused Europe of \u201cnot being sincere with Turkey\u201d. The EU has warned Turkey that re-instating the death penalty would end its membership hopes. </p> <p>The two sides are also at odds over money. While Brussels likes to stress the \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.8bn) \u201cmobilised\u201d to help Syrian refugees in Turkey, only \u20ac105m has been disbursed to aid agencies on the ground. A plan to bring refugees to Europe from Europe has also got off to a stuttering start: only 1,085 Syrians in Turkey have been resettled in EU countries, despite initial talk of 72,000 places.</p> <p>Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, maintained an agreement was possible, but insisted Turkey had to meet all 72 conditions (\u201cbenchmarks\u201d) to get the visa deal. \u201cWe are on the same side. The intention of the visa liberalisation benchmark has never been to reduce Turkey\u2019s capacity to fight terrorism effectively, quite the contrary,\u201d he said in a written answer to the Guardian.</p> <p>Kati Piri, a Dutch Socialist MEP, who works on EU-Turkey relations in the European parliament, did not share this optimism. Visa-free travel was \u201csimply not going to happen if Turkey does not fulfil these criteria,\u201d she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe are not asking Turkey not to fight terrorism, Turkey is very vulnerable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are asking them to bring [the law] into line with European legislation, so you cannot put journalists in jail when they are only writing about more rights for the Kurdish population.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did not see a willingness neither before nor after the coup attempt to fulfil the criteria.\u201d </p> <p>The MEP, who will meet Turkish government and opposition figures in Ankara, said it would be wiser for the EU executive to postpone its September report, as changes are unlikely during the post-coup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/erdogan-bans-academics-from-travel-holds-first-post-coup-security-meeting-ankara-turkey\">state of emergency</a>.<br></p>",

  "<p>Some years ago, researchers from a British university contacted the member agencies of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to ask them how they measured fraud. The responses were not encouraging: \u201cwe are too busy to help\u201d, \u201cwe are unable to respond to your exact request\u201d and \u201cwe do not measure fraud\u201d.</p> <p>Fortunately, much has changed. Several large international NGOs now have counter-fraud units, institutional donors make stringent fraud-prevention demands, and the risk of fraud and corruption is more widely understood in the sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/26/nine-ways-to-use-technology-to-reduce-corruption\">Nine ways to use technology to reduce corruption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That risk is high. Cultures of trust, challenging environments where staff are overstretched, and high-risk delivery models (such as humanitarian emergencies and remote programme management) all raise it. Our moral missions may encourage us to take poorly managed risks. Estimates of the scale of loss to fraud are between 2% and 5% of an organisation\u2019s income \u2013 and many global development workers find that range readily believable. Of the \u00a35.8bn identified as having been channelled through NGOs in <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GHA-Report-2015_-Interactive_Online.pdf\">humanitarian emergencies</a> in 2013, for example, that range could mean that up to \u00a3276m may have been lost to fraud.</p> <p>And yet, despite increasing public scrutiny, many international NGOs still struggle to acknowledge the problem and invest in coherent, holistic frameworks to reduce it. That means developing deterrence, prevention, detection and response workstreams and a programme of internal cultural development, underpinned by counter-fraud training. We understand the need for structure and method in programming, so why don\u2019t we take the same approach to reducing fraud and corruption?<strong><br></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to answer. Counter-fraud work carries the odour of \u201cadministration costs\u201d, while successfully detecting fraud upsets the public, provokes institutional donors and can give ammunition to our critics. Preventative work is not much more attractive; badly-designed procedures and systems can create bureaucracy that slows delivery. Myths and misconceptions underpin much of this, and when we do dust off the fraud portfolio, our efforts are often underfunded. We\u2019ve all sat through the impenetrable, life-sapping slides of a \u201cfraud workshop\u201d facilitated by whichever finance officer drew the short straw this time.</p> <p>If executed properly, however, with real backing from an organisation\u2019s leaders and proper investment, there are good reasons why a holistic counter-fraud and corruption framework is a great investment for an international NGO.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/25/less-paperwork-bureaucracy-more-aid-in-humanitarian-work\">We need less paperwork and more aid in humanitarian work</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The first is that a managed framework gives us the flexibility we so desperately need. Humanitarian emergencies, for example, rightly require lighter preventative procedures. Lengthy tender processes are hardly appropriate when lives are on the line. But if we take such risks in the context of diligent risk management, with the benefit of proper contingency planning, prior training and later reflective learning, we can do so responsibly and minimise fraud.</p> <p>A second benefit is that it can be a powerful trust-building tool. One of the first things an NGO manager considers when an incident takes place is reputational risk. But it\u2019s a mistake to think about reputation only after a fraud has happened. Proactive counter-fraud frameworks offer a more sustainable way to build and maintain public trust because they not only reduce the likelihood of fraud, but show measurable efforts that our supporters and institutional donors want to see see. We can be open about the risks we face \u2013 institutional donors and the public recognise that we work in difficult and dangerous places \u2013 and move the conversation on to what we do about it.</p> <p>Investing in counter-fraud best practice can generate other programme benefits too. Due diligence, timely auditing, and local implementing partners all help prevent fraud, but they also improve programme quality and reduce waste. Even that most alarming of events \u2013 the fraud investigation \u2013 can be a business improvement tool, helping us to become stronger.</p> <p>Perhaps the most obvious benefit, though, is in the prevention of loss \u2013 but seeing the cost-saving value of a counter-fraud framework requires a degree of organisational maturity. Fraud and corruption hide, and so do their costs. Programmes can appear successful for a long time without seeing how much is being lost. A wise organisation recognises that the value of counter-fraud work, like the lock on a safe, might sometimes be realised only in its absence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/19/uk-needs-stronger-legal-framework-aid-spending\">Why the UK needs a stronger legal framework for aid spending</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end, the only argument against investing in reducing the risk of fraud and corruption is that there isn\u2019t any to reduce \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to find an experienced and competent aid worker who believes that. The way to handle fraud that is most consistent with our values and most respectful of our beneficiaries and donors, is not in pretending it isn\u2019t a problem, but in the energy and effort that goes into our vigilance.

  "<p>An overwhelming majority of the British public polled want new post-Brexit laws protecting wildlife and the countryside to be at least as strong as the EU rules currently in place, <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/yougov-survey-brexit-environment-august-2016-101683.pdf\">according to a opinion poll</a> published on Thursday.</p> <p>Many also want a new farming subsidy regime to emphasise environmental protection more than the EU\u2019s existing Common Agricultural Policy and the vast majority want an EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/high-pesticide-levels-on-oilseed-crops-harm-wild-bees-scientists-prove\">known to harm bees</a> and other pollinators, to remain in place.</p> <p>Much of the protection of British wildlife and the environment stems from EU\u2019s birds and habitat directives, but these will have to be replaced when the UK leaves the bloc. Farming minister George Eustice campaigned for the UK to leave the EU and told the Guardian in May that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice\">these directives were \u201cspirit crushing\u201d</a> and \u201cwould go\u201d.</p> <p>But the national poll, conducted by YouGov for Friends of the Earth, found that support for the same or better environmental protection was high even among those who voted to leave the EU.</p> <p>Overall, 83% of people said Britain should pass new laws providing better (46%) or the same (37%) protection for wild areas and wildlife as current EU laws, with only 4% wanting lower protection. Of those who voted to leave, 46% wanted better protection, 39% the same and 6% less protection. </p> <p>The poll found 88% of people wanted the neonicotinoid ban to stay in place after the UK leaves the EU, with just 5% wanting the ban to be scrapped. The National Farmers Union (NFU) opposes the ban, arguing that it blocks useful protection of oil seed rape crops, but the ministers recently <a href=\"https://www.fginsight.com/news/eustice-rejects-second-nfu-neonicotinoid-emergency-use-application--13413\">rejected an NFU application for an \u201cemergency\u201d lifting</a> of the ban.</p> <p>EU farming subsidies are currently worth \u00a33bn a year to UK farmers and include some schemes for improving the environment. The poll showed 57% of the public want more emphasis (25%) or the same emphasis (32%) on environmental protection. Only 7% of people wanted less emphasis on environmental protection, while 11% said there should be no subsidies at all.</p> <p>Chancellor Philip Hammond said earlier in August that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">existing levels of farm subsidies will be guaranteed</a> until 2020, when there will be a \u201ctransition to new domestic arrangements\u201d.

The <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/news/national-trust-demands-an-end-to-direct-farm-subsidies.htm\">NFU criticised the plan</a>, saying food production is vital.</p> <p>Samuel Lowe, at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis [poll] sends a powerful message to the UK government that EU rules aimed at protecting our natural environment must be maintained or strengthened. The poll completely undermines those who argue that Brexit should lead to a watering down of the UK\u2019s environmental commitments.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe government must also stand up to pressure from the NFU and keep the EU ban on bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticides.

  "<p>A new study measures the loss of ice from one of world\u2019s largest ice sheets. They find an ice loss that has accelerated in the past few years, and their measurements confirm prior estimates.</p> <p>As humans emit heat-trapping gases, we expect to see changes to the Earth. One obvious change to be on the lookout for is melting ice. This includes ice atop mountains, ice floating in cold ocean waters, and the ice within large ice sheets or glaciers. It is this last type of ice loss that most affects ocean levels because as the water runs into the oceans, it raises sea levels. This is in contrast to melting sea ice \u2013 since it is already floating in ocean waters, its potential to raise ocean levels is very small.</p> <p>So measuring ice sheet melting is important, not only as a signal of global warming but also because of the sea level impacts. But how is this melting measured? The ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are huge and scientists need enough measurements in space and time to really understand what\u2019s going on. That is, we need high-resolution and long duration measurements to fully understand trends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459049e38885240e7998381ba17186a1a7845f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459049e38885240e7998381ba17186a1a7845f64/0_0_468_351/468.jpg\" alt=\"Greenland Ice Sheet\" width=\"468\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenland Ice Sheet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Briggs/CPOM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069666/full\">a very recent publication</a> in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, an international team reported on a new high-resolution measurement of Greenland. The lead author, <a href=\"http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/people/m.mcmillan\">Malcolm McMillan</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.cpom.org/\">Centre for Polar Observation and Modeling</a>, and his colleagues mapped Greenland with incredibly high resolution (5 km distances). <br></p> <p>They accomplished this mapping by obtaining data from <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/The_Living_Planet_Programme/Earth_Explorers/CryoSat-2/ESA_s_ice_mission\">the Cryosat 2</a> satellite. This satellite uses a technique called radar altimetry to measure the height of surfaces. It is able to track the elevation of the ice sheets on Greenland with high precision. If the height of the ice sheet is growing, it means the ice is getting thicker. If the heights are decreasing, it means the ice layers are getting thinner.</p> <p>A simplistic view would be that if ice sheets become taller, then they contain more frozen water. If they are shorter, they contain less water. But, this isn\u2019t the entire story. Scientists also have to account for other changes, such as changes to density, surface roughness, and water content. When you realize that the Greenland Ice Sheet is thousands of meters thick, and the top layers include both snow and firn (which later get buried and compressed into ice), it becomes apparent that accounting for the constitution of the ice sheet is important when estimating how much water is being delivered to the ocean.</p> <p>The authors of this study did such an accounting and they discovered that not only is Greenland losing a lot of ice, but the loss varies a lot depending on location and year. For example, 2012 was a year of incredible ice loss compared to other years. Also, the western side of the ice sheet is losing much more ice than the eastern side. They also found that a small part of the ice sheet (less than 1% of the sheet) is responsible for more than 10% of the mass loss. </p> <p>In total, they estimate approximately 270 gigatons of ice loss per year for 2011\u20132014. This result is almost a perfect match to independent measurements made by other researchers and builds our confidence in their conclusions. To put this in perspective, the Greenland Ice Sheet is losing approximately 110 million Olympic size swimming pools worth of water each year. </p> <p>Lead author Malcolm told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Using high resolution satellite data from ESA\u2019s CryoSat-2 mission, we have produced a detailed and comprehensive picture of how Greenland has changed in recent years. In particular, we have been able to map the changing ice sheet in fine detail, and pinpoint where, and when, the greatest ice losses have occurred.</em></p> <p><em> These observations reveal not only the extent of Greenland\u2019s contribution to sea level in recent years but, thanks to their high resolution, allow us to identify the key glaciers that are showing the greatest signs of change. The data also enable us to look at how much ice has been lost in each year and, for example, to quantify the large impact on the ice sheet of the record summertime temperatures occurring in 2012.</em></p> <p><em> Within a wider context, satellite records such as these are crucial for systematically monitoring our climate system, and assessing the impact of rising temperatures across Earth\u2019s polar regions. In particular, they help us to understand the sensitivity of the ice sheet to changes in its surrounding atmosphere and ocean environment, and aid the development of reliable sea level rise projections.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The duration of this study is pretty short (4 years). I will be very interested to see if the mass loss continues at the same rate in following years. If the rate of mass loss increases, it may signify a larger future contribution to sea level from Greenland. This would be bad news for vulnerable coastal cities like Miami and certainly something coastal areas should plan for.</p>",

The 2011 floods that effectively shut down huge swaths of Bangkok also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/29/bangkok-centre-escapes-floods\">crippled the city\u2019s regional airport and deluged major industrial parks</a>, costing billions of dollars in damage and lost revenue.</p> <p>Such situations demonstrate just how much infrastructure can shape disaster risk, says Garschagen. As natural disasters have increased dramatically  and intensity over the past three decades, investment in better logistics and infrastructure systems would not only save lives but also billions of dollars annually. According to <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/files/47804_2015disastertrendsinfographic.pdf\">UN figures</a> [PDF], 346 natural disasters were recorded worldwide last year, killing 22,000 people, affecting another 100 million, and costing $66.5bn (\u00a350bn) in total.</p> <p>The world risk report analyses various data each year in an attempt to rate 171 countries by their disaster risk. This year\u2019s focus was on logistics and infrastructure.</p> <p>A number of developing countries, like Vietnam and Bangladesh, are now looking at designing and implementing disaster-resilient infrastructure systems, says Garschagen, taking into particular account flood patterns over the past few years and projections for the next 20 years. While this is a major step in the right direction, effective law enforcement is also needed, says Garschagen, pointing to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/07/china-earthquake-anniversary-death-toll\">killed thousands of children when school buildings collapsed</a>, effectively because the schools had not been built to code.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c58758c6aec115cd0686ec0305fca47bae91bc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c58758c6aec115cd0686ec0305fca47bae91bc3/0_169_3886_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Partially submerged vehicles are seen stranded in floodwaters at a roundabout in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, in October 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Partially submerged vehicles are seen stranded in floodwaters at a roundabout in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, in October 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to World Bank estimates, additional investments of up to $1.5tn in low- and middle-income countries are needed annually until 2020, simply to establish an \u201cadequate level\u201d of infrastructure.

With dozens more suitable snaps of the 21-year-old available online, the Tele\u2019s editor, Chris Dore, chose to publish on the front page on Thursday a photo of the murder victim scantily clad in long black stockings and underwear. </p> <h2>A bitter pill for ABC supporters</h2> <p>There was an <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-23/concerns-raised-as-australia-plus-partners-with-swisse-wellness/7778488\">immediate outcry this week</a> when the ABC announced it had entered into a commercial partnership with Swisse Wellness, a vitamins and supplements company which pays celebrities, including Nicole Kidman and Sonia Kruger, to spruik its wares. The ABC\u2019s international arm, a multi-platform, international media service called Australia Plus (A+), will now be branded with exclusive Swisse logos on its online platforms, digital and social media channels and Australia Plus TV. The ABC has also signed Monash University and the Victorian state government as partners.</p> <p>Swisse chief executive Radek Sali, who was one of the few people to be thrilled about the arrangement: \u201cOur mission at Swisse is to make people around the world healthier and happier, and through this exciting partnership we will be able to take our message to a number of new regions and audiences,\u201d he said. One of the critics was Dr Ken Harvey, an adjunct associate professor in the department of epidemiology and preventive medicine at Monash University. \u201cSwisse have an unenviable reputation for marketing their products, both in Australia and internationally,\u201d Dr Harvey told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cTheir sales success reflect the large amount of money they spend on marketing hype and the use of celebrities, not on science. Their advertising claims have also been the subject of a number of satirical segments on the ABC Checkout program,\u201d Harvey said. In 2013 a story on the Checkout regarding some of the product claims was the subject of a defamation lawsuit which was eventually settled out of court with both sides paying their own costs. </p> <p>But the ABC has defended the deal, saying ABC International is \u201cexpressly permitted under the ABC Act\u201d to accept advertising and sponsorship. \u201cIt does so in accordance with the ABC Editorial Policies, ensuring that editorial decisions are in no way influenced by any companies, government, universities or other organisations who advertise or provide sponsorship on Australia Plus. Because of that, the existence of sponsors and advertisers on Australia Plus has absolutely no improper impact or influence on ABC editorial content on the Australia Plus platform or anywhere else on the ABC.\u201d</p> <h2>Worth paying for?</h2> <p>Andrew Bolt\u2019s book \u201cBolt: Worth Fighting For\u201d (Wilkinson Publishing, June 2016) is on an international mystery tour, courtesy of Bolt\u2019s fans. Every couple of days the Herald Sun columnist posts a photograph of his book in an exotic location, on a train or in a field of tulips, always urging readers to buy their own copy for just $29.99 via <a href=\"http://www.wilkinsonpublishing.com.au/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=500\">a helpful link</a>. Bolt explains: \u201cMy book is an odyssey, visiting Bath, the skulls of Montpellier, York Minster, Shanghai, Croatia, Ho Chi Minh City, Santorini, London, Lake Como, Ithaca, Scotland, the Bay of Naples, Dubrovnik, Fiji, Aileron, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, the Andes, the Northern Territory, the Whitsundays, Kalgoorlie and Condabri, Queensland, before invading Australia\u2019s most leftwing parliament \u2013 an experience which convinced one reader at the Katharine River Mango Farm to try teaching even a donkey to understand what\u2019s in it. Meanwhile, it attended a christening in Newcastle, checked in at a Penrith hospital and recuperated at the Moreton Bay Boat Club before sailing down the Murray and visiting the Mt Annan Australian Botanical Garden.\u201d Could the endless publicity Bolt has lavished on his tome be because it is selling rather poorly in the bookshops? According to Bookscan figures, Worth Fighting For has sold just 2,665 copies to date. For comparison Niki Savva\u2019s book about former PM Tony Abbott, Road to Ruin, has sold 34,496 copies since it came out in March.</p> <ul> <li>This story was amended on 26 August 2016 to clarify that the ABC, not Swisse, has signed Monash University and the Victorian state government as partners.<br></li> </ul>",

We\u2019d passed security and boarded the flight to Naples, but just as I was about to nod off we were told there was a seating issue and that all three of us would have to follow the air stewardess, who offered no explanation of where we were going. At the top of the stairs leading down to the tarmac there was a sight I\u2019m not likely to forget in a hurry \u2013 a mob of armed police and men in suits waiting for us to meet them.</p> <p>They informed us that a concerned passenger on our flight claimed my sister and I were reading Isis material on our phones in Arabic, with the words \u201cPraise be to God\u201d visible. We vehemently denied all claims. Arabic? There was no Arabic anywhere on our phones. Our family is of Indian origin \u2013 none of us even know how to speak Arabic. They then asked why my sister\u2019s passport showed a stamp from Iraq. Ironically, she had gone there to raise money for victims of Isis.</p> <p>I showed them the timestamps of my WhatsApp conversations to demonstrate how the only thing I had done on my phone that morning was send a message to my dad about how Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies compare to other leftwing leaders. Unless being a lefty is a crime these days, I had committed no offence. We had been humiliated, demonised and our holiday delayed for nothing.</p> <p>As Muslims we understand that extremism \u2013 coupled with a good dose of fear-mongering \u2013 has made people wary, so we take extra precautions at airports so as not to prompt any unwarranted suspicion. I\u2019d ordinarily read a prayer for a safe journey but, being aware of how religion has sadly become synonymous with terror in the eyes of many, I refrained from doing so. My sister had wanted to bring Agatha Christie\u2019s Death on the Nile to read on the plane but I had scoffed imagining the next day\u2019s headline: \u201cMUSLIM WOMAN SEEN BRANDISHING MURDER MANUAL\u201d. No chance, especially after I remembered how a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/faizah-shaheen-reading-book-on-plane-syria-terror-laws-muslims-radicalisation\" title=\"\">woman was recently detained</a> and her reading material, on art and culture in Syria, was treated like it was an Isis handbook.</p> <p>But despite all that consideration and care we still ended up as targets. It\u2019s become apparent that Muslims taking extra care to avoid their behaviour being misconstrued will not stop the bigotry that is rife in our society. Making clear that false accusations are a crime is the first step in tackling the issue of ordinary citizens being vilified, with education to combat ignorance being a close second. If this had happened in any other context, the couple who made the baseless claim against us would be charged with an offence for wasting police time. So why is this prejudice suddenly OK when it\u2019s Muslims who are the targets? Is the next step going to be that we\u2019re treated as second-class citizens, with the scarf on my head giving people licence to tarnish my name with impunity?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/01/muslim-profiling-recipe-insecurity\">Muslim profiling is a recipe for insecurity | Ed Husain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Islamophobia has now become racialised.

The common thread tying the tales of intolerance together seems to be that anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to a standardised appearance is made to feel like a criminal. What happened to us and many others is not a mere misunderstanding or mistake, it\u2019s racism based on profiling.</p> <p>Nobody is denying that Islamic extremism is a global issue that needs to be tackled, but pointing an accusing finger at any woman in a headscarf is a no way of going about it. The only way for society to progress is for the public to be aware that Muslims are exactly the same as everyone else, and that discrimination and suppressing someone\u2019s right to practice their religion without fear of persecution goes against the core democratic values of this country.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s that time of year when Britain is besieged by little green veg. As any kitchen gardener who has ever tenderly bedded in a courgette plant, fondly envisaging a couple of<a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2369639/summer-courgette-and-tomato-gratin\"> gratins</a>, will ruefully attest, they are more prolific than Barbara Cartland, and similarly long-lived. After a couple of weeks of courgettes with everything, even the most committed cucurbitophile might feel the romance turning sour.</p> <p>The solution? Well, you can turn them into<a href=\"http://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/spiced-courgette-chutney/4953.html\"> chutney</a> or<a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/681665/crunchy-courgette-pickle\"> pickle</a>, of course, to keep your relationship alive even when the plants are finally exhausted. You can freak your kids out with a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/16/nigel-slater-courgette\"> courgette cake</a>. Or you can save yourself a lot of time and effort, and turn them into fritters \u2013 because it is scientifically impossible to tire of hot, crisp little cakes, fresh from the frying pan.</p> <p>While they might seem like the easiest thing in the world to put together, as a reader who put forward the idea in the first place has found, there\u2019s an awful lot of sub-standard recipes out there that make a mockery of your homegrown bounty. Courgettes may be easy to grow, but they are not always that easy to cook.</p> <h2>The courgettes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e5576168c96d6639afabb20c208a1bae081c3ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e5576168c96d6639afabb20c208a1bae081c3ad/0_492_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vefa Alexiadou\u2019s fritters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vefa Alexiadou\u2019s fritters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Opinion is divided as to whether the courgettes should be salted to draw out their liquid before use: Janet MacDonald, author of the magnificently specific recipe book Pumpkins and Squashes (sadly the even more niche title Cooking with Courgettes, which I also have in my possession, is silent on the subject of fritters) expressly cautions against this step, on the basis that \u201cyour batter will get diluted before you\u2019ve finished cooking\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2249638/courgette-fritters\">BBC Good Food magazine</a>, food writer <a href=\"http://www.theclerkenwellpost.com/food-drink/386-cook-like-a-clerkenwell-chef-courgette-fritters-with-eggs\">Katy Salter</a> and Greek cookery icon <a href=\"http://ellenbcookery.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/zucchini-fritters-grated-and-awards.html\">Vefa Alexiadou</a> are of the same opinion. In the opposite camp, chef Bill Granger, Deb Perelman of the <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/zucchini-fritters/\">Smitten Kitchen blog</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Martha Rose Shulman of the New York Times</a> all recommend not only salting the grated courgette, but squeezing out the liquid as vigorously as possible before use. Perelman writes: \u201cYou\u2019ll be shocked (I was!) by the amount of liquid you\u2019ll lose, but this is a good thing as it will save the fritters from sogginess.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s certainly possible to make decent courgette fritters without this step, should you be in a tearing hurry, the extra liquid imparts a slightly sloppy quality that requires delicate handling in the pan, and makes them obstinately averse to crisping up. Wring them out, and you will have more solid foundations for your fritters, which means you can use more courgette and less batter \u2013 which has to be a good thing in a dish designed to make the most of them (and use them up). An initial salting, of course, helps to season this undeniably bland vegetable more effectively than doing so after cooking.</p> <p>Perelman also writes that she prefers to use a food processor rather than a grater on her courgettes: \u201cI\u2019m convinced it creates the coarsest and most rope-like strands and frankly, I like my fritters to look like mops.\u201d Unless you\u2019re making a lot, however, I find it creates too much washing up \u2013 and there\u2019s something oddly satisfying about grating something as soft and obliging as a squash.</p> <h2>The batter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06283f18dd1599156bea9a64881343aed77aca5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06283f18dd1599156bea9a64881343aed77aca5d/0_320_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBC Good Food\u2019s fritters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBC Good Food\u2019s fritters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The simplest recipes, from MacDonald and Granger, bind the courgette strands together with a mixture of flour and beaten egg. BBC Good Food makes a wetter, more pancake-like batter with milk as well as eggs, that gives a firm, almost frittata-like result \u2013 pleasant enough, but not as crisp as I would like.</p> <p>Alexiadou\u2019s recipe comes from her book of vegan recipes, Sunny Mediterranean Cuisine, \u201cinspired by the tradition of the <em>Nistia</em> \u2013 the Christian church fast\u201d, and as such, uses water, rather than eggs, which would probably work better for a more stridently flavoured vegetable, but leaves testers reaching for the hot sauce here.</p> <p>Shulman substitutes flour for breadcrumbs to make what she describes as \u201ca Greek version of latkes\u201d \u2013 not bad if you also happen to have a heel in need of using up, but a bit soggy if not \u2013 and Salter swaps it for fine polenta in her book Dairy-Free Delicious, which, as she observes, not only makes them gluten-free, but adds \u201cextra crunch\u201d. They are indeed utterly delicious, though, for the gluten-tolerant among us, I think a mixture of flour and polenta would work even better; hers are quite delicate to manoeuvre, and not only does flour act as a more effective glue, but it will also make the cakes slightly softer inside, as a contrast to the crunchy outer layer.</p> <p>After eating their body weight in fritters, the panel concludes the best are those in which the stands of courgette are just held together with the bare minimum of batter \u2013 too much and they become doughy and heavy.</p> <h2>Raising agent</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c58d4112a2c89346e72b08be11e2347b30a4316b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58d4112a2c89346e72b08be11e2347b30a4316b/0_224_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katy Salter\u2019s fritters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katy Salter\u2019s fritters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You certainly don\u2019t need a raising agent in a fritter \u2013 Shulman, Granger and MacDonald make perfectly good ones without any such thing, but as Perelman, who uses baking powder, enthuses: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how amazing it makes them, how they just lift off the pan when they\u2019re flipped.\u201d It also gives them a fluffier texture.</p> <p>Interestingly, Alexiadou\u2019s fritters are yeast-risen, like little green-flecked crumpets. They\u2019re not fritters as I know them but, with a little fat in the batter, they could be a very tasty alternative.</p> <h2>Flavourings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d13ba2d6c063ef4355af4e3580d8d3b1dd1a23b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d13ba2d6c063ef4355af4e3580d8d3b1dd1a23b6/0_198_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Rose Shulman\u2019s fritters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha Rose Shulman\u2019s fritters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>BBC Good Food keeps its fritters plain, but courgettes are crying out for some help in the flavour department. Not too much, though \u2013 Granger and Shulman\u2019s feta cheese, though it pairs well with the vegetable, is very much the dominant partner in the relationship, which seems a shame unless you\u2019re actively trying to disguise their presence. </p> <p>The same goes for Alexiadou\u2019s dill, Granger\u2019s mint and parsley, and even the basil in MacDonald\u2019s Italian-accented version \u2013 they\u2019re lovely, and this is the kind of blank canvas of a dish that can take any of them, but if you want to taste the courgette go easy on the herbs. A similarly delicate hand is required on the spice rack: Salter uses smoked paprika, and Shulman cumin, but to my mind, the sweeter, gentler spice of MacDonald\u2019s nutmeg is more complementary to the subtle, slightly creamy flavour of the courgette.</p> <p>For exactly the same reason, the greener, fresher flavour of spring onion is a better match for a summer squash than MacDonald\u2019s more pungent shallot. Like Salter\u2019s fresh chilli, I think it would be best saved for the accompanying dip, though, truth be told, I could, and do, eat these on their own, hot from the pan. After a week of wall-to-wall courgette, that\u2019s quite some boast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1daf4f35227a9556348436210d9b46435b529ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1daf4f35227a9556348436210d9b46435b529ad/0_547_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Granger\u2019s fritters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Granger\u2019s fritters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Perfect courgette fritters</strong></h2> <p><em>(Makes 10)<br></em><strong>500g courgettes<br></strong><strong>\u00bd</strong><strong> tsp sea salt<br></strong><strong>40g plain flour<br></strong><strong>\u00bd</strong><strong> tsp baking powder<br></strong><strong>20g fine polenta or cornmeal<br></strong><strong>4 spring onions, finely chopped<br></strong><strong>2 eggs, beaten<br></strong><strong>Grating of nutmeg<br></strong><strong>Optional: 15g fresh herbs, chopped (I like dill), and 100g crumbled feta<br></strong><strong>Oil, to cook</strong></p> <p>Coarsely grate the courgettes into a colander and toss with the salt.

But world fame has not been achieved without its hiccups. The Oxford English Dictionary debated the matter for years before accepting an entry which described it as a sponge biscuit with an orange-flavoured jelly filling and chocolate topping. McVitie\u2019s had to go to court to defend the identity of the Jaffa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cake\">Cake</a> as a cake and not a biscuit. It even produced a 12-inch cake to support its claim that, as a cake, it is soft when fresh and turns hard when stale. When the tribunal chairman ruled in favour of the cake definition, the VAT man was left biting his nails, as no VAT can be charged on cakes. Whoever makes it, the combination of bitter chocolate, sweet orange and a neutral sponge cake, dunked in a cup of tea, is a winner in any culture. Recipes like this should not be regarded as lost to these shores, but spread around the globe.</p>",

Here are some earlier shows that did just that.</p> <h2><strong>1 The Big Bang Theory</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5617431aa0da71bf03596894530a2ba823126b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5617431aa0da71bf03596894530a2ba823126b8/0_134_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Big Bang Theory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs far as junk like this goes,\u201d wrote the Chicago Sun-Times\u2019s critic, \u201cit\u2019s not heinous and has moments of OK-ness.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just the same joke endlessly repeated \u2013 the everyday translated into geek-speak,\u201d argued the LA Times critic, \u201cand the obscure and difficult treated as if it were common knowledge.\u201d Seven years after these reviews appeared, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/oct/07/the-big-bang-theory-critics-fans\">The Big Bang Theory</a>, about brainiac flatmates who know a great deal about subatomic particles but much, much less about how human relationships work, became the most popular show on US TV with 23.1 million viewers, and a global hit.

  "<p>The literary calendar is marked by big public events: writers\u2019 festivals, book fairs, and the announcements first of shortlists and then of winners of major awards. For Australian writers and readers, the Miles Franklin is a lodestone, our Big Award, the one that celebrates not just writing, not just fiction, but particularly and peculiarly Australian writing. Since 2013 it has been accompanied by the second literary award to be named for Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/19/charlotte-woods-the-natural-way-of-things-wins-50000-stella-prize\">the Stella prize</a>, established to recognise women\u2019s contribution to Australian literature. </p> <p>This year, it seems to me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/29/women-and-melbourne-writers-dominate-miles-franklin-2016-shortlist\">the Miles Franklin shortlist</a> entirely honours the founder of the award, not only because four of the five novelists are women, but also because each of the novels, in its own idiosyncratic and nuanced way, reflects and represents Australian life, presenting as that \u201cindigenous literature\u201d (Franklin\u2019s term) that prevents people from being \u201calien in their own soil\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/29/women-and-melbourne-writers-dominate-miles-franklin-2016-shortlist\">Women and Melbourne writers dominate Miles Franklin 2016 shortlist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novels do not, though, offer a comfortable or consoling rendition of Australian life. If anything, they turn their lenses on alienation, and on the weight of the ordinary occasions of everyday life, as well as the larger scale complexities \u2013 of, say, the sociopolitical landscape \u2013 that bear down on individuals. </p> <p>This makes them sound a bit \u201cworthy\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d, novels that take as their task the imperative to instruct readers about The Human Condition. But in fact each is remarkably readable; each writer has a wonderful sense of story and its elements: character, pacing, setting and, yes, even plot. Any would be a worthy recipient of this prestigious award. Let me tiptoe through them in alphabetical order.</p> <h2>Hope Farm by Peggy Frew</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5ccff9fc5f55469a05ae1f194b3035a5919bc8cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ccff9fc5f55469a05ae1f194b3035a5919bc8cc/0_0_1594_2480/643.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Frew\u2019s Hope Farm.\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Peggy Frew\u2019s Hope Farm is set in 1985 Gippsland, and narrated by Silver, daughter of Ishtar who \u2013 as a pregnant teenager \u2013 fled the petit bourgeois morality of 1970s Queensland that would have forcibly removed her baby from her, for the uncertain support of a local ashram. </p> <p>The story unfolds on the ironically misnamed Hope Farm, a communal property occupied mainly by feckless incompetents. Ishtar and Silver may be misfits, but they are neither feckless nor incompetent; and their arrival, along with that of Ishtar\u2019s new man, Miller, initiates an unravelling of that decaying place, that compromised community. </p> <p>There are the expected conflicts \u2013 children v adults; bullies v bullied; male v female; parent v child \u2013 but they are delivered with a clarity and tenderness that takes readers beyond the surface impression of, say, snotty child or slovenly adult, to the fullness, the complexity, of any individual or group of individuals. </p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying \u201credemption\u201d in relation to this novel \u2013 and indeed this is not a redemptive story in the classical sense \u2013 but it does offer a stage on which Silver, her equally misplaced friend Ian and her shining glorious damaged mother Ishtar can begin to feel their way beyond mere survival, and toward a more endurable life.</p> <h2>Leap by Myfanwy Jones</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"187740104d346a5dfec680ca344abad99c3d0cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/187740104d346a5dfec680ca344abad99c3d0cfc/0_0_1807_2457/735.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Myfanwy Jones\u2019 Leap\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With Leap Myfanwy Jones has crafted a lyrical account of mourning, and the long, lonely, difficult work of building sufficient scar tissue over the wounds of bereavement to allow mourners the possibility of moving on. Much of this work is couched in terms of physical being: the parkour through which Joe, muted by the death of his girlfriend Jen, is feeling his way back into the world; or the stillness, the compulsive observation, that Jen\u2019s mother, Elsie, uses as her connection to memories of her daughter, to the idea of being alive. </p> <p>Cats are important metaphors in this novel: the cat leap that Joe is learning to perform; the tigers that have captured Elsie\u2019s imagination; the \u201ccatlike containment\u201d of the mysterious nurse who moves into the spare room in Joe\u2019s share house; Jen\u2019s intention to have tiger stripes tattooed on her leg. Cats as a way of thinking about being: it worked for me. </p> <p>The novel is moving; the language poetic; the morphology of grief very believable.</p> <h2>Black Rock White City by AS Patric</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b5cb737fb12fa9ffb8d7557068abd7e0e137f2a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5cb737fb12fa9ffb8d7557068abd7e0e137f2a5/0_0_2336_3584/652.jpg\" alt=\"AS Patric\u2019s Black Rock White City.\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With Black Rock White City we are again in the company of grief: loss, bereavement, trauma. Of the central characters, AS Patric\u2019s narrator says, \u201cNeither of them is sure about the present but this is some sort of afterlife.\u201d Jovan and Suzana, refugees from the war in Sarajevo, have left their lives behind, along with the bodies of their little children: \u201cTheir names were Dejan and Ana. And there\u2019s nothing more that can be said about the dead that doesn\u2019t make them small, lost and forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>They are living now in the sort of afterlife you find in mythology: grey, and sad, and haunted by the shades of all they have lost. Even Jovan\u2019s name has been lost in this new country (\u201cJo \u2026 Ja \u2026 Joh-von. Ja-Va. Ah fuck it, we\u2019ll call you Joe.\u201d But of course we never entirely lose or escape our past. The idea of war has come with them. Dr Graffito, who defaces the walls of the hospital with violent phrases, is a metaphor as well as an actuality of violence and death. </p> <p>But Patric does not leave Suzana and Jovan there; slowly, tenderly, they begin to emerge into this new country and all its possibilities.</p> <h2>Salt Creek by Lucy Treloar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"49d8d63772b6a2b4561388629009343228acb086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49d8d63772b6a2b4561388629009343228acb086/0_0_1600_2421/661.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Lucy Treloar\u2019s Salt Creek.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lucy Treloar\u2019s Salt Creek treads the sort of ground broken a few years ago by Kate Grenville and her Secret River. Set in the Coorong in South Australia and peopled by the Finches \u2013 a large and ever-expanding family whose father cannot find the balance between ideal and action \u2013 it\u2019s narrated by Hester, the eldest daughter and the one who is required to provide the through line for the family, including cooking and cleaning and supporting her depressed mother and caring for the little children. </p> <p>What I found compelling was not the story of Hester\u2019s endurance, but rather the way Treloar depicts the relationship between the local people and the Finches: the stupidity and carelessness, the casual brutality with which the settlers treat the Indigenous owners of land to which they have laid claim; and the way some of the Finch children begin to connect, however inadequately, with some of the local people. One of the rare sunny spots in the novel is provided by Tully, a local youth, who is adored both by Addie, Hester\u2019s lighthearted sister, and Fred, her artist brother. And yes, it ends in tears.</p> <p>Indeed, this particular colonial adventure generally ends in betrayal, brokenness and disappointment; but to say this so bluntly is to ignore the beauty of the language, the lightness with which the historical context is carried by the story, and the vivid presence of the physical environment, which is as fully realised as are the central characters.</p> <h2>The Natural Way of Things by Charlotte Wood</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"128979debe8bb38bed479ebf6104289d9dbbbcf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/128979debe8bb38bed479ebf6104289d9dbbbcf4/0_0_1807_2456/736.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Charlotte Wood\u2019s The Natural Way of Things.\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/19/charlotte-woods-the-natural-way-of-things-wins-50000-stella-prize\">Charlotte Wood\u2019s The Natural Way of Things</a> in equal parts captivated and appalled me. Built out of the actuality of the Hay institution for girls, an institution established for the punitive constraint of adolescent \u201coffenders\u201d, this novel operates as a dystopic fable of the control of women and women\u2019s sexuality. The 10 young women who suffer \u201cthe natural way of things\u201d have all been the subjects of very public sexual scandals. They have been kidnapped and enslaved and brutalised by the agents of a vaguely identified corporation, Harding International. </p> <p>Their heads shaved, their clothes exchanged for heavy boots and rough dresses and their eyes and arms under constraints, the women find themselves \u201cabducted right into the middle of the nineteen fucking fifties\u201d. The necessarily \u201cbald and frightened girls\u201d and their dull abusive captors gradually adapt to this bizarre life, in a Waiting for Godot situation where day after day Harding International fails to arrive. But how does anyone adapt to the impossible: to authorised misogyny, to absent rights? They don\u2019t, of course; they simply find ways to accommodate themselves to it. </p> <p>In those accommodations we see the crippling of selves; the ambiguous comfort of friendship; the giving over of personal values for tiny physical ease. While there are fleeting gestures towards a sense of sisterhood, only two characters really come out of it with any honour: Yolanda, betrayed by her beloved brother, named \u201clunatic\u201d, but able to hunt and kill, and thus keep everyone alive for a time; and Verla, who is able to use her brain, and thus to some extent keep them comparatively functional. It is gruelling to read, shattering. It is important.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Novels build in their readers a capacity for empathy, we are told. These five novels do precisely that, and besides are lovely to read \u2013 each writer has a feeling for sentences and phrases, and has built in such narrative traction that I read them at a gulp, emerging only at the end, blinking, before returning to the everyday. These novels are scored through by sensitivity, clarity, and a ruthless generosity of voice, and feel their way into character, into ethical complexities, and into the small and large ways our society creaks on. </p> <p><em>\u2022 This article is co-published with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/touching-ferocious-and-poetic-the-miles-franklin-shortlist-is-worthy-of-your-attention-64428\">The Conversation</a>.

We not only advertise our Pok\u00e9Stop status and the number of Pok\u00e9mon on site, but also run a series of events for families to learn about technology, while playing the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4513409bf19d06938325e0e3cead234f92b41219\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4513409bf19d06938325e0e3cead234f92b41219/0_133_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young girl sitting in library holds up phone displaying Pokemon Go game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One library visitor celebrates bagging a new Gastly Pok\u00e9mon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Reguera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I came up with the idea after reading about a priest in Spain who was pleased the app was bringing more people to his church. I thought if Pok\u00e9mon could bring more people to a church, it could be a great way for me to bring more people to the library.</p> <p>So I started tweeting that we were a Pok\u00e9Stop and took pictures of the Pok\u00e9mon I found among the books to encourage people to visit. A lot of the young people who come to the library to play the game don\u2019t come here normally, especially the teenagers.</p> <p>We have targeted families because we know that Pok\u00e9mon Go appeals to all generations. The events, held weekly, include advice on privacy issues and online security, and are a chance for me to publicise our free Wi-Fi facility, computers, e-books and e-magazines.</p> <p>It\u2019s been popular. Eight people came to the first session, but word of mouth meant that increased to 21 the following week, and we\u2019ll continue to run them if the demand is still there once the schools go back in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/InIlford/status/757553240955289601\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pokemon?src=hash\">#Pokemon</a> love <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedbridgeLibs\">@RedbridgeLibs</a>!

The children call out when they discover a new Pok\u00e9mon or manage to catch one, but I think anybody who uses local libraries knows they are multi-purpose now. While they are still perfect for quiet studying or reading, they are also spaces full of energy and creativity. Most people just laugh when they see what we are up to, and then continue with whatever they were doing.</p> <p>It\u2019s important for libraries to embrace new technology and media and to teach the public to do that, too. More of Redbridge council\u2019s services are moving online, and having a good grasp of technology means that local residents will feel confident about accessing information online.</p> <p>Our efforts in this area \u2013 and my role for Vision RCL (Redbridge culture and libraries), which focuses on digital services and innovation \u2013 means we are now where people can learn about technology and digital media, in a non-threatening environment.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to think beyond the walls of the library. I always keep it in the back of my mind, looking for what\u2019s on trend, motivating people, or getting them talking. We should also be asking for feedback from our users \u2013 I always ask parents and children attending my events for ideas and suggestions. Even if it\u2019s not feasible right now, it might be one day, so keep a folder for ideas, and hold on to even the craziest.</p> <p><em>Maria Reguera is library development officer at Redbridge central library.</em></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Central bank governors are gathering at the fishing resort of Jackson Hole in Wyoming to discuss how they can dig themselves out of the monetary hole caused by the 2008 financial crash.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">central banks have cut interest rates</a> to zero and beyond, they have pumped trillions of dollars into the global financial system and devised novel ways to make sure most of the money is used to cut the cost of credit to ordinary consumers and businesses.</p> <p>The aim has been to boost growth and jobs at a time when governments of all colours have refused to ditch their austerity programmes and support productivity enhancing investment.</p> <p>Before the conference, deputy US Federal Reserve governor, Stanley Fischer, said monetary policy was not equipped to boost productivity growth. But governments have ignored the pleas of central bankers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/what-central-bankers-really-want-read-janet-yellens-mind\">leaving Fed boss Janet Yellen</a>, the Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney, Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and Haruhiko Kuroda at the Bank of Japan to carry the burden.<br></p> <p>In Jackson Hole, Yellen, Carney\u2019s deputy Nemat Shafik and many others will debate how to piece back together the monetary system so it bears some resemblance to the one that existed before the crash. Under the title Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, attendees will discuss the hurdles they must leap before they can achieve their stated aim. These include:</p> <h2>Markets addicted to low rates</h2> <p>Financial markets sank like a stone in the summer of 2013 when the Fed, believing the world had recovered from the Greek crisis the year before, hinted that it would begin to tighten monetary policy. The so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d revealed that several major economies, including Turkey and Brazil, were still addicted to cheap debt after borrowing heavily in the US currency. They faced crippling interest bills if dollar interest rates went up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/what-central-bankers-really-want-read-janet-yellens-mind\">What do central bankers really want? To read Janet Yellen's mind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year the Fed was poised to try again but this was scuppered after the Chinese authorities bungled a depreciation of the yuan, triggering a stock market plunge. Such was the severity of the market reaction, the Fed only managed a 0.25% rise in December. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/fischer-signals-2016-rate-hike-with-economy-nearing-fed-goals\">Fischer said 2016 was fertile ground for another rise</a>, possibly in September, but the huge volume of borrowing by governments and private corporations, especially among the emerging markets, Brexit, and the slowing US economy continues to make the Fed wary.</p> <h2>Negative interest rates</h2> <p>Kuroda recently said he would not rule out a \u201cdeepening cut\u201d to the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/negative-interest-rates\">negative interest rates</a>. Draghi has followed the Japanese into negative territory, dragging the Swedish, Danish and Swiss national banks with him. </p> <p>Negative rates mean that commercial banks must pay to keep their funds on deposit with a central bank. The policy aims to encourage commercial banks to do other things with the money \u2013 lend it or invest it in riskier assets.<br></p> <p>But the effect has been to squeeze the gap between lending and borrowing rates, hitting bank profits. Even the Bank of England\u2019s recent interest rate cut to 0.25% is expected to hit the profits of high street lenders.</p> <p>Carney has vowed to avoid negative interest rates for just this reason and alongside the base rate cut to 0.25%, he set aside \u00a3100bn of cheap loans for the banks with the express aim of maintaining their profit margins.</p> <h2>Stagnant eurozone</h2> <p>Draghi is expected to release further funds later this year to boost lacklustre growth in the eurozone. The 19-member currency zone is trundling along with GDP growth just above 1% but this anaemic rate of expansion is unlikely to improve the dire jobs situation across much of the continent or push inflation closer to the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target.</p> <p>Central bankers worry that for all Draghi\u2019s optimism, Europe is going to be on monetary life support for a generation, as the the wealthy baby boomers of Germany, France and Italy stash their savings rather than spend it. For every euro the boomers stash away or invest in property, the central bank will need to print two just for the economy to inch ahead.<br></p> <p>The latest figures show France beginning to recover and generate some private sector growth but with several countries still in recession and Greece ready to erupt at any time, the eurozone remains a a long-term problem</p> <h2>Fragile emerging markets</h2> <p>Brazil and Turkey are case studies in how strong emerging market economies can flip into recession, undermining the confidence among global investors that the recovery from 2008 is nearing completion.</p> <p>Brazil suffered from the knock-on effects of a slowdown in China, along with a string of domestic scandals, while Turkey found its corporate sector facing extra credit costs following its heavy borrowing in dollars. Both economies were roaring in 2013 at a time when the west was struggling, propping up global growth. Within a couple of years they were in recession while Russia and China\u2019s growth rate had slumped, leaving central banks to delay any return to normality.</p> <h2>Currency wars</h2> <p>Some central banks are frank about their determination to make exports more competitive by driving down the value of the local currency. Japan is a case in point. Kuroda was appointed by prime minister Shinzo Abe to fire two of the three arrows designed to rescue a stagnant economy \u2013 a cut in the cost of credit and a lower yen. A recent rise in the yen against the pound, the yuan and euro is likely to bring further monetary easing this year.</p> <p>Draghi, despite his denials, has embarked on the same mission at the ECB. Almost all the rise in Italian and French exports in the last couple of years can be attributed to a cheaper euro. In London the lower value of the pound was widely seen as a positive post-Brexit benefit, not least by the Bank of England.</p> <p>China has followed the same policy over the last year, sometimes clumsily, at other times without the world taking much notice. </p> <p>For all of them the target is the same: the US. They want to drive down the value of their currency to compete with American businesses, which have enjoyed a stellar recovery riding on the back of a cheap dollar. The fear is that a rise in US interest rates and the value of the dollar is not a step towards normality but a shock that will upset the applecart again.</p>",
  "<p>Omar\u2019s home for the last six months has been a makeshift wooden hut in the Calais \u201cJungle\u201d refugee camp, where the teenager sleeps alone under piles of donated blankets.</p> <p>But unlike many of the thousands of refugees living in the tents and containers next to the bypass, the Syrian teenager has a home waiting for him in the UK. </p> <p>Omar has been approved by the Home Office to cross to the UK, under the Dublin regulation, which will give the shy 17-year-old the right to join his uncle and cousin in north-west London. And yet he is still living in the makeshift refugee camp, with no way of knowing when he will be able to leave. He has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/peer-condemns-shocking-delays-over-help-for-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">waiting for his transfer to the UK</a> for almost two months. </p> <p>Volunteers working in the camp say <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/conditions-for-unaccompanied-children-in-calais-camp-worsening-says-report\">violence is increasing</a> as its population increases with the good weather, meaning more people are attempting the journey. Omar (not his real name) said he does not tell his family in Syria about the dangers he faces each night. \u201cI could not tell them, no. They would be too scared for me,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">Hungry, scared, and no closer to safety: child refugees failed by Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For now, when the atmosphere in the camp turns tense, Omar said he stays shut in his cabin or heads for the main road to stand under the bridge on the outskirts of the camp, out of the melee.</p> <p>Omar is one of many refugee children in the camp caught up in bureaucratic delays. He applied in March and the Home Office approved his \u201ctake charge request\u201d in June. Every day he waits for the call telling him it is his day to be transferred to the UK.</p> <p>The Home Office is under increasing pressure to speed up the process of bringing children who have the right to be in the UK across the Channel, with human rights groups claiming children are being left at risk of violence and exploitation in the camp. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper wrote to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, last week, and said the Home Office was given details last month of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/child-refugees-in-limbo-in-calais-because-of-home-office-delays\">110 children and teenagers</a> still in Calais who have Dublin rights to be reunited with their families in the UK. No action had yet been taken on their cases, Cooper said. At the current rate of progress it would take over a year to reunite every child with their family. </p> <p>An additional 200 <a href=\"http://Channel\">children in the camps in Calais</a> are eligible for sanctuary in Britain under the Dubs amendment to bring child refugees to the UK, brought about by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/16/pressure-grows-on-theresa-may-to-admit-3000-lone-refugee-children-to-uk\">Labour peer Alf Dubs</a>, formerly a child refugee himself. It commits the government to relocate lone child refugees in Europe \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Though ministers promised around 3,000 would be brought to Britain, around a tenth of that number have arrived so far.</p> <p>Visiting the camp on Tuesday with Save the Children and two Conservative MPs, Heidi Allen and David Burrowes, Cooper said the delay in Omar\u2019s case and others was hard to understand. All three said they would seek a meeting with Rudd in order to press for a Home Office official to be based in Calais, though one has now been seconded to the Dublin Unit at France\u2019s interior ministry in Paris.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b84ded099f55f57329724f77bd72df0e7df33f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b84ded099f55f57329724f77bd72df0e7df33f41/0_127_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of the container camp at the Calais refugee camp, where many unaccompanied children live.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of the container camp at the Calais refugee camp, where many unaccompanied children live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For now, Omar is in limbo. All the paperwork is in order and yet he has been waiting for more than six weeks with no word of when he will finally cross safely to the UK. He has heard stories about Willesden, the suburb where he will eventually live. </p> <p>\u201cThey told me it\u2019s so beautiful, you can\u2019t imagine,\u201d he said. Burrowes, MP for the neighbouring Enfield Southgate, smiled but agreed. \u201cIt is beautiful because of the freedom it brings, the safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is beautiful in that sense. The opportunity it brings.\u201d</p> <p>The camp is on edge when the MPs visit after a disturbing late night fight between two parts of the camp. Volunteers warn that many of the children at the youth centre are in need of special care and attention after the violence.</p> <p>While Omar waits in the camp, each day brings a new risk. \u201cEverything is bad here, there is a lot of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no law in the Jungle, and there are a lot of people looking just to take advantage of the situation.\u201d </p> <p>Walking back to his cabin one evening, he came across a fight between Sudanese and Afghan refugees. \u201cReally it was a big fight, 600 people, throwing rocks at each other.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/they-are-falling-apart-the-fate-of-lone-children-in-calais-refugee-camp\">'They are falling apart': the fate of lone children in Calais' refugee camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One missile caught him in the eye and his face is still scarred. No ambulance would come to the camp, he said, so he had to walk to the underpass where he waited half an hour for medical help.</p> <p>Laura Griffiths, the senior field manager for Safe Passage, who are handling Omar\u2019s case, said it was important to keep reminding authorities that the delays left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/they-are-falling-apart-the-fate-of-lone-children-in-calais-refugee-camp\">children not just in limbo but at risk</a>. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting here in danger,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Others waiting for their transfer include Ahmed, a 13-year-old with learning difficulties who has been given special dispensation to go to the UK along with his father, because of the demands of his disability. Few of Omar\u2019s friends are left in the camp and he sleeps alone in the container, decorated with woollen rugs and posters with English language quotes. One says: \u201cI love Syria, more than my life\u201d and he said he was hopeful he would return there. </p> <p>For now, he is keen to ask the MPs what they can do to help. \u201cI just have one question, what am I waiting for?\u201d he asks. There is no answer, other than paperwork.</p> <p>The Syrian community has shrunk to around 50 of the 8,000 people living in the camp. Volunteers say though the system is slow, there are now official routes in place to help Syrians claim asylum in France or help children reach families in the UK. </p> <p>Around 30 Syrian boys have been reunited with their families in the UK, through the work of Safe Passage. But for others, no such systems exist. Volunteers are particularly worried about unaccompanied young girls, mostly from Eritrea, whose numbers are growing, with up to 50 now in the camp. </p> <p>Were they to decide to claim asylum in France and move to the official housing, only six beds for young women are on offer and volunteers say many young asylum seekers of either sex are regularly turned away, despite being actively encouraged to claim asylum in France. </p> <p>Johnny Willis, a volunteer co-ordinator with Help Refugees who runs the camp\u2019s brightly painted youth centre, said he had had 10 asylum seekers turned away by the authorities in one day. </p> <p>\u201cStaying in France is the only safe thing we can really recommend. And they are wasting their youths here, this really talented bunch of kids, they have so much to offer and it is just painful to watch them here for months on end. But they say, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll stay in France\u2019, we make the phone call and get told there is no space.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s a very, very hard thing.\u201d</p> <p>The remarks are the strongest evidence yet that Trump is softening his previous stance on illegal immigration, after a meeting with Latino Republicans over the weekend led multiple outlets to report that Trump had vowed to move beyond his pledge to deport all undocumented immigrants from the country, as well as US citizens born to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign threw cold water on those reports at the time. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said on Saturday: \u201cTrump said nothing today that he hasn\u2019t said many times before, including in his convention speech \u2013 enforce our immigration laws, uphold the constitution and be fair and humane while putting American workers first.\u201d</p> <p>Since fall of last year, Trump vowed to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to eject undocumented migrants from the US, but campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, a new addition to the campaign after a leadership shakeup earlier this month, waffled on whether the candidate still embraced that idea on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks unfold, as the weeks unfold, he will lay out the specifics of that plan that he would implement as president of the United States,\u201d Conway told CNN. Asked about whether those specifics included a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d Conway replied: \u201cTo be determined.\u201d</p> <p>John Weaver, former senior strategist for the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, told the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs that Trump\u2019s newfound openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants reads highly familiar - despite Trump decrying the position as tantamount to amnesty during the Republican presidential primaries.</p> <p>\u201cHe has jack rabbit trailed his way to John Kasich\u2019s correct view on immigration,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut, alas it won\u2019t last.

It was a far cry from the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d philosophy which guided the nominee\u2019s first campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and it was far more effective than efforts of replacement Paul Manafort to rein the outspoken real estate developer. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">expressed a statement of regret</a> last week in North Carolina, the closest he has ever come to an apology for his multitude of controversial remarks in the course of his campaign.</p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s remarks Wednesday were classic unscripted statements from the candidate. He stoked controversy by hinting at unfounded rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health when he apparently misspoke that his Democratic rival was \u201cpremedicated\u201d in lieu of saying \u201cpremeditated\u201d as was in his prepared remarks. Trump dwelled on the phrase and suggested that he liked \u201cpremedicated\u201d better. It was a return to form for the Republican nominee and one that was received to cheers from his supportive crowd. The question as Trump moves forward with yet another reinvented campaign team is whether this was a brief lapse in style or if it simply further evidence that no operative can tame the bombastic populist on the stump.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0c60e4b0fe30498a473f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T21:11:28.665Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of Donald Trump\u2019s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in office during a \u201cMoms 4 Trump\u201d event in Loudoun County, Virginia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHow many of you would wear a wool coat in August?\u201d John Jaggers asked the a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432\">according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror</a>. \u201cThe woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States wears a wool coat at every single thing.

Ten days later Fema had become shorthand for incompetence and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/09/hurricanekatrina.usa3\">Brown was forced to quit</a>, a setback from which Bush\u2019s standing never fully recovered.</p> <p>On Tuesday Obama toured flood-ravaged southern Louisiana and singled out the current administrator of Fema, <a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/william-craig-fugate\">Craig Fugate</a>, \u201cas somebody who I can\u2019t brag enough about, one of the best hires I made as president\u201d, crediting him with professionalising the organisation and turning it around.</p> <p>The president also shrugged off political criticism over his own response to the tragedy, which struck while he was on holiday last week, killing at least 13 people in the region and displacing thousands. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-louisiana-floods-supplies\">visited Baton Rouge last Friday</a>, handing out water and diapers.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I don\u2019t worry too much about politics,\u201d said Obama, wearing a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves and an unbuttoned collar, standing in front of piles of waterlogged debris. \u201cThe second thing I have seen historically is that, when disasters strike, that\u2019s probably one of the few times when Washington tends not to get political.</p> <p>\u201cI guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican. What they care about is making sure they\u2019re getting the drywall out and the carpet out, there\u2019s not any mould building, they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible.

Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">I'm a doctor.

We often sat within her line of sight and sometimes when she wasn\u2019t tired, she would lift her hand in blessing. She didn\u2019t have any last-minute advice for us neither did she say goodbye. She never cried and she never complained. In fact, she barely spoke but she smiled when possible. The kind of quiet, contented smile that said she was at peace with life even though she was dying far too young. I remember thinking how much she loved her grandchildren \u2013 the feeling was so powerful and visceral that it never struck me there could be suffering behind it.</p> <p>But my grandmother\u2019s skin had turned bright yellow and explanations were called for.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is she yellow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey say it\u2019s jaundice,\u201d the adults replied.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does she have a drip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor ordered it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is she sleepy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs she hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, can we have the egg curry?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was through incidental observations that as children we became witness to life drawing to a close.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were no doctors in our family and there was no sophisticated understanding of the process of illness and dying. Since the adults didn\u2019t know much, there were no customised, careful explanations for the children. In fact, as loss stared us in the face, there was very little to say. But what we lacked in words we made up for in another way \u2013 we stuck together to observe the ritual of dying. </p> <p>Alongside our parents, we watched our beloved grandmother sleep, awake, groan and smile. We watched her totter to the bathroom and then confined to her bed. We watched her eat half her food and then none at all. We learnt to scrutinise the doctors\u2019 expressions and understand that our sorrow wasn\u2019t their fault. We saw how hard the nurses worked and came to fill in their gaps without rancour.</p> <p>Thus it was through incidental observations that as children we became witness to life drawing to a close. It was a gradual and real schooling so that when our grandmother finally died, we were sad but neither inconsolable nor traumatised. Years later, as grown-ups, we find ourselves helping our own children navigate illness and loss \u2013 as the cycle continues, we summon our own memories about the importance of just having been at the bedside.</p> <p>I found myself thinking of all this when I looked after an elderly patient who came for an elective procedure which went horribly wrong. As organ after organ failed, my patient retained an uncommon spirit of optimism, expressing hope that he would get home to see his grandchildren whom he greatly missed.</p> <p>In the week he became irretrievably ill, his daughter came up to me, wringing her hands.</p> <p>\u201cWhat should I do about the kids?\u201d</p> <p>I waited, sensing there was more. As it turned out, her children, 8 and 13, had not been in at all. She had protected them from his temporary problems and when his condition took another downturn, she was grateful that they were occupied at school. She maintained an anxious vigil over him but kept hoping for a day to come when her father was well enough to greet his grandchildren like his old self.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d I gently asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat they\u2019ll have lifelong nightmares. Isn\u2019t it better if they remember him being well?\u201d</p> <p>I felt a stab of regret. It\u2019s true that her father looked pale and gaunt but the warmth in his eyes was unmistakeable. And he could still speak, telling me he didn\u2019t have long and thanking me for my care. He didn\u2019t want to burden his daughter but I longed to fulfil his final desire without compounding her dilemma.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you do if you were me?\u201d she tearfully asked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>GPs report meeting adults ... who fall apart when a parent falls ill because they have never encountered illness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There, she had asked the question I had dreaded. I believed that although there had been better opportunities, a visit to their grandfather\u2019s bedside would still be meaningful and provide an opening to a later unavoidable conversation with the children about illness and mortality. I thought the children were old enough to be left confused by the turn of events and wondered what views they might form of what happened in a hospital. I feared that their mother, coping with bereavement, might struggle to find reasonable explanations later. And I fretted that the emerging disagreement in the family over the children would test adult relationships. So I told her sincerely, \u201cI would find it heartbreaking but I\u2019d try to bring them in.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to children visiting sick or dying relatives in hospital, every family decides differently. Granted, hospitals aren\u2019t designed for the ease of young (or old) visitors. There is a maddening lack of space, chair and amenities and visitors can feel conscious of getting in the way. It\u2019s unlikely that these deficiencies will disappear anytime soon though people do find their way around them.</p> <p>Studies show that childhood bereavement alone is unlikely to be related to adult outcomes. Rather, factors such as parental support, open communication, age-appropriate explanation and the presence of other adverse social and psychological events may have more impact than the fact of the death. </p> <p>In hospitals and nursing homes, there is a stark lack of young visitors to the bedsides of their elderly relatives. When children do visit, they are nearly always parked on a device, making real engagement impossible. We seem happy to let our children Google illness, just not let them near it. But making illness and mortality invisible to our children has unexpected consequences. GPs report meeting adults in their 40s who fall apart when a parent falls ill because they have never encountered illness up close and don\u2019t know how to deal with their own emotions, let alone their children\u2019s.</p> <p>There is an epidemic of loneliness among our elderly population as they trudge from residential care to hospital and back again. For staff, the loneliness is in plain sight \u2013 every doctor has met a patient who begs to stay an extra day because \u201cit\u2019s nice here, people talk to me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/what-its-like-to-survive-cancer-by-those-who-have-been-given-the-all-clear\">What it's like to survive cancer, by those who have done it | Guardian readers and Sarah Marsh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Addressing loneliness is hard when there are a dozen other priorities even though a visit from a loved one is worth a dozen pills. And the comfort of strangers is no match for the consolation of family, so every day we convince and cajole relatives to visit, until it becomes a job as routine as checking bloods.</p> <p>Patients cheer up when anyone visits but when children come they have an unfailing effect on lifting the mood and alleviating the loneliness of patients. Occasionally, I\u2019ve needed to take one of my children on a weekend ward-round and felt bad about it. But my misgivings have melted at the sheer delight of patients. Nothing banishes the dreariness of being in hospital than an innocent banter with a child. The food tastes nicer, the pain seems bearable and life itself seems more hopeful. Indeed, children inject a kind of optimism and happiness in patients that it\u2019s hard to replicate. Countless patients have thanked my children, saying, \u201cYou remind me of my grandchildren,\u201d prompting one green medical student to ask me, \u201cThen where are <em>their</em> grandchildren?\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, for my patient, time ran out and his grandchildren didn\u2019t come in. But the encounter was another reminder of the therapeutic benefit of young visitors to the bedside.</p> <p>We cannot forever shield our children from the realities of life. It\u2019s normal to feel apprehensive but there are steps parents can take to prepare everyone for a visit. We need to protect our children but we also need to spare a thought for our elderly who have often given years to building a bond with our young only to be deprived of it when they most need it. Being sick is hard enough, they don\u2019t need to be lonely too.</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m guessing that Malcolm Turnbull gets a fair few letters on any given day. You wonder how he has the time to read them all.</p> <p>How do you prioritise the ones worth your attention and the ones that you can toss in the round-shaped filing cabinet under your desk? </p> <p>Perhaps there\u2019s some formula involved in picking out the ones worthy of a public response \u2013 some sort of computer model that measures time and effort against the votes you might get, the donors and lobby groups you can afford to upset and the sort of reaction you can expect from the mainstream media. </p> <p>Either that, or the letters all get dropped into a giant hessian sack ready for a morning lucky dip. </p> <p>Honestly, I\u2019ve no idea. </p> <p>But a factor that appears not to be all that important are ones warning of an unfolding crisis that threatens people\u2019s way of life, impacts countries across the globe, condemns future generations to several metres of sea level rise and generally makes the future not all that pleasant. </p> <p>The number of letters coming into the prime minister\u2019s office of late from climate change and marine scientists warning of these sorts of scenarios would be very hard to miss, especially when they\u2019re signed by some of the best informed scientists from Australia and the rest of the world.</p> <p>The latest one to drop into Turnbull\u2019s office/social media feed/sack/bin carries the signatures of more than 150 of Australia\u2019s leading scientists who work at universities and government agencies across the country.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/154-australian-scientists-demand-climate-policy-that-matches-the-science-64359\">letter says</a> \u201cgovernments worldwide are presiding over a large-scale demise of the planetary ecosystems, which threatens to leave large parts of Earth uninhabitable\u201d and asks for \u201cmeaningful reductions\u201d in greenhouse gas emissions and cuts to coal exports. </p> <p>The letter, coordinated by Australian National University Earth scientist Dr Andrew Glikson, lays out a few facts. </p> <p>July 2016 was the hottest month the world has experienced on a temperature record going back 136 years. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rising at a rate not known in at least 55m years. Daytime heat records in Australia are being broken three times as often as cold records. Ice sheets are melting at an increasing rate and sea level rise was is accelerating. </p> <p>Once he had collaborated with colleagues to refine the text, it only took Glikson a couple of days to gather the signatures. </p> <p>He told me there was an increasing sense of frustration among scientists that warnings and predictions, stemming from peer-reviewed research over many years, were going unheeded in the corridors of power. </p> <p>He put the lack of genuine action to cut greenhouse gas emissions down to two things: a media that downplays or ignores the issue, and a fossil fuel industry with too much power over the political process.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many people just don\u2019t understand the issue because there has been something of a cover-up across many parts of mainstream media, with a few exceptions. Sure, the media reports the issue, but they don\u2019t explain it.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>But the fossil fuel industry is the largest in the world by far. There\u2019s an enormous vested interest and the political elites just follow that money.</p> </blockquote> <p>So Glikson admitted he didn\u2019t \u201canticipate a response\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s office. </p> <h2>Scientists ask for coal cuts</h2> <p>The letter, like several others over the last year or so, have called for Australia to move away from its support for the fossil fuel industry, in particular coal.</p> <p>In October last year, just before the United Nations climate talks in Paris, <a href=\"http://www.nonewcoalmines.org.au/open_letter\">scientists joined campaigners and advocates to sign an open letter</a> to world leaders asking for a moratorium on new coalmines in Australia.</p> <p>Australia was in the process of doubling its coal exports, the letter said, something that was \u201cincompatible with the world\u2019s objective of limiting global warming below dangerous levels\u201d. </p> <p>In February this year, about <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/02/11/scientists-60-countries-condemn-cuts-vital-climate-research-australia-s-csiro-agency\">3,000 scientists from more than 60 countries sent a letter to the prime minister</a> pleading for reconsideration of the drastic cuts to climate research planned at the CSIRO.</p> <p>The letter said that rather than cut climate change research, what was needed was more investment. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Without committing to the continued development of next generation climate monitoring and climate modelling, billions of public investment dollars for long-term infrastructure will be based on guesswork rather than on strategic and informed science-driven policy. The societal benefits of climate science far outweigh the likely high costs of reacting to future climate change instead of strategically planning for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>In June more than 2,000 marine scientists and reef managers from across the world sent Turnbull a letter asking his government to \u201cstop endorsing the export of coal\u201d and to \u201cstop or revoke the approval of new mines\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/readfearn/status/746917373429506049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Letter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm\">@TurnbullMalcolm</a> from 2k+ coral scientists asks for end to backing of coal exports and no more coal mines <a href=\"https://t.co/4Cx6p2obWj\">pic.twitter.com/4Cx6p2obWj</a></p>&mdash; Graham Readfearn (@readfearn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/readfearn/status/746917373429506049\">June 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Coral reefs supported 500 million people worldwide, the letter said, but reefs were \u201cthreatened with complete collapse\u201d</p> <p>A quarter of marine species were at risk, exposing \u201chundreds of millions of people to decreasing food security and increased poverty\u201d. </p> <h2>Advice from a former Malcolm</h2> <p>So let\u2019s say thanks to either the luck of the draw or advice from his policy team, Turnbull finds himself reading the latest open letter from scientists asking for leadership on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
