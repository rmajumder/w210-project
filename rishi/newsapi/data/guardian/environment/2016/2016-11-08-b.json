I know that\u2019s a term they reserve for Barack Obama, but I think women can have swag also. I take a lot of pride in the way I dress, the way I look, the way I carry myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baxter, who spent 31 years with the New York City board of education, was quickly taken out of her comfort zone: as a teenager in the early 1960s, she was a scholarship student at a highly selective Bronx-based private school named Fieldston. \u201cI was the only black female in my class.\u201d</p> \n<p>Baxter, who came from a mixed family \u2013 with a white father and a part African American, part Native American mother \u2013 found it scary at first. Discrimination was evident. There were parties she wasn\u2019t invited to, comments she was subjected to.</p> \n<p>Discrimination followed her. After college, despite qualifying as a high school teacher, when it came to a final oral examination, she was failed. The board of examiners said her southern accent was an impediment to her being understood by students in the classroom. But Baxter didn\u2019t have one; she had lived in New York her entire life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6c1d7665-bec5-4d84-8487-7c3f97a7cd62\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"expandable\"> \n    <h1>The Guardian view on America\u2019s choice</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>If we had a vote, we would use it to elect Hillary Clinton as president. She's a thoughtful politician who has&nbsp;responded to concerns about her cautious centrism by committing to more radical plans. With decades of experience, she is a fitting successor to Barack Obama. It is also high time there was a woman president. By contrast Donald Trump is an irascible egomaniac, uninterested in the world. He has fought a campaign of abuse, riddled with racism and misogyny. He propagates lies, ignorance and prejudice.</p>\n     <p>There are three particular ways in which electing Mr Trump is a step that should be spurned by any responsible American voter.

Mrs Clinton is much better. So elect her.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Baxter eventually qualified and rose up. Her crowning achievement? Besides her two daughters, she says that as a principal, she turned around a failing school in the Bronx in record time. In just three years, Baxter overhauled a 5,000-student school where many attendants lived below the poverty line \u2013 significantly improving grades, attendance and morale. The accomplishment won her an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/27/opinion/cloning-thelma-baxter.html\">editorial</a> in the New York Times, the title of which reads \u201cCloning Thelma Baxter\u201d.</p> \n<p>More broadly, it is birth control, Roe v Wade, and winning the battle of being in charge of our own bodies that she considers the most important victory she has seen in her lifetime.</p> \n<p>Other victories, like childcare, and finding ways to balance careers with child-rearing, have yet to come. Baxter remembers her mother, a prominent journalist and then city government worker, suffering from that struggle. It is the same struggle she grappled with, that she now sees her daughters also face.</p> \n<p>Baxter says Hillary Clinton has faced a vast amount of unfair scrutiny in the run-up to the presidential elections. Her own way of vanquishing such treatment was to keep on facing the challenges set before her. \u201cI just had to overcome those kinds of hurdles. I had to constantly prove to people that I was qualified, well-prepared and that I wanted to do the job \u2013 and that I was up to doing the job. I think that\u2019s a hurdle that all minority, black, or Hispanic women have to face, much more so than white women.\u201d</p> \n<p>And going to cast a vote for the first female president feels important as well as historic. \u201cI will be very, very proud. Almost as proud as when I went to vote for Barack.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Gloria Neuwirth, 82, lawyer: \u2018It\u2019s an uphill battle for women\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-women-voter-gloria-neuwirth-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b3n4\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876530\" data-video-name=\"Gloria Neuwirth, age 82, on voting for a female president \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5822332ce4b0822c310ec179\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108gloriafinalwoman_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-clinton-women-voter-gloria-neuwirth-video\">Gloria Neuwirth, age 82, on voting for a female president</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sitting behind her large wooden desk, Gloria Neuwirth says she is cutting down her work hours at the Manhattan law firm where she has been a partner for the last 20 years. \u201cI am cutting down from five days to four days a week,\u201d she states, no movement of the eyelid detectable.</p> \n<p>Neuwirth grew up in the South Bronx, the daughter of immigrant parents who owned a chain of pharmacies. She\u2019s the product of the New York City public school system, and recalls riding the subway to go to piano lessons with a degree of freedom and independence.</p> \n<p>In the mid-1950s, Neuwirth attended Yale law school: she was one of just 12 women in a class of 162 students. Her gender received frequent attention. \u201cThe question that I got from students and even some professors was: why are you here, taking the place of a man? I heard that question over and over again, the assumption being I was going to graduate and just go and raise a family.\u201d</p> \n<p>After graduating, finding a job was hard. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many jobs available to women. It was the late 1950s.\u201d</p> \n<p>One company refused to hire her because they held occasional evening meetings they didn\u2019t think would be suitable for her to attend. Another Wall Street firm declared they didn\u2019t hire women, but told her she was pretty, so they\u2019d be happy to talk to her.</p> \n<p>Neuwirth eventually found a job as a researcher with Columbia University and the Bar Association. A little over a decade later, after taking time off to have four children, she once more struggled to find employment. She wanted work adapted to her family requirements \u2013 an almost impossible ask. The battle for flexibility and childcare is a gender battle that has yet to be won, she says.</p> \n<p>Women have come a long way since she first qualified as a lawyer, Neuwirth points out. Nowadays, women make up a little over half of law school students. But then, she pauses, she also read of a law firm that had announced new partners, 14 out of 15 of whom were men. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s an uphill battle for women.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for having a woman in the White House, it will be \u201cvery exciting for girls as well as boys to see that a woman can be president\u201d. However, America is hardly blazing a trail, she points out. \u201cWe are way behind the rest of the world. So many other countries have had women leaders, and we have never.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Robin Morgan</strong>, 75: \u2018People have died for the right to vote \u2013 women included\u2019</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/robin-morgan-hillary-clinton-video\" data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b3f4\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2876314\" data-video-name=\"Robin Morgan, age 75, on voting for a female president \u2013 video\" data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58220a57e4b0eda0192fd80c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/08/161108robinfinalwoman_WebM.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/robin-morgan-hillary-clinton-video\">Robin Morgan, age 75, on voting for a female president</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Robin Morgan sits by the fire in her small, book-filled New York City apartment, and lets her gaze be drawn towards the small entrance to her bathroom, where a few framed letters have been placed.</p> \n<p>The writer, feminist, activist organizer and radio <a href=\"http://www.wmclive.com/\">show</a> host nods. \u201cYes, those are copies of some of my correspondence with Simone de Beauvoir,\u201d she confirms. \u201cShe was a wonderful woman.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan, a child actor who enrolled as a non-matriculated student at Columbia University aged 14, says her first adult job as a secretary at a New York literary agency in the late 1950s forced her to confront serious sexism.</p> \n<p>Around the same time, like \u201ca great many other idealistic young people\u201d, she became involved in the civil rights and then anti-Vietnam movements. It was a rude awakening.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are doing all this work in civil rights and anti-war movements thinking that we are marching towards this brave new world with our revolutionary brothers where we would all be equal and free. And, not so much. Because we discovered that our revolutionary brothers thought women were a species apart.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morgan recalls men in both movements issuing derogatory come-ons to women. \u201cHey baby, give me a little of my civil rights tonight\u201d and \u201cGirls say yes to boys who say no\u201d were lines that were all too common, she says. \u201cIf you think about it, of course, that statement pimps women.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We discovered that our revolutionary brothers thought women were a species apart</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In 1968, Morgan <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_feminists.html\">helped lead a protest</a> at the Miss America pageant, decrying the degrading nature of the event. The protest, which attracted national and international coverage, threw the American women\u2019s liberation movement firmly into the mainstream.</p> \n<p>But for her, looking back, it is not the more than 20 published books that are her greatest professional accomplishment, but rather her participation in the establishment of a global women\u2019s rights movement. \u201cWomen are aware now that they are part of a global movement. The United States did not invent feminism; it is not an export from the Americas. We are one mosaic tile in a grand mosaic.\u201d</p> \n<p>She mentions how slow some battles feel \u2013 against sexual harassment, for instance. \u201cEvery now and then you think: how can this still be happening?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery woman in this country, I think every woman on this planet knows, has experienced some version of sexual harassment \u2013 some man has put his hands or looks where they shouldn\u2019t have been, employment discrimination, whether it\u2019s a job you have or a career.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she remains optimistic. \u201cIf you pan back to a historical perspective, change is happening very rapidly.\u201d</p> \n<p>And although Morgan believes electing a female president should not be perceived as the be-all and end-all \u2013 \u201cWe still have racism having had a black president for two terms, and we even have backlash\u201d \u2013 it still feels like an exciting moment.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will vote with great pride, I will be moved to do so. Just to see a woman\u2019s name on the ballot. And not any woman, but to see a woman who in a very real way comes out of the women\u2019s movement, who was affected by the women\u2019s movement, calls herself a feminist, stands for many of the things that we have put on the map. That\u2019s a thrill I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to see.\u201d</p>",

The corporation said it would be ready to start crossing the water in two weeks.</p> <p>The announcement came on a quiet election day at the encampments built by members of the Standing Rock Sioux nation and other indigenous people in opposition to the pipeline.</p> <p>After a string of clashes and mass arrests, rumors spread among activists that the pipeline, government and tribal leaders had negotiated a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/11/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-delay\">30-day moratorium</a> on both construction and protest or religious ceremonies on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the conflict.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in shock. I\u2019m speechless,\u201d said Cheryl Angel, a Sicangu Lakota tribe member who has been at the Standing Rock camps since the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable and devastating. It\u2019s almost as though they have no soul.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement presents the final phase of construction as a done deal, and will be seen as a clear illustration that the oil company is aggressively moving forward with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/north-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-protests-explainer\">$3.7bn pipeline</a> in defiance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/dakota-access-obama-suggests-ways-to-reroute-pipeline-being-investigated\">Barack Obama</a> and the thousands of demonstrators who are camped out at Standing Rock to fight the project.</p> <p>Last week, Obama made his first remarks on the huge demonstrations since police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-arrests-pepper-spray\">arrested hundreds of unarmed protesters</a>, who call themselves \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/north-dakota-pipeline-activists-bakken-oil-fields\">water protectors</a>\u201d and say the pipeline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-sioux\">destroying sacred indigenous lands</a>.</p> <p>The president said the US army corps of engineers was exploring ways to \u201creroute\u201d around Native American lands, and said the government was \u201cgoing to let it play out for several more weeks, and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans\u201d.</p> <p>In September, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">government said</a> it would temporarily <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing\">halt permits</a> to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river and requested that the company \u201cvoluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west\u201d of Lake Oahe.</p> <p>Energy Transfer Partners ignored that request and continued construction, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/north-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-last-stand\">approaching within a few miles of the river</a>, causing widespread anger and sadness at the Standing Rock camps, which have been opposing the pipeline since April.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s statement does not address the requests from the government for a delay. On the contrary, it suggests that the company is not giving consideration to alternative routes or Obama\u2019s recent remarks.</p> <p>\u201cDakota Access previously received a permit from the army corps with respect the tunneling activities under Lake Oahe, and Dakota Access has all other regulatory approvals and land rights to complete the crossing of the Missouri river at Lake Oahe,\u201d the statement said, adding that the company expects to receive final permissions \u201cin a time frame that will not result in any significant delay\u201d.</p> <p>The army corps did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Asked about Obama\u2019s comments, pipeline spokeswoman Vicki Granado told the Guardian: \u201cWe are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement comes as North Dakota regulators are moving ahead with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/dakota-access-oil-pipeline-native-american-artifacts-discovered\">formal complaint against the corporation</a> for failing to properly disclose findings of Native American artifacts along the construction route.</p> <p>Angel said the pipeline construction plan was \u201cenvironmentally irresponsible\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d considering the army corps has yet to approve final permits. Noting that the Missouri river provided drinking water to millions, she added: \u201cI\u2019m in tears, because I can\u2019t believe [the company] would do this to a whole group of people who don\u2019t have any say.\u201d</p> <p>This past Sunday, more than a hundred water protectors used boats to ferry across the Cannonball river and attempted to climb \u201cTurtle Island\u201d \u2013 a portion of army corps land where tribal members say there are 11 burial sites. Several tribal elders, including Darrel Killsinsight, implored everyone to return to the main camp, referencing the alleged 30-day agreement.</p> <p>But representatives of the tribe never officially confirmed that any such agreement was in place, and Tuesday\u2019s statement flies in the face of any hope for a moratorium. </p> <p>Jan Hasselman, the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux in its permit litigation, said that the statement from Dakota Access was probably a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-north-dakota-pipeline-energy-transfer-idUSKBN1332QZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">response to an army corps spokesman</a> telling Bloomberg that the company had agreed to slow construction. But, she added, Dakota Access does not have all the permits it needs to begin drilling, including the easement. </p> <p>\u201cStarting construction without permits would be beyond the pale, even for Dakota Access,\u201d Hasselman told the Guardian. \u201cIt is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors\u2019 money into this route when both the President and Senator Tim Kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from Lake Oahe.\u201d</p> <p>The timing of the announcement on election day instantly raised suspicion \u2013 and anger \u2013 among the activists gathered at Standing Rock. Activists have expressed frustration with the US presidential race, noting that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates?page=with:block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5#block-58129388e4b08d944ba4b6f5\">refused</a> to take a position on the conflict and GOP candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">Donald Trump has close financial ties to the pipeline</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWith the election being so big, and North Dakota being so small, they think they can just sweep this under the rug,\u201d said Danny Grassrope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. \u201cI\u2019m not really surprised. Snakes are sneaky, and this is a black snake. It blindsides everyone.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cA lot of people are going to get angry, and this is where we need to stay positive. We need prayers more than ever now.\u201d</p> <p>The protesters were also disappointed that Obama has not condemned the highly militarized police force in North Dakota, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/dakota-access-pipeline-protest-standing-rock-women-police-abuse\">arrested more than 400 people</a> and deployed Mace, Tasers, rubber bullets and army tanks to respond to demonstrations.</p> <p>A UN group is also investigating claims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/dakota-access-pipeline-native-american-protesters\">inhumane jail treatment</a> and other human rights abuses by law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cAre indigenous people so invaluable that now that Dakota Access is to the water, does it not matter to anyone that people are going to start laying down their lives?\u201d asked Eryn Wise, a member of the Jicarilla Apache and Laguna Pueblo tribes.</p> <p>\u201cI think that people need to seriously question the integrity of the work produced by DAPL right now, because they\u2019re rushing,\u201d Wise added. \u201cIs it safe when they\u2019ve been rushing like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 11 November 2016 to better reflect the article.</p>",

He started the next three but was taken off every time. \u201cThen we played Hull, we were on our way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/bournemouth-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">to winning 6-1</a> and I was thinking: \u2018This is the game, this is it \u2013 at last, I\u2019m going to play 90 minutes.\u2019 And then I was taken off.\u201d It was the following week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/bournemouth-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Tottenham</a>, that he ended a run lasting 771 days. \u201cIt was a good feeling,\u201d he says, with a rueful smile.</p> <p>These are still early days and nothing can be taken for granted given the long, demoralising parts of his career when his body has been his hardest opponent and, by his own admission, the number of times when what has seemed like an innocuous injury has turned into something far more serious.</p> <p>\u201cThe one last season was the hardest to take mentally because I had already been through such a lot with my previous injuries. I had come back, played for England, scored a couple of goals. It was the best I had felt for a while. It was a freak tackle in training. Just a little kick and I got this injury that took forever to heal.\u201d</p> <p>None of that is Arsenal\u2019s fault but he had started to find it \u201ca churn\u201d going into the training ground every day for rehab and experiencing the kind of isolation that every player who has suffered long-term injuries will understand. Had he actually fallen out of love with the sport? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I did,\u201d is his first reaction. But then he pauses. \u201cI nearly did. When you are injured \u2013 and injured for a while \u2013 it is hard. You have to go to the training ground and watch everyone go out to play. Then you go to the Emirates to watch them play the match. It was difficult at times.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he also concluded Arsenal were moving on without him and that even when he was fully fit he was in danger of \u201cbeing the player that comes on now and again, or starts the odd cup game here and there\u201d. Being left out of Allardyce\u2019s England squad provided hard evidence it may affect his international career and, plainly, a man of 34 caps does not regard Bournemouth as beneath him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/08/roy-keane-hits-out-ronald-koeman-everton-republic-of-ireland-james-mccarthy\">Roy Keane hits out at Koeman over Everton and Republic of Ireland row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is different,\u201d he says. \u201cThe training ground is smaller and the stadium is different but one thing which is similar is the way both teams want to play football. The manager [Eddie Howe] is really good like that. Even if things are going badly or we\u2019re under pressure he wants to play out from the back and that suits me perfectly. There are a few things that are different but I really like the manager. He\u2019s been good for me, we speak quite a lot and I am in a good place, I am happy.\u201d</p> <p>If his suspicions are right, he might still be out in the wilderness, England-wise, if he had stayed at Arsenal. Instead, Southgate has been to watch him play twice for Bournemouth and is satisfied the player\u2019s fitness has already considerably improved.</p> <p>All of which leaves the question of whether the 24-year-old may resume his career at Arsenal next season or decide now that he should leave for good.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a difficult one because I love Arsenal and I\u2019ve had great times there,\u201d Wilshere says. \u201cIf I go back and I\u2019m still not playing then of course I will have to think about things but at the moment I\u2019m concentrating on Bournemouth. I want to put myself in a position where I go back next year and I\u2019m a better player. I\u2019m fitter, I\u2019ve proved to people I can play week in and week out and I\u2019m ready for the challenge.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>David Walsh is not a man to do things by halves. </p> <p>Most people already know this, of course; read anything written about the gambler-cum-art collector and you\u2019ll find no shortage of excess.

They collected it because he\u2019s got a big dick.\u201d</p> <p>Walsh \u2013 scruffy haired and brightly shod \u2013 is a fan of declarative statements, particularly ones that undercut the entire industry he bought into.

On the Origin of Art \u2013 which opened at the weekend with a Gatsby-ish private party even more lavish than the museum\u2019s official launch \u2013 is the culmination of five years of planning and decades of fascination for Walsh and his team. And tens of millions of dollars, too. <br></p> <p>The show works from Walsh\u2019s thesis that art is not purely a cultural project but one that has its basis in biology. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the real world that almost everyone ignores,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of art exhibitions at any given time around the world and all of them are inadvertently based on the premise that art is a cultural phenomenon. And that\u2019s both unquestioned and likely to be wrong.\u201d<br></p> <p>The exhibition begins in a foyer space on the underground floor known as \u201cthe void\u201d, with four identical doors leading to four very different spaces. Four experts in science, psychology and language \u2013 four men who, in line with Mona\u2019s philosophy of rethinking how we understand art, are outsiders to the art world \u2013 have curated their own exhibitions to present their theories of where art comes from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e1e1f28be7eb0db07efdb97774ad73968192408\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e1e1f28be7eb0db07efdb97774ad73968192408/0_515_1365_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dots Obsession \u2013 Tasmania (2016) by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dots Obsession \u2013 Tasmania (2016) by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, commissioned for Brian Boyd\u2019s room in On the Origin of Art at Mona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: R\u00e9mi Chauvin/Mona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhibition comprises 234 objects from 35 countries spanning millennia; some are drawn from the gallery\u2019s collection, others are loans, acquisitions and original commissions. Taken as a jumbled collection of art to spend an afternoon in \u2013 featuring such names as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Brett Whiteley, Cindy Sherman, Bill Henson, Fiona Hall \u2013 it is extravagant enough: in literary professor Brian Boyd\u2019s exhibition, for instance, you\u2019ll find a retrospective of Art Spiegelman\u2019s comics, a dazzling melting rug from Azerbaijan\u2019s Faig Ahmed, ancient patterned pottery from central America, and a bright yellow polka dotted mirror room by Yayoi Kusama, commissioned for this exhibition. </p> <p>But through their curation, and in the<strong> </strong>accompanying audio tours and essays, it becomes so much more. Each expert asks and answers a different question about art, science and evolution<strong> </strong>\u2013 some more successfully than others, and some in direct opposition to others \u2013 for an overall experience that\u2019s as fun to think about as it is to look at. </p> <p>Stephen Pinker, cognitive scientist, linguist and popular science author, makes perhaps the most compelling argument. He believes artistic drive has not evolved as a trait but arrived as a byproduct, piggy-backing on other adaptive aesthetics \u2013 our appreciation of \u201cgood\u201d bodies (for reproduction), high status (for security) and pretty landscapes (for safety). </p> <p>Brian Boyd<strong>, </strong>by contrast, homes in on patterns \u2013 in nature, in Shakespeare, in Indigenous art, in comics \u2013 which help humans make sense of, and play with, the information around them. </p> <p>The US evolutionary neurobiologist Mark Changizi brings us art that resembles the natural world \u2013 evocative but also grotesque \u201cuncanny valley\u201d sculptures by Patricia Piccinini, a commissioned installation by Brigita Ozolins exploring the resemblance of alphabet letters to the contours of nature \u2013 to show us that art is shaped to fit preferences our brains have already developed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ce167e6559137910abc2053a6f65468fca8fb49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ce167e6559137910abc2053a6f65468fca8fb49/0_0_6400_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sphinx (2012) by Australian artist Patricia Piccinini, with more of her works in the background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sphinx (2012) by the Australian artist Patricia Piccinini, with more of her works in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: R\u00e9mi Chauvin/Mona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rooms Walsh and I are standing in, though, are the gallerist\u2019s favourite.

Don\u2019t make us think about things that actually require the acquisition of expertise.

Well, that should be obvious by now. </p> <p>\u201cLet me ask you, if there\u2019s someone who owns a gallery of this scale, compared with someone that doesn\u2019t, which do you think is more likely to get laid?\u201d</p> <p>I answer the question with a pointed finger.</p> <p>\u201cWell, see, <em>there\u2019s</em> the biological advantage,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Mona\u2019s new exhibition, <a href=\"https://mona.net.au/ooa/\">On the Origin of Art</a>, is open until 17 April.

John Higgins at consultancy Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A victory for Hillary Clinton in the presidential race was heavily discounted on the day of the vote. So we doubt that there will be much of a response in the markets today if she has triumphed. But a win for Donald Trump could cause major upheaval.</p> <p>For example, a victory for Trump would probably send the dollar down sharply against other \u201cmajors\u201d, particularly the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. We would expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to break below 100, compared to a current level of nearly 105. We would also anticipate a sharp rise in the dollar against some emerging market currencies. For example, the Mexican peso could hit 25/$, versus 19/$ or so now.</p> <p>In our view, a Trump win would also have large effects on equities. For example, we think the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 2,000, compared to a current level of around 2,130. And many stock market indices elsewhere would probably fare worse. The Nikkei 225 could be hit especially hard by accompanying strength in the yen \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it tumbled below 15,000, versus a current level of more than 17,000. And there would probably a broad-based rout in emerging markets.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a93ec2b8167d4198cafd8cfd932aa8bbbd8d631/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the US votes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We suspect that US Treasuries would rally if Trump won, with the 10-year yield falling to 1.5% from around 1.8%. Admittedly, he has talked about defaulting on the national debt, has a fiscal plan that includes unfunded tax cuts and has proposed trade tariffs that would boost inflation. But a plunge in risky asset prices would prompt a reassessment of the near-term outlook for Fed policy and boost the demand for safe havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the initial uncertainty following a victory for Trump would surely undermine the prices of industrial commodities, including oil and base metals, while gold would benefit from a renewed burst of safe-haven demand. In the short term, therefore, we would expect crude oil to fall to around $40 and gold to surge to at least $1,400. The impact of the dollar is a further wildcard. A big fall in the value of the US currency would limit the downside for the dollar prices of industrial commodities, while adding to the upside for gold. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821ee7ae4b029b92ca46a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:31:34.879Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the presidential election, and if Hillary Clinton wins, it would give a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates in December, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have rushed to price in a rate hike from the Fed in recent days, the current implied probability of one 25 basis point hike next month is 82%, up from 68% a week ago.

There is nothing constructive to be said today on the political noise, so perhaps we should look to the challenges ahead.</li> <li>Prejudice is one of the biggest threats to economic and social stability. Prejudice is on the rise. Declaring a group in society to be \u201csecond class\u201d undermines their economic contribution \u2013 increasingly so in today\u2019s changing world. Politicians must tackle prejudice head-on; it is morally and economically the right thing to do.<br></li> <li>Global trade patterns are changing. Lengthening supply chains and outsourcing are outdated as localized production reintroduces the imperial trade model, and technology means that trade in services is increasingly important. Politicians need to stop living the trade of the past, and embrace the trade of the future.<br></li> <li>Jobs do not disappear; jobs become different.

It\u2019s precisely the sort of everyday administrative pain in the arse that online banking has revolutionised: click, confirm, done. The money promptly disappeared from one account \u2013 and singularly failed to materialise in the other. I waited a day. Then another.</p> <p>When nothing changed, I rang the first bank to make a polite inquiry about the anomaly. After checking I had input all the numbers correctly, the man on the helpline said there was nothing more he could do \u2013 I needed to speak to the other bank. To me he sounded like an airline spokesman explaining why a plane that has vanished off the radar is actually the responsibility of the destination airport.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the helpline woman at my other bank didn\u2019t really feel like taking responsibility for a transaction she had absolutely no record of. At this point I started to get a cold, fluttery feeling in my chest. Shuffling money around cyberspace \u2013 what had made me think that would work?</p> <p>The helpline woman suggested I call the first bank and ask them to put a forward trace on the money, or something. The first bank transferred me around a bit before telling me I needed to update my security settings in order to proceed further. I patiently followed instructions for changing my password to one with more numbers in it, all the while resisting the urge to shout \u201cWHERE\u2019S MY MONEY, MAN?\u201d into the phone.</p> <p>Eventually I achieved a security clearance sufficient for them to confess they had held up my transaction on purpose because it seemed so out of character. I got a letter to that effect three days later.</p> <h2><strong>Solar confusion</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b20f4ede3ef3e4153cbf9946a215678ebfffc6a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b20f4ede3ef3e4153cbf9946a215678ebfffc6a6/0_275_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voters cast their ballots in Miami\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voters cast their ballots in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Way down the US election ballot, below Clinton and Trump, there were also all manner of local referendums to be voted on.

But a second part of the amendment \u2013 its true purpose, cynics might say, since the measure is supported by big power utilities \u2013 relieves residents who don\u2019t produce solar energy from the obligation to subsidise its production. In other (less weasly) words, it would end the solar panel owner\u2019s automatic right to sell surplus electricity back to the grid. So, yes or no to solar, voter? Quickly, there\u2019s a queue.</p> <h2><strong>Glimpsed in the black mirror</strong><br></h2> <p>I experienced another sort of cyberattack this week, when Facebook dropped a picture of me \u201c7 years ago\u201d into my timeline, asking if I wanted to Share it.</p> <p>No thanks.

  "<p>On Sunday, the capital city of one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies was effectively shut down in an emergency act. The reason was not terrorism, but air pollution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/delhi-air-pollution-closes-schools-for-three-days\" title=\"\">threat to citizens from smog in Delhi</a> was judged so great that traffic was ratioined, coal-fired power stations closed and diesel generators suspended. This was a&#xa0;brave and sane decision in the world\u2019s largest democracy.</p> <p>Right now Delhi is the world\u2019s most polluted city. But air quality is at crisis levels in cities around the world. More than <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/media_92979.html\" title=\"\">300 million children live at the severest risk, Unicef declared last week</a>, and 2 billion in areas where outdoor pollution exceeds health guidelines. Half of Delhi\u2019s schoolchildren have permanently impaired lung capacity, thanks to the air they breathe.</p> <p>India\u2019s capital city is telling people to stay away or work from home, but offering no compensation to those who cannot, or whose livelihood suffers. This can only be a short-term solution; it hurts those who can least bear it. Although the prime minister Theresa May will have been sheltered from the worst of the choking smog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/theresa-may-visa-offer-india-citizens-uk\" title=\"\">during her trip to India</a>, arriving in Delhi should have been a powerful warning about the effects of privileging growth over environmental concerns. Citizens of rich countries are sometimes too relaxed about such things when air pollution afflicts the richest cities as well as the poorest. That&#xa0;London has not yet been closed down in&#xa0;similar fashion to Delhi is only through lack&#xa0;of&#xa0;courage on the part of the government.</p> <p>Air quality in London has hit levels worse than those in Delhi and Beijing. Earlier this year, annual air pollution limits were breached in just a week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/high-court-rules-uk-government-plans-to-tackle-air-pollution-are-illegal\" title=\"\">Earlier this month, in&#xa0;what may be one of the last chances to bring EU law to bear on the issue, the high court ruled that the government had knowingly failed to draw up plans to bring it within legal limits</a> and there must be immediate action, even if that means drastic measures to curtail traffic.</p> <p>The causes of air pollution differ around the world, from coal-fired power plants to agricultural burning. One constant is traffic. Older cars and diesel engines produce particulates that clog up the lungs and may enter brain tissue, and nitrogen oxides that affect breathing. Car manufacturers were forced to admit last year that they had flouted tests on their diesel emissions. But the bigger question is why in a shortsighted attempt to reduce greenhouse gases by a tiny amount (diesel cars do more miles to the gallon) the risks were ignored, and customers persuaded that diesel cars were actually greener.</p> <p>Now that the consequences for air quality are clear, it is time to rebalance taxation and regulation in favour of petrol, which is cleaner though producing more carbon, and urgently incentivise electric cars. In London Sadiq Khan, the new mayor, to his credit has taken a strong line on air pollution, in contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s tactics which amounted to unconvincing denial and attempts to silence scientists. Mr Khan should move faster still on banning the most polluting vehicles \u2013 he would find public support in inner London.</p> <p>Air pollution shames us all. From Beijing to Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.fr/20160621/pollution-in-france-kills-48000-people-each-year\" title=\"\">Marseille</a> to Manila, the air we breathe in cities has deteriorated so much that it is no longer safe for children. Adults who grew up breathing cleaner air are more resilient in the face of polution. But when a child\u2019s lungs are damaged, they are damaged for life. The next generation already carries the burden of our inaction. This is a problem we know how to solve. Cut down coal-fired power, cut out diesel in cities, encourage electric cars and public transport. India should follow the declaration of emergency with long-term action, not just this short-term fix. Richer cities, London foremost among them, should be ashamed that they, with all their resources, have failed their children for so long. The high court judges were right. The&#xa0;government can and must act&#xa0;now.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s official. The north-south divide in Britain is now wider than at any time since the beginning of the industrial revolution \u2013 wider than when Charles Dickens was writing about Victorian squalor, and wider than in the depression years of the 1930s, when George Orwell exposed the grinding poverty of northern England in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/24/road-wigan-pier-george-orwell-100-best-nonfiction-books\" title=\"\">The Road to Wigan Pier</a>.</p> <p>Remarkable new evidence from a&#xa0;study by the academic Philip McCann, The UK Regional-National Economic Problem, shows that while economic output per head, measured by gross value added, is near \u00a343,000 a year in London \u2013 and as high as \u00a3135,000 in inner west London \u2013 almost half the UK population lives, in regions where output per head is below \u00a322,325.</p> <p>Indeed the regional divide is so vast that, at \u00a313,500 per person, economic output in Gwent, Wales, is a tenth that of one of the wealthiest part of London; and in the Tees and Welsh valleys it has now fallen below that of Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia.</p> <p>Of course, in both the north and south we are all better off than 100 years ago, but the divide in income, jobs and pay is increasing faster than ever. Average household incomes in Wales, Northern Ireland and the northern regions of England are around 60% of those in Greater London. Last year, when jobs rose by 277,000 in London they rose by only 1,000 in the north-west and fell by 40,000 in the north-east. In London 10% of workers are officially low paid. In the north the figure is 25%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement can offer will be sufficient to bridge this divide</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was a revolt of the regions \u2013 northern industrial towns hit by wave after wave of crushing global change \u2013 that pushed the Brexit vote over the edge. Sadly, with the north more dependent on European trade \u2013 59% of the north-east\u2019s goods exports go to the European Union against only 39% of London\u2019s \u2013 the post-referendum optimism felt by northern leave voters will be short lived, as standards of living fall faster and even more jobs are lost in leave-voting areas.</p> <p>Nothing the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement can offer will be sufficient to bridge this divide. Historical gaps in infrastructure spending are set only to widen over the next few years: transport investment per head will be \u00a31,900 a year in London between now and 2020 but less than \u00a3300 in the north-east. Three-quarters of Government and Research Council research and development spending is in the southern third of the country while the north-east receives only 7%. Even talk of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/scunthorpe-workers-northern-powerhouse-tata-steel-cuts\" title=\"\">northern powerhouse</a>\u201d cannot obscure a cut in regional aid from \u00a33.3bn a year in the first decade of the century to around \u00a32bn in the second.</p> <p>All this leaves us with a United Kingdom that is united in name only. Britain now has the most extreme inter-regional inequalities of any country in western Europe, yet the biggest concentration of political power in a centre that is singularly ill equipped to narrow the divide. Quite simply, our London-centric constitution has failed to unlock the potential, unleash the enterprise, or even meet the needs and aspirations of, our northern regions.</p> <p>And this centralisation does not even meet the needs of London. While northern communities live with long-term unemployment, forced migration and in some cases depopulation, the capital city struggles with congestion, overheating, high house prices and poor housing supply \u2013 challenges that a more balanced regional policy could address.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ac35c9b17597ff0f35c5c8d45ffa026fe15cc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ac35c9b17597ff0f35c5c8d45ffa026fe15cc1/0_0_4134_2970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London\u2019s financial district.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London\u2019s financial district.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So we need to engage the regions and nations in a UK\u2013wide debate that is about much more than the terms of Brexit. For this reason, I advocate a People\u2019s Constitutional Convention, modelled on the successful Scottish convention of 1989, which energised Scotland and built a consensus for progressive change. Such a gathering should start with everyday concerns \u2013 how to create more jobs, raise living standards and improve services \u2013 and ask what constitutional settlement can best meet our needs and aspirations.</p> <p>A people\u2019s convention could propose more power for the north and, in turn, encourage an outpouring of innovation, creativity and local decision-making in each region and nation. Such a convention could explore a more federal way for resolving the future role of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the UK.</p> <p>After last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/high-court-ruling-brexit-not-sabotaging-parliamentary-democracy-best-deal-britain\" title=\"\">Brexit court judgment</a>, the regions and nations could unite and demand a better deal under article 50. Powers now held in Brussels \u2013 from decisions concerning regional policy, agriculture and fisheries, to social and environmental protection \u2013 should be repatriated not to Whitehall but to the regions and nations, giving them power over \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn of public spending.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/21/brexit-widen-north-south-divide-poorest-areas-lose-most-eu\">Brexit would widen the north-south divide as poorest areas stand to lose most | Peter Hetherington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no going back to pre-23 June Britain. What is open to us is a fresh and more expansive vision of Britain than the Tory Brexiteers could ever deliver, in which we view Britain not through the lens of London but as an association of four nations and many distinct regions, whose potential remains largely untapped, and which are at their best when local initiative is unlocked and the right balance is struck between the autonomy our communities desire and the co-operation we need.</p> <p>A new and different Britain \u2013 empowered, confident and outward-looking \u2013 is the answer to the harsher, shriller version of Brexit Britain on display at the Conservative conference. A party that questions the right of EU nationals to stay in Britain, then proposes employers single out the foreigners in their workforces, and ridicules any notion that we could think of ourselves as citizens of both Britain and the world, is not going to build the Britain our young people want.</p> <p>The Labour party should now ask the government to sponsor a convention. If ministers refuse \u2013 as happened in Scotland in 1989 \u2013 then Labour should invite the other political parties to join them. The convention should engage citizens outside the established political process and should rule out nothing \u2013 from a written constitution on federal lines to an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions to replace the unelected House of Lords. Out of such a gathering can emerge a more tolerant, inclusive, equal and outward-looking Britain \u2013 the best alternative to the Conservatives\u2019 hard-Brexit Britain. For an even bigger decision than what type of Brexit we want to end up with is what kind of nation we seek to become.</p>",

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland did not tip healthy small businesses into default and did not seek to profit from their collapse. Nor did it request personal injections of cash from owners when it had already decided a business was doomed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/rbs-facing-400m-bill-to-compensate-small-business-customers\">says the Financial Conduct Authority</a>. But it did sometimes charge fees it didn\u2019t explain properly, and there was a failure to support small businesses \u201cin a manner consistent with good turnaround practice\u201d. Thus the bank will pay compensation to address \u201cpoor outcomes\u201d at a cost of about \u00a3400m. Is everybody happy now?</p> <p>Of course not. The period under the microscope is 2008-13, so the process of inspection has been painfully slow. The perception also remains that an apology, not to mention a few quid in redress, has had to be dragged out of RBS.</p> <p>The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said on Tuesday the bank had \u201cacknowledged mistakes for some time\u201d, but the latest admission of shortcomings was fuller and franker than any heard previously.</p> <p>Indeed, back in 2014, when an internally commissioned report by the law firm Clifford Chance found no evidence that RBS set out to defraud its small business customers, the bank\u2019s tone verged on jubilant. Tuesday\u2019s response was necessarily humbler. RBS is still innocent on the explosive central charge of wrecking healthy businesses but the FCA\u2019s qualification was significant. Of the potentially viable business customers transferred into the controversial unit called the global restructuring group (GRG), \u201cmost of them experienced some form of inappropriate action by RBS\u201d, said the regulator. Not pretty.</p> <p>Incompetence at RBS \u2013 if that\u2019s what the regulator has decided \u2013 would be understandable. In 2008, the bank was bust and new management, after the state-funded bailout, was fighting fires on many fronts. It would not be a surprise if overwhelmed staff at GRG, facing a steep rise in defaults, took insufficient care with small businesses.</p> <p>Yet the process of ensuring redress has been uncertain and plodding. An adviser to Sir Vince Cable, when business secretary in the coalition government, first made allegations of shabby behaviour in 2013. The subsequent FCA inquiry has run a year behind schedule (and still hasn\u2019t been published in full). Now fees charged as long ago as 2008 will be returned in 2017 and complainants who still feel aggrieved can make their pleas to a retired high court judge, Sir William Blackburne.</p> <p>A just outcome, even when it arrives late, is better than an unjust one. But one sympathises with the small businesses. They should not have had to shout so loudly, or for so long, to be heard. The system has served them poorly.</p> <h2>Magic and sparkle dim at M&amp;S</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"883bd8110d4c1dff227b50c5c3e57cf13c254fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883bd8110d4c1dff227b50c5c3e57cf13c254fa6/0_165_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks & Spencer logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close. Is that enough?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he announced his first strategic update in May, Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new chief executive, Steve Rowe, knocked 10% off the share price. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/m-and-s-marks-spencer-close-80-stores-major-overhaul\">his second on Tuesday</a>, which sought to answer the questions he raised in the spring, the fall was 5%. One can understand why investors are worried. Over the course of two outings in the City, Rowe has made a strong case that M&amp;S is in need of radical overhaul. But it\u2019s hard to conclude that his plan for action is as bold as his words.</p> <p>Shutting 53 wholly owned foreign stores sounds dramatic, of course. But the combined losses in the 10 affected countries were \u00a345m on turnover of \u00a3171m last year. If you are losing \u00a31 for every \u00a34 of revenue and see few opportunities for expansion, retreat is merely an act of common sense, even when the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es store in Paris was a pet project of your predecessor. Concentrating on franchise stores, where most of the risks sit with a franchisee with local knowledge, is more logical.</p> <p>The charge of timidity really concerns the UK. M&amp;S says 10% of floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close. Is that really enough? The clothing market is shifting online at pace and M&amp;S is seeking smaller (but sharper) ranges. A 10% slimming might be considered fearless if it were happening overnight but this is a five-year overhaul costing \u00a3350m, half of it in cash. Come 2021, it may be time to do it all over again.</p> <p>The supposed compensations for investors are twofold: M&amp;S is still generating plenty of cash and sees 200 pockets of the country that are deprived of the delights of Simply Food. The former is definitely a blessing, but less of the cash may find its way to investors: in the second-half of the financial year, shareholders will get an ordinary dividend but not a special on top. As for 200 more Simply Foods, the format is a proven winner but a 0.9% decline in like-for-like sales in the first half may be the first hint top-of-the-range food is becoming harder to shift.</p> <p>All in all, it\u2019s hard to find reasons to be cheerful. Underlying profits fell 18.6% to \u00a3231m in the first half and the next five years for M&amp;S look like hard graft for uncertain reward.</p>",
  "<p>Yet another cruel move that widens the gap between richest and poorest (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/damian-green-says-governments-benefits-cap-is-a-real-success\" title=\"\">Minister calls benefit cap a \u2018real success\u2019 as poorest lose \u00a32,000 a year more</a>, 7&#xa0;November). Claiming this will better enable those on benefits to find work adds insult to injury, and implies that the main barrier to employment is personal laziness rather than the lack of secure, adequately remunerated employment. Research finds that benefit cuts and sanctions actually make it harder to find work by adding stress and hassle to those already desperately trying to make ends meet. It will save a piffling \u00a3100m a year, yet will prove counterproductive as higher costs are put on to local authorities dealing with consequent homelessness, will add to NHS costs in greater sickness rates, and will damage educational prospects for the children affected. Can the government not join the dots when carrying out these moves? Or is personal misery and economic cost unimportant in its ideological drive?<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Even people who are in work on low pay can claim benefits. According to the government benefits calculator, if I were a single person with two children living in my borough of Haringey and earning the \u00a323,000 a year that is the benefit cap, I could claim over \u00a34,000 in child tax credit and almost \u00a312,000 a year in housing benefit. Admittedly I would be paying about \u00a34,000 a year on tax and national insurance, and \u00a31,300 a year on council tax, but I would still find it hard to make ends meet. Still, I would be considerably better off than a similar family, in similar circumstances, under this inhumane benefit cap. Of course I could always look for work but unfortunately there are not many jobs going in Haringey that pay \u00a323,000 a year. As for the possibility of a three-bedroom flat at \u00a312,000 a year, according to Rightmove they don\u2019t exist.<br><strong>Louise Lewis</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Regarding Larry Elliot\u2019s article on <a href=\"http://www4.shu.ac.uk/research/cresr/sites/shu.ac.uk/files/cresr30th-jobs-welfare-austerity.pdf\" title=\"\">the report by Christina Beatty and Steve Fothergill on welfare, work and austerity</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/half-of-uk-deficit-is-result-of-job-destruction-in-older-industrial-areas\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 7 November), we have just completed our own research on <a href=\"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.645005!/file/SSDevolutionPolicy.pdf\" title=\"\">Devolution and Disadvantage in the Sheffield City Region</a>, which can be viewed as a case study of a severely deindustrialised area of the north comprising South Yorkshire and north-east Derbyshire, former coal and steel communities.</p> <p>Our study findings are similar to Fothergill and Beatty, though we focus in more detail on two areas and these need to be fed into this very important debate on the nature and consequences of deindustrialisation in Britain. First, the nature of labour market disadvantage is complex and relates to a variety of groups such as women, young people and BAME people, as well as those on long-term sickness and disability benefits.</p> <p>The second area we explore is devolution policies and here we argue that the devolution deals and agreements are closely linked to austerity policies and the various cuts (some of these being welfare-rated). While the devolution deal for the Sheffield city region financially involves \u00a3900m over 30 years (subject of course to an elected mayor and other milestones), we have found that cuts to welfare and local authority budgets between 2010 and 2014 amounted to \u00a31.1bn. As outlined in the article and report, the welfare cuts in no way actually contribute to raising employment rates. In reality, austerity is contributing to increased personal and family impoverishment and debt. It is also seriously undermining the city-regional growth model trumpeted as the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. This is because of the distortions to the labour market through increasing segmentation, which welfare conditionality actually creates.</p> <p>This means that the actual impact of policies is that a more limited cohort of labour can access skills and apprenticeships, which is deemed as essential to devolution growth strategies.

One estimate suggests that 3,000 schools in Britain are likely to <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Health/article1618132.ece\" title=\"\">suffer pollution levels above the legal limit</a>. Yet the government lists just <a href=\"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/networks/find-sites\" title=\"\">155 monitoring sites across the country</a>. In the West Midlands, where 5 million people live, there are six. There are 10 in London and one apiece in Edinburgh, Bristol, Doncaster and several other places. In most British towns, there are none.</p> <p>But while the judgment will force the&#xa0;government to pay more attention, its response is certain to be both piecemeal and faint. There is no sustained political pressure for anything better. <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmenvfru/479/479.pdf\" title=\"\">The report on air quality</a> published by a House of Commons committee earlier this year is remarkable for the contrast between the ferocity of its criticism and the feebleness of the changes it proposes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba32cb09ecea789275bd6f8c42e9b544e86962be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba32cb09ecea789275bd6f8c42e9b544e86962be/0_0_2835_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust smoke from an Arriva in Luton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exhaust smoke from an Arriva in Luton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media/Tony Margiocchi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For example, it proposes a car scrappage scheme, but only for people who want to swap their old bangers for new bangers. Yet the same report points out that 75% of the particulate emissions that vehicles produce come from their tyres and brakes, and erosion of the road surface. In other words, every motor vehicle, including electric cars, can damage your health. So why not pay people to replace their old cars with no car, by issuing the incentive in the form of public transport tokens?</p> <p>Bicycles are mentioned only in passing.

But, while building up his new political movement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\">En Marche!</a>, he has played a long game, feeding months of speculation over his intentions and whether or not he would run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/emmanuel-macron-will-frances-young-economy-minister-launch-presidential-bid\">Will France's young economy minister \u2013 with a volunteer army \u2013 launch presidential bid?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Macron will \u201cdeclare his candidacy before 10 December\u201d a member of his team told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday. \u201cAll the conditions are in place.\u201d</p> <p>Macron\u2019s camp then played this down, saying only that he would make a decision on whether or not to run for president before 10 December, when he would hold a large rally in Paris. </p> <p>Speeding up the launch of a possible presidential bid would allow Macron to exploit the deep divisions on the French left. The Socialist party is in disarray, with a recent poll showing only 4% of people were satisfied with Hollande. The party base is increasingly disillusioned and there are serious questions over whether Hollande, or anyone else from the Socialist party, could even make it into the final runoff of the presidential race next May. </p> <p>The French presidential election is more open than any previously. Hollande is France\u2019s least popular president since the second world war, and is expected to announce next month whether he will attempt a re-election bid that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/francois-hollande-would-be-swept-aside-in-presidential-election-poll-shows\">some predict</a> is already doomed. Meanwhile, the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen is tipped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national\">easily make it through</a> to the final runoff. </p> <p>The French right will choose its presidential candidate in a primary race at the end of this month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/alain-juppe-france-prophet-happiness-presidential-wows-rally-crowd\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a>, the pro-business and socially moderate mayor of Bordeaux, is the favourite to win ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/le-comeback-kid-sarkozy-shapes-up-for-presidential-run-on-hardline-platform\">former president Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, who has run an increasingly hardline campaign, veering towards the themes of the far right. </p> <p>But it is the first time the right has held an open primary race to choose its candidate, making the turnout and result hard to predict. Jupp\u00e9 is currently rated France\u2019s most popular politician, and Macron \u2013 who shares similar free-market reform ideas \u2013 is the second most popular.</p> <p>Macron prides himself on his independence and belonging to no political party, saying it doesn\u2019t matter he has never before run for elected office. He describes himself as of the left but keen to bring together people from across the whole spectrum, including the right. Polls show he is most popular among rightwing, older and professional voters. But pollsters have said Macron has his work cut out to expand his support base.</p> <p>Only two years ago, when Macron was Hollande\u2019s chief adviser in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, he was totally unknown to the general public. The philosophy postgraduate and former Rothschild banker\u2019s rise to government minister was so extraordinary and unconventional that he is still known as a \u201cflying saucer\u201d on the political scene.</p> <p>Five years ago the notion that someone with no constituency or political party and no electoral experience could be a serious contender for the French presidency would have been unthinkable. But Macron \u2013 a pro-reformist, pro-business figure who served for two years in a Socialist government while insisting he was \u201cneither left nor right\u201d \u2013 has spent months building up financial and strategic backing for a presidential bid. He is seen as a product of the times: a non-politician wanting to take on politics. Yet, though he is a rebel, he is also a product of the establishment as a former minister and graduate of France\u2019s top civil service school. He is seen as someone new, but a safe pair of hands.</p> <p>As economy minister, Macron regularly launched scathing attacks on the left\u2019s defining characteristics \u2013 from the 35-hour-week to the large public sector \u2013 and repeatedly criticised the discrimination and inequality that still defined France\u2019s high-rise suburban estates. Not afraid of grand metaphors, Macron has likened his own rebellious streak to France\u2019s 15th-century saint and saviour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/joan-of-arc-ring-stays-in-france-after-appeal-to-queen\">Joan of Arc</a>.</p> <p>He has not yet set out his political platform \u2013 which he calls a mission to \u201ctransform France\u201d \u2013 but he has spoken of the need to cure France of its \u201cdemocratic malaise\u201d, warning of people\u2019s distrust of the political class.</p> <p>He has often been intentionally cryptic and is expected to flesh out his ideas in a book this month. \u201cFrance is a project, and that\u2019s the project I want to take further,\u201d he said at a rally in Montpellier last month.</p>",
  "<p>When The Crown debuted on Netflix last week, it drew immediate attention for its lavish look and for creator Peter Morgan\u2019s ambition to spend nearly 60 hours telling the full story of Queen Elizabeth II, from her youth to today. The Crown also raised eyebrows for the news that its backers spent over $100m to produce the series\u2019 first 10 episodes. Twenty years ago, the goal of any TV producer was to keep costs low and to make enough episodes to get a syndication deal, so that the money for reruns would keep rolling in. These days, companies are willing to spend big on just one short season, knowing that some viewers tend to look at high production values as a sign that a show\u2019s worth binge-watching.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWtnJjn6ng0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JWtnJjn6ng0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There are multiple reasons why a series can end up costing millions of dollars per episode \u2013 including cases like ER or Friends, where the show\u2019s popularity drives up the cast\u2019s salaries. With premium cable productions like HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones and Starz\u2019s Outlander, the feature film-level budgets tend to go unremarked upon, because the programs are so popular that no one pays much attention to how much they cost. But when reports surface on mega-deals like Amazon\u2019s just-announced $160m 16-episode Robert De Niro/Julianne Moore/David O Russell series, it\u2019s hard not to notice the huge risk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/03/the-crown-windsor-claire-foy-elizabeth-blockbuster\">The Crown: a huge ocean-going blockbuster \u2013 the Americans will love it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here then are a handful of expensive TV shows where the price tag has become as much a part of the conversation about them as anything actually on the screen.</p> <h2><strong>The Crown/The Get Down (Netflix)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usv442G6H8A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usv442G6H8A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Netflix\u2019s decision-makers drive conventional television programmers batty with their willingness to spend lavishly, regardless of commercial prospects. The Crown\u2019s reported $100m budget is about on-par with Baz Luhrmann\u2019s New York hip-hop/disco period-piece The Get Down \u2026 at least officially. (Some reports have its 12 episodes topping $200m.) In both cases, the price is part of the pitch, luring subscribers with the promise that their money is buying something they won\u2019t find anywhere else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/07/baz-luhrmann-the-get-down-rappers-delight\">Why Baz Luhrmann\u2019s The Get Down is a rapper\u2019s delight</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> The jury\u2019s still out on The Crown, which launched with great fanfare and has drawn some strong (but not ecstatic) reviews in the early going. Because Netflix is stingy with hard viewership data, it may be a while before we know whether The Crown\u2019s a hit. Third-party research suggests that Luhrmann\u2019s folly has disappointed with an estimated 3.2 million viewers in the 18-49 demo in the first month, less than half of the audience of the platform\u2019s most popular shows. </p> <h2><strong>Vinyl/Rome/Deadwood (HBO)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iphllcTYOs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1iphllcTYOs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019d be very easy to fill this list completely with HBO originals, given that the most premium of the premium cablers has a long history of laying out cash for everything from the vintage Atlantic City recreations of Boardwalk Empire to the star-studded cop action in True Detective. But some of the channel\u2019s most memorable would-be blockbusters have been the ones that never caught on enough to justify their bills, such as the soapy \u201970s rock music melodrama Vinyl (where the first episode alone cost $30m) the historical epic Rome (where HBO and the BBC split a budget of nearly $10m per episode) and the earthy, arty western Deadwood (which spent a comparatively modest $4.5m an episode to reconstruct an American frontier town). None of these series got to tell the full stories their creators intended; but each spent big to evoke bygone places and times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/11/deadwood-movie-film-what-to-watch-five-tv-shows\">Deadwood: what to watch until the movie rides into town</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> Deadwood remains beloved enough to land in the top 10 of critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz\u2019s new \u201cbest television of all time\u201d survey TV: The Book; and Rome has its cult as well. It\u2019s Vinyl though that will be a cautionary tale in the HBO offices for years to come, framed as a boondoggle so costly that it became one of the rare series to be renewed for a second season and then cancelled before any new episodes could be written or shot.</p> <h2><strong>Terra Nova/Utopia (Fox)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oux-2iZfNc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Oux-2iZfNc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The cable kingpins and streaming services don\u2019t have a monopoly on overpaying. In the 2010s, Fox gambled twice on concepts so complicated to execute that the network went ahead and put them on the primetime schedule without pilot episodes, because the executives figured that once they\u2019d spent the money to build the sets, they may as well use them. That\u2019s how TV viewers ended up with 13 episodes of Terra Nova, a strange science-fiction/cop show about a law enforcement officer who travels through time to live in a new colony established in a prehistoric era \u2013 complete with dinosaurs. The $20m two-hour premiere alone made the project hard to scrap. Even heavy preproduction expenditures couldn\u2019t save Utopia, a Big Brother/Survivor-style \u201cliving with strangers in the middle of nowhere\u201d reality series that was supposed to air twice a week for a full year, but was instead scratched after two months, before anybody had \u201cwon\u201d the \u201cgame\u201d. An elaborate set was supposed to pay for itself through repeated use, but the reported $50m experiment never got the chance to cover the network\u2019s investment.</p> <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> Kudos to Fox for taking a big swing, and trying to recapture the buzzy weirdness of ABC\u2019s Lost \u2013 a few years after such shows had become too extravagant for network TV. Still, if a channel\u2019s going to take these kinds of chances, the product has to be good. Terra Nova barely rose above mediocre, despite everyone\u2019s best efforts; and Utopia looked and felt like every other cheap reality competition, despite how much its custom-built location cost.</p> <h2><strong>Viva Laughlin (CBS)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtonEFBeZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9vtonEFBeZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Television has long struggled with how to integrate full-scale musical numbers into a weekly show, with some efforts (like Glee and Galavant) paying off either commercially or critically, and others (like Cop Rock) flopping miserably. CBS\u2019s Nevada-set dramedy Viva Laughlin seemed to have an edge with the participation of stage and movie star Hugh Jackman \u2013 a beloved, award-winning singer and dancer. But its premise was too vague, and its pop covers too corny. Even worse, the pilot alone cost nearly $7m, raising legitimate concerns over whether the music rights and elaborate production design were going to be an ongoing problem. Rather than risk ruin, the network cancelled Viva Laughlin after only two episodes aired.</p> <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> CBS has a reputation as the network that takes the fewest chances, so the real shame in the failure of something like Viva Laughlin is that it convinces an already cautious outlet to be even less adventurous. TV fans suffer as a result \u2026 even if it means we don\u2019t have to endure another show this bad.</p> <h2><strong>Battlestar Galactica (ABC)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrd767Xzfk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8hrd767Xzfk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The popularity of Star Wars gave writer/producer Glen A Larson an opportunity to pitch a longstanding dream project of his: an interstellar \u201cman against robot\u201d quest saga loosely inspired by his Mormon faith. ABC backed Battlestar Galactica with the then-princely sum of a million dollars an episode, and the series got off to a promising start in the ratings, but even with the extra cash, the effects weren\u2019t up to the standard of a major motion picture, and the stories were too juvenile to compensate for the shoddiness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/oct/20/worst-tv-pilots-ever\">The worst TV pilots ever: a Waterworld prequel, drag-racing PIs and furry fetish</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Worth it? </strong>Absolutely, if only because this quirky little cash-in inspired the SyFy Channel\u2019s brilliant 21st century reimagining.</p> <h2><strong>Kings/Supertrain (NBC)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUERtAe73NI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gUERtAe73NI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s hard even to explain Kings, a retelling of the biblical story of David set in an alternate history version of our modern times. But whatever creator Michael Green had in mind, it required a huge cast of characters and a budget for costumes and art direction that reportedly pushed each episode past the $4m mark \u2013 or too much to pay for the series\u2019 paltry viewership. After one 13-episode season, Kings ended up on the same shelf as other big-ticket NBC misses, alongside 1979\u2019s Supertrain, a bizarre attempt to replicate the success of ABC\u2019s anthology series The Love Boat, on \u2026 well, a really big train. And not just any big train, but one that was said to have cost $5m to build.</p> <p><strong>Worth it?</strong> Supertrain is a legendary botch, representative of the general creative bankruptcy and crass commercial instincts of TV executives in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s. Kings though was a thing of beauty: a bold, unclassifiable hybrid of history, fantasy and literature. No matter how much they cost, without flawed experiments like Kings, television would dry up altogether as an art form.</p>",

Since fugitive emissions are rarely measured, they are not properly accounted for, and could jeopardise any attempt to meet emissions reduction pledges made in Paris.</p> <p>If fugitive emissions from the coal seam gas industry in Australia were anywhere near what they are in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/26/australia-coal-seam-gas-emissions-may-be-vastly-underestimated-report\">coal seam gas would be worse for the climate than coal</a>.</p> <p>Cartwright said the industry should fight attempts to regulate gas pipelines. In April the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/East%20Coast%20Gas%20Inquiry%20key%20findings_0.pdf\">found evidence</a> that \u201ca large number of pipeline operators have been engaging in monopoly pricing\u201d.</p> <p>The ACCC pointed out that other countries, such as New Zealand and the US, imposed much stronger regulation.

Frydenberg described the change as \u201cthe most significant reforms to the domestic gas market in two decades\u201d.</p> <p>It did not propose regulating prices, which other commentators have suggested, but which the gas industry strongly opposes.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, if you want to phase out oil and gas completely, you might like the idea of increasing economic regulation, which would stymie investment,\u201d Cartwright told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Bruce Robertson, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the industry was overdue for regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThe pipeline companies are gouging the consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it and are fearful that sensible regulation as to price and capacity will come in. Essentially gas transmission pipelines are natural monopolies and Australia is unique in the western world at not regulating them.</p> <p>\u201cThe US has far better disclosure rules and still heavily regulates them. In Australia we need both far more comprehensive disclosure on a pipeline by pipeline basis and also strong regulation. Regulation of monopolies is not anti market. No market exists and hence the need for regulation.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>English football has been far too slow to tackle an environment where homophobia is still sometimes \u201ctolerated\u201d and gay players are scared to come out, a parliamentary committee was told on Tuesday. The warning came from the former NBA star John Amaechi, who said he was in contact with Premier League players who were afraid to be open about their sexuality because they knew their clubs and managers would not be supportive.</p> <p>Amaechi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/04/features.sport4\" title=\"\">the first NBA player to come out in 2007</a>, told MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee that there were \u201cmultiple\u201d reasons why the gay Premier League players he knew had not come out, including fears of how they would be treated by their clubs. \u201cSome of them feel that their team specifically would not be supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cNot their team-mates, but the coaches, the club and the administration around them. They either know them to be openly hostile, having stood in conversations or having overheard conversations that were incontrovertible, or suspected it. It is interesting how many of them I know are out to a greater or lesser extent to their family, friends and a selection of their team-mates. It\u2019s amazing to me that people don\u2019t realise that there are lots of players whose \u2018manager\u2019 picks them up after training \u2013 and that can\u2019t always be the case.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/04/features.sport4\">Why I've come out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amaechi also pointed to another reason why a top player had not come out: they did not want to be defined by their sexuality. \u201cOne day your achievements define you, the next day your sexuality does and I can tell you that is irritating.\u201d</p> <p>The British race walker Tom Bosworth, who came out as gay before the Rio Olympics, told the MPs that a gay footballer would be \u201ca game-changer\u201d for the way LGBT athletes were treated in the UK.</p> <p>Bosworth said while British Athletics had been tremendously supportive to him personally, he was in contact with gay stars from other sports who had not come out, including one who was a \u201cfar bigger name than me\u201d but was not in an \u201csafe environment\u201d to do so. \u201cI think it highlights the support isn\u2019t there from clubs, team-mates and managers all the way through,\u201d he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/28/usa.americansports\">Gary Younge talks to sports star John Amaechi on coming out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year the Daily Mirror claimed that two Premier League players \u2013 including an England international \u2013 were preparing to publicly come out as gay by the start of the 2016-17 season and had the full support of their respective clubs and the Football Association. However, that did not happen, and it remains the case that no top British footballer has said they were gay while playing at the highest levels of the game.</p> <p>In October the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/fa-sam-allardyce-appointment-parliamentary-committee\" title=\"\">told MPs that he was \u201cpersonally ashamed\u201d</a> no gay players in the Premier League had felt able to come out, and cited a small minority of people who hurled vile abuse at players as being the main factor.</p> <p>But Amaechi told the select committee that while there was a small minority of fans who \u201cbecame freed up to behave badly\u201d when they entered football stadiums, the culture in the game \u201ccould be changed tomorrow\u201d if senior figures in football had the will to act more firmly.</p> <p>\u201cIn most businesses, managers get blamed for the people they lead. And yet somehow we are led to believe that fans are somehow feral and uncontrollable and we have got no choice to let them do what they want?\u201d asked Amaechi, who said the lack of sanction for football\u2019s leaders for sexist emails or homophobic behaviour in the past had sent a message to fans that what they did was OK too.</p> <p>\u201cFootball has all the resources it wants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has the resources to hire the best cultural change people. We do not accept in workplaces the kind of things that we accept in sport. They could change it tomorrow if they want to. The fact they haven\u2019t is down to their will. Nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>He also urged sporting authorities to provide education about homophobia for coaches at all levels after agreeing with one MP that he had never heard a Premier League manager talk about the issue. \u201cThey could demand coaches at every level stop being emotionally illiterate and intellectual disinterested troglodyte men who are willing to sustain the status quo as it stands,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Amaechi, who is black, admitted he was surprised to be still having a conversation about homophobia in sport. \u201cThis is not an intractable problem to be solved. The things that are tolerated with homophobia are not tolerated when it comes to race. It is a tacit message from sport that the colour of my skin is worthy of protection but my sexuality is not.\u201d</p>",

Earl Spencer said the press had \u201ca direct hand\u201d in his sister\u2019s death and contacted tabloid editors to tell them they <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/earl-spencer-asks-tabloid-editors-not-to-attend-funeral-1.103401\">would not be welcome</a> at her funeral, after they had been invited by Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>The shock of the princess\u2019s death led to the famous temporary truce, with newspaper editors agreeing not to use paparazzi pictures and agreeing to end <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/after-diana-the-media-drinking-in-the-last-chance-saloon-1174321.html\">\u201cdeplorable practices\u201d</a> in their coverage of the royals.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/08/prince-harry-criticises-incessant-intrusions-private-life-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4jx6h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500649\"            data-video-name=\"Prince Harry: 'everyone has the right to privacy' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC1 The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572f28f9e4b002f4e7ed8387\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/08/160508harry_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/08/160508harry.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/08/160508harry_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/08/160508harry_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/08/160508harry_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/08/prince-harry-criticises-incessant-intrusions-private-life-video\">Prince Harry: \u2018everyone has the right to privacy\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The young princes were allowed substantial privacy while growing up, but remained uncomfortable in their dealings with the media. In 2002, Harry was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1757448.stm\">exposed for drinking underage and using cannabis</a>; two years later, he was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3762200.stm\">involved in a scuffle with reporters</a> as he left a nightclub, reportedly shouting: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, as the relationship between William and Kate Middleton intensified, the then regulator, the Press Complaints Commission, circulated a letter to editors claiming Middleton was being harassed. It worked. The publisher of the Sun and News of the World announced that it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/09/newsinternational.royalsandthemedia\">would no longer publish paparazzi pictures</a> of her. MPs <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6290066.stm\">later said she had been \u201chounded\u201d</a> and subjected to \u201cpersistent harassment\u201d.</p> <p>The couple were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/03/royal-honeymooners-left-alone-tabloids-pledge\">largely left alone on honeymoon</a> after their marriage in 2011, but when topless photographs of the duchess emerged the following year the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-william-furious-topless-photographs\">palace was furious</a>, calling them a \u201cgrotesque and totally unjustifiable\u201d invasion of privacy, and saying it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d for anyone to reproduce them. The photographs did not appear in a mainstream UK publication, but were published in the French magazine Closer and widely available online. </p> <p>That incident illustrated the scale of the difficulty the family faced in controlling their image in a global media market where they were of huge international interest. It was not a British newspaper, for instance, but the US website The Drudge Report that revealed Prince Harry was serving in Afghanistan in 2008, forcing him to be urgently pulled out of Helmand. On that occasion, the British media had been aware of the deployment but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/28/military.afghanistan\">agreed to observe a strict media blackout</a>. </p> <p>Even if it is impossible to restrict every outlet, however, it is clear the family will do their best to control what they can. \u201c[Prince Harry] knows this is not a magic wand and this stuff will continue,\u201d a royal source said. \u201cBut he no longer felt comfortable in himself having so much written about someone not because of who she is, but because of who he is.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A generation ago, a man like David Brunelle would probably be working through the autumn of a long career for the same manufacturer in north-eastern Ohio.

After a late surge in polls, Trump holds a 2.2% lead <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_trump_vs_clinton-5634.html\">in the RealClearPolitics average</a>.

Only eight years ago, 86% of presidential primary voters in Youngstown and the surrounding Mahoning County, for instance, were Democrats and just 14% were Republicans. This year, the split was 51-49.</p> \n<p>Under Barack Obama, Ohio\u2019s economy has recovered steadily from the 2008 recession. The number of manufacturing jobs in the state has actually ticked up slightly in recent years, after falling sharply and consistently under the administration of George W Bush.</p> \n<p>Trump has, however, relentlessly claimed that the sector\u2019s decades-long structural decline was somehow caused directly by Clinton and her husband, Bill, who was president when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which was signed by his predecessor, came into force.</p> \n<p>The Republican nominee has turned the trade pact into a shorthand for one of the central themes of his campaign: that leaders in Washington, supposedly incapable of standing up to canny foreigners, have left US workers exposed to the ravages of international competition without protection.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery time you see a closed factory or wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Springfield last month.</p> \n<p>However untrue, the message has resonated deeply with workers such as Brunelle, who long for the stability enjoyed by their parents and grandparents.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause of global competition, we have to compete with second- and third-rate countries around the world,\u201d he said, noting that he and his friends discuss Nafta quite a bit these days.</p> \n<p>Until last year, Brunelle managed a plant in the town of Bedford for Production Pattern, a company which makes moulds for vehicles. But the firm was buffeted by competition from China, he said, where companies could sell finished moulds for less than the cost of the materials he and his colleagues were using to make them. Some jobs at Brunelle\u2019s plant were moved out of state and others went overseas, he said. Brunelle lost his position, which paid him $70,000 a year.</p> \n<p>Before that, Brunelle was a plant manager for Water Star, a hi-tech manufacturer in Newbury, Ohio. The firm makes anodes and cathodes that are used to purify and treat water. But then Water Star was bought by Tennant, a commercial cleaning company from Minnesota, which wanted the technology for its floor scrubbers. Brunelle lost his job.</p> \n<p>As he wandered around a state-sponsored jobs fair in Akron on Monday, Brunelle winced at the sort of positions on offer at many of the stands.</p> \n<p>Packing boxes of potato chips on the midnight shift for $30,000 a year. Helping gamblers use video slot machines at an out-of-town mega-casino for $10 an hour plus tips. Serving sandwiches in a popular fast-food outlet for $9 an hour.</p> \n<p>Brunelle is a smart man. He knows the arguments in favor of globalisation, knows how difficult it would be for any president to turn back the clock. But as he sets off to wander the aisles for a few more minutes while employers begin dismantling their stalls, it\u2019s just difficult to take.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the long term, maybe it is good for the world economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to go down for the rest of them to go up. And it hurts.\u201d</p>",

She will have to get used to it.</p> <p>EU leaders are planning a meeting in December to discuss Brexit without the British prime minister, the Guardian has learnt.</p> <p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, wants the EU\u2019s 27 remaining member states to discuss Brexit around the time of an EU summit scheduled for 15-16 December, according to two Brussels sources.</p> <p>The British prime minister would attend the EU summit, but would not be invited to separate Brexit talks, the third time the UK has been excluded from leaders\u2019 talks since it joined the bloc in 1973. EU leaders met without David Cameron soon after the Brexit vote and held the summit in Slovakia without Theresa May in September.</p> <p>The meeting is a sign the EU27 are intensifying preparations on Britain\u2019s EU exit ahead of article 50, which May has promised to trigger by the end of March.</p> <p>Once the UK fires the starting gun on talks, the EU will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations, a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of Gibraltar.</p> <p>That work hasn\u2019t started yet, but Tusk wants to start preparing the ground. One senior EU diplomat told the Guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and precision: \u201cif the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to adopt, if they are very detailed, they are likely to take more time.\u201d</p> <p>Brussels diplomats are keenly following Brexit fallout in the UK.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary, one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system. The reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism.</p> <p>The democratic structure of the UK and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system. The tragic recent history of Europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts. That road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction. I would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste, will want to reflect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Explaining to the assembly in Cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing, Antoniw said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.</p> <p>I think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage, as the high court itself said, this case involves a pure question of law. It is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the European Union and the politics surrounding that.</p> <p>The sole legal question at issue is whether the UK Government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the European Union. In seeking to intervene in any appeal, the Welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law: core, established principles of British constitutional law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Antoniw emphasised that the Welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having outlined what the case is about I should also make a comment on what it is not about. The first minister has made crystal clear and I repeat that sentiment now: the Welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821fae1e4b07ceadb3a39c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T16:23:28.701Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The legal commentator <strong>Joshua Rozenberg </strong>has posted a good story <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaRozenbergQC/posts/222545208167403\">on his Facebook page.</a> He says that Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination.

That may sound like cheating, but the IFS commends this approach.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only two targets managed to be met consistently: that is the coalition government\u2019s initial target to aim for a cyclically-adjusted balance on the current budget five years out and its subsequent revised target to aim to achieve this three years out. It is perhaps not a coincidence that these two targets also had much to commend them. In contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary (\u201cwhen did the cycle start and end?\u201d, \u201cwhy 40% of GDP?\u201d, \u201cwhy should debt definitely fall between two future points in time?\u201d, \u201cwhy should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed level?\u201d) and/or were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks (\u201cwhy must there be an overall surplus in 2019\u201320?\u201d, \u201cwhy must borrowing in 2013\u201314 be no more than half what it was in 2009\u201310?\u201d). The weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5821f373e4b029b92ca46a93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T15:56:12.758Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more pictures from Theresa May\u2019s India tour today.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d176b3adef39ae79e585ec2987b24bec5ccc00/0_94_3390_2035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May stands amidst Hindu priests after offering prayers to the Hindu deity Lord Shiva during a visit to Someshwara Temple in Bangalore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251caa6fb2448a24d14bdb9d5a5a440c5be45572/0_240_4716_2829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/218aad3cbba35767c27daa88731119c5ca0ceda1/0_240_4507_2705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May at the Sri Someshwara Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8fddb7a9257352c02f8eb4a75fbc86dcc47256/0_0_3092_5184/596.jpg\" alt=\"Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.\" width=\"596\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hindu priests brief British Prime Minister Theresa May, center, during her visit to Someshwara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is what Number 10 said about the visit in a briefing note sent out in advance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will visit the Sri Someshwara Temple in the Ulsoor District of Bengaluru later today to pay her respects at this ancient Hindu place of worship.</p> <p>She will be welcomed by a guard of honour consisting of garlanders (who place a garland of fragrant flowers around the neck) and musicians playing drums and horns. </p> <p>She will then tour the temple, built by the Chola dynasty (300 BCE\u20131279 CE) and showcasing an impressive mixture of Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagar architecture.</p> <p>Someshwara means \u201che who wears the moon on his head\u201d, and is another name for Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in the Hindu triumvirate.</p> <p>The prime minister will conclude her visit by participating in a Hindu Aarti (blessing).

So we should all give a lot of thought to that when you\u2019re talking to your friends and neighbours and trying to influence them. The first thing this election is about is how to restore broad-based prosperity and growth to the American economy. And I hope in the next presidential debate she and Senator Sanders and the others will be able to talk about what the best way to do that is. Hillary says that you have to have a campaign that appeals to the struggling, the striving and the successful. We have to do this together. And Bernie says just go get the money from the millionaires. And it sounds good because there\u2019s \u2013 to a lot of people, if you look all over the world \u2013 the British Labor Party disposed of its most (inaudible) leader, David Miliband, because they were mad at him for being part of Tony Blair\u2019s government in the Iraq War. And they moved to the left and put his brother in as leader because the British labor movement wanted it. When David Cameron thumped him in the election, they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they hadn\u2019t moved far left enough, and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the British Labor Party, who I saw in the press today said that he was really a British citizen and had real British (inaudible). (Laughter.) </p> <p>But what that is reflective of \u2013 the same thing happened in the Greek election \u2013 when people feel they\u2019ve been shafted and they don\u2019t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them. And that is perfectly psychologically understandable and predictable. Most people in America haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. 86 percent of the American people, adjusted for inflation, have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash. The median income of American families, adjusted for inflation, is lower than it was the day I left office. </p> <p>So this election, first of all, should be: how do we restore broad-based prosperity? We\u2019ve only had one period in 50 years, since the early 1960s, when all segments of the American economy grew together, and that was the eight years when I served. You have to work at that. It is not an accident. That\u2019s a matter of policy. It really does matter what you do. And I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we moved 100 times as many people out of poverty into the middle class through work as happened in the Reagan years.

But building a plan for further austerity in the next parliament would be prudent. Indeed even if a balanced headline budget was delivered in 2020\u201321 and then maintained thereafter public sector net debt would not be on course to reach its pre-crisis level of 40% of national income until around the mid-2040s. Unfortunately if anything the \u00a325 billion estimated deterioration in the public finances in 2019\u201320 is likely to understate the increase in the longer-term challenge that has occurred since the March Budget. The OBR\u2019s previous long-run projections were based on an optimistic assumption about NHS productivity growth which they have recently said is likely to be revised down in their future projections. More fundamentally any reduction in future immigration, any reduction in longer-term growth or any increase in future interest rates would make the fiscal arithmetic harder still. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning Nick Gibb, the education minister, and Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, are both giving evidence to select committees.

At present, he said, the UK spent more annually on the winter fuel allowance than on the Foreign Office, while the department\u2019s budget was only twice the UK aid budget to Ethiopia.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is, whatever our ambition and intent, the process of our EU separation will suck our policy and political energy inwards, far more so if it leads to an existential crisis over Scotland or a deterioration of peace and and security in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cOther countries that had the UK down as a stable and active player in world affairs are unsure at the moment where we are heading.\u201d</p> <p>Although he insisted Britain could yet retain global influence outside the EU, through other international institutions such as Nato and the UN, Fraser warned there was no point denying that the decision to leave affected how the UK conducted foreign policy.</p> <p>To tackle the problem Fraser urged a revamp of Whitehall departments, saying May had fragmented the international effort, with six different government departments now leading on foreign and security policy.</p> <p>He said the Foreign Office should be handed the same coordinating role over foreign affairs as the Treasury enjoys over economic policy. He suggested the Department of International Development and the Department of International Trade could be incorporated into the Foreign Office.</p> <p>He disclosed Whitehall was facing \u201can uphill struggle\u201d to respond to Brexit and that since there had been no planning for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, Whitehall was still in the process of analysing options for a future relationship. The Foreign Office in particular was preparing an initiative setting out how the UK could retain close security and foreign policy relations with the EU, even though in future it will be excluded from its meetings and denied access to papers.</p> <p>Fraser said continued diplomatic and security influence would come with continued economic success, and urged the government not to imagine it would be easy to build a new economic relationship away from the EU. \u201cThat is why a rational outcome on our future relationship with the EU single market is essential,\u201d he said</p> <p>Fraser also urged the cabinet not to think Britain could build a reliable economic future by engaging only with non-European countries such as China and India. \u201cWe export more to Belgium at the moment than we do to India, Russia Brazil and South Africa combined,\u201d he said. Although UK trade with these countries was growing, the structure of UK trade was not going to shift rapidly.

  "<p>A global \u201cgreening\u201d of the planet has significantly slowed the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since the start of the century, according to new research.</p> <p>More plants have been growing due to higher CO2 levels in the air and warming temperatures that cut the CO2 emitted by plants via respiration. The effects led the proportion of annual carbon emissions remaining in the air to fall from about 50% to 40% in the last decade.</p> <p>However, this greening is only offsetting a small amount of the billions of tonnes of CO2 emitted from fossil fuel burning and other human activities and will not halt dangerous global warming. \u201cUnfortunately, this increase is nowhere near enough to stop climate change,\u201d said Dr Trevor Keenan, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US, who led the new work.</p> <p>The absolute level of CO2 in the atmosphere is continuing to rise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/24/new-era-of-climate-change-reality-as-emissions-hit-symbolic-threshold\">breaking the milestone of 400 parts per million (ppm) in 2015</a>, and rising temperatures continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/17/shattered-records-climate-change-emergency-today-scientists-warn\">surpass records</a>.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://public.wmo.int/en\">World Meteorological Organisation</a> (WMO) warned on Tuesday that 2011-15 was the hottest five-year period ever recorded and that climate change had increased the risk of half of extreme weather events, with some heatwaves made 10 times more likely by global warming.</p> <p>The new study on global greening is <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/NCOMMS13428\">published in Nature Communications</a> by an international team of scientists who concluded cutting carbon emissions remains vital to preventing severe climate change. </p> <p>\u201cEnhanced carbon uptake by the biosphere to date has slowed the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 and our results [suggest] uptake has been especially strong recently,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWithout effective reduction of global CO2 emissions, however, future climate change remains a stark reality.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia, who was not part of the new research, said: \u201cNatural vegetation is a fantastic help in slowing down climate change by absorbing about a quarter of our carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. </p> <p>\u201cFundamentally though, this help is not enough to stop the planet warming \u2013 far from it \u2013 carbon emissions have to drop to almost zero to stop global warming.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists used extensive land, air and satellite data to assess how carbon uptake by plants has changed over recent decades and used modelling to help untangle the different factors underlying the changes. It has been unclear whether the fertilisation effect of higher CO2 levels for plants is outweighed by the harm caused to them by warming and droughts.</p> <p>The researchers found that between 1960 and 2000 the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere was increasing every year, but that after 2000 the rate slowed to about the same increase every year. They found that the main factor was the higher CO2 levels, which were just 290ppm at the start of the last century, compared to 400ppm today.</p> <p>Another factor was the slower rate of global temperature increase after 2000, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/24/study-drives-a-sixth-nail-in-the-global-warming-pause-myth\">so-called \u201cpause\u201d</a> during which more of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases went into the oceans than the air. This meant the increasing respiration of plants driven by rising heat was curbed, trapping more carbon.</p> <p>Prof Chris Rapley, at University College London, said: \u201cThe researchers make it clear that this effect is almost certainly temporary. The \u2018greening\u2019 effect of CO2 will ultimately be overwhelmed by the plants\u2019 own respiration and decay, which will cause even more CO2 to be released.\u201d</p> <p>The research also shows the importance of preserving forests and other ecosystems that absorb carbon, said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh: \u201cThe land and oceans have been bailing us out of dangerous climate change for decades. Unless key carbon sinks such as forests are better protected, the delicate green veil that has saved our worst climate blushes will be in tatters.\u201d</p> <p>The WMO submitted its new report to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-22-un-climate-change-conference-marrakech\">UN climate change summit taking place in Morocco</a>. \u201cWe just had the hottest five-year period on record, with 2015 claiming the title of hottest individual year. Even that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/2016-locked-into-being-hottest-year-on-record-nasa-says\">record is likely to be beaten in 2016</a>,\u201d said WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas.</p> <p>\u201cThe effects of climate change have been consistently visible on the global scale since the 1980s: rising global temperature, both over land and in the ocean; sea-level rise; and the widespread melting of ice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has increased the risks of extreme events such as heatwaves, drought, record rainfall and damaging floods.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Impartiality lies at the very heart of good journalism \u2013 avoiding bias is something on which respectable media outlets pride themselves. This is laudable, as robust debate is vital for a healthy media and, by extension, an informed society. But when the weight of scientific evidence points incontrovertibly one direction, doggedly reporting both \u201csides\u201d equally can result in misleading coverage.</p> <p>The BBC provided a high-profile example of this in 2011, coming in for harsh criticism in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/science_impartiality.pdf\">a Trust report</a> which singled out their \u201cundue attention to marginal opinion\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em> on the subject of man made climate change, among other issues. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate change, the report found that several BBC shows fell victim to an \u201cover-rigid application of editorial guidelines on impartiality,\u201d resulting in far too much airtime for climate change deniers. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf\">follow-up report published in 2014</a> concluded that this key conclusion \u201cstill resonates today\u201d. </p> <p>This situation, known as <a href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/media-debates-on-science-delicately-balanced/\">false balance</a>, arises when journalists present opposing view-points as being more equal than the evidence allows. But when the evidence for a position is virtually incontrovertible, it is profoundly mistaken to treat a conflicting view as equal and opposite by default. With respect to man made climate change, the BBC is far from the only outlet skewing their coverage in the name of balance, and global <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/media-debates-on-science-delicately-balanced/\">coverage on climate science remains exceptionally off-kilter</a> with the scientific consensus. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Part of the problem is that good science reporting requires a keen understanding of scientific method and the importance of evidence. In the absence of this, dubious views can perpetuate. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield held a press conference, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/\">claiming a link between autism and the MMR vaccine</a>. These allegations received scant attention from dedicated science journalists, who were familiar with anti-vaccination tropes and acutely aware of the paucity of evidence for Wakefield\u2019s claims. Anti-MMR activists instead targeted their stories at non-science journalists, selling them as human interest pieces.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> This strategy was devastatingly effective \u2013 as author and academic<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bad-science-2.html\"> Ben Goldacre recounts</a>, a staggering <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.badscience.net/2003/12/mmr-never-mind-the-facts/\">10% of science stories in 2002 were MMR-related</a>, with over 80% of these pieces penned by non-science journalists. In Goldacre\u2019s words:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cSuddenly we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the au pair on the way to a dinner party.\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Editors and writers who lacked knowledge of the requisite science fell into a default assumption that two mutually opposed views must have equal merit. But the lack of evidence for such ominous claims was still rather telling, and investigative journalist Brian Deer began to scrutinise Wakefield. Deer\u2019s work eventually exposed financial conflicts of interest and unethical conduct, and in time <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm\">Wakefield\u2019s MMR claims were exposed as false</a>.</p> <p>Since then, a wealth of data has <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmr-vaccine.html\">continued to show the MMR vaccine to be completely safe</a>.The consequences of the needless panic, however, were anything but \u2013 faced with conflicting reports and unable to gauge their respective veracity, parents opted to not vaccine their children, with deadly results and an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/\">on-going resurgence of measles worldwide</a>.</p> <p>None of this is intended to pin the blame for these deleterious consequences on journalists and media outlets alone, but the fact that anti-vaccine activists could exploit the ideal of impartiality is a worrying one. The assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply doesn\u2019t hold when the overwhelming weight of evidence points resolutely in one direction</p> <p>It does however require a certain amount of expertise to gauge this, and for media outlets discerning between valid science and pseudoscience can be a difficult task. Journalists are under tremendous pressure to produce engaging copy, with tight deadlines. One way of reducing false balance and poor reportage is to put scientific experts in direct contact with those covering the story, and organisations such as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/working-with-us/for-scientists/\">Science Media Centre</a> and <a href=\"http://senseaboutscience.org/\">Sense About Science</a> have had considerable success in such endeavours. I strongly recommend that scientists register their expertise with these groups to help stem the tide of misinformation. </p> <p>Scientific public engagement is helpful, but the question of when and how to engage is rife with complications. I encountered this recently, when an Irish radio station asked me to discuss the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/vaxxed\">anti-vaccine documentary Vaxxed</a> with its star \u2013 the aforementioned Andrew Wakefield. The producer claimed a rival broadcaster had offered him a slot with a sympathetic host and no counterpoint, and that there was strong local public pressure for him to appear. </p> <p> I grudgingly agreed to provide a counter, with the caveat that I would be allowed articulate why giving him a platform to air discredited views was itself unethical. The experience was a frustrating one, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sVzMcZzqC5E?t=589]\">predictably generating more heat than light</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>This is the crux of the issue with false balance - no matter how noble the intention of media outlets, presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format gives a false impression that an issue is scientifically contentious. Worse again, it gives free rein for dubious motivations to masquerade as scientific opinion. Whether the issue is vaccination, climate-change, alt-med or anything else, presenting an evidence-free belief as being on equal footing with an established scientific understanding is corrosive to public understanding. I asked scientist, author and broadcaster Simon Singh for his take on this unfortunate trend, and in his view such media requests are as time-wasting as they are inept:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cEvery situation is different, but I am increasingly declining interviews about, say, homeopathy, because it is not my job to provide false balance and thereby justify bad journalism. Most recently a BBC local radio station wanted to have a jolly chat about cupping in light of its use by Olympic athletes. I declined, because the piece was inevitably going to be (a) Simon says it is rubbish, (b) cupping therapists says it works for some people, (c) patient says it worked for them, (d) hosts says that opinion is divided, but isn\u2019t it interesting, and (e) a series of callers ring in with their tales of cupping miracles. I don\u2019t want to be part of that sort of journalism.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It needn\u2019t be this way, however: it is entirely possible for media outlets to cover publicly contentious topics in an informative and responsible manner. The BBC has quite admirably now given its reporters training on how to avoid false balance and present complex and contentious science, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/science_impartiality/trust_conclusions.pdf\">pointing out that</a> \u201c... science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views but depends on the varying degree of prominence (due weight) such views should be given.\u201d<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em></p> <p>Part of the disconnect is that there can be a wide gulf between the scientific consensus and public opinion, with broadcasters resorting to false balance to appease their audience. But rather than default to adversarial white-noise, media outlets might benefit from framing such issues in context as a discussion. As an example of this, I was recently a radio guest with Dr Ciara Kelly, discussing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jan/11/why-is-there-opposition-hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer\">controversy over the HPV vaccine</a>. Rather than enforce a contrived debate scenario, Dr Kelly and her producers explained to listeners why it they were opting to avoid false balance, whilst still tackling people\u2019s fears. The result of this was, in my view, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newstalk.com/podcasts/Alive_and_Kicking/Alive_And_Kicking/162104/The_HPV_Vaccine\">an informative dialogue</a> that explored misconceptions whilst putting them firmly in scientific context. </p> <p>When the science is relatively clear-cut, this kind of approach is orders of magnitude better than conjuring up a pointless debate, as it gives an audience an understanding of the evidence base these views are built upon. With such an approach, it is possible to cover dissenting views too, and to explore why these are not scientifically accepted. This is far more constructive and understandable than the default paradigm of two talking heads shouting one another down </p> <p>Media outlets have an important role to play in conveying vital information and view-points, pushing a standard for fact-checking and quality control that may be lacking in more fragmented modern media. But engaging in false balance undermines this strength and risks giving debunked or dangerous fringe views an air of legitimacy and the oxygen of publicity \u2013 and ultimately, such sophism leaves us all more divided and less informed. </p>",

This is really disappointing because the food department is great as it offers lots of products we don\u2019t usually get here. I like their traditionally British foods, such as scones, and all their nice meats. The clothes are a bit traditional and not really exciting, however. They are also a bit overpriced, but I will definitely miss the food. I also feel it\u2019s a missed opportunity as lots of people in this area could be potential customers and many are upset about the closure. I read a Twitter post today from a food blogger in the Netherlands who said: \u201cNo, not more bad news!\u201d</p> <h2>Gregory Baser, 58, Plymouth: \u2018The sizing has really changed over the years, which is frustrating\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0a58b966c0e227c240a0b761c535a15b23fd11ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a58b966c0e227c240a0b761c535a15b23fd11ed/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Gregory Baser\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I love the Sparks card and its targeted promotions, the underpants and socks, the trousers (especially the coloured ones). I like the suits. I am a loyal customer and have shopped there for more than 45 years, but even though I am a fan of the clothing I do feel it\u2019s got worse over time. For example, with the shirts there are now much less options in terms of colour. Also the sizing has really changed over the years, and shirts I bought years ago that were XXLs are XXXLs today. Being forced up a size means there\u2019s less on offer for me in terms of variety. <br></p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s takeaway food is its strongest food selling point, but the lunchtime deals have got a bit more complicated. There\u2019s now more on offer but that shouldn\u2019t be at the detriment of losing classics, such as the cheese and tomato ones. They offer a nice in-store bakery in their main branch in Plymouth but sometimes the portions aren\u2019t big enough. </p> <p>I am disappointed that they are giving up on a lot of their clothes stores overall. I know it must be difficult with stores like Primark opening up but they used to be really great. And it felt like they were taking some steps in the right direction, for example by sorting out their website. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb6e5d242e7f7d8337c56c5a4b1438b60a30a1c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb6e5d242e7f7d8337c56c5a4b1438b60a30a1c2/0_337_1823_2397/761.jpg\" alt=\"M & S sandwich\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s takeaway food is it\u2019s strongest food selling point.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stephanie Wong, 38, London: \u2018The only person the Alexa Chung range looks good on is, well, Alexa Chung\u2019<br></h2> <p>They do the best lunch salads of any high-street chain. And all the fruit, sweets, drinks \u2013 basically, if you want a posh picnic in the summer you can\u2019t beat M&amp;S. It will cost a bomb though. Baby and children\u2019s clothes, socks and underpants are always reliable, and good value.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t know who 'Mrs M&S' is, but she has been wearing hideous T-shirts and cardigans in lurid reds  for far too long.</p> <footer> <cite>Stephanie Wong</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They do some really lovely textured, super comfortable sleepwear too. I have these lightweight lounge pants that I am obsessed with. The crockery is also good value and reasonable quality. Their women\u2019s daytime clothing range, however, is still terrible. The only person the Alexa Chung range looks good on is, well, Alexa Chung. On any average-sized woman, her whole range looks frumpy. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know who \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d is, but the poor woman has been wearing hideous T-shirts and cardigans in lurid tomato reds and hideous deep electric blues in stiff cotton for far too long. I would love it if M&amp;S refocused its clothing line for women on \u201cbasics\u201d along the lines of its children\u2019s range. They could also take a leaf out of H&amp;M in terms of basic design standards, fabrics and versatile colours. Or just copy their underpants, sock and children\u2019s clothes, to be honest. Just don\u2019t touch the children\u2019s clothes, they are so good. </p> <h2>Callum, 35, Merseyside: \u2018The high-quality food products are what makes M&amp;S so brilliant\u2019</h2> <p>M&amp;S food products are brilliant and noticeably higher quality than many other food retailers for the most part. This is their strongest area. They do also have extremely well-designed homeware. This leaves their clothing ranges as the weaker link, but they definitely serve a core audience. Their attempts at chasing a younger market haven\u2019t worked but it would be a shame if their ranges were removed completely. It seems like they need simpler and fewer ranges, with a clearer target market. </p> <p>It would be sad to see stores close. As a British person it is reassuring to see M&amp;S stores in other countries, particularly when buying food. Hopefully this will remain unaltered. I\u2019ve shopped at M&amp;S for more than 10 years, my family always went there and as a young child I was fascinated by their attractive packaging and well-designed food ranges. Their home products have become more contemporary and attractive, and much more informed by Scandinavian design, which is a good thing. Much of their range is similar to the likes of Habitat. So it has definitely changed and very much kept at the forefront of demand. Their staff are also considerably better than many other stores, and it\u2019s good to see that they employ so many people that clearly have experience and manners. </p> <h2>Megan Peel, 38, Harrogate: \u2018I used to shop at M&amp;S food but don\u2019t now \u2013 their food is so over-packaged to me\u2019</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic?</p> <footer> <cite>Megan Peel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The only items I now really buy at M&amp;S are clothes for my one-year-old. They are exactly what I want in terms of fabrics and patterns, but when I look for clothes for my four-year-old there\u2019s much less on offer. It\u2019s not stylish and it looks cheaper. I used to shop regularly at M&amp;S food but I don\u2019t any more as their food feels so over-packaged to me. They claim to be sustainable but how can they be when all their food is wrapped in so much plastic? So I shop less at M&amp;S than I used to. I would definitely never shop for women\u2019s clothes there: the price of their clothes is up there with the likes of Jigsaw, but the experience of shopping at Jigsaw is much better. Shopping in supermarkets is not nearly as nice. Strategically, I feel they are missing a massive opportunity; with British Home Stores closing they could champion British retail by promoting young British designers. They could also do more of their manufacturing in the UK.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 46, Sheffield: \u2018 I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life\u2019</h2> <p>My current gripes about M&amp;S are as follows: <br></p> <ul> <li>They no longer seem to stock ordinary cotton knickers in a variety of styles. <br></li> <li>All of their individual knickers that are not part of a matching set seem to be nylon.</li> <li>You can only buy cotton knickers in bags of five, with very few styles/colours to choose from.</li> </ul> <p>The choice is so poor that I have been forced to shop elsewhere for knickers for the first time in my life. I never thought this would happen and I hate it. Their women\u2019s clothing range is an incoherent mess. They seem to be trying to be all things to all people. They should get back to offering classic pieces for each season, reducing the number of stock items, and presenting them as outfits in the stores instead of just hanging all the trousers together, etc. I\u2019m sick of having to schlep around the store to see if they have a scarf to match a jumper.</p> <p>The quality of the finish needs to improve markedly. I am tired of hems coming down and buttons falling off. I have had to pay for two zips to be replaced on faulty M&amp;S garments this year. I would gladly pay a bit more for better quality. </p> <p>It seems sensible to focus on the successful part of the business \u2013 food \u2013 but this ignores the fact that M&amp;S should be a clothing retailer, not a supermarket. They need to reconnect with their core customers and offer good quality pieces to middle-aged women, rather than trying to compete for the Topshop/Zara market. </p>",

  "<p>\u2018Change is happening!\u201d says the message stencilled, in bright green, on a peeling wall just behind Hull\u2019s new marina. And if that sounds a little wistful, given that right now it\u2019s overlooking an empty car park surrounded by wire fencing, it has the underlying ring of truth.</p> <p>It\u2019s two decades since I was last in Hull, frozen in my memory as one long Saturday night \u2013 short skirts, hot chips, scuffles in taxi queues, excitement edged with nerves. Back then I was working just over the Humber Bridge in Grimsby, and Hull was the bright light across the water, home of gigs and cavernous nightclubs and all the exotic thrills small towns lack.

City of Culture is really a shot at economic redemption, and if the idea of building a future on poetry and song feels hopelessly airy-fairy, beneath it is a hard-headed attempt to portray Hull as a feelgood city to which big employers might want to bring their staff. For it\u2019s jobs that will ultimately revive those pockets of the city tourists don\u2019t come to see, as Hale points out: \u201cOnce you come here you see there\u2019s a real creative buzz, and people say: \u2018This is the sort of place you could do business and you could settle\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s no longer the only vision of Hull\u2019s future on the table. In June, despite warnings that Brexit risked its future as a port city that trades daily with the outside world, Hull voted to leave Europe. If it was already a city at a crossroads, in the words of filmmaker and opening ceremony curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/20/a-syrian-love-story-review-microcosm-of-global-crisis\">Sean McAllister</a>, it\u2019s even more so now. One road harks back to bygone days when other countries sent their ships here, but not their people; the other evokes a bright, high-skilled future that nonetheless sounds uncertain to people who have heard such promises before. Of all the jaunty City of Culture slogans plastered across the city, the most evocative is a banner near the pierhead. \u201cWhere have you been all our lives?\u201d it asks, in a way that could be plaintive or mildly acerbic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"085f494d12b14d12d2db448ce5d7607a576c1531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/085f494d12b14d12d2db448ce5d7607a576c1531/0_139_5478_3590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign of confidence on a Hull street.

It\u2019s friendly enough to tourists but as the Hull-born author and poet Russ Litten writes in My People Come From The Sea, there\u2019s a tendency to \u201cignore the rest of the country, face away/lips pursed, arms crossed\u201d.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s a lot going on behind those masks. As the poem goes on, \u201cMy people come from deep waters/My people are deep waters/My people are in deep water.\u201d They are indeed \u2013 Hull was the third most deprived local authority in England last year, with household disposable income a third less than the national average \u2013 but suspicion of City of Culture\u2019s proffered lifebelt lingers. There have been complaints about local artists being overlooked in favour of famous outsiders, and scepticism about what commercial regeneration means for the kind of non-conformist city that remains proud of holding out for years against getting a Starbucks.</p> <p>Litten has long been a driving force on Hull\u2019s musical and literary scene, and while the 2017 programme excites him, he worries too little of it is created by or for locals. \u201cFor people inside the city, I hope it doesn\u2019t make us feel self-conscious,\u201d he says, when asked how he hopes people will feel by the year\u2019s end. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that people would feel empowered to create stuff rather than just consume stuff. And for people from the outside, to be perfectly honest, I couldn\u2019t care less. The minute you start to worry about what people think and how they view you, you\u2019ve had it.\u201d</p> <p>Litten grew up in the Hessle Road area, a working-class community ripped apart in the 1970s when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">territorial battles with Iceland</a> scuppered its fishing industry, and he\u2019s not alone in linking that history with Hull\u2019s flinty resilience. <a href=\"https://filthybroke.bandcamp.com/track/my-people-come-from-the-sea\">My People Come From The Sea</a>, improvised for a spoken word album with local musician Steve Cobby, is based on their grandfathers\u2019 stories. \u201cOur families lived close to death,\u201d he says simply. \u201cSix times more people died in fishing than in mining. Where I\u2019m from was like a village within a city and it bred a specific type of person, very stoic.\u201d When Sheffield and Hull both flooded a few years back, he says, TV crews descended on Sheffield to film stricken householders but Hull just cracked on, out of sight and mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cde1c87bc87d22a6b49ca183fe9881232c190ab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cde1c87bc87d22a6b49ca183fe9881232c190ab8/0_8_5175_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hull marina ... the business development alongside includes a hub for tech startups...

It has a quirky, almost eccentric side supporting a thriving artistic scene, and Litten argues that it\u2019s a great place to be creative; rents are cheap, geographical isolation fosters originality, and so does the landscape of sea to the east and rolling fields to the west. \u201cIt\u2019s flat, and artists like a horizon, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>But years of being laughed at by outsiders \u2013 famously, the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/02/britishidentity.regeneration\">Crap Towns</a> once called it Britain\u2019s \u201cworst place to live\u201d \u2013 has left its mark.</p> <p>\u201cCulturally and psychologically, because the city was run down by people outside for so long, it kind of bites,\u201d says Andrew Young, a strategic consultant to universities whose Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hullbhoy\">@Hullbhoy</a> plugs all that\u2019s good about his home town. He sees City of Culture both as injecting new ideas and challenging those who knock Hull without ever having been: \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic to have the spotlight on the city and big national players on the stage. We don\u2019t get the London Philharmonic here, but we\u2019ve got it in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>Yet he concedes the spotlight isn\u2019t comfortable for everyone. \u201cPeople in Hull can be quite timid in terms of shouting about what they do. If you go to Glasgow people aren\u2019t slow in coming forward and telling you what\u2019s going on. We don\u2019t do that so much.\u201d And that ingrained reticence can make Hull a hard city to help.</p> <p>Diana Johnson, MP for Hull North, says the city was \u201clate to the party\u201d in the boom years for urban regeneration, hesitating to hustle for funding when rivals such as Newcastle and Liverpool were doing so. And now it\u2019s finally at the front of the queue, the party is winding down. Few envisage Conservative ministers spending more now on rundown estates than Labour did during a boom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81cf4e69115fef6f1457287e8095e0dc3e972b86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81cf4e69115fef6f1457287e8095e0dc3e972b86/0_156_4932_2960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seagoing heritage ...

Alan Johnson, MP for Hull West and Hessle, has argued offshore wind could do for the city what oil did for Aberdeen, and if that was a cheerier analogy before the oil price crashed, it\u2019s still a breakthrough for a city that\u2019s struggled in the past to woo inward investors. The city\u2019s luck seemed to be turning, which in some ways makes the decisive backing for Brexit more surprising. </p> <p>Hale puts it down to a now familiar mix of anti-establishment feeling, longstanding anger at the EU\u2019s treatment of the fishing industry, but above all immigration.</p> <p>For decades Hull had experienced relatively little, but then eastern Europeans started coming to work on the outlying farms as well as in the city. Drive north of the centre, past the leafy university quarter, and you soon find a scruffier landscape of pound shops and cut-price carwashes, many of the latter immigrant-owned. In the mid-90s the biggest ethnic minority group in town was Chinese, according to Hale, constituting about 1% of the population; now, he reckons anywhere up to 15% are from immigrant backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively good for the city in lots of ways but it\u2019s a massive change in the culture.\u201d</p> <p>The incomers have, he says, helped reverse inner-city decline by bringing empty shops and homes into use: \u201cPeople hark back to the day of the butcher, baker and candlestick maker but those shops had gone. The eastern Europeans were opening up boarded-up, empty shops.\u201d</p> <p>But Ukip, now second behind Labour in Hull\u2019s three parliamentary seats, is finding a ready audience for its message here. The vote, Johnson thinks, was a protest not just against immigration but \u201cthe fact that Hull hasn\u2019t done as well in recent years, people feel their wages don\u2019t go up as fast as prices\u201d. And then there were those who, like some of Litten\u2019s friends on the left, voted Leave for radical socialist reasons. \u201cIt was a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the establishment, saying don\u2019t tell us what to do,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb6fcea1b941f2a74705e705684661f90f4f8cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb6fcea1b941f2a74705e705684661f90f4f8cd/0_180_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Deep ...

But it had ultimately hoped to export turbines made here across Europe, and local politicians are worried about the longterm prospects for investment given uncertainty over life outside a single market. If the worst fears about a hard Brexit are realised, Hull may just have voted to shoot itself in the foot. </p> <p>Walking to a meeting in the city, I cross its last foiled attempt at regeneration. The innovative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/28/scale-lane-bridge-hull-review\">Scale Lane Bridge</a> over the river Hull, which swings aside for shipping, is where Tunick assembled his naked blue people but it\u2019s more than just a landmark. It was originally conceived to link the picturesque old city on the west bank with a largely derelict industrial site on the east, which would then be turned into a swanky waterside development complete with new hotel. The hotel was built but the banking crash killed off everything else, leaving just an unusually spectacular approach to a marooned Premier Inn, and a reminder of Hull\u2019s vulnerability to forces beyond its control.</p> <p>The optimist\u2019s view is that if hard times are coming again, they could at least foster creative revival. \u201cAll great art is born out of struggle, and the need for survival,\u201d says Litten. \u201cLook at punk, reggae, acid house.\u201d</p> <p>If new artforms are to emerge in Hull, however, they may come from the development around the marina, which includes a spanking new hub for tech startups. It\u2019s not Shoreditch, but you could live here far more cheaply than in London while trying to get a business off the ground \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-50-best-urban-places-live-list-8211-sunday/story-26126697-detail/story.html\">Hull made the Sunday Times top 10 urban places to live last year</a> partly for its affordable housing \u2013 and the idea is to encourage computer science students from the University of Hull to stay around after graduation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f584c57606e017843532bf4526f95d4387a811ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f584c57606e017843532bf4526f95d4387a811ef/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beneath the city\u2019s tough outer skin there\u2019s an offbeat charm ...

Hull may never quite be Liverpool, reinvented as a sexy weekend destination with its Beatles Museum and its Tate and its thriving bars. But there\u2019s an offbeat charm beneath this city\u2019s tough outer skin and if nothing else, it deserves respect for trying. This is a bold roll of the dice, from a city that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a plan B. What\u2019s the worst that could happen if you gave it an evening or a weekend of your free time?</p> <p>Walking back later towards the bridge, I pass a karaoke bar where men are downing cut-price pints while someone belts out a song I\u2019ve not heard for decades: the Beautiful South\u2019s Perfect 10. \u201cI love her body, especially the lies/Time takes its toll, but not on the eyes.\u201d Time has taken its toll on Hull, but the bones of what it was and could be remain.

  "<p>I grew up in suburban Sheffield. Everywhere in Sheffield is an edge place. Everywhere everywhere\u2019s an edge place, in fact, but in some places you can forget that for a while. That\u2019s not an option in Sheffield. The streetlights ended at the top of our road. Wilderness crouched in the dark beyond and it would slink into my bedroom at night. As an edge person, perhaps I was bound to try to look over, or even ooze through, the porous boundary between our species and others. Certainly I was bound to write about the wilderness that creeps in and sleeps with and in everyone, and without which we die, and which will one day kill and eat us.</p> <p>One day, there was a blackbird in our garden. It looked at me, and I looked at it. It plainly knew something about the garden that I didn\u2019t know. That enraged and tantalised me. I wanted to know what it knew; I wanted to know what it saw when it looked at our privet hedges. I wanted to see our garden properly, and thought that the bird could help me to do it.</p> <p>I tried all sorts of things to find out. I read everything I could find about blackbirds, and mapped their flight paths. I stuffed a dead blackbird, strung it on a thread over my bed and watched it circling as I went to sleep. I clutched a pot containing a formalinised blackbird brain, hoping that some of its knowledge would seep into me. This probably seems perverted. It would seem trite to any shamanic culture anywhere in the world. In any event it didn\u2019t work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/23/going-underground-meet-man-lived-as-animal-charles-foster\">Going underground: meet the man who lived as an animal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I grew up. I became ever more disastrously bipedal. The sensory receptors buried in my head became further and further from the ground, and further and further from the perspective that, as children, we share with our non-human cousins. But the question (\u201cWhat did the bird know?\u201d) didn\u2019t go away. Indeed it spawned other questions. Can we really know anything other than the contents of our own heads? Are we always and forever alone \u2013 trapped in our own self-generated worlds?</p> <p>Being a Beast is an attempt to reassure myself that there\u2019s an objective world out there, and to use more data than is usually used to describe it.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got at least five senses. We usually use only one of them \u2013 vision. So at best we get 20% of the available information about, say, a tree. You\u2019re unlikely to describe something accurately, or relate to it satisfactorily, if you have only a fifth of the information about it. It\u2019s also commercially bad for a nature writer. I think of myself as a farmer, making my living from the land. I should try to farm efficiently. To use just 20% of the available facts is pretty pathetic. But actually it\u2019s worse than that: our vision and our cognition are intimately linked. Just think how we talk. When we understand something we say: \u201cI see!\u201d We insist that seeing is believing. When I look at the tree, I\u2019m barely even seeing it. When I describe it in a book, I\u2019m actually describing my own thoughts about the tree. They\u2019re a woefully inaccurate reflection of the tree: they\u2019re far less lovely and interesting. We don\u2019t do trees justice. And it\u2019s terribly incompetent fact-farming. </p> <p>Who could free me from the tyranny of vision, cognition and self-reference? Well, no one, as it turned out. But five animals loosened the bonds: badgers in a Welsh wood, foxes in the East End of London, otters in the rivers of Exmoor, red deer in the West Highlands of Scotland and on Exmoor, and finally, most ludicrously and hubristically, swifts in the air between Oxford and Central Africa. Between them they helped me to perceive slightly more than a fifth of a tree.</p> <p>All my five species were animals my children liked and enjoyed emulating. The children were my great teachers, since all real knowledge is unforgetting and they\u2019ve forgotten far less than I have. Most of the research was a rather strange family picnic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/14/being-a-beast-charles-foster-review-living-wild-five-animals\">Being a Beast by Charles Foster review \u2013 a true walk on the wild side</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I tried for a while to be like these animals; to live in an olfactory landscape; to learn how a single sniff telescopes time so that you get in an instant a cocktail of scent particles from many millennia; to hear how water shrinks distance; to run from wolves that haven\u2019t existed for a thousand years and to dip my head so that my antlers didn\u2019t get caught on trees that were felled 500 years ago; to be entangled with the swifts in a weird ecstatic net whose twitching told me from miles away that they were about to arrive.</p> <p>There were whole microseconds of arguable success.

It had a curtain of water, like those curtains of beads that fill the doors leading to the toilets in small Chinese restaurants. It was almost totally dark, except when lightning bled through the fault lines in the sky. The whole wood bent to the wind. We rocked in our cradle, the roots around us straining and creaking like the timbers of a rolling ship. A wood mouse, displaced from a flooded or crumbling tunnel, scrambled in and hunched, shivering, in the crook of Tom\u2019s knee. The mouse reassured me. We were in the best place, a sanctuary accredited by the wild, so I snatched bits of queasy maritime sleep. Tom slept, which is what I expect badgers do in storms.</p> <p>But Nova Scotia\u2019s worst wasn\u2019t so bad. Our sett wasn\u2019t damaged at all but, out of gratitude to it, and with a new pride in having survived the worst, we set to that morning to make it even better. We excavated a new chamber, complete with shelves, reinforced the roof and built an imposing earth arch at the entrance. Then, as Tom was happily making his own purely recreational earthworks, I slipped into unbroken sleep.</p> <p>Burt trundled back, not looking as solicitous as he should have been after leaving his supposed friend and a cub in a wood in an historic storm. This time it was lasagne.</p> <p>Food worried me. I couldn\u2019t duplicate the precariousness of the badger\u2019s life. We did our best: we ate earthworms, both raw and cooked, and any other flotsam tossed up by the valley that we could keep down. We scraped a squirrel off the road and had it with wood sorrel and wild garlic. But there were Burt\u2019s regular gifts, which we had neither the discipline nor the churlishness to refuse, and lying guiltily at the bottom of the backpack were sardines, tuna and beans. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to think you can know this wood like a badger,\u201d Burt said a week or so later. \u201cYou can\u2019t even know it like me.

  "<p>The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, has dismissed a <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/InquiryProcedure.aspx\">critical UN report</a> that concluded that the UK government\u2019s austerity policies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-austerity-policies-amount-to-violations-of-disabled-peoples-rights\">\u201csystematically violated\u201d</a> the rights of disabled people.</p> <p>Green said the report was \u201cpatronising and offensive\u201d and presented an outdated view of disability in the UK. He said Britain was \u201ca world leader in disability rights and equality\u201d.<br></p> <p>But disability activists and charities welcomed the report, saying it accurately highlighted the real economic and social pressures faced by disabled people after years of harsh spending cuts to social security and social care.</p> <p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said the UN report was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d in its identification of UK government failures. \u201cIt confirms that, despite Theresa May\u2019s warm words, this government is failing sick and disabled people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The UN committee said a range of measures introduced since 2010, including the bedroom tax and cuts to disability benefits and social care budgets, had disproportionately and adversely affected disabled people.</p> <p>Spending cuts had negatively affected the rights of disabled people to live independently, to work and to achieve an adequate standard of living, the report said. It urged UK ministers to ensure the rights of disabled people were upheld.</p> <p>Government ministers contributed to the inquiry that led to the report and are understood to have been presented with the findings earlier this year.</p> <p>Green said: \u201cAt the heart of this report lies an outdated view of disability which is patronising and offensive. We strongly refute its findings. The UN measures success as the amount of money poured into the system, rather than the work and health outcomes for disabled people. Our focus is on helping disabled people find and stay in work, whilst taking care of those who can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The government said it spent about \u00a350bn a year to support sick and disabled people \u2013 a bigger proportion of GDP than countries including Canada, France and the US.</p> <p>It said the recent publication of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/31/government-aims-to-halve-disability-employment-gap-in-uk\">work and health green paper</a>, which included ambitious proposals to increase employment levels among disabled people, was \u201ca turning point in our action to confront the attitudes, prejudices and misunderstandings within the minds of employers and across wider society.\u201d<br></p> <p>But Abrahams said the report echoed warnings Labour had been making since 2011 about the effects of the government\u2019s policies on disabled people. </p> <p> \u201cThe UN committee is clear that its report examines the cumulative impact of legislation, policies and measures adopted from 2010 to October 2016, so the government\u2019s claim that it is outdated does not stand up to scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cI am also concerned that the government is labelling the report as patronising, when they are the ones dismissing the concerns raised by disabled people who helped instigate the inquiry in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Vicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind, said the UN findings were extremely concerning but came as no surprise. </p> <p>\u201cThe government has ambitions to help many more people with mental health problems back into work but, as this inquiry points out, the current approach is cruel, inappropriate and doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Liz Sayce, the chief executive of Disability Rights UK, said the government was right to emphasise its commitment to helping disabled people get into and stay in work, but it had failed to invest sufficiently in inclusion and participation in recent years, leaving many people reliant on social protection.</p> <p>Neil Crowther, an independent disability rights expert, said: \u2018It\u2019s deeply sad to see the UK \u2013 once a proud global leader on disabled people\u2019s rights \u2013 being found guilty of systematically violating them. </p> <p>\u201cBritain\u2019s own joint parliamentary committee on human rights warned of the risks to disabled people\u2019s human rights that would result from the combined effect of reform and spending decisions in 2012. After extensive research and consultation, the UN committee has found that these risks have come to pass. </p> <p>\u201cWith further cuts to social security still to come and no plans for additional investment in social care, it seems likely that things are only going to get worse. The government\u2019s complacent response offers little reassurance to the contrary.\u201d </p> <p>Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis report is further acknowledgement that cutting disabled people\u2019s benefits will only make life harder and isolate people further from inclusion in employment and wider society. People with a learning disability face massive exclusion from the labour market, and have seen their benefits and funding for vital social care services reduced.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of the MS Society, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis is yet more evidence that there\u2019s a clear need for changes to disability benefits.

The world is literally going to town on urbanisation \u2013 but it is a project that is both immense and historically fleeting. </p> <p>In less than 100 years, the world\u2019s urban population is expected to double to 8 or 9 billion \u2013 accounting for the bulk of a <a href=\"https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2014-Highlights.pdf\">projected global population of around 11 billion</a>. Yet in all the centuries that follow this one, cities may add, at most, another billion to their ranks. So if this century is the most urbanising in history, it will also mark the end of humankind\u2019s \u201cgreat urbanisation\u201d era.<br></p> <p>Thus the next few decades will be hugely influential in determining the patterns of production, behaviour and governance that humanity locks into, and the innovative efficiency with which it utilises the earth\u2019s resources. The future of the world\u2019s urban population will mostly be built in our lifetimes. </p> <p>The consequences of bad government and inaction over planning and urban design will last decades or centuries. Once the urban population is stable, and road, rail and utility networks have been laid down, it will be much harder to undertake reform or retrofit urban infrastructure. This is why the subject deserves the urgent attention of policymakers, academics and business entrepreneurs worldwide.<br></p> <p>This week, global leaders are meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd UN climate summit (<a href=\"http://cop22.ma/en\">Cop22</a>).

Be it through investing in electric vehicles, building smart grids, constructing energy-efficient homes, planning limits on urban sprawl, investing in renewable power or providing integrated public transport, such action generates a number of important benefits \u2013 not least, tackling the growing and deadly problem of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution\">air pollution</a> all over the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c571af886e6ca1274d3dfcb78ec6f8eb38105d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c571af886e6ca1274d3dfcb78ec6f8eb38105d1/0_316_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk in heavy dust and smog in New Delhi at the weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians walk through dust and smog in New Delhi at the weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harish Tyagi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Air pollution costs millions of lives every year. The <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015/premature-deaths-attributable-to-air-pollution\">European Environment Agency</a> estimates that premature deaths resulting from a single particulate pollutant (PM2.5) totalled approximately 432,000 in 2012 in Europe alone, while around 75,000 people die each year as a result of prolonged exposure to NO2 air pollution. A <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/\">recent study</a> by the World Resources Institute put the health impacts in China of PM2.5 exposure (including premature deaths) at a shocking 10-13% of the country\u2019s annual GDP.</p> <p>Thus, air pollution is one key reason why the <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.report/2014\">Global Commission on the Economy and Climate</a> found that more than half of the reduction in global emissions required to meet an ambitious climate target could generate net benefits to the economy.</p> <p>Implementing policy action to reduce emissions is often easiest at the city level. This means increased effort is required to devolve administration to the urban level and empower cities through greater fiscal autonomy. Things like recycling schemes, energy from waste, broadband networks, integrated public transport systems, \u201csmart\u201d buildings and biking networks are easy to appreciate and can come with popular local support.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate \u2026 and risks rendering cities dysfunctional</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Local accountability is also a vital part of good governance. In large parts of the world, this means fighting urban corruption and supporting institutional capacity. Corruption stifles incentives to work and innovate, undermining property rights and threatening to usurp the returns to productive activities. This offsets many of the benefits of urban clustering, and risks rendering cities dysfunctional.<br></p> <p>The tragedy is that some of the poorest cities in the world are also the fastest growing \u2013 and they lack the resources and capacity to prevent locking into structures that are inefficient, unreliable and polluting.<br></p> <p>New mechanisms to finance investments in urban infrastructure and smart technology need to be developed. These may include: greater use of land-value capture mechanisms, where the construction of new transit infrastructure is financed with the profits generated by the increase in land value stimulated by the presence of that infrastructure; municipal bonds such as Johannesburg\u2019s recently issued $136m (\u00a3110m) green bond; and the creation of dedicated national, regional or city-level investment platforms as mechanisms for aggregating smaller infrastructure projects and attracting private investment at scale.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/17/cities-climate-change-problems-solution\">Climate change and cities: a prime source of problems, yet key to a solution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But successful urbanisation is not just about infrastructure; it\u2019s also about skills.

Despite politicians talking about sustainability, climate change and the protection of the natural environment, we are actually doing little.</p> <p>We go on using finite resources, continuing to build large projects, consuming, without much regard for the ecological damage we do, the carbon we create, the indigenous habitat we lose and the destruction we cause. We really have to stop talking about the importance of the environment and act to halt the loss of the biodiversity, livability and sustainability of our planet.</p> <p>We\u2019ve lost so much forest and so many animal species through land clearing, climate change and human developments; we must preserve what wild habitat remains. We need to take a stand and say stop. Not just for the welfare and betterment of humanity and the future we pass on to our kids, but for the other creatures that inhabit the planet and the health of the earth itself.</p> <p>The ecological situation is dire.

These superficially cutesy four pages of prose totally ignore the many real issues surrounding the bottled water industry.</p> <p>I live on Vancouver Island, one of the great rainforests of the world. Yet, just last year, we endured four months of water restrictions because of severe drought. A few years earlier, in Tofino, one of the wettest areas of North America, the authorities found themselves without sufficient municipal water and were forced to bring in the precious commodity on trucks.</p> <p>Farther east, in Ontario, members of a small community are fighting the giant Nestl\u00e9 apparatus in an attempt to head off plans for further expansion of a water bottling operation that already draws billions of litres from the local aquifer.</p> <p>This is the same Nestl\u00e9 whose CEO is on record as saying that public access to water is not a right, and that privatisation of the life-giving resource is the way to go. So the world ends up with mountains of plastic bottles, more fossil fuels burned to deliver them and more landfills crammed with useless garbage.</p> <p>The Guardian has done magnificent work with its Keep It in the Ground campaign, but Elmhirst\u2019s article reads more like a trade show catalogue than the kind of journalism for which this newspaper is praised. In Canada, water is becoming a serious issue; in some parts of the world it is already a matter of life and death.</p> <p>The world has indeed gone mad, but some consideration of the real issues by Elmhirst would have been welcome.<br><strong>Barry Munn</strong><br>Nanoose Bay, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 I find a stark contrast between the succeeding articles in your 21 October issue. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/10/uganda-dignity-not-poverty-the-cash-grants-helping-older-generation\" title=\"\">A small price for dignity</a> discusses how elderly people in rural Ghana make wonderful use of tiny amounts of money, provided through their government\u2019s social protection programmes.

Watts\u2019 account, however, suggests that he set out in advance to lay blame squarely on the \u2018maverick\u2019 Venezuelan government. Certainly his account is one-sided, whether through political bias or ignorance.</p> <p>There are two remarkable things about the Venezuelan revolution, which Watts does not remark on. First, over the period 2000-2010, poverty was reduced by 50%, healthcare became free and of a high standard and so did education. Over the same 10 years the US, appalled by the threat to its interests in the country with the largest oil reserves on the planet, channelled more than $100m to opposition groups, with the stated objective of regime change.</p> <p>Despite extreme hardship with inflation and supplies of food and medicines, there is evidence that a large number of people, probably the majority, do not want an opposition government that promises nothing but foreign intervention and uncertainty, and that their dreams have not \u201cdried up\u201d. They are up against history, however, which tells us that socialism in one country is likely to fail, especially in a country that is so strategically important to a large capitalist neighbour.<br><strong>Mike Downham</strong><br>Strathblane, UK</p> <h2>Time to get rid of elections<br></h2> <p>Thanks to George Monbiot for bringing Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels\u2019s important work, Democracy for Realists, to a broader audience <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/democracy-people-power-governments-policy\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a>.

Emerging in the 17th century, it was developed as a form of self-defence by dissenting slaves in the vast colonial mire that was Brazil\u2019s sugar and coffee plantations. Supreme fighting skills allowed many slaves to escape their captors and establish large <em>quilombos</em> (settlements).</p> <p>Capoeira soon became associated with gangs and criminality. It was not until 1932 that the first legitimate capoeira academy was established in Brazil and only in the late 1960s were women accepted as participants.</p> <p>\u201cEven then capoeira was still considered inappropriate for women,\u201d said Barreto. \u201cAs feminists, we had to confront the gender norms within this male-dominated space.\u201d</p> <p>During the Awid forum, students from Barreto\u2019s school formed a <em>roda</em>, or circle. The mostly female group sang and clapped in rhythm to the sound of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/berimbau\">berimbau</a>, a kind of musical bow, as the two players swerved, swooped and rotated around each other without making contact.</p> <p>\u201cMen learn to fight and to move their physical bodies,\u201d said Barreto. \u201cAccording to gender norms women cannot do certain movements. We go against this by opening our legs, going into inverted positions and even fighting against men inside the <em>roda</em>. It is a game but also a fight. Capoeira empowers women because we have to learn to fight and move our bodies in different ways.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Barreto had started practising in the late 1970s, a new contemporary style was emerging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0a39b720822594ab84365b30655bd2b280910a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a39b720822594ab84365b30655bd2b280910a2/26_0_1791_1075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A capoeira demonstration at the 13th Awid International forum, Bahia, Brazil, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A capoeira demonstration at the 2016 Awid forum in Bahia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kary Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCapoeira Angola comes from African rituals and philosophy and is an affirmation of blackness,\u201d explained Barreto. \u201cCapoeira Contempor\u00e2nea became prominent as a solely Brazilian art form, away from African or black Brazilian origins.\u201d </p> <p>Feminist capoeiristas saw this new style as an attempt to stigmatise African cultural practices, and racial relations became appropriated into their folds of resistance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/03/brazil-argentina-unite-protest-sexual-violence-gender\">Brazil and Argentina unite in protest against culture of sexual violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had to defend capoeira Angola,\u201d added Barreto. \u201cWe could not accept an invisibility of the black and African roots of the practice.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003 President Lula de Silva made moves to address racial discrimination in the country with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/29/brazil-race\">proposal of the Statute of Racial Equality</a>.

Yes, workers suffered the longest squeeze in their wages since the 19th century, but the fall in living standards was somehow decoupled from the issue of cuts. Government cuts pursued the following strategy: to target people who were less likely to vote (such as young people) and who preferably were held in low esteem by wider society (such as benefit claimants); or where the consequences would not be felt for a long time. A case in point: the prison system.</p> <p>Over the last few days, the crisis enveloping Britain\u2019s prison system stopped being a warning scribbled in press releases. It become an actuality. This weekend, up to 200 inmates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/06/fire-service-called-to-riot-at-bedford-prison\" title=\"\">rioted in Bedford prison</a>. Yesterday, two prisoners <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37902148\" title=\"\">escaped from Pentonville prison</a> and are now on the run. And on the same day, there were reports of a <a href=\"http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/disruption-reported-at-hmp-exeter-after-serious-incidents-across-country/story-29876442-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">riot in Exeter prison</a>.</p> <p>Our Victorian prison system \u2013 which is more interested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/prison-doctor-jails-inmates-addicts-sentences\" title=\"\">locking up mentally ill poor people</a> than rehabilitation and crime prevention \u2013 is overcrowded, under-staffed and underresourced. No one can say the warnings weren\u2019t there. While our prison population <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/PressPolicy/News/vw/1/ItemID/279\" title=\"\">doubled in the space of two decades</a>, last week the Prison Officers\u2019 Association warned that falling staff numbers and cuts mean a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-to-recruit-2500-new-prison-officers-after-warning-cuts-are-leaving-jails-unsafe-a7394141.html\" title=\"\">\u201cbloodbath in prisons\u201d</a>, adding that \u201cstaff are absolutely on their knees, lost all morale, all motivation\u201d. Opponents of cuts are frequently accused of alarmism: we are now seeing how prophetic they were.</p> <p>Some of the other consequences of austerity are becoming visible, too. A UN inquiry has condemned government cuts for \u201csystematic violations\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/uk-austerity-policies-amount-to-violations-of-disabled-peoples-rights\" title=\"\">rights of disabled people</a>, whether it be the bedroom tax or cuts to disability benefits. And today the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/08/trussell-trust-to-deliver-more-emergency-food-parcels-than-ever-before\" title=\"\">Trussell Trust reports</a> that \u2013 partly due to benefit sanctions and delays in social security payments \u2013 it is set to deliver the biggest number of emergency food parcels ever. After Britain was battered by floods over the festive period last year, it was revealed how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/02/tory-cuts-wrecking-uk-flood-defences\" title=\"\">cuts to flood defences</a> had put households at risk.</p> <p>The danger is that \u2013 even as these cuts hit \u2013 they will remain abstractions, headlines to goggle at and then turn the page. Those most badly affected can all too easily be ignored. But the failure to invest in a country\u2019s future means we will all increasingly suffer the consequences.

  "<p>The Almighty plays a central part in the hallowed 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Six of them make reference to God, Him or Power. In one step, members vow to hand \u201cour will and our lives\u201d to God while another implores Him to remove their shortcomings.<br></p> <p>Now the organisation\u2019s religious undertone \u2013 and its utility in fighting alcoholism \u2013 has come under fire in Canada, where an atheist has lodged a human rights complaint alleging AA discriminated against him.</p> <p>For more than two years, Lawrence Knight has watched his complaint snake through the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. Earlier this year, the tribunal said the complaint <a href=\"http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onhrt/doc/2016/2016hrto208/2016hrto208.html?resultIndex=12\">raised a number of complex legal issues</a> and recommended it go to a full hearing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/24/women-drink-alcohol-men-global-study\">Women now drink as much alcohol as men, global study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 23 years sober, Knight says he always found that the world of AA was an uneasy fit. \u201cI come from a long line of humanists,\u201d said the 59-year-old. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aatorontoagnostics.com/\">We Agnostics</a>, a Toronto secular AA group created in 2010, seemed the perfect solution, offering all the support and companionship of AA but without the trappings of God. Here the 12 steps were still followed \u2013 each carefully rewritten to scrub out any mention of God or prayer. </p> <p>But the group\u2019s separation of church and sobriety didn\u2019t sit well with some. In 2011, We Agnostics and Toronto\u2019s other secular AA group, <a href=\"http://www.aabeyondbelief.com/\">Beyond Belief</a>, were delisted from the Toronto AA website and directory, in effect removing them from the city\u2019s network of 500 weekly meetings.</p> <p>The decision prompted tears and shock among the three dozen or so people who had embraced the secular groups. \u201cIt was painful. It\u2019s shunning,\u201d said Knight. \u201cIt was unbelievable that an organisation that can\u2019t kick anybody out, and that prides itself on that, had kicked us out.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the secular groups \u2013 worried that their hard-won efforts at staying sober were now in jeopardy \u2013 vowed to push forward. What emerged was a parallel system of sorts, one that has today swelled to about 350 members in 12 secular AA groups across Toronto.</p> <p>As the secular movement grew in numbers, Knight and others continued to push to be brought back into Toronto\u2019s AA fold. They appealed to the city\u2019s coordinating body, urging them to reconsider the decision. \u201cWe ran into a brick wall,\u201d said Knight.</p> <p>Frustration drove him to lodge a human rights complaint two years ago, claiming that AA had discriminated against his group on the basis of creed. While directed at Toronto\u2019s coordinating body, the complaint also names the highest levels of the organisation in North America. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make any decisions directly,\u201d said Knight. \u201cBut there is something that they did do, in my opinion, and that is the fact that there have been agnostic meetings for 40 years, but they haven\u2019t clarified anything; they didn\u2019t have any human rights protocols in place.\u201d</p> <p>The result is a scattered approach to secularism around the world. In some places, such as New York City, secular groups are allowed to operate freely and under the umbrella of the local AA hierarchy. Other secular groups \u2013 from Des Moines to Vancouver \u2013 have been treated similarly to those in Toronto, pushed out and left to their own devices over their rejection of God.</p> <p>Knight\u2019s complaint will head to mediation in the coming weeks. To date, AA has argued to the tribunal that it is a special interest organisation, a status that affords it the right to restrict its membership.</p> <p>The dispute hints at a broader question being asked among the group\u2019s two million members worldwide as they seek to incorporate 12 steps first penned in the 1930s into modern times: How important is God and religion in AA\u2019s quest to empower people to fight alcoholism?</p> <p>Some, like Knight, argue that AA\u2019s curative power lies not in religion, but instead in the fellowship it fosters. A growing body of research, he pointed out, now suggests that the roots of addiction <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/12/johann-hari-chasing-the-scream-war-on-drugs\">are tangled in isolation and loneliness.</a></p> <p>The argument clashes with the Toronto coordinating body, which has argued to the tribunal that a belief in the higher power of God is a bona fide requirement for groups in Toronto. </p> <p>Officials in Toronto declined to comment, while a spokesperson from AA World Services in New York City said the organisation was unable to comment as the matter was before the Human Rights Tribunal. </p> <p>Knight is hoping that the human rights complaint will force the organisation to definitively address the long-simmering issue. \u201cAlcoholism kills more people than it saves. It\u2019s killed a lot of my friends, it\u2019s killed a lot of my family, it\u2019s an insidious thing. And the best support system in the world is AA.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the strength of that support hinges on AA being accessible to all. \u201cThe point is that anybody should be able to go to a meeting and not feel intimidated, not feel forced out or that they have to believe in something that somebody else believes,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s just ludicrous in this day and age.\u201d</p>",

For example, for our <a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/road-to-womens-business-growth-in-nigeria/\">Road to Growth project</a>, we involved a bank in designing our training curriculum on financial literacy, and also organised events with the bank and the women entrepreneurs to build relationships.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough to simply teach women about financial literacy; financial service providers must also offer the right kinds of products and services.

The primary challenge is that most of those cannot work their way out of poverty because most earn their living in the informal economy where average earnings are low while costs and risks are high.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the value of the informal economy has been estimated at <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/05/n7-62trn-informal-sector-booms-in-lagos/\">7.615tn naira ($48.2bn)</a>. And yet the activities \u2013 the livelihoods \u2013 of these workers remain almost entirely unrecognised, valued or taken into account in urban planning or local economic development. If urban poverty, inequality and unemployment are to be reduced, urban informal workers, especially the working poor, need to be recognised, valued and supported as economic agents who contribute to the economy and to society. <em>Victoria Okoye, urban advocacy specialist, <a href=\"http://www.wiego.org/\">Wiego</a>, Accra, Ghana</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/13/why-arent-we-designing-cities-that-work-for-women-not-just-men\">Why aren\u2019t we designing cities that work for women, not just men?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7 | Make travel safer for women</h2> <p>We need to integrate women more effectively through infrastructure.

At the same time, we also need to look at violence women experience in the workplace. Most women in Nigeria I know who have set up their own business or work for a company or organisation have experienced sexual harassment. This has a detrimental impact on women\u2019s wellbeing at work as well as their motivation.</p> <p>In some cases, men often will not allow daughters, wives or sisters to work outside the home (although many still engaged in home-based businesses) \u201cfor their own protection\u201d and to guard against this violence. <em>Chitra Nagarajan, activist and writer, Maiduguri, Nigeria <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chitranagarajan\">@chitranagarajan</a></em></p> <h2>9 | Teach boys to respect women</h2> <p>There\u2019s a long-term role that parents must play in raising our sons better.

We can, however, make targets more difficult to hack and therefore less desirable targets.\u201d</p> <p><em> </em></p> <h2>Making towns and cities more walkable... </h2> <p>Marsh, at Atkins, said UK core cities are looking at walking as something they can support and integrate into the wider network.

Speaking on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Conway said of Crites: \u201cThis is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally.\u201d</p> <p>Crites is not a Democrat. He has been a registered Republican since 2011, and was previously an independent. A fiscal conservative who is supporting other Republicans this election, he said he protested of his own volition because he believes Trump is \u201ca textbook version of a dictator and a fascist\u201d.</p> <p>Crites voluntarily told the Guardian that, despite not agreeing with all of Clinton\u2019s platform, he had canvassed \u201cfor a few hours\u201d for the Democratic nominee and donated to her campaign. </p> <p>He was not, as has been claimed on social media, the same protester who interrupted Trump at a rally in Florida.</p> <p>The conspiracy about Crites that has been most widely circulated since his protest on Saturday is the claim that he was a Democratic operative connected to John Podesta, a revelation supposedly contained in the WikiLeaks disclosures of the Clinton campaign chair\u2019s emails.</p> <p>The claim, which is false, may have been the source of Conway\u2019s false declaration to CNN that Crites was a Democratic \u201coperative\u201d.<br></p> <p>The name \u201cAustyn Crites\u201d was not connected to the Podesta disclosures, but an entirely unrelated Wikileaks disclosure, in 2012, based on a internal documents belonging to the global intelligence company Stratfor. Crites said his name only appeared in the leak because he was listed as a subscriber to one of Stratfor\u2019s newsletters.</p> <p>The genesis of the fake story about Crites\u2019 grandmother, and the way in which it bubbled through from blogs to a Fox News report, seemingly without any attempt at corroboration, is unclear.</p> <p>Both of Crites\u2019 grandmothers are alive, but the trail of false allegations leads to Wilda Austin, who resides at his family address.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WDFx2EU8/status/795267833185779713\">A Twitter user</a> first made the false connection between Crites, whom it called the \u201cTrump Reno assassin\u201d and his \u201cdead granny\u201d on Sunday afternoon. The post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bf1l8/austyn_crites_trump_assassin_commits_vote_fraud/\">caused a stir on Reddit</a>, before being picked up by a rightwing news website <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/11/breaking-trump-attacker-hillary-supporter-dead-grandma-voting-reno-address/\">called The Gateway Pundit</a>.<br></p> <p>It appears the original tweet, the Reddit post, the rightwing news website and Fox News all misidentified Crites\u2019 grandmother for another Wilda Austin, who is deceased, but lived in Utah.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/us-election-voting-polls-mood\">What\u2019s the mood where you are?</a> Share your pictures and views with us</em></p>",

What do these stops tell us about the race?</p> <p>Typically, last-minute campaign decisions are based on internal campaign polling not available to the public. Such polling explains why Al Gore campaigned at 2am in Florida on election day in 2000, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/795685460953677826\">as confusing as that move was</a> for the opposition at the time.</p> <p>The late moves of the 2016 campaign may be trickier to decode, in part because of the drunken-ninja style of the Donald Trump campaign, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/795722142159605760\">reportedly</a> ceased conducting its own polling last week or even two weeks ago.</p> <p>The action in Michigan, visited twice by Clinton and four times by Trump, may be most interesting. The Great Lakes state emerged as an object of interest relatively late in the race, with both campaigns having dispensed with other, more central fights, and with the Trump campaign sensing opportunity with the state\u2019s white blue-collar voters. The Clinton campaign hopes the state\u2019s Democratic voting record since 1988 will be good for 16 electoral votes Tuesday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/clinton-trump-final-campaign-stops-election-what-it-means\">The last-minute map: how to read each presidential candidate\u2019s final stops</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214bdae4b029b92ca467a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:56:06.278Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shares in Asian markets \u2013 where it\u2019s Tuesday already \u2013 have edged up as the prospect of a Clinton win looks more likely, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday ahead of the election, with investors optimistic but cautious over improving prospects for a win by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The Mexican peso, which strengthens as the perceived chances of an election victory by Donald Trump fall, retained its strong gains from Monday.</p> <p>The dollar, which also advanced on Monday, edged slightly lower. </p> <p>Boosting Clinton\u2019s chances of winning, and markets globally, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">statement by the FBI on Sunday</a> standing by its July finding that Clinton was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server. </p> <p>That came after the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/fbi-reopens-hillary-clinton-emails-investigation\">announced on 28 October</a> it was reviewing additional emails relating to the server while Clinton was secretary of state, sending markets around the world tumbling. </p> <p>Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability, and, until last week\u2019s stumble, had been seen as the likely victor in Tuesday\u2019s presidential vote. </p> <p>But investors remained wary, noting Britain\u2019s shock vote in June to leave the European Union had defied most polls and bookmakers\u2019 odds. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs markets head into the U.S. election, a final recalibration of risk is in train,\u201d Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note. <br></p> <p>\u201cAsia-Pacific markets were the first to adjust to the political shift, and may trade more modestly today after roaring back to life yesterday.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on markets in Asia and beyond as the votes are totted up on Tuesday (or Wednesday as it\u2019s known in some parts of the globe).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58214ad7e4b029b92ca467a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T03:48:25.836Z\">3.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Miami Herald op-ed page is keeping it simple tomorrow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PatriciaMazzei/status/795819819090186240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prediction: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeraldOpEd\">@HeraldOpEd</a> gonna get a *few* emails about this one.

Brady was suspended for four games at the start of the 2016 season for his role in the Deflategate scandal.<br></p> <p>Speaking in Manchester, New Hampshire, the Republican nominee told the cheering crowd that Brady called him earlier on Monday to say: \u201cDonald, I support you. You\u2019re my friend and I voted for you.\u201d</p> <p>The quarterback was photographed in 2015 with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker. Brady <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/15/tom-brady-donald-trump-is-a-good-friend-and-i-support-my-friends/\">also said</a> in an interview in December 2015: \u201cDonald is a good friend of mine.

The famously taciturn and obsessive coach has won four Super Bowls with Brady as his quarterback and is considered one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. Belichick\u2019s girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/bill-belichick-donald-trump-new-england-patriots-presidential-candidate-030616\">posted a picture</a> on Instagram of Trump and the NFL coach in the spring, describing the Republican nominee as \u201cour good friend\u201d.</p> <p>Trump announced after the Brady endorsement that Belichick \u201cwrote me the most beautiful letter\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Congratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and come out beautifully. You have proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter.

The judge slammed the local Democratic party for \u201cbelated, inflammatory allegations<strong> </strong>that<strong> </strong>appear intended to generate only heat, not light\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court on Monday also denied a request to restore a sweeping temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge in Ohio last week, which had briefly enjoined the Trump campaign, Stone, and Stop the Steal, as well as the Clinton campaign, from engaging in a variety of voter intimidation behaviors.

The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> <p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> <p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> <p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out.</p> <p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> <p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality.

They are, in fact, widespread and even predicted by some local officials.</p> <p>Since 2000, the popularity of early voting has increased from 12% of the electorate to an anticipated 40% this year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-voting-2016-election/\">CBS report of the AP Election Research Group</a>. During that same time though, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-love-early-voting-and-it-might-help-clinton/\">Republican-led</a> legislatures have pushed back against early voting in Ohio, Arizona and Nebraska. </p> <p>Why?</p> <p>In-person early voting tends to benefit Democrats. In North Carolina, for example, 60% of black voters \u2013 a reliably Democratic group \u2013 cast early ballots, as opposed to 44% of white voters, according to the <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">Institute for Southern Studies</a>.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">US Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which required some southern states to get pre-approval of election law changes from the federal government, North Carolinian state representatives passed a law that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">eliminated early voting on one Sunday</a>. In part, that move was designed to impact \u201csouls to the polls\u201d day, a powerful program that brings black churchgoers to vote after Sunday service.</p> <p>A judge struck down that state law in July, finding that it targeted African Americans \u201c<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/29/fourth_circuit_strikes_down_north_carolina_voting_restrictions.html\">with almost surgical precision</a>\u201d. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2016/09/why-early-voting-matters\">three North Carolina counties</a> still managed to limit early voting the Sunday before election day.</p> <p>Research from the Brennan Center for Justice on three states with the longest lines in 2012, Florida, Maryland and South Carolina, found that voters in urban areas tended to have fewer machines, less poll workers or both. More research cited by the center backs up findings that voters in <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/10/11/democrats-maintain-edge-as-party-more-concerned-for-latinos-but-views-similar-to-2012/\">Latino</a> and African American districts tend to wait the longest (both constituencies lean Democratic).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e33d07f2741447a79ff6aa2b190503a8dc2a67/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A line of early voters waits outside the Franklin County Board of Elections, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just this spring, lines were so long in Arizona that voters of both parties were <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/25/471891525/arizona-polling-places-overwhelmed-with-long-lines-on-primary-day\">livid</a>. Why? Republican state officials cut budgets for county officials, who in turn demanded cheap elections, which cut polling places. Democratic leaders tended to blame Republicans, who cut budgets. Arizona was another state that used to be required to seek pre-approval of election law changes under the Voting Rights Act.</p> <p>If politicians wanted to end long lines, experts say some simple recommendations could make a big impact. A January 2014 report called The American Voting Experience looked at ways that officials could predict and plan for voter turnout, after Floridians waited <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/no-one-in-america-should-have-to-wait-7-hours-to-vote/264506/\">seven hours</a> to vote for Barack Obama in 2012.</p> <p>They found that expanding early voting, online registration, new technologies and efficient polling place management could all help reduce and eliminate long wait times. </p> <p>So if you\u2019re waiting in a long line, congratulate your fellow voters, and consider a letter to you local election commission. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5820cee2e4b07ceadb3a34c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T19:00:40.062Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama picks up on report that aides confiscated Trump's Twitter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Don\u2019t miss this from the New York Times: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-race.html\">Inside Donald Trump\u2019s Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the juicy details: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/\">the Twitter account</a> that he used to colorfully \u2014 and often counterproductively \u2014 savage his rivals.

It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/hillary-clinton-white-house-donald-trump-bullying-barbara-kingsolver\">End this misogynistic horror show.

(In 2012, the state did not report results until four days after election day.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Giving the high early vote totals in both FL and NC, we&#39;re going to know fairly early on whether Clinton has won or Trump still has a shot.</p>&mdash; (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/794215432135864320\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Steve Schale is a Democratic analyst who ran Florida operations for Obama in 2008. He<strong> <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">sees low-propensity Hispanic voters</a> </strong>\u2013 meaning voters who weren\u2019t judged especially likely to turn out \u2013 <strong>pushing the election in Clinton\u2019s direction:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But two things emerged last week. One, this low propensity Hispanic thing became a thing. While Trump folks argued that Trump would turn out low propensity voters, we\u2019d see slight edges for Democrats in this category. What became clear over days last week, this was a Hispanic deal, and as week 2 of early voting took hold, so did this surge. As of Saturday, Democrats had an edge of more than 175K low propensity voters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale also sees <a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">serious strength</a> for <strong>Clinton in Miami-Dade:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dade is at 11.9% of all votes cast so far (should be 10.3%), and Broward is at 9.55%, where I had it pegged at 8.75%. The media market is a full two points bigger than it should be. If the Miami market finishes at 21.8% of all votes, this thing is cooked, and we will know it before 8:00 (assuming Miami decides to count all these ballots)</p> </blockquote> <p>Schale sees <strong>Clinton \u201cunder-performing\u201d in Palm Beach county,</strong> two counties north of Miami:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The red flag for Dems: Palm Beach. It is at 62% of its 2012 total, and it is also the county most \u201cunder-performing.\u201d It should be about 7% of the state vote, but today it is about 5.9%. Of all the data points right now, this is the only one that concerns me. While Miami is more than making up for it, for HRC, win path is much easier with a more robust Palm Beach.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a51b3fa0aebea1a11c2e7e8618af8dd2a7fb7f4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording artist Stevie Wonder performing prior to President Obama coming on stage at a Clinton rally at Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Florida, November 6, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://steveschale.com/\">Here\u2019s Schales conclusion:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am going to write a wrap tomorrow for E-Day, but two questions I get a lot.</p> <p>What am I worried about for HRC?</p> <p>Really, almost nothing. I\u2019ve mentioned the Palm Beach thing a few times, but right now, the diversity mix is rounding nicely into shape, and our best counties are way out-performing the state. Right now, she needs the organization on the ground to get this done on Tuesday</p> <p>Could there be a Trump surge on Tuesday? It is possible, because the counties most under-performing right now are Trump counties. His problem, most of them are very small, part of what Jonathan Martin called the Gingrich Counties (where Newt beat Romney)-- those rural places in-between all the big counties.</p> <p>All in all, the I-10 markets are way below where they should be, maybe as much as 3% below where its share should be. If that comes in tomorrow, it will tighten the race considerably.</p> <p>Tomorrow\u2019s memo will also lay out some things you watch for. If she wins by 3, we will know pretty well, probably before the Panhandle returns come back after 8. If it is close, prepare for a long night.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c4ce4b07ceadb3a33c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:26:50.731Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>She was 9 or 10 years old (depending on whether she falls in Aquarius-Leo or in Virgo-Capricorn) when the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Desiline Victor, at 106 years old, is the oldest voter in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiDade?src=hash\">#MiamiDade</a> arrives at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthMiami?src=hash\">#NorthMiami</a> to cast her vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeCareWeVote?src=hash\">#WeCareWeVote</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MobilizeFlorida?src=hash\">#MobilizeFlorida</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PfPo7aeGRx\">pic.twitter.com/PfPo7aeGRx</a></p>&mdash; 1199SEIUFlorida (@1199SEIUFlorida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1199SEIUFlorida/status/795367927285485569\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209ab8e4b029b92ca464f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:18:06.012Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi Grandma, what are you doing today? </p> <p>Hillary Clinton has a granddaughter who just turned two, and a grandson who\u2019s five months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"clinton\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:58.9932126697% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BMg3PI8AH2J/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hillary Clinton Facetimes with her granddaughter Charlotte on final morning of the campaign trail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Sabrina Siddiqui (@sabrinasiddiqui) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-11-07T15:11:20+00:00&quot;&gt;Nov 7, 2016 at 7:11am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209989e4b07ceadb3a33b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:14:43.720Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Philly transit strike ends</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If voters in Philadelphia, prime Democratic territory, don\u2019t turn up at the polls tomorrow, they will not have a weeklong public transit strike to blame.

For Ningsih\u2019s family, in Cilacap, Central Java, having a daughter working in a far-off city never to return was all too familiar. In 2008, her older sister went to work as a domestic helper in Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta. Shortly after she arrived, she disappeared and has never been seen since.</p> <p>That was the same year Ningsih married at 17. Her son was born less than a year later after her husband left just before the baby\u2019s birth. She would be dead at 23.</p> <p>For her family at home, supporting six people on just $70 (\u00a356) a month from rice farming became increasingly difficult, and by the time Ningsih was murdered she was sending her family nearly four times that amount.</p> <p>Although she called her family every day, her son was too young to sit for long conversations and barely knew the woman on the other end of the phone. He was only five years old when she was killed.</p> <p>\u201cHer son never really knew what it meant to have a mother,\u201d Suyitno, Ningsih\u2019s older brother, tells the Guardian. \u201cHe knows this woman is dead, that she was murdered, but doesn\u2019t fully understand who she is in relation to him.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/gender/labour_force/\">Roughly half</a> of Hong Kong\u2019s 340,000 live-in maids are from Indonesia, surviving on just HK$4,000 (\u00a3415) a month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f4592aff26c5144c0d0bab99206b36f10d810de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f4592aff26c5144c0d0bab99206b36f10d810de/0_0_4256_2840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indonesian migrant workers pray during a vigil in Hong Kong in 2014 for the two murder victims.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indonesian migrant workers pray during a vigil in Hong Kong in 2014 for the two murder victims.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desperate situations are common among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/14/forced-labour-common-among-hong-kongs-domestic-helpers-study-finds\">migrants in the city</a>.

In 2013 it was suggested that around 50,000 UK-based individuals were involved in downloading and sharing abusive images of children. Last month police chiefs said they feared the number may have risen significantly since then, with one report putting it at up to 100,000.</p> <p>The German study, which surveyed more than 8,700 men, found that 2.4% of respondents admitted looking at online images of child sexual abuse. Applying the figures to the male UK population, the NSPCC said, \u201cwould equate to an estimate that there may be between 450,000 and 590,000 males aged 18-89 in the UK who have at some point viewed and used child sexual abuse images.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Wanless, the NSPCC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe sheer numbers of people viewing child sexual abuse images online must be addressed as a social emergency. It is two years since the government made it a <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/index.php/news-media/nca-news/771-hundreds-more-potential-image-offenders-identified-through-proactive-targeting-by-police-and-nca\">national priority</a> to rid the internet of these vile crimes against children, but today\u2019s report reveals how horrifyingly prolific the problem remains.\u201d</p> <p>In the past five years, the charity notes, the number of police-recorded offences under obscene publications laws has more than doubled in all four of the UK nations, with a total of 8,745 crimes recorded last year. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, this data only tells us how many images have been found or offenders who have been caught \u2013 the true scale of the issue remains unknown,\u201d the charity said.</p> <p>Wanless said the NSPCC was calling for \u201ca robust action plan to cut off the supply of child sexual abuse images in circulation and deter adults from seeking out child abuse online.\u201d</p> <p>He said the <a href=\"https://www.iwf.org.uk/\">Internet Watch Foundation</a> (IWF), which represents the internet industry, had removed tens of thousands of abusive websites, and he acknowledged the work of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/\">National Crime Agency</a> (NCA) in protecting a record number of victims. \u201cBut it is clear, from the scale of the problem, that we cannot \u2018arrest our way out\u2019 of this challenge,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The charity wants internet firms operating in the UK to sign up to a set of minimum standards, enforced by new regulatory powers, and is calling for an independent annual audit of the current system of voluntary self-regulation, to ensure it is as effective as possible in tackling the problem. <br></p> <p>In addition, it is calling on the government to produce an annual report on the identification and removal of child abuse images accessed from within the UK.</p> <p>Alan Wardle, head of policy for the NSPCC, said part of the challenge for agencies was the difficulty in establishing the scale of a crime that is both hidden and international in reach. \u201cOne of the trends we are seeing is that abuse can be \u2018done to order\u2019 and livestreamed from poorer parts of the world, and I think that is only going to get worse as the internet becomes a more globalised force. <br></p> <p>\u201c[The question has] got to be: how do we prevent this happening, how do we stop people getting these images online and sharing them? Particularly with the technology companies, there\u2019s a big responsibility to ensure that this material is as difficult to find, to share, to access on the internet as it possibly can be.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office welcomed the report, calling the viewing of child abuse images an \u201cappalling crime\u201d and saying it was committed to working with other agencies \u201cto stamp out online child sexual exploitation\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe NCA has received additional funding of \u00a310m for further specialist teams, enabling a near-doubling of their investigative capability, meaning more children being safeguarded,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that the government had led international action on online child exploitation and worked with other countries, the internet industry and NGOs to develop a coordinated response.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the IWF said the UK was already \u201cthe most hostile place in the world for hosting child sex abuse content. Our success in the UK is due to our unparalleled relationships with the internet industry. The internet is without geographical borders, so a truly global effort is what\u2019s needed.\u201d </p>",

But without the numbers, the Greens amendment will not pass.</p> <p>So the Greens will support the crossbench/Labor amendment for a 10.5% backpacker tax.</p> <p>The treasurer, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, has said if the bill is amended, the government will knock it off in the lower house.</p> <p>Which means it will be status quo. Or will it?</p> <p>Morrison says in the absence of the changes, the default tax will be 32.5% \u2013 which was what the Abbott government originally proposed in 2015 (where it all started).</p> <p>Whish-Wilson was claiming the win, no matter what happens.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greens have led on this issue. We were the first party to oppose the backpacker tax. We were the only one to take a costed policy to the election. We were the ones who discovered legislation was required and that the automatic default is not 32.5%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now the default position of the tax is complicated. The key thing to remember is that though the Abbott government originally proposed the tax in 2015, this has been argued about ever since. No backpacker legislation has passed the house since then.</p> <p>That means there is no change to the existing position. </p> <p>Which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax purposes, getting a lesser rate. And some will continue to qualify as non-residents, getting a higher rate.</p> <p>Whish-Wilson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> is talking bulldust that a default rate of 32.5% will start on January 1 2017. The only thing due to come in on January 1 was the government\u2019s law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament. If the legislation fails to pass then the status quo remains unchanged, that is some backpackers are treated as residents, and some are not.</p> <p>Tasmanian farmers, at an individual level, have told me they want this bill dead. They will never trust the government again. Barnaby Joyce did not even visit Tasmania during this debate. He has done nothing to fix the mess his government created.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T06:14:25.729Z\">at 6.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58215a92e4b029b92ca467c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T04:55:48.708Z\">4.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No props. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57b67cb75c0881dd91c5a70460f48f1d5be95ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b67cb75c0881dd91c5a70460f48f1d5be95ad9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposition deputy leader Tanya Plibersek leads a visual taunt with members holding up a photograph of former senator Bob Day with education minister Simon Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposition deputy leader Tanya Plibersek leads a visual taunt with members holding up a photograph of former senator Bob Day with education minister Simon Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labor loses the right to ask a question by using props.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58215879e4b07ceadb3a367d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-08T04:53:33.353Z\">4.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just to keep you going ... the Senate committee report into the attorney general <strong>George Brandis\u2019s </strong>legal direction to the solicitor general <strong>Justin Gleeson</strong> will be tabled tonight about 5pm.</p> <p>That was the committee that saw fiery exchanges between Gleeson and the LNP senator <strong>Ian Macdonald </strong>and in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent\">Gleeson admitted he considered the Brandis direction invalid</a>.

Xenophon says he has told the government the NXT bloc will look at the <strong>forever ban proposal</strong> but this is a \u201cconscience issue\u201d for his parliamentarians. By this he means the <strong>NXT bloc may split on this issue</strong>. In any case, they are not yet set in stone about which way to go. Xenophon is sounding relaxed about his people voting in different ways on this proposal.</p> <p>In terms of Labor\u2019s decision this morning to reject the proposal, here\u2019s a <strong>couple of quick analytical thoughts</strong>.</p> <p>It\u2019s been obvious for a little while that the government\u2019s drive-by attacks on Labor on the boats don\u2019t resonate politically quite as much as they used to. It could be because the boats have stopped, voters are no longer so fixated on unauthorised arrivals making their way south.</p> <p>This trajectory did happen during the Howard years, voters were fixated on the problem (aided by a government telling them constantly it was a problem), but once the \u201cproblem\u201d was \u201cfixed\u201d, it was actually an electoral plus for <strong>Kevin Rudd </strong>in 2007, when he went to the election promising to wind back the punitive \u201cPacific solution\u201d.<br></p> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s just a case of the politics being moderately less toxic. Labor is certainly less worried than it used to be about standing up to the government on border protection, and the new shadow immigration spokesman, <strong>Shayne Neumann</strong>, has set quite a different tone in the portfolio to his predecessor, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>.</p> <p>But I also think there was <strong>no way on God\u2019s earth that the left faction would have supported this latest policy foray by the government</strong>. I suspect Shorten, the leadership group, and the shadow cabinet knew that. It would have been fraught if Shorten had insisted on exercising a bit of \u201cme too-ism\u201d on the government\u2019s proposal. Hence today\u2019s result.

  "<p>Ogoo Farm in Sierra Leone\u2019s Waterloo District is about to bring in its October rice crop. The farmer is optimistic that it will be a record yield. Increasing agricultural productivity is one of the 146 priority initiatives included in the country\u2019s economic recovery plan, also known as the president\u2019s recovery priorities. If all goes well, many farmers will double their production this year.</p> <p>The country spends more than $110m (\u00a389m) annually on importing rice. In 2014, this represented 4.8% of the country\u2019s imports, second to refined petroleum. While Sierra Leone is still a long way from being self-sufficient in its staple food, initiatives such as providing farmers with improved seed rice and fertiliser are part of an extensive plan to jump-start Sierra Leone\u2019s agricultural sector.</p> <p>When President Koroma launched this 24-month economic recovery plan to address the catastrophic effects of the Ebola epidemic and commodities price crash in Sierra Leone, he was unequivocal about its demands, stating that it would require \u201ca new way of working\u201d, collaboration, sacrifice and unity. </p> <p>Mindful of the lessons of the Ebola response, which reasserted the need for Sierra Leone\u2019s sovereignty in its own development, the country\u2019s economic recovery plan is led by Sierra Leoneans. Aligning their support behind it, donors have signalled their approval for the approach, and as the largest single donor, with \u00a3240m, the Department for International Development (DfID) has a substantial stake in its success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/nov/03/afghanistans-corruption-epidemic-is-wasting-billions-in-aid\">Afghanistan's corruption epidemic is wasting billions in aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a nine-month focus on health, education, income and private sector support, the scope widened to include increasing access to water and energy, and boosting public sector efficiency for the remaining 15 months.<br></p> <p>The breadth of the plan reflects the scale of need in Sierra Leone. The economy contracted by 22% in 2015. Electricity reaches less than 10% of the population and only about 5% have access to piped water. Maternal and child health, which had been slowly improving thanks to a free healthcare programme for mothers and children, deteriorated during and after the epidemic. With as many as 100 children in a classroom, educational standards are poor and more than 60%<strong> </strong>of the population <a href=\"https://www.statistics.sl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sierra_leone_labour_force_survey_report_2014.pdf\">is illiterate or semi-literate</a> [pdf].</p> <p>The early months of the programme were taken up with necessary background preparations, such as an intensive planning process, which created the framework to allow recovery activities in all the country\u2019s 149 chiefdoms to be tracked weekly. During this period, managing the nation\u2019s expectations of an immediate improvement in circumstances was a challenge. Introducing community engagement officers to all 14 districts to keep dialogue going and exchange information has helped, and as visible signs of improvement begin to emerge, public confidence in the process is growing. <br> A school construction programme is under way to reduce class sizes by delivering 225 new classrooms across the country. It feeds into a bigger impetus to improve educational outcomes, as does a national school feeding programme, which will give the 1.2 million children in government and government-assisted schools a cooked meal two days a week.  A significant contributor to the severity of the Ebola outbreak was the chronic shortage of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, clinics and communities more generally. The 19 boreholes that have been sunk in Kambia, Sierra Leone\u2019s northernmost province, are the first of 125 that will provide safe water to communities with urgent needs. <br></p> <p>These are part of a wider scheme to supply water to 700,000 people in the provinces and 600,000 in the capital, Freetown, which started with a nationwide water-point mapping survey to identify what is available and where. The recovery plan has expanded to accommodate a dry season scheme for providing water in Freetown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/20/botwana-droughts-dont-spell-disaster-el-nino-countries-take-note\">Droughts don\u2019t have to spell disaster.

  "<p>Gold has long thrived on bouts of uncertainty and right now markets have uncertainty in spades. The Brexit vote in Britain, the prospect of Donald Trump as US president and a raft of elections due in Europe next year have all pushed investors to ramp up their holdings of the precious metal.</p> <p>That strong demand for gold \u2013 seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u2013 has sent its price soaring on world markets this year. But while big investors like pension funds stock up, individuals who fancy their own little pot of gold for a rainy day have been priced out of the market. </p> <p>As the World Gold Council releases its <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/gold-demand-trends\">latest figures</a> we look at key trends for the metal.</p> <h2>Global climate of uncertainty is boosting investor demand</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbfa95df111ddc38d0efacb82ac95a760be17ee/0_0_547_321/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gold demand\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold demand in the third quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Metals Focus; World Gold Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Investment demand for gold was up 44% in the third quarter on a year earlier, dominated by demand from European funds. That was a bright spot in an otherwise weak quarter for gold. Demand was down 10% overall from a year ago, as the growth in investor demand failed to offset a drop in appetite for gold among central banks, the jewellery sector and technology companies that use gold in electronics.</p> <p>The solid demand among institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers builds on a strong first half to 2016. For the year to date, demand from investors is up 98%, according to the World Gold Council, a lobby group for the gold industry. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e0927139e56265df454744c5b5a8ec4eefa3b06/65_0_2402_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As polls tightened between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election, the gold price rose. But Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, says the demand for the precious metal goes beyond worries about a political upset in the US.</p> <p>\u201cFocus this week is going to be centred around the US election but it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Uncertainty rose on the back of the vote for Brexit, and with it activity in the gold market, Hewitt adds. Now investors are worrying about a series of elections in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too. <br></p> <p>\u201cGiven what we have seen in the UK referendum and what we\u2019ve seen in the US election, there is huge uncertainty about what the outcome of these [European elections] is going to be,\u201d says Hewitt.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that is completely clear to us and certainly to institutional investors is that gone are the days of the predictable status quo.\u201d</p> <h2>That has lifted the gold price 20% so far this year</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ef3b0a34823ef55bd28ddcb6ed88a480c8f171/0_0_1323_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The spot gold price this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"510\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The spot gold price this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other factors working in gold\u2019s favour, too. </p> <p>Investor demand has also been helped by the fact interest rates are negative in the eurozone, Japan and elsewhere. That effectively means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/rbs-charging-customers-cash-negative-interest-rates\">people end up paying for the privilege of parking their cash with a bank</a>. In the US and UK, official rates remain in positive territory but they are not far off zero, making returns meagre for savers. That has made gold a more attractive asset and coupled with the boost from geopolitical and economic worries has seen the spot gold price rise more than 20% this year to $1,279 an ounce on Monday.</p> <h2>Pricier gold has put off retail investors</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e90f2166918e05bac39b146478720d4efe5f4f/0_97_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A saleswoman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A saleswoman arranges a gold necklace inside a jewellery showroom in the southern Indian city of Kochi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand for coins, gold bars and jewellery have all suffered from the rise in prices, says Hewitt at World Gold Council. Both China and India, the world\u2019s leading gold markets, experienced a drop in consumer demand this quarter, of 22% and 28% respectively as price savvy customers waited to buy on a dip - something many did at the start of October, he adds.</p> <p>In China, ongoing economic uncertainty also contributed to a softening in sentiment towards gold, as did changing consumer behaviour. </p> <p>In India, appetite has been affected by more stringent government regulations, such as a 1% excise duty on gold jewellery manufacturing, designed to formalise the gold industry, the World Gold Council said. Added to that is the impact of a squeeze on disposable rural incomes. With consistently high prices hurting demand, one or two stores in Southern India introduced gold-plated silver jewellery.</p> <h2>Millennials don\u2019t have the gold bug</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f05618d4be9ad765bddc8ed282316043dcb6660/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A trend among millennials to spend more on going out and travel is impacting the gold market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinopix/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In China and elsewhere changing tastes are impacting the gold market. Hewitt at the World Gold Council says millennials living in Chinese cities do not go for the top grade gold favoured by their parents but instead tend to look for design over quality. They also share a trend seen among other young consumers around the world to spend on experiences rather than objects. </p> <p>\u201cThe industry also faces the challenge of the rising popularity of \u2018experiential\u2019 purchases at the expense of physical consumption,\u201d says the World Gold Council\u2019s report. </p> <p>\u201cEvidence of this can be seen in the way the Chinese populace chose to celebrate the recent Golden Week national holiday. Over the last three years, the number of people choosing to travel during this holiday has grown by nearly 25%, reaching 589million. 31% of this year\u2019s tourists were millennials, born after 1980.\u201d</p> <h2>Gold teeth are out of fashion too</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24dd8f2efff4cbe1d9942a7801f50e963fc858c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24dd8f2efff4cbe1d9942a7801f50e963fc858c5/203_587_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Demand from dentists has been on a declining trend and gold used in dentistry fell another 6% year-on-year in the third quarter. \u201cDemand is expected to fade further as the industry and consumers turn to ceramic materials for cosmetic reasons,\u201d says the World Gold Council report.</p> <h2>Recycling is all the rage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e80cd2cebc8f1077faceccc2180899e9888be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e80cd2cebc8f1077faceccc2180899e9888be9/0_0_5476_3286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shop buying gold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shop buying gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the gold price high, people are being encouraged to dig around their cupboards and take old trinkets and jewellery into services that buy gold from consumers for recycling.</p> <p>That trend was particularly prevalent in India, where consumers cashed in their holdings, swelling the amount of recycled gold in the region to its highest level for almost four years.

Not a subtle moue of displeasure from behind an expensive pair of cufflinks, but a bluntly put, publicly issued ransom. At the end of September the boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, goes to one of the car industry\u2019s biggest annual events, the Paris Motor Show, and declares to reporters that Brexit means the UK now has to cut him \u201ca deal\u201d. If cars made in Britain are to face tariffs on export to Europe, he wants \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">some kind of compensation</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Extraordinary: one of the biggest manufacturers in Britain effectively wants danger money to carry on investing here. Even more remarkably, Nissan has behind it the full might of the Japanese government, which sent 15 pages of demands on behalf of some of the country\u2019s biggest businesses \u2013 along with the veiled threat to pull out of the UK.</p> <p>Faster than you can say Micra, Ghosn is invited to Downing Street. Within two weeks he has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/nissan-chief-executive-carlos-ghosn-meets-theresa-may-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">face-to-face with the prime minister</a>. The UK has just opted to sever four decades of relations with its biggest trading partner, the government has no fiscal policy and her own party is in turmoil \u2013 yet May still clears her diary for the Nissan boss.</p> <p>Then, a few days back, Ghosn announces Sunderland will not only carry on working, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-to-make-new-qashqai-and-x-trail-models-in-britain\" title=\"\">will now make the new-model Qashqai</a>. The obvious question is: what did his company get from our government? Yet business secretary Greg Clark refuses to divulge any detail of how much or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/new-nissan-super-plant-hopes-for-tariff-free-eu-access\" title=\"\">what kind of taxpayer support has been offered</a> to Nissan \u2013 after all, it\u2019s only our money. Instead, he waves off the deal as just a slightly prickly chat in the senior common room.</p> <p>\u201cOne can overcomplicate these things,\u201d he airily tells MPs at the end of October. A mere month after Ghosn made his initial threat, what apparently <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2016-10-31b.687.3\" title=\"\">changed his mind</a> was the government\u2019s \u201cintention to find common ground and to pursue discussions in a rational and civilised way\u201d.</p> <p>To say this doesn\u2019t add up is beside the point: it\u2019s not meant to. Clark and May obviously don\u2019t want a rival carmaker or any other multinational operating in Britain to know how far they will go to keep them onshore. But if the multimillionaire boss of a \u00a333bn auto giant only wanted a \u201crational and civilised\u201d discussion, , he could try a Melvyn Bragg podcast. The Qashqai has been a massive seller for Nissan; the company would not have opted to make the next model out of Sunderland merely on the basis of some comforting ministerial purrs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-nissan-support-idUKKCN12R2FI\" title=\"\">A source</a> tells Reuters that \u201cthe government gave Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event Brexit reduces its competitiveness\u201d. The carmaker itself acknowledges that its executive committee made its decision upon receiving the \u201csupport and assurances of the UK government\u201d. And the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, warns that such deals could cost the taxpayer \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/nissans-post-brexit-deal-could-lead-to-colossal-bills-for-taxpayers\" title=\"\">colossal amounts of money</a>\u201d. How much? Were the EU to slap on 10% extra on British-made cars, the tariff bill for Nissan UK alone would come to just shy of \u00a3300m a year. If May and Clark were to try to cover half of that, they would be extending an unprecedented level of subsidy to just one company.

First the threat, then the bargain, and finally, with unministerial haste, an expensive handshake behind closed doors. Each time, the public will be none the wiser, even as their government commits them to perhaps costly support for some company or sector, each one claiming strategic importance. And don\u2019t think it will stop at cars.</p> <p>Within 48 hours of the Brexit vote, the National Farmers\u2019 Union was preparing for an extraordinary meeting of its council to draw up demands for Downing Street. Top of the list was the \u00a32.4bn in subsidies that farmers get each year from Brussels. Within weeks, the new chancellor Philip Hammond was promising to carry on the handouts until the end of this decade. He made similar offers to universities and businesses reliant on EU grants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Almost inevitably, the British state becomes even more of a milch-cow for big businesses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Put these numbers in context. Starting this week, the government will cut the benefits it gives to 88,000 families. That is huge turmoil \u2013 and it will cut just \u00a3100m from the welfare bill. Yet at the same time, billions are being committed to keep sweet businesses from the pharmaceutical giants to the landowners of the south-west.</p> <p>These are businesses that have already done very well out of taxpayers. Consider Nissan UK: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kevin-farnsworth\" title=\"\">Kevin Farnsworth</a>, lecturer in social policy at the University of York and an expert on government subsidies, calculates that over the past two decades it has taken \u00a3782m in loans, grants and handouts from the British and European public. In upfront cash transfers alone that comes to \u00a3130m.</p> <p>Farnsworth has calculated this figure by combing Nissan accounts as well as the grant documents from the British government and its various agencies. He has compiled a <a href=\"http://staging.corporate-welfare-watch.org.uk/wp/\" title=\"\">database</a> for other major businesses, to be found at corporate-welfare-watch.org.uk.</p> <p>Where this takes you is to the dirty secret of the British business model. From Margaret Thatcher onwards, successive governments have lured multinational investors by promising them access to the single market, a cheap, biddable workforce and a bunch of corporate sweeteners. It was the same offer Dublin made to the tax avoiders of Silicon Valley and \u2013 within its own narrow confines \u2013 it worked. As Farnsworth points out, Britain has reliably taken in proportionately more foreign direct investment than most of its competitors.</p> <p>The problem is that now the UK can no longer guarantee access to 500&#xa0;million European consumers, it will need to make its workers cheaper and even more flexible and offer more handouts.</p> <p>Surveying this debacle, it strikes me that Lord Acton got it wrong. It\u2019s not power that corrupts; it\u2019s powerlessness. What do you bargain with, when three decades of deregulation and weakening of local and central government mean you have hardly any cards left in your hand? Almost inevitably, the British state becomes even more of a milch-cow for big businesses. Forget about foreigners coming over here and taking our benefits; now think about multinationals cherry-picking our benefits. That trade-off isn\u2019t rhetorical: it\u2019s real. That money will come from our social security, our hospitals, our schools. Brexit Britain: a soft touch for corporate welfare.

It has actually declined from 14% to 4%, in part because of an increase in higher-paid part-time roles for women. This is good news as it means that much of the hard work that has been done on improving flexible work options is starting to pay off.</p> <p>The idea of \u201cchoice\u201d becomes questionable, however, when one considers that overwhelmingly it is still women who take on the bulk of unpaid caring roles within families. There are a number of reasons for this (historical and social norms playing a significant part) but, given that men are paid more than women, for many families it just does not make financial sense for men to work part-time as it will result in a bigger cut to the family budget. </p> <h2><strong>Women are paid less because they \u2018choose\u2019 lower-paying jobs</strong></h2> <p>Our report showed that industrial and occupational segregation continue to be significant contributing factors to the gender pay gap. But while occupational segregation is decreasing (i.e. the different types of roles men and women do), the impact of industrial segregation (i.e. the different industries that men and women work in like mining or healthcare) has increased.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/20/the-future-is-flexible-why-companies-must-rethink-work-arrangements\">Life is messy. If we want the brightest workforce, we need more flexible work</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Women are not \u201cchoosing\u201d to work in lower paying industries but, when large numbers of women start to work in an industry, they all get paid less. As Rhaina Cohen explained in an <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/what-programmings-past-reveals-about-todays-gender-pay-gap/498797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> in the Atlantic:</p> <blockquote> <p>A study [by the sociologists Asaf Levanon, Paula England, and Paul Allison], which examined census data from 1950 to 2000, found that, when women enter an occupation in large numbers, that job begins to pay less, even after controlling for a range of factors like skill, race and geography. Their analysis <a href=\"http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/2/865.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">found</a> evidence of \u201cdevaluation\u201d \u2013 that a higher proportion of women in an occupation leads to lower pay because of the discounting of work performed by women.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, in other words: 50 years of data proved that the more women join an industry the less everyone gets paid. </p> <p>If that\u2019s not convincing enough, Cohen also pointed to a study <a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/678518?journalCode=jole\" rel=\"nofollow\">showing</a> that higher the percentage of women in an industry the lower its perceived \u201cprestige\u201d; and a study from 2007 that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sex_of_Class.html?id=8HWYc76LtFcC\" rel=\"nofollow\">found</a> that even where men\u2019s low-wage jobs demand far less in terms of skill, education and certifications than women\u2019s low-wage jobs, the male-dominated ones usually command higher hourly pay.</p> <h2><strong>Women don\u2019t have the same levels of education as men</strong></h2> <p>Despite women reaching higher levels of educational attainment, there has not been an associated decrease in the pay gap between women and men. This graph from the KPMG report makes it clear:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e358576862f4ee00b2c174dbe35df9087e468e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e358576862f4ee00b2c174dbe35df9087e468e2/0_0_737_630/500.jpg\" alt=\"Average individual income for women and men by educational attainment (2014)\" width=\"500\" height=\"427\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average individual income for women and men by educational attainment (2014).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Melbourne Institute/Diversity Council of Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The pay gap figure is bogus because it does not reflect \u2018like-for-like\u2019 pay gaps for employees in the same or comparable roles</strong></h2> <p>It must be said that while it is illegal to pay women less than men doing the same jobs, it is still happening. WGEA\u2019s annual report shows that, even in their first year in the workforce, male graduates earn more than female graduates entering the same roles. Recent <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-22/gender-pay-gap-alive-and-thriving-in-australia/7775244\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimates</a> from Australia suggest that for partners in top firms, the like-for-like gap is up to 5%.</p> <h2><strong>Women don\u2019t negotiate for better pay so it\u2019s their fault if they\u2019re paid less</strong></h2> <p>Again, it\u2019s not true to say women don\u2019t ask for raises. They just don\u2019t receive them at the same rate as men. And there is evidence that when women do negotiate, they are actually penalised. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/news/2016/9/new_study_suggests_women_do_ask_for_pay_rises_but_dont_get_them/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent study from Cass Business School, the University of Warwick</a> and the University of Wisconsin shows that women ask for wage rises just as often as men but men are 25% more likely to get a raise when they ask. The study collected data from 4,600 Australian workers across more than 800 employers and found no difference in the likelihood of asking between the two genders. The authors suggested that it might actually be \u201chow\u201d women ask, that a lack of assertiveness in negotiations is often cited as a potential reason why women might make less money than men for similar work.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/20131206_PP_womennegotiation_1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">WGEA</a> explains, negotiation is usually associated with agentic, and therefore masculine, behaviour. When employers negotiate with women, they tend to offer less and are more likely to resist influence attempts. Studies have shown that women\u2019s reluctance to enter negotiations is partly because they are penalised more than men for doing so. The more women anticipate backlash, the less inclined they are to initiate negotiations.</p> <p>In other words, women are asking for raises but, if they ask too assertively, they\u2019re turned down for being too pushy, and if they don\u2019t ask assertively enough, they aren\u2019t good negotiators so they don\u2019t get a raise.</p> <h2><strong>The pay gap reflects choices women make, not discrimination</strong></h2> <p>First of all, there\u2019s that questionable word, \u201cchoice\u201d, again.</p> <p>Secondly, what our study showed was that sex discrimination continues to be the single largest factor contributing to the gender pay gap, increasing from 35% in 2007 to 38% in 2014. </p> <p>Sex discrimination in the report accounts for everything that is left after all the other factors that have an impact on the gender pay gap, such as age, tenure, time out of the workforce, occupation, industry, part-time work and sector, have been taken into account. This means that more than a third of the gender pay gap is the result of gender discrimination and unconscious bias. </p> <p>In other words, women are paid less than men simply because they are women.</p> <p>So if the new report She\u2019s Price(d)less reveals anything above and beyond what we already know about pay inequity in the Australian economy, it is that we now know exactly what constitutes the gap. </p> <p>Not only should this be enough to silence the sceptics but it should shine a light for individuals and their organisations \u2013 and indeed the wider community \u2013 on where to start fixing the problem.</p>",

Both helped him write the report.</p> <p>The report cites a 2009 study by three contrarian scientists that claimed most of the recent warming (which elsewhere the report argues isn\u2019t real) was down to natural fluctuations of the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a climate phenomenon.</p> <p>But Roberts does not mention the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JD012960/abstract\">follow-up research by a more experienced team of scientists</a> which found that the original study\u2019s conclusion was \u201cnot supported by their analysis or any physical theory presented in their paper, especially as the analysis method itself eliminates the influence of trends on the purported correlations\u201d. Why cite one study but not the other?</p> <p>Roberts claims the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change specifically \u201cignore[s] natural drivers\u201d of the climate system. This is entirely false.</p> <p>The IPCC collates scientific research that looks at human drivers of climate change (the release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning being a main one) in the context of natural fluctuations. </p> <p>Roberts\u2019 report says the natural and seasonal fluctuations in the levels of CO2 recorded in the atmosphere \u201cclearly overrides human production\u201d. </p> <p>Yet his chart shows CO2 peaking higher each year. What is causing the rapidly rising background trend? </p> <p>Why only show four years of data when there are more than 50 years of data available?<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MJIBrown/status/795423206018424832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">50+ years data show CO2 steadily rising due to human emissions, so Malcolm Roberts uses just 4 years to bogusly claim opposite. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0EuB7d0Hqg\">pic.twitter.com/0EuB7d0Hqg</a></p>&mdash; Michael Brown (@MJIBrown) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MJIBrown/status/795423206018424832\">November 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Roberts claims the natural fluctuation in the atmospheric levels of CO2 shows that \u201ccarbon dioxide cannot drive temperature\u201d. </p> <p>But the reason that CO2 levels in the atmosphere change seasonally is<a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/2013/05/07/why-are-seasonal-co2-fluctuations-strongest-in-northern-latitudes/\"> mostly down to the photosynthesis of plants</a> (uptake and respiration). The variations also depend on where you take your measurements.</p> <p>Roberts\u2019s report implies the rise in CO2 in the atmosphere might not be from fossil fuels but instead could be from volcanoes because they carry the same chemical signature. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/06/pew-survey-republicans-are-rejecting-reality-on-climate-change\">Pew survey: Republicans are rejecting reality on climate change | Dana Nuccitelli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But various studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/which-emits-more-carbon-dioxide-volcanoes-or-human-activities\">humans emit about 50 or 60 times more CO2 annually than volcanoes</a>. </p> <p>Roberts\u2019 arguments are all over the place. At times the report argues against itself.</p> <p>The Queensland senator has said he has asked the government\u2019s scientific agencies for \u201cempirical evidence\u201d that CO2 is causing climate change \u2013 evidence he claims does not exist.</p> <p>When he has been shown the real-world evidence, he either ignores it, constructs faulty arguments to discount it or comes up with a one-size-fits-all conspiracy theory to explain why we\u2019re all being conned.</p> <h2>Responsibility of the media</h2> <p>Roberts tends to attack journalists he doesn\u2019t like. </p> <p>In his report he list journalists he says \u201cshow the courage to research the evidence\u201d, naming the likes of Alan Jones, News Corp and Sky News commentator Andrew Bolt, and Graham Lloyd and Chris Kenny of the Australian.</p> <p>In the US, where much of the climate science denial machinery has its base, the same groups who have funded organisations pushing climate science denial have started to pour money into journalism. There is now a network of outlets stridently pro-climate science denial.</p> <p>So how should we all deal with this? </p> <p>The Guardian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/climate-crisis-media-relegates-greatest-challenge-hurtle-us-collapse-planet\">George Monbiot has written</a> that if \u201chumanity fails to prevent climate breakdown\u201d then much fault should lie at the feet of the media.</p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">If journalists aspire to protect the public, then producing stories that allow debunked climate science denial talking points to hang in the air like a bad smell is not going to cut it.</span></p> <p>What happens if journalists fail to give context, fail to expose potential vested interests or fail to distinguish between genuine expertise and fringe beliefs?</p> <p>The impact is not benign.
