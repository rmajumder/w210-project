While we should be concerned about the fate of Crown\u2019s staff, this move also has implications for Crown\u2019s Australian facilities, especially the casino currently being constructed on Sydney Harbour.</p> <p>The Barangaroo casino was marketed to the public in 2013 on the basis that it would attract VIP high-rollers from Asia.

Yet since then, the Chinese government has enforced restrictions on Chinese gamblers taking large sums of money to Macau, a casino industry US diplomats described in <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09HONGKONG2313_a.html\">leaked cables</a> in 2009 as being \u201cbased on a formula that facilitates if not encourages money laundering.\u201d As a result, high-roller gambling in Macau has plummeted to levels <a href=\"http://www.dicj.gov.mo/web/en/information/DadosEstat/2016/content.html#n1\">less than half</a> those recorded in 2013.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s further crackdown by Chinese authorities threatens Packer\u2019s ambitious plans for his Barangaroo casino. <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/deutsche-bank-says-buy-crown-resorts-2016-10\">Markets are reportedly pricing in</a> a 70% reduction in international high-roller gambling in Crown\u2019s Australian casinos, at a time when the viability of the Sydney casino reportedly relies on a threefold increase in revenue from these customers. This is a problem for Crown as it needs to recoup the <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/james-packers-2b-barangaroo-development-vision-to-help-make-sydney-a-truly-global-city/story-fni0cx12-1226840060610\">$2bn</a> it is spending constructing the casino.</p> <p>This latest crackdown by Chinese authorities should not come as a surprise. Independent observers have <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-lies-behind-chinas-clampdown-on-foreign-casinos-37359\">long predicted</a> that Chinese officials are likely to increase their efforts to prevent Chinese capital from exiting the country through international casinos.</p> <p>And Crown has form when it comes to pushing the envelope on gambling promotions in mainland China. In 2007, for example, Packer\u2019s joint-venture casino in Macau was launched with an advertisement featuring moviestar Chow Yun-fat, best known for his role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This absurd, cinematic advertisement featured coded references to gambling, and aired for only three days before it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da8b4e18-c0e1-11df-99c4-00144feab49a\">banned Chinese authorities</a>.

In Sydney, this is likely to lead to increased pressure to legalise poker machines in the casino. While the <a href=\"https://www.liquorandgaming.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/casino/Restricted_Gaming_Licence.pdf\">restricted gaming licence</a> currently bans poker machines from Crown Sydney, such licences can be changed.</p> <p>While Crown has apparently had little success in persuading Chinese government officials to tolerate its gambling business, Packer has demonstrated his ability to influence Australian governments time after time. Whether it be the approval of the Sydney casino itself, which required government intervention to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/ofarrell-denies-favouring-packer-20121107-28yli.html\">bypass the tender process</a>, or the extraordinary licence concessions and reduced tax rate for Crown Melbourne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/14/crown-casino-given-200m-taxpayer-guarantee-in-extraordinary-deal\">announced in 2014</a>, Packer has repeatedly secured special treatment for his Australian casinos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/ka-ching-how-the-gambling-lobby-won-the-fight-over-pokie-reforms\">Ka-ching!

Labor powerbrokers Mark Arbib and Karl Bitar both draw paycheques from Packer, with the newly retired senator Stephen Conroy reportedly approached to join the lobbying effort. A former Liberal minister, Helen Coonan, sits on Crown\u2019s board.</p> <p>And as the recent backflip on the greyhound racing ban in NSW demonstrates, even poorly organised and managed gambling industries have a good chance of overturning unfavourable regulations.</p> <p>If Crown Sydney is granted poker machine licences, it would hardly be the first time an Australian casino gained acceptance by opening without pokies before renegotiating licence agreements down the track. The casinos in Adelaide, Hobart, Darwin, Alice Springs, and Launceston all followed this routine, while Canberra Casino looks to be the latest to join these ranks with a strong likelihood that a re-elected Labor government will grant 200 poker machine licences.</p> <p>If Barangaroo casino requires local gamblers to underwrite its viability, it will exact a toll of suffering from the Sydney community. According to the Productivity Commission, more than 42% of money lost on poker machines and 11% on table games comes from problem gamblers. Repaying 10%-42% of the $2bn outlaid to build a harbourside tower is a heavy burden for a small group to bear.</p>",

offshore tax regimes.</p> <p>\u201cIt is essential that momentum is not lost in the wake of the decision to leave the European Union, when laws, regulations and trading arrangements are

according to OECD estimates, with developing countries hit the hardest.</p> <p>The report asks the British government to reconsider whether the best forum for its pursuit of discussions and decisions on international tax matters should actually be the OECD, whose membership is mainly composed of developed countries and which it accused of \u201cnot adequately reflecting the needs of the poorest countries\u201d.</p> <p>The MPs say it is clear from the evidence they received that companies and individuals in the UK as well as in Britain\u2019s crown dependencies and overseas territories \u201cplay a major role in facilitating global corruption\u201d.</p> <p>By way of example, they quote the evidence of Professor Paul Heywood, an anti-corruption expert at the University of Nottingham, who told the committee the role of banks and the City of London \u201cin allowing corrupt money to flow should not be underestimated\u201d.</p> <p>It also notes that approximately half of the

  "<p>The New Horizons spacecraft has nearly finished its 16-month dispatches from Pluto, Nasa scientists said on Tuesday, as they unveiled new hints of clouds and the craft\u2019s next destination in the distant ring of the solar system.</p> <p>Researchers had found last year that Pluto has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/24/pluto-nitrogen-ice-flows-atmosphere-collapse-red-haze\"> layers of strange hazes towering</a> half a million feet (200km) in the sky, but saw none of the swirling storms that cover gas giants or the wisps of condensation that gather in Mars\u2019 thin atmosphere. On Tuesday, at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society\u2019s planetary scientists, principal researcher Alan Stern presented new evidence that clouds may form at dusk and dawn on Pluto.</p> <p>Nasa had found seven candidates for clouds, Stern said, each \u201cquite suggestive of possible but rare condensation clouds on Pluto\u201d. He cautioned, however, that \u201cnone of them can be confirmed as clouds because all of them are very low lying, close to the surface\u201d \u2013 and outside the reach of New Horizons\u2019 instruments.</p> <p>The cloud candidates were not decked or layered like those on Earth, he added, but rather suggest a sky \u201clike it is in the western United States\u201d. That sky would be \u201c99% free of clouds\u201d, he said, but it would suggest \u201cweather on Pluto is even more complex than we imagined.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/01/plutos-perplexing-polygonal-patterns-caused-by-convection-scientists-suggest-sputnik-planum\">Pluto's perplexing polygonal patterns caused by convection, scientists suggest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clouds have a specific definition, he added: \u201cdiscrete features that are optically thick and therefore would block the surface below them\u201d.

Stern said Nasa was only in the earliest stages of talks for a follow-up mission to Pluto, and that any mission would take time. \u201cAlthough New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched, it still took it nine and a half years.\u201d</p> <p>The spacecraft already has sent an enormous amount of data back to scientists, who will finish the download from Pluto\u2019s flyby on Sunday, nearly a year and a half after New Horizons<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/17/pluto-pictures-high-resolution-image-delights-intrigues-scientists\"> became the first manmade object ever to visit </a>the dwarf planet. Analysis of some of that data, Nasa scientist Bonnie Buratti told reporters on Tuesday, showed Pluto\u2019s giant, heart-shaped region is one of the most reflective places in the solar system.</p> <p>Pluto\u2019s icy surface varies in its brightness, from nearly 100% at the heart to only 8% in other regions. Buratti said that intense brightness, like \u201cfreshly fallen snow\u201d, suggests intense activity akin to that on Enceladus, the frozen moon of Saturn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/30/nasa-cassini-images-enceladus-saturn-moon\">where scientists have seen plumes erupting from a saltwater ocean beneath the ice</a>.</p> <p>The body that Pluto looks like, it turns out, is Iapetus, a \u201cstrange, very weird moon of Saturn,\u201d Buratti said, calling the moon \u201cthis world where half is very dark, sweeping up dark particles from the Phoebe ring [the largest ring of Saturn], and the other half is bright, not as bright as Pluto.\u201d </p> <p>She said these clues suggest similar activity on Eris, another dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, the distant ring of the solar system where Pluto orbits.</p> <p>New Horizons is now on its way to MU69, another object in the belt, and scheduled to come within 3,000km of it around New Years Day 2019. Researcher Amanda Zangari said that MU69 could provide a look at \u201cone of the ancient building blocks of the planets\u201d, since the belt contains the \u201cprimordial remnants of the disc that formed the planets\u201d about four billion years ago. </p> <p>Stern refused to speculate on what New Horizons would find there. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been to something like MU69,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t make predictions because they\u2019re so often wrong.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/25/pluto-images-atmospheric-haze-nasa-new-horizons-mission-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4bxmf\"                        data-video-id=\"2343615\"            data-video-name=\"Pluto images reveal luminous haze around planet - video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/25/1437823671775/Pluto-haze-004.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457589056\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/25/1437823671775/Pluto-haze-004.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/25/150725plutonew_KP-24840072.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/25/pluto-images-atmospheric-haze-nasa-new-horizons-mission-video\">Pluto images reveal luminous haze around planet</a></figcaption> </figure>",

But otherwise we do not rule anything or anything out,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Kirby, who co-owned a chain of restaurants and pubs, also said businesses had to take some responsibility for handling the risks of Brexit. </p> \n<p>\u201cI am a businessman and business is all about managing uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as we\u2019d all like to know exactly what the future brings, business make money analysing their risks and preparing contingency plans and preparing the best possible decision for their shareholders or owners. I don\u2019t think you can, in any environment, remove uncertainty.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kirby said currency fluctuations should be expected as the negotiation progressed. \u201cWhatever the exchange rate, it has an impact on some people positively and some people negatively but we do not seek, from government perspective, to influence and we fully expect markets to see a movement as we proceed down the road.\u201d</p> \n<p>The customs union paper was one of three documents presented to ministers during the cabinet meeting. The second discussed options for the UK\u2019s immigration policy after Brexit while the third examined the consequences of the country becoming directly subject to World Trade Organisation rules.</p> \n<p>Ministers were also warned that some ports, including Dover and Holyhead, which handle a lot of road freight, could be seriously clogged up if there were customs checks on vehicles transporting goods.</p> \n<p>The document said that extra infrastructure required, likely to include dozens of parking spaces for lorries undergoing checks, could not physically be built in Dover because of its cliffs.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Roberts, head of communications at the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the Guardian that removal of customs controls in 1992 \u201cstimulated huge growth\u201d of trade between Britain and its EU neighbours.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201c\u00a3120bn of goods is transported on ferries to and from Dover alone every year, and the re-imposition of significant customs checks would cause profound traffic problems near ports and could ultimately cause a reduction in trade volumes.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Roberts argued that the fact that Europe exported more to the UK than imported from it meant there was a strong incentive for EU to offer Britain a reasonable deal even following an exit. \u201cWhether in or out of the customs union, British negotiators should treat the maintenance of unimpeded movement of trade as non-negotiable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>James Hookham, of the Freight Transport Association, said there would be a \u201cprofound\u201d impact if there is a sudden exit from the customs union as over half of Britain\u2019s exports go to the EU. He urged Fox to talk to the individuals involved in the process so he understood any \u201cunintended consequences\u201d.</p> \n<p>Others highlighted the UK-Irish border, which is effectively invisible, warning that it would be a complex issue to tackle if it had to become a new point for customs checks.</p> \n<p>Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said that Irish officials feared that the return of customs posts would provoke terrorist attacks. \u201cThe British and Irish governments would certainly do everything possible to minimise physical customs checks on the border \u2013 perhaps through the use of advanced technology, or simply through checking lorries at towns near the border, rather than at the border itself,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>May is under significant pressure from her own party to deliver Brexit following the vote in June, with many leave campaigners wanting to see a hard break with the EU in which the UK would leave both the customs union and single market.</p> \n<p>But she is also being challenged by backbenchers who want an open relationship with the EU. One of them, Nick Herbert, told the Guardian that the 37% figure obtained by the Guardian underlined the \u201cpainful economic cost if we allow ideology to dictate the terms\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBanking on such a huge increase in non-EU trade in current global economic conditions would be a massive gamble that could leave us all worse off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly why we need a proper debate on the choices so that we can drive a sensible Brexit deal for Britain.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Fox were said to have accused officials of drawing up a deeply \u201cpessimistic paper\u201d that assumed no mitigating factors. The trade secretary told cabinet colleagues that he had received assurances from non EU countries that they would allow the UK would be able to continue trading with them on the same conditions until new agreements had been drawn up.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said they would not comment on the paper, nor give a running commentary on Brexit negotiations.</p> \n<p>The cabinet is grappling with how to approach Brexit at a time when there is growing pressure on for the government to spell out its next steps. After a fortnight in which the pound had fallen amid growing expectations of a \u201chard\u201d Brexit that focuses on controlling immigration, sterling rallied when a court heard that parliament was \u201cvery likely\u201d to be asked to ratify any what ever treaty agreement is ultimately struck with the EU.</p> \n<p>Details of parliament\u2019s potential role emerged during the third day of a legal challenge over whether ministers or MPs have the power to give formal notification to Brussels that Britain is withdrawing under article 50 of the treaty on the European Union. Pressed by the lord chief justice on whether any agreement with the EU would eventually be subject to approval by parliament, James Eadie QC, for the government, confirmed that it was likely.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIt is ultimately dependent upon the agreement of the parties to the treaty, whether they want it to be subject to ratification or not. But as I say, the view within government is that it is very likely that this treaty will be subject to ratification process in the usual way. Most of them are. It is a pretty rare event for the things to take effect immediately upon accession.\u201d</p> \n<p>That opinion was seized on by City traders as a sign that MPs might be able to prevent a hard Brexit, pushing the pound\u2019s value up at one stage to $1.23 \u2013 a rise of almost 1%. Compared with its rate of $1.46 prior to the Brexit referendum, however, it was a small recovery.<br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><br><br></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>",

So other means must be found of trying to make it fit.</p> <p>The government\u2019s decision will be based on the findings of the Airports Commission, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440316/airports-commission-final-report.pdf\" title=\"\">which reported last year</a>. It favours a new runway at Heathrow, and proposes two means of ensuring that the extra flights will not conflict with Britain\u2019s climate pledges. Neither is either fair or workable. The first is that the rest of the economy should make extra cuts in greenhouse gases to accommodate aviation. Already the Climate Change Act imposes a legal target of 80% reductions by 2050. But if flights are to keep growing as the commission expects, those cuts would have to rise to 85%.

An <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdfs/Air%20Traffic%20Controls%20report.pdf\" title=\"\">analysis by the Campaign for Better Transport</a> suggests that the tax required to reconcile a new runway with our carbon commitments is somewhere between \u00a3270 and&#xa0;\u00a3850 for a return flight for a family of four to&#xa0;New York.</p> <p>In other words, the Airports Commission plan amounts to increasing airport capacity then pricing people out. Where\u2019s the sense in that?</p> <p>As the commission doubtless knows, no government would impose such charges, or shut down northern airports to allow Heathrow to grow. Having approved the extra capacity, the government will discover that it\u2019s incompatible with our commitments under the Climate Change Act, mull the consequences for a minute or two, then quietly abandon the commitments. It\u2019s this simple: a third runway at Heathrow means that the UK will not meet its carbon targets.

  "<p>Howard J Curtis of Liverpool asks why the shale gas and oil under the South Downs national park is not being exploited (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/16/in-their-clamour-for-shale-gas-ministers-forgot-the-climate-agreement\">Letters</a>, 17 October). He needs to check his facts. Oil is being extracted from under the South Downs (in Lidsey, Markwells Wood, Singleton and Storrington, for example), there are applications for four wells, including horizontal drilling at Markwells Wood, and there is a site at Broadford Bridge that was prepared by one company, and which is now on the action list by another to bring in a drill. The issues haven\u2019t gone away from Balcombe either.</p> <p>And I do object to such activity taking place, not only here in West Sussex but also elsewhere, including Lancashire and North Yorkshire, when the climate change issues need to be addressed, and quickly.</p> <p>Why are we going after the most difficult fossil fuels to obtain, when they need to stay in the ground and when the economic return on investment is so low? When drills leak and materials can contaminate water supplies? When the Weald area has so many faults that chemicals can easily move towards streams, and when there are no facilities in the south (unlike the five in the north) to deal with the issues of waste water involving large amounts of contaminated materials that cannot be dealt with by sewage treatment works.</p> <p>A workshop held in the US last November to look at fracking, and attended by some 50 of the top US and UK scientists, found more than 140 questions that needed to be answered.<br><strong>Dr Jill Sutcliffe</strong><br><em>Wisborough Green, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 The South Downs has several small oilfields, including Singleton, in the middle of the national park, quietly producing oil. While natural gas was used to light Heathfield, East Sussex, after it was discovered in water wells in 1896, an initial <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/\">assessment by the British Geological Survey</a> suggests the Weald has only limited potential for shale oil. The Jurassic clays contain around 4.4 billion barrels of oil, compared with 37.6 trillion cubic metres of shale gas, which may be trapped within the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bowland-shale-gas-study\">Bowland shales</a>, equivalent to 2,210 billion barrels of oil.</p> <p>Though only a small fraction of this can ever be recovered, it is simply selfish to continue importing hydrocarbons from laxly regulated countries, which are left to suffer from the resulting pollution. What worries me most in the planning applications is the absence of detailed geological mapping \u2013 even when at Wisborough Green in West Sussex 1:10,560 maps existed to help to assess the surface impact of such sites.</p> <p>Even if we cut back drastically on consumption, we cannot afford to reject cleaner forms of transitional carbon technologies, including coalbed methane and carbon capture.

The numbers provide a compelling context to this debate.</p> <ul> <li>Energy occupies a central place in the Australian economy. It\u2019s 6% of the economy or about $100bn value add, and responsible 155,000 jobs.<br></li> <li> Nearly three-quarters of that value comes from coal mining, oil and gas extraction, and petroleum and coal product manufacturing, most of it for export. </li> <li>Australia produces three times as much energy as we consume: we are number eight in the world for production versus number 20 in the world for consumption.</li> <li>We have 100 years of coal reserves and 50 years of gas reserves.</li> <li>And despite the emerging consensus on climate change, growth in Australian energy production in the decade to 2013-14 was twice as fast for black coal and gas as it was for renewables.</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s hardly a surprise then that the owners and other beneficiaries of those future earnings \u2013 that\u2019s the corporates and the government \u2013 are seeking to defend these future earnings.</p> <p>Clean energy threatens their international markets for electricity fuel and production and also for transport where the substitution of clean electricity for liquid fuels is only constrained by fast-evolving battery technology.</p> <p>Any serious view on de-carbonisation implies a massive downgrade in expectations of future earnings and thus market value for these players.</p> <p>That\u2019s where South Australia is one of the world\u2019s biggest challenges to the market value of those bedrock Australian industries because it has moved fastest in shifting its energy mix.</p> <p>But while it is an early adapter it is not an outlier. According to Navigant research for US industry association Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), global \u201cadvanced energy\u201d revenues went from $1.08tn in 2011 to $1.35tn in 2015. That\u2019s up 25% in four years.</p> <p>Quoting the World Bank, Navigant says that from 2014 to 2015, advanced energy revenue grew at more than three times the rate of the world economy overall.</p> <p>That\u2019s a global market of $2tn by 2020 or soon after. Even if you discount for some debatable AEE inclusions such as nuclear, that\u2019s a massive global market.</p> <p>The size and speed of the national and state renewable energy targets are key drivers of Australia building its own \u201cadvanced energy\u201d market, albeit at the cost of the existing Australian energy players.</p> <p>The difference in ambition is becoming one of the fault lines of the major political parties, with Labor\u2019s national 50% target more than double the current Coalition position.</p> <p>Again our figures show the public is backing a fundamental energy transition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=14vhcGSjdUBYR8MJSbE78obXMj5uj_J0pcLI4QQBOee0\" data-alt=\"The Labor Party is committed to a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.

  "<p>Theresa May has retreated from holding a parliamentary vote on airport expansion this autumn after the government was warned that Tory MPs could resign their seats if ministers backed a third runway at Heathrow. Two Conservative sources said Downing Street had been warned by whips that May could face resignations and byelections in seats that could be lost to the Liberal Democrats in south-west London.</p> <p>The prime minister appeared to prepare the way for a decision in favour of expansion at Heathrow on Tuesday, as she revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">cabinet responsibility would be suspended</a> for longstanding opponents of airport expansion in west London. This would allow Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Justine Greening, the education secretary, to carry on voicing dissent on behalf of their constituents.</p> <p>However, May also signalled there may not be a major vote in parliament on the issue until winter 2017/18, despite the belief of senior government and opposition figures that a vote would take place this autumn.</p> <p>One of the MPs who has long been threatening to trigger a contest is Zac Goldsmith, who would be likely to stand as an independent with the support of his local party. He may resign at the point of a decision in favour of Heathrow or put this off until after a formal Commons vote on the issue.<br></p> <p>Tania Mathias, the Twickenham MP who won her seat from Vince Cable last year, is reported by the Evening Standard to support Goldsmith\u2019s decision to trigger a byelection, even though it is strictly against party rules to support anyone standing against an official candidate. </p> <p>May outlined her timetable on Tuesday in a letter to cabinet colleagues, saying cabinet ministers with longstanding opposition to the chosen option could dissent publicly as long as they do not campaign against the government or speak against it in parliament.</p> <p>However, her official spokeswoman could not say whether Conservative MPs would eventually be given a free vote when the final decision is put before parliament. Asked how many ministers have threatened to resign over the decision on aviation strategy, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not keeping a tally.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street sources said May had not categorically ruled out holding a preliminary vote before winter of next year, but pointed out the only legal requirement was for a vote in the final stages, when a national policy statement needed for planning purposes is put to parliament for approval.</p> <p>One Tory backbencher said the parliamentary vote had been put off because of increasing nervousness about resignations.</p> <p>The decision suggests she is not strong enough to whip her cabinet in favour of a pro-Heathrow decision, although her official spokeswoman rejected the idea that partially suspending collective responsibility on this issue was a sign of weakness.</p> <p>Richard Burden, the shadow roads minister, said: \u201cDowning Street\u2019s memo proves once again that ministers are more concerned about managing divisions in the Conservative party than tackling the vital issue of airport capacity \u2026 If the cabinet are now going to be allowed to go their separate ways on this, why could they not have decided to do that a year ago?\u201d The Liberal Democrats accused the government of \u201ckicking the can down the road\u201d and breaking the Conservative party\u2019s promise to people in west London.</p> <p>May allowed a discussion of airport capacity at cabinet on Tuesday morning, but the final decision on whether to back expansion at Heathrow or Gatwick will be taken by a smaller subcommittee by the end of this month.</p> <p>They will choose between three options examined by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/airports-commission-case-for-heathrow-expansion-opaque\">Airports Commission</a>, led by Sir Howard Davies: a third runway at Heathrow, which was the preferred choice, the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick.</p> <p>The commission, established under the coalition government more than four years ago, gave a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heathrow-third-runway-recommended-in-davies-report-on-airport-capacity\">\u201cclear and unanimous\u201d verdict in July 2015 in favour</a> of building a third runway at Heathrow, costing an estimated \u00a317.6bn. But ministers have since almost entirely referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/17/london-airport-expansion-davies-commission-shortlist-heathrow-gatwick\">Davies\u2019 shortlist, delivered in 2013</a>, which included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/17/heathrow-gatwick-airport-runway-davies-interim-report\">a \u00a37.1bn second runway at Gatwick</a>, as well as the Heathrow hub scheme, an alternative \u00a313.5bn proposal for Heathrow to expand an existing runway.</p> <p>Members of the subcommittee include May, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Sajid Javid, a vocal supporter of Heathrow expansion, but not Johnson, Greening, or any other MPs from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> area.</p> <p>A Heathrow spokeswoman said the process was what the airport had expected, with a parliamentary vote necessary on a national policy statement. She said: \u201cThis is the expected and appropriate political process; there is no delay. Government announces its preferred option, consults on that position and publishes a national policy statement, which parliament then approves. Heathrow then applies for planning permission with support of government policy.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cHeathrow expansion has the support of the majority of MPs. In recent polling, 71% of Conservative MPs and 73% of Labour MPs back a new runway at Heathrow.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, told the transport select committee on Monday that parliament would eventually have to vote on a national policy statement, which could only be published following a period of public consultation, to allow a new runway to be built. </p> <p>Opponents of expansion said that the legislative timetable was \u201cnormal procedure\u201d. John Stewart of Hacan, who chaired the campaign against Heathrow\u2019s third runway last time it was approved by the government, said: \u201cYou could argue that they have given themselves a fair bit of time to publish the statement and hold the consultation, but the letter appears to be setting out what would be normal procedure, not any real delay.\u201d </p> <p>The winning airport would expect to secure planning permission by 2021 and not open a new runway before 2025.</p> <p>A new study suggested the need for urgent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may\">airport expansion</a> by 2030 could be diminished by Brexit, as the number of UK air passengers could be around 25 million fewer than forecast by government \u2013 or more than the entire annual traffic of Stansted.</p> <p>Although airports have argued that Britain\u2019s future isolation from the European Union requires rapid investment in airport capacity, the analysis by economists from airline industry body Iata predicts UK air traffic will tail off in the next two years, having experienced four years of rapid growth before the EU referendum.</p> <p>If membership of the European Common Aviation Area is forfeited, Iata\u2019s report warns, the impact would be \u201cfront-loaded\u201d and the costs of air travel to the UK would remain higher for decades, dampening demand.</p> <p>However, the weaker overall demand will make little difference to the main contenders for a new runway in south-east England, with Heathrow having effectively reached capacity in 2011, and forecasts predicting Gatwick\u2019s subsequent rapid growth taking it to capacity by the next decade if not before.</p>",
  "<p>It has become a commonplace to remark on the hyper-sensitivity of the culture; a person saying a vile thing can never be debated, but only no-platformed. A person who once debated another person who went on to say a vile thing thereby shared a platform. Often it\u2019s hard to establish what was vile about the thing, because if you ask, you are giving it a platform. So once an issue has platform status, the platform acquires final authority and all you can talk about is the platform. Taken as a free-speech issue, it is quite two-dimensional (your&#xa0;right to say what you like versus my right not to be offended), and therefore boring.</p> <p>Yet the steady build-up of unsayables has had an effect on humour that you only notice when the jokes are gone.</p> <p>There used to be a place called satire where you could go when politics got really bad. Say you woke up in 1991 and John Major was still prime minister, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/apr/15/how-we-made-spitting-image\" title=\"\">Spitting Image</a>. Or it was 1994, and you had a headachey, breathless, high-altitude feeling that the government of pompous sociopaths would never end: there was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_Today\" title=\"\">The Day Today</a>. Or it was 2005, in a post-Iraq and post-hope landscape of rule by press release, endless meaningless gestures to assuage the forces of moral outrage that only became bolder: and there was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgrd/episodes/guide\" title=\"\">The Thick of It</a>. None of these shows was reactive in the classic sense: they were nothing like the US\u2019s Daily Show.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that we never try to do headline-humour (10 O\u2019Clock Live, The 11 O\u2019Clock Show, Tonightly).

But our defining satirical tradition has always been rather different: tangential, playful, surreal, creating amplified hyper-realities that excel politics rather than reflect it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a730e377a47274d9d63778a8614bea0c723ed69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a730e377a47274d9d63778a8614bea0c723ed69/0_57_2038_1223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Thick of It\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Thick of It: a world where people are monstrously human, complicated, foul and furious.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You didn\u2019t watch Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It in order to think about Alastair Campbell. You watched him to live in a world where you weren\u2019t alienated by polish and spin, where people were monstrously human, complicated, foul and furious in a way you understood. You watched him, ultimately, to forget Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>Re-watching The Day Today now, its surrealism belongs to another age. In episode five, thieves dressed as cleaners steal the British pound. \u201cThe men escaped, making good with their legs on open ground,\u201d Chris Morris\u2019s newsreader intoned. (Jesse Armstrong, who co-created Peep Show and co-wrote The Thick of It, noted: \u201cThe Day Today was at least as interested in satirising form as content.\u201d At the time, it felt like traditional news might never recover from how ridiculous Morris made its conventions look.) The anchor continued that the Bank of England had issued \u201can emergency currency based on the Queen\u2019s eggs, several thousand of which were removed from her ovaries in 1953 and held in reserve\u201d.</p> <p>There is a lot of trust in the surreal \u2013 Morris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/armandoiannucci\" title=\"\">Armando Iannucci</a> et al trusted the audience to get that jokes, like mercury, told you something you couldn\u2019t guess but slipped through your fingers if you tried to catch them. We trusted them to bring insight with their obliqueness, without which \u201csurreal\u201d is just another word for \u201crandom\u201d. The reward of that mutuality was a sense of belonging much more profound than the gooey crowd-think of a Bake Off final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74768b1b1d4facd500e989378ada458916a49c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74768b1b1d4facd500e989378ada458916a49c5f/914_65_1458_1823/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Morris\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Morris: ridiculed news in The Day Today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kramer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you told Morris\u2019s joke today, there would be a pearl-clutching, royalist faction (let\u2019s term it, for brevity, the Daily Mail) outraged that jokes were being made (with taxpayers\u2019 money/where children might see \u2013 delete according to the channel) about the Queen\u2019s gynaecological apparatus. Followed swiftly by: \u201cAnd aren\u2019t you lefties supposed to be feminists? How would you feel if someone made a joke about your eggs?\u201d From the other side, a feminist outcry, how can the Queen\u2019s eggs function as a joke in this context without the presupposition that shame is indivisible from the condition of being female? You would find yourself having to defend it; and justifying a joke, like pleading your own character, is to have lost before you begin.</p> <p>Two personnel notes. First, there are no women in this piece; political satire is a very male world. Second, as Armstrong said bluntly: \u201cTalking about satire feels like death. If I heard somebody go, \u2018Now I\u2019m going to write some satire\u2019, and I had to think what that person looked like, I\u2019d think, \u2018That person looks like a wanker.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is a magic circle-like code: that the truest of the satirists would never speak of it. More than once, someone said: \u201cI bet Chris Morris would never go near a conversation like this.\u201d And it was true, he wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ian-martin\" title=\"\">Ian Martin</a>, originally hired as a \u201cswearing consultant\u201d by Iannucci for The Thick of It, went on to become one of the main writers. \u201cI still remember one from a few years back,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the characters had demanded of another character that they behave \u2018like a Hutu\u2019, in graphic and unpleasant detail. It was massively \u2018inappropriate\u2019 and precisely the sort of awful thing that character would say.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, I was challenged to explain why I thought genocide was funny. And that\u2019s the tone now, isn\u2019t it? Creepy 1984 vibe. Bumptious, puffed-up little dickheads demanding so-and-so is \u2018sacked by the BBC\u2019. Everyone patrols the boundaries of their own jokes and opinions now. But if they do go over the line, there\u2019s a great mass of outrage starlings ready to swoop down and Hitchcock them.\u201d</p> <p>Iannucci agrees that something has changed. \u201cI\u2019ve found this very worrying, the idea that if anyone says anything that might offend anyone, they mustn\u2019t&#xa0;be given a platform. It\u2019s like when a complaint is made about a satire show, the reply goes out immediately: \u2018The intention was never to offend.\u2019 The intention <em>was</em> to offend. If&#xa0;it hadn\u2019t offended, it wouldn\u2019t be funny. If we have beliefs, religious or political, and they\u2019re not strong enough to stand up to a joke, then they&#xa0;can\u2019t be that good.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this new respect for offence-taking doesn\u2019t touch the people who are actually offensive. Iannucci\u2019s example is: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign manager said this morning, \u2018This thing about locking Hillary up in prison, that was just a quip.\u2019 Trump saying \u2018if I were in charge, you\u2019d be in jail\u2019, doesn\u2019t sound like a joke. There\u2019s nothing to signify that it\u2019s a joke. There\u2019s no set up and no punchline. If it\u2019s a bold statement that then takes 24 hours to clarify that it\u2019s a&#xa0;joke \u2026\u201d \u2013 he has reached a beautiful crescendo, like a Gettysburg Address to&#xa0;the honour of the joke \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s not a joke!\u201d</p> <p>Iannucci believes that in this polarisation \u2013 excessive sensitivity quelling humour on one side, radical insensitivity masquerading as humour on the other \u2013 comedy has come to replicate the new extremes of politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the third way,\u201d he concludes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9122bfd545341da0428bd5ccff1f2d27772581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9122bfd545341da0428bd5ccff1f2d27772581/3_387_4876_2926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spitting Image puppets of Neil Kinnock, Margaret Thatcher, David Owen and David Steele\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Better times to be a satirist: Spitting Image had plenty of targets in the 1980s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone, from John O\u2019Farrell, writer of Spitting Image, onwards, has what Armstrong calls \u201ca wistful respect for the endeavour of being in politics\u201d. \u201cI think politics should be held&#xa0;in higher esteem,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says, and not just because, without it, satire has \u201csort of died, really. There\u2019s no pedestal to pull them off. The public hold them in such contempt.\u201d Armstrong generally resists grand theories about the state of satire, preferring the happenstance explanation that you get&#xa0;little bubbles of great talent \u2013 Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, the Pythons, Iannucci and Morris \u2013 but you don\u2019t get them all the time, any more than you get great pop songs all the time. Some decades don\u2019t&#xa0;have a Beatles. \u201cBut if I&#xa0;thought there was any dip in satirical output, I&#xa0;might put it down to the fact that, usually, satirists are there to prick the pomposity of the establishment. That\u2019s an over-beaten pi\u00f1ata. Everyone\u2019s kicking the shit out of the establishment. Being puckish about the trains not running on time, or cold tea, there\u2019s some fucker sitting there going:&#xa0;\u2018You know why the tea\u2019s cold? Because of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Farrell sees nothing new in the offence-taking: \u201cThe 80s was another time of extreme leftier-than-thou, people trying to catch each other out and trip each other up, outmanoeuvre each other for political purity. It\u2019s related to a lack of confidence.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s because we keep losing. But I keep wondering whether it\u2019s that way round, or whether we keep losing because we have lost our confidence.</p> <p>Contempt for mainstream politics is&#xa0;possibly a global, certainly <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org\" title=\"\">OECD</a> constant nowadays, and makes the work of challenging the establishment difficult everywhere. But \u2013 although perhaps I am suffering a surfeit of national pride \u2013 I think there is something about politics at its extremes that neuters British satire in a specific way. The Americans lampoon their politicians with direct mimicry \u2013 Tina Fey as Sarah Palin, Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump \u2013 and it works, it\u2019s funny. Baldwin <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-17/donald-trump-says-alec-baldwin-%E2%80%99stinks%E2%80%99-on-saturday-night-live/7937516\" title=\"\">riled Trump</a> enough that the latter responded, calling Saturday Night Live \u201cboring and unfunny\u201d (though his narcissist\u2019s rage admits no dignity, so his taking to Twitter is not as unusual as it would be from any other politician). Whereas, here, anything so direct falls flat: \u201cIf we did a joke, now, about Theresa May the individual,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says, \u201cthat she hadn\u2019t told the truth or whatever, people would just say, \u2018We knew that.\u2019 If we did those sketches from the 80s \u2013 Margaret Thatcher is bossy \u2013 it just wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Tracking to further extremes, it is really hard to mock Nigel Farage: he is already a caricature of a little England neo-fascist, defending Trump\u2019s pussy-grabbing one day, attacking Goldman Sachs without quite saying the words \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d the next. He is a mockery already, and he&#xa0;isn\u2019t laughing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66d23fddb248669701ed0585ba4e3e35babd88f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d23fddb248669701ed0585ba4e3e35babd88f2/135_2_3395_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Nigel met Donald: beyond satire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin\u2019s analysis is easily the most depressing. \u201cIt\u2019s the great hate shift of&#xa0;early 21st-century civilisation. Righteous anger has tipped over online into righteous hatred and it\u2019s poisoned everything. Maybe that\u2019s OK, you know? Victimhood is a legitimate response to targeted abuse. And the internet\u2019s full of wankers. And civil society is struggling to redefine itself, and all the guy ropes have snapped and it\u2019s a howling gale, and maybe if the price for some sort of sanity is PC humour, then so be it.\u201d But underneath, everyone hopes that it\u2019s out there, we just have to look in the right place. Satire is a young person\u2019s game, which means a digital platform, which means it probably won\u2019t be in a Soho cabaret or on BBC2.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re due a satire boom,\u201d O\u2019Farrell says optimistically. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a rightwing government doing these appalling things; it\u2019s time for satirists to gather under the flag.\u201d Go on, then. \u201cOh, I\u2019m too old now. I leave that to the&#xa0;younger satirists.\u201d</p> <p>But what if satire isn\u2019t firing? How much does that matter? When it is at its height, does it pack any political punch? As Peter Cook said when he opened The Establishment in Soho, he was modelling it on \u201cthose wonderful Berlin cabarets \u2026 which did so much to&#xa0;stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the second world war\u201d. O\u2019Farrell concludes mournfully \u2013 but also quite jauntily, with that dualism made possible by being funny to your bones: \u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned over the&#xa0;30 years of doing it is that satire doesn\u2019t work. It has the opposite effect. Our outrage turns into elation and a joke. It\u2019s a release valve.

But I think every joke is instead of a tiny revolution\u201d. He pauses for a minute, to consider whether any of the Spitting Image sketches had had any destabilising effect on Thatcher\u2019s government. All he can remember was&#xa0;one Tory MP who had changed his&#xa0;mind to vote in Thatcher\u2019s favour, after&#xa0;her Spitting Image puppet looked so sad.</p> <p>Armstrong says Orwell was also wrong in thinking \u201cwe couldn\u2019t have fascism here, because people would laugh at the goose-stepping. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s true. Some people would have been sniggering behind their hands, but a couple of labour camps would solve that problem. It has&#xa0;no objective truth.

She said any cabinet minister with longstanding opposition to the chosen option <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">will be permitted to dissent publicly on behalf of their constituents</a>, without campaigning against the government or speaking against it in parliament. At Westminster MPs were expecting the key vote on airport expansion to come this autumn, and the news has prompted speculation about why May appears to have postponed the Commons decision. One theory is that she wants to avoid Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP, resigning and triggering a byelection in Richmond Park, as he has threatened to do if Heathrow goes ahead. Today the Evening Standard reports that <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/tories-in-revolt-over-heathrow-a3372236.html\">local Conservatives would back Goldsmith,</a> as would Tania Mathias, the Tory MP for the neighbouring constituency, Twickenham. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cancels-plans-to-create-a-market-for-secondary-annuities\">The Treasury has cancelled plans to let people sell their pension annuities. </a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/child-abuse-inquiry-insider-told-home-office-lowell-goddard-concerns-april\">A member of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse panel has said she went to the Home Office with concerns about the then chair, Dame Lowell Goddard, in April, months before the Home Office said it was aware of the reservations surrounding her.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/parliament-very-likely-to-be-asked-to-agree-brexit-deal\">Parliament is \u201cvery likely\u201d to be asked to ratify any future treaty agreement with the European Union, the high court has been told by lawyers for the government. </a></strong>As<strong> Owen Bowcott</strong> reports, the suggestion that MPs might ultimately be able to exert some control over the final Brexit settlement prompted the pound to surge immediately against the dollar in exchange markets.

Five select committee chairmanships have become vacant and, in line with the Wright reforms introduced in 2010 (named after the then Labour MP Tony Wright, who chaired a committee that recommended them), the posts are filled by MPs voting in a secret ballot. Previously it used to be a whips\u2019 stitch-up. Four of the posts are contested, and nominations have just closed.</p> <p>Two of the committees chairmanships have been allocated to Labour and there is a Jeremy Corbyn effect at work; some particularly experienced candidates are standing who would not normally be standing, because in other circumstances they would be serving on the Labour front bench.</p> <p>The contest that will attract most attention is the one to replace Keith Vaz as chair of the <strong>home affairs committee.</strong> This goes to a Labour MP, and there are four candidates.</p> <p><em>Yvette Cooper, Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford</em></p> <p><em>Caroline Flint, Don Valley</em></p> <p><em>Paul Flynn, Newport West</em></p> <p><em>Chuka Umunna, Streatham</em></p> <p>This will be a fascinating contest. Cooper, a former shadow home secretary, Flint, a former Home Office minister, and Umunna, a former shadow business secretary and a current member of the committee, are all strong, mainstream candidates. Flynn, a career backbencher who briefly held two jobs in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet over the summer, is more of a maverick, but he is also passionate about the executive being accountable to parliament.</p> <p>There will also be keen interest in the contest to become chair of the new <strong>Brexit committee</strong>. Again, it has been allocated to Labour and there are just two candidates.</p> <p><em>Hilary Benn, Leeds Central</em></p> <p><em>Kate Hoey, Vauxhall</em></p> <p>Benn is strongly pro-EU, and Hoey is strongly anti, and so it is straight remain/leave fight. Given the fact that most MPs backed remain, and that he is highly respected in the Commons anyway, Benn seems a dead-cert.</p> <p>There are five candidates for the post of <strong>science and technology committee</strong> chair, which goes to a Conservative. They are:</p> <p><em>Victoria Borwick, Kensington</em></p> <p><em>Stephen Metcalfe, South Basildon and East Thurrock</em></p> <p><em>Dr Poulter, Central Suffolk and North Ipswich</em></p> <p><em>Derek Thomas, St Ives</em></p> <p><em>Matt Warman, Boston and Skegness</em></p> <p>And there are just two candidates for the <strong>culture, media and sport committee</strong>, which also goes to a Conservative.</p> <p><em>Damian Collins, Folkestone and Hythe<br></em></p> <p><em>Helen Grant, Maidstone and The Weald</em></p> <p>MPs vote tomorrow and the results will be announced in the afternoon.</p> <p>The fifth committee is the new <strong>international trade</strong> one. This has been allocated to the SNP and there is just one candidate for chairman, Angus MacNeil. So he\u2019s got the job.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580618dce4b055209adaec5c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/heatherstewart\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T12:45:53.967Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Whitehall bade farewell to one of its finest at St Margaret\u2019s church, alongside Westminster Abbey, this lunchtime at the memorial service for Chris Martin, who was principal private secretary to David Cameron.</p> <p>Martin died of cancer last year at the age of just 42, and the church was packed with friends, many of whom are senior civil servants.

Normally benefits are uprated in line with inflation, but the government has frozen most working-age benefits and tax credits until 2020, which means that higher inflation makes them ever less generous.</p> <p>Here is the key passage from its analysis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Figure 1 shows how the size of the expected cut in generosity resulting from the four-year cash freeze has increased in the light of upwards revisions to forecast inflation. As of March 2016 the freeze represented a 4% cut in the value of those benefits affected relative to previous plans (given OBR inflation forecasts). As a result, 11.5 million families were expected to lose an average of \u00a3260 a year, saving the government \u00a33.0 billion in 2019\u201320. Given the latest inflation forecasts from the IMF, the policy now represents a 6% cut to affected benefits. The same 11.5 million families are now expected to lose an average of \u00a3360 a year (\u00a3100 a year more than expected in March), saving the government \u00a34.2 billion in 2019\u201320 (i.e. an additional \u00a31.2 billion over what was expected back in March). Greater losses are found among families \u2013 typically those on lower incomes \u2013 who receive more in benefits: for example, ignoring the 3.2 million families who only receive child benefit, the average loss from higher inflation rises to \u00a3140 per year (from \u00a3330 to \u00a3470).</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Some 11.5m families set to lose an extra \u00a3100 a year from the government\u2019s benefits freeze because of post-Brexit inflation.</strong></li> </ul> <p>And here is the chart quoted in this passage. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32901b5321d53e9fa5404da41b319ec94bba9aef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32901b5321d53e9fa5404da41b319ec94bba9aef/0_15_748_449/500.jpg\" alt=\"Increased losses faced by benefit claimants caused by inflation increases.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Increased losses faced by benefit claimants caused by inflation increases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IFS also says that freezing benefits has become \u201csomething of a habit\u201d for the government but that it is bad policy.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the benefit recipient\u2019s perspective, there is a reason that benefits are uprated in line with prices by default \u2013 since one purpose of benefits is to provide a minimum standard of living, their level should reflect the cost of purchasing the goods and services required to provide that minimum standard. While it is perfectly reasonable to argue \u2013 as the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto did \u2013 that the working age benefit system should be made less generous over this parliament, it is hard to see why the appropriate size of cut should be arbitrarily determined by the impact of movements in sterling on prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58060d96e4b055209adaec27\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T11:56:50.016Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s story on the airports announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">Heathrow or Gatwick: airport expansion to be decided next week</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58060b5fe4b055209adaec14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T11:54:34.394Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Number 10\u2019s decision to announce that it will be suspending collective responsibility over the airport expansion decision is being taken in the lobby as Downing Street all but admitting that the government will decide to go ahead with the third runway.</p> <p>This is from the Evening Standard\u2019s<strong> Pippa Crerar.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar/status/788343707699478528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar\">@PippaCrerar</a> .... which is strongest hint yet that Heathrow runway will get green light.

You can read <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/305-2016_becker_fetzer_novy.pdf\">the entire 62-page paper (Who voted for Brext? A comprehensive district-level analysis) here (pdf).</a> And here is a summary.</p> <p>(I\u2019m grateful for acme in the comments for flagging this up BTL yesterday.)</p> <ul> <li><strong>The academics claims that if the government could have won the referendum if it had spent \u00a33bn more on public services.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our results indicate that modest reductions in fiscal cuts could have swayed the referendum outcome ...</p> <p>The analysis suggests that just a slightly less harsh regime of austerity aimed at cutting benefits could have substantially reduced support for the Vote Leave campaign and overturned the result of the EU referendum.</p> <p>We find that the quality of public service provision is also systematically related to the Vote Leave share. In particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent UK austerity programme are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share. We also produce evidence that lower-quality service provision in the National Health Service is associated with the success of Vote Leave ...</p> <p>Our regressions allow for a counterfactual analysis. We find that relatively modest reductions in fiscal cuts at the local authority level (less than \u00a350 per person) may have been sufficient to lead to the opposite referendum outcome, pushing the Vote Leave share below 50 percent. The overall reductions in fiscal cuts would have amounted to less than \u00a33 billion in total for the UK. In contrast, even major changes to immigration from Eastern Europe would have been very unlikely to sway the vote in any meaningful way. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>They claim that immigration from Eastern Europe increased the leave vote, but not immigration from other EU countries or from outside the EU.</strong> But they say reducing immigration from Eastern Europe may not have affected the result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A reduction in migration from Eastern Europe, which could have been achieved by opting to phase in freedom of movement in 2004 (which much of the rest of Europe did), could have also reduced the margin of victory for the Leave campaign, but would have been unlikely to overturn the referendum result ...</p> <p>We also find strong evidence that the growth rate of migrants from the 12 EU accession countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 is tightly linked to the Vote Leave share. This stands in contrast to migrant growth from the EU 15 countries or elsewhere in the world. We therefore conclude that migration from predominantly Eastern European countries has had a distinct effect on voters. However, we cannot identify the precise mechanism \u2013 whether the effect on voters is mainly economic through competition in the labour and housing markets, or rather in terms of changing social conditions. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>They say that the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system contributed to leave winning.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anti-EU parties, in particular the UK Independence Party (Ukip), have seen strong popular support in European parliament elections that are based on proportional representation. However, despite significant popular support for Ukip, the party is essentially not represented in the national parliament, implying that a significant share of voters lack formal access to the political system through representation of their views. At the same time, the strong popular support has rightfully attracted media attention. But it has come with no obligation for far-right politicians to assume roles of responsibility towards their electorate by exercising executive power ...</p> <p>We argue that the \u2018Westminster bubble\u2019 is key to understanding the voting outcome. The under-representation of anti-EU parties in the British parliament is likely a crucial contributing factor to the lack of attention paid in the political process to struggling areas, especially in England and Wales. As a result of the first-past-the-post voting system, Ukip currently only has one member of parliament in the House of Commons out of over 600, despite the fact that Ukip came first in the most recent European Parliament elections. Ukip representatives are therefore hardly in positions of political responsibility and thus largely escape media scrutiny. It may therefore be appropriate to consider ways of introducing more proportional representation into British politics. </p> </blockquote> <p>But, remember, just because something gets published by academics, that does not mean it is necessarily correct. <strong>Chris Hanretty</strong>, a politics lecturer and elections expert, has published <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/did-austerity-cause-brexit-7051e691f0ab#.siqz2hxow\">a critique of the paper</a> arguing that the Warwick authors have confused correlation with causation. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem (which the authors recognize) is that \u201clocal authority cutbacks\u201d are a bit like \u201cpurchases of value brands\u201d in the example I gave above: they\u2019re a consequence of an underlying problem, rather than a factor in their own right. As the authors write,</p> <blockquote> <p>geographic variation in the size of the fiscal cuts captures the underlying baseline degree of demand for benefits: the places with highest demand for benefits were naturally more affected</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words: cuts were more severe in poorer areas. If poorer areas were more likely to vote Leave, then anything which is associated with poorer areas will also (probably but not necessarily) end up being associated with the Leave vote, and might therefore emerge as a predictor of the Leave vote purely in virtue of this connection.</p> <p>Oh, by the way \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ce1a720-ce94-3c32-a689-8d2356388a1f\">poorer areas <strong>were</strong> more likely to vote Leave</a>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T10:44:42.967Z\">at 11.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5805eecae4b0cd26ff71e44b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T09:55:20.507Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Balls says he fears Corbyn is unelectable</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some quotes from <strong>Ed Balls</strong>\u2019 interview on the Victoria Derbyshire show.</p> <ul> <li>Balls, <strong>the former shadow chancellor, said that he feared Jeremy Corbyn was unelectable.</strong> He said it was possible that Corbyn could make himself electable, but that so far there was no evidence of this happening.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have got to persuade people they actually really want to be in government, because if you want to be in government you\u2019ve got to persuade those sceptical people in the middle to trust you.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">remarks that seemed highly critical of the Bank of England, and its QE policy,</a> she said: \u201cWhile monetary policy, with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing, provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201d Downing Street later had to clarify that she was not trying to interfere with the Bank\u2019s independence and that QE policy was a matter for them.</p> <p>But it would be unwise to think that that is the end of the matter, and this morning a powerful voice has come to the aid of those in Number 10 who think it is time for a QE rethink. <strong>William Hague</strong>, the former Conservative leader and former foreign secretary, has used <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/17/central-bankers-have-collectively-lost-the-plot-they-must-raise/\">his column in the Telegraph </a>to suggest that the Bank of England should raise interest rates or lose its independence. He also lists 10 problems with the Bank\u2019s continued reliance on QE. Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not an economist but I have come to the conclusion that central banks collectively have now indeed lost the plot. The whole point of their independence was that they could be brave enough to make people confront reality. Yet in reality they are blowing up a bubble of make-believe money to avoid immediate pain, except for penalising the poor and the prudent ...</p> <p>Some central bankers would mount a strong defence of their approach. They would explain that there is a global glut of savings, so interest rates are in any case kept low by market forces. This is true, but it does not mean those rates have to be driven to zero, or even below zero now in some places, by the authorities ...</p> <p>I have bad news for them. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/08/desperate-ecb-risks-destroying-european-project-with-negative-ra/\">The accumulating effects of loose monetary policy globally</a> are intensely political. When pension funds renege on promises, or inequality widens further, or savers become desperate, huge public and political anger is gong to burst over the heads of the world\u2019s central banks. </p> <p>The only way out is for the US Fed to summon the courage to lead the way to higher interest rates, and others to follow slowly but surely. If they fail to do so, the era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end. </p> </blockquote> <p>Where this will lead, I don\u2019t know, but it is strong stuff, and an interesting indication of how the debate is shifting fundamentally on monetary policy.

But it also represented a shifting of risk from the Government to benefit recipients. Previously, higher inflation was a risk to the public finances, increasing cash spending on benefits. Now the risk is borne by low-income households: unless policy changes higher inflation will reduce their real incomes.</p> </blockquote> <p>The government had expected this change to cost households \u00a3260 per year each.

Since the beginning of September, sterling has fallen a further 8 percent or so against the euro and the dollar. This will continue to push up inflation in the months ahead. A stronger oil price will add further to price rises for energy and transport. <br></p> <p>\u201cOver the course of next year, we should expect inflation to rise above the Bank of England\u2019s 2 percent target.

Parts of the agreement will remain frozen, most notably a controversial court to enable investors to resolve disputes with national governments. </p> <p>In order to become a permanent and complete agreement, Ceta must also be ratified by 28 national parliaments and 10 other regional assemblies and upper houses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps\">Canada's trade deal with EU a model for Brexit?

Last week the German constitutional court gave its backing to Ceta, but added several conditions. One significant proviso would allow Germany to withdraw from the temporary treaty, if national parliaments chose not to ratify it.</p> <p>So far, this legal declaration has not convinced Walloon leader Paul Magnette, the man at the centre of the furore. Magnette, a political scientist who studied at the University of Cambridge, became Wallonia\u2019s minister-president in 2014, after stints in Belgium\u2019s national government. </p> <p>The leading political lights of the Francophone world have been urging him to back down, including French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a fellow socialist, who supports Ceta, as well as senior Canadian and EU diplomats.<br></p> <p>Speaking to Walloon MPs on Monday, Magnette said he had encountered \u201cthinly-veiled threats\u201d, but refused to climb down. He argued that Ceta was weighted against European producers. \u201cWhy would Europeans not have the right to protect their markets against exports that would eventually threaten our sectors? This is what I am fighting for.\u201d<br></p> <p>The trade treaty comes at a sensitive time for Wallonia, a region of 3.5 million people, which has struggled with a legacy of industrial decline. Last month, the US firm Caterpillar, maker of diggers, drills and other machinery, announced it was closing its plant in a Charleroi suburb with the loss of 2,000 jobs, as part of a global cost-cutting plan.

But anti-hunt activists are outraged and have found some support politically, with state representative Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/S3000/2702_I1.PDF\">putting forward a bill </a>that would ban bear hunting for five years while non-lethal alternatives are explored. </p> <p>This legislation has little chance of success given the support Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and erstwhile presidential candidate, has given bear hunting.</p> <p>\u201cThis is definitely Christie\u2019s bear hunt,\u201d said Metler. \u201cThree previous governors saw through the malarkey of this bear hunting. When we get a new governor, we hope to stop the bear hunt for good.\u201d</p>",

The likelihood they will return home is slim,\u201d Segun said.</p> <p> There have been frequent reports of stigma and discrimination directed at women who are released by, or escape from, Boko Haram. Campaigners have repeatedly raised concerns that the reaction of communities and relatives to released women might complicate negotiations, and exacerbate victims\u2019 trauma.</p> <p> Bitrus said the students freed last week in the first negotiated release between Nigeria\u2019s government and Boko Haram should be educated abroad. The girls and their parents were reunited amid joyous scenes on Sunday.</p> <p> \u201cWe would prefer that they are taken away from the community and this country because the stigmatisation is going to affect them for the rest of their lives,\u201d Bitrus said. \u201cEven someone believed to have been abused by Boko Haram would be seen in a bad light.\u201d</p> <p> On Sunday, a Boko Haram commander <a href=\"http:// http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/10/shocking-revelations-freed-chibok-girls/\">told local newspaper the Vanguard</a> that about 90 of the students \u201chad since become Boko Haram members, having been married off and radicalised ... as soon as they were captured over two years ago\u201d.</p> <p>Commanders of the group, which has waged a bloody insurgency for seven years, have also claimed that some girls were killed when Nigerian planes bombed their bases.</p> <p> About 60 students who managed to escape in the immediate aftermath of the raid in 2014 faced taunts and insults in Chibok, their home town, since they were labelled \u201cBoko Haram wives\u201d, Bitrus told AP.</p> <p> At least 20 such girls are being educated in the US.</p> <p> Chibok is a small and conservative Christian enclave in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria where many parents are involved in translating the Bible into local languages and belong to the Nigerian branch of the Elgin, Illinois-based Church of the Brethren.</p> <p>\u201cMany had to leave Chibok because they were seen as Boko Haram wives, even if they didn\u2019t even get to the Boko Haram camp. Some never even went back to Chibok and some left very shortly after returning,\u201d said Segun.</p> <p> One father of a newly freed girl, Emos Lawal, said his daughter was \u201cpraying that the rest of them have the chance to come out\u201d.</p> <p> The freed girls have told their parents they were separated into two groups early on in their captivity, when Boko Haram commanders gave them the choice of joining the extremists and embracing Islam, or becoming their slaves, Bitrus said.</p> <p> The girls freed and those 104 whose release is being negotiated are believed to be in the group that rejected Islam and Boko Haram, he explained. The freed girls said they never saw the other girls again.</p> <p> Few details have previously emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls, many of whom are believed to have been taken as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/boko-haram-forced-marriage-rape-torture-abuse-hrw-report\">wives by extremists and systematically raped</a>. Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks. </p> <p> Bitrus said, however, that though the freed girls were used as domestic workers and porters, they were not sexually abused. He said only one girl in the recently freed group was carrying a baby, and her parents have confirmed that she was pregnant when she was kidnapped. </p> <p> This clashes with initial reports that many of the recently released girls had infant children. </p> <p>An aid worker had told AP that he had seen the girls on their release and that all but three carried babies. Bitrus said that report was incorrect.</p> <p> Previous negotiators in talks that failed also had corroborated that more than 100 of the girls did not want to return to their parents, Bitrus said.</p> <p> A report by <a href=\"https://www.mercycorps.org/research-resources/motivations-and-empty-promises-voices-former-boko-haram-combatants-and-nigerian\">Mercy Corps, the US-based aid organisation,</a> suggested that women play a significant role in the Boko Haram insurgency, at least in its early stages. Nearly half of the Boko Haram recruits interviewed for the study were women. Some had been abducted or forced to join the group, but not all.</p> <p> Thousands of other women have been abducted by Boko Haram over recent years and many released. These have also faced systematic discrimination and stigma on their return, say experts.</p> <p> Over the weekend, commanders from Boko Haram said the girls were freed to prove good faith and <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/10/boko-haram-sets-conditions-to-free-83-more-chibok-girls/\">more will be released if demands for cash and an exchange of prisoners are met</a>.</p> <p> Nigeria\u2019s government has denied reports the girls were swapped for four Boko Haram commanders, or that a large ransom was paid.</p>",

  "<h2>RED YAWN</h2> <p>So it turned out that there were more entertaining ways to spend a Monday evening \u2013 that black stuff that seems to be creeping into the grouting round the bathroom taps isn\u2019t going to clean itself and who knows when you\u2019ll next have chance to alphabetise your tinned goods. The titanic clash at Anfield was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">a joyless, goalless affair</a>, failing to disappoint only those for whom anticipation is merely the amuse-bouche of misery. And we all know who\u2019s to blame.</p> <p>Not J\u00fcrgen Klopp, of course, despite his Liverpool side displaying all the poise, composure and passing ability of a zoo on fire for much of the contest. No, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, he\u2019s the one. He\u2019s the coward that set up his Manchester United team to nullify the league\u2019s form side on their own turf. He\u2019s the spoiler. He\u2019s the one who ruined Monday Night Football, the evening that has given us timeless classics already this season like Burnley 2-0 Watford and Sunderland 0-3 Everton.

There\u2019d have been some credit in coming out afterwards with a little smirk and a ton of braggadocio and pointing out that the game had gone almost exactly to his masterplan, that United were a work-in-progress but had got exactly what they came for against a side who were supposed to wipe the floor with them. But no. Post-match Mourinho <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/jose-mourinho-liverpool-anfield-manchester-united-jurgen-klopp\">took a leaf out of Donald Trump\u2019s playbook of criticism deflection</a>. \u201cYes, I said bad things but look at what Bill Clinton did,\u201d became: \u201cYes, we had our lowest possession percentage since Opta began compiling statistics in 2003 but look at what Liverpool did with their 65%.\u201d The Jos\u00e9 continued: \u201cHow many shots on target did Liverpool have on target today? Two. Two shots on target with 65% of possession, you have to be critical of Liverpool. It is their problem, not our problem.\u201d</p> <p>And the general sense that Mourinho had set up United to prevent free-flowing attacking trendsetters Liverpool from being free-flowing attacking trendsetters Liverpool? Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, reckoned Mourinho. In fact, Klopp had prevented free-flowing attacking trendsetters Liverpool from being free-flowing attacking trendsetters Liverpool. \u201cThey played [Emre] Can and [Jordan] Henderson for some reason and they did that for 90 minutes when they normally project more players in attack,\u201d trumped Mourinho. \u201cThey were very cautious.\u201d</p> <p>Credit where credit is due, Jos\u00e9.

  "<p>Northern Ireland\u2019s fragile economy will be hit harder than that of any other UK region by Brexit, local forecasters say, as questions persist about who will replace hundreds of millions of pounds in EU funding.</p> <p>Not only does Northern Ireland stand to lose about \u00a3500m a year in EU funding for farmers, voluntary groups and peace projects, its exports \u2013 60% of which go to Europe \u2013 could suffer if tariffs are imposed on products imported from the UK.</p> <p>The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/philip-hammond-treasury-to-guarantee-post-brexit-funding-for-eu-backed-projects\">has promised to match the current level of agricultural funding through to 2020</a>, but what will happen after that is unclear.</p> <p>\u201cWe will need to address the future of all programmes that are currently EU funded once we have left,\u201d the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, told the Guardian. \u201cOver the coming months HMT [Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury] will consult closely to review all EU funding schemes to ensure that any new funding commitments best serve the UK\u2019s national interest.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pwc.co.uk/who-we-are/regional-sites/northern-ireland/press-releases/northern-ireland-should-avoid-recession-but-it-will-be-close.html\">Forecasters predict</a> that in 2017, the year when article 50 must be triggered, Northern Ireland will be the UK\u2019s weakest performing region, with growth of just 0.2%. </p> <p>The first minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, have urged Theresa May to be mindful of the region\u2019s unique position, pointing out that since 1984 it has benefited from \u00a311bn of EU funding.</p> <p>But the PWC chief economist Esmond Birnie said the focus on the EU funding was kicking the real problem into the long grass, and that this should be a moment for questioning whether subsidies and grants had been a good thing.</p> <p>\u201cIf the NI executive is pinning its hopes on safeguarding the subsidies, it\u2019s a mistake, it\u2019s not realistic and it\u2019s fairly important to have a plan B,\u201d said Birnie. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/29/eu-farming-subsidies-uk-cap-ceiling-england\">Farm subsidies</a>, for instance, have \u201cfossilised a sector in one period of time\u201d with little incentive to innovate \u2013 or even leave the sector \u2013 meaning missed opportunities to grow the business or make it more dynamic, according to Birnie.</p> <p>Some 38,000 farmers and rural projects shared nearly \u00a3350m from Brussels, accounting for about 70% of the region\u2019s EU money. By output, this amounts to three times the subsidies and grants given to farmers in the rest of the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d25fdb0b2c28ddab1e1d3978efaef99492ad8de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d25fdb0b2c28ddab1e1d3978efaef99492ad8de/30_136_4416_2650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banners in the border town of Carrickcarnon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banners in the border town of Carrickcarnon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others point out that the Brussels money is dwarfed by the money London transfers to Belfast each year \u2013 a net \u00a39bn. \u201cThe real paymaster of Northern Ireland is London, not Brussels,\u201d said Graham Brownlow, a lecturer in economics at Queen\u2019s University and co-editor of Irish Economic and Social History.</p> <p>Some sections of the public sector economy are a vestige of the Troubles. The rail and bus services remain state owned, while the management of council homes is outsourced to a housing executive because of sectarianism.</p> <p>But most of the public sector dates back to the founding of Northern Ireland in 1922 following Ireland\u2019s war of independence. </p> <p>\u201cPeople have argued that the private sector is the wealth-generating sector, and the logic being that the problem is there is too much public sector, but for Northern Ireland the public sector is more a consequence of economic failure rather than its cause,\u201d said Brownlow.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Belfast\u2019s hopes of winning an advantage over the rest of the UK, and perhaps even undercutting Ireland, by lowering corporation tax have been dashed, union officials say, because most global companies want to operate inside the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d3e50ecb6ee2b97f30caf1c805a08a377a8502f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3e50ecb6ee2b97f30caf1c805a08a377a8502f/107_332_3934_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May meets Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness in Belfast in July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May meets Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness in Belfast in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Mcerlane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coalition in Belfast, led by the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in, has insisted it will continue to press the UK Treasury for a local corporation tax rate in order to compete with the Irish Republic\u2019s 12.5% rate.</p> <p>But Peter Bunting, the northern secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said it was pointless to cut corporation tax to 12.5%, or even 10%, and try to appeal to multinationals \u201cbecause the rivals down the road will still have access to the single market\u201d.</p> <p>Jimmy Kelly, Unite\u2019s regional secretary, described the power-sharing government\u2019s continued search for a rate as low as 10% as an \u201cunwinnable race for the bottom\u201d.</p> <p>Kelly said: \u201cPost-Brexit it\u2019s unclear whether the beggar-thy-neighbour approach to winning tax haven status will even bring FDI [foreign direct investment] to Northern Ireland.

First, it represents the amplification of Christmas in our culture. Christmas, which used to refer to a few days in December, has expanded into a festive season that begins in November with window displays of fairy lights and sequinned dresses, with themed knitwear days and mince pie popups. (I made that one up, but it can\u2019t be long now.) The premiere of certain Christmas adverts have become an annual red letter day, a retail FA Cup final. In Denmark, hygge is most potent during the long winters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/08/congresbury-somerset-kind-acts-philanthropy\">but exists all year round</a> \u2013 bicycle rides can be hygge, pebbles can be hygge, blue skies can be hygge \u2013 so it is interesting that in translation hygge has become fixed to the winter months. Hygge is a neat trick to take the Christmas feelgood factor and evolve it into something that works as soon as the nights have drawn in, filtering out the garish colourways as deftly as the <a href=\"http://gramfilters.com/inkwell/\">Inkwell filter on an Instagram selfie</a>. Fireside chic with a longer shelf life.</p> <p>It is easy to see why hygge has got a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/book-of-hygge-louisa-thomsen-brits-review\">hold on us this particular winter</a>. 2016 has been a traumatic and abrasive year, spiked with the sudden loss of beloved icons of culture, rocked by moments that have altered the political landscape and our national identity. A heart-rate monitor attached to 2016 would look like the topography of the Rocky mountains, so the soothing balm of hygge is just what the doctor ordered. The <a href=\"http://linnetresearch.dk/about-jeppe-linnet/\">Danish anthropologist Jeppe Trolle Linnet</a>, who has written extensively about hygge, says that if a social gathering is <em>hyggelig</em> (adj), this means that \u201cno one will discuss opposite opinions about politics, economic development or raising children\u201d. And if hygge seems at first glance a surprising rebranding of what the \u201cScandi\u201d or \u201cNordic\u201d prefixes conjure up in popular culture \u2013 from the unsettling Scandi noir of box set sensation fame, with the extreme violence and flawed protagonists of The Killing and The Bridge, to the solid hearth-and-home hygge values \u2013 then consider what Agatha Christie represents. Crime dramas have always been perfect Sunday night fodder, once the curtains are drawn and the fire on.</p> <p>The Nordic gift for extrapolating meaning from the everyday, for creating drama without glitz or glamour, has become particularly resonant in a decade that has seen mindfulness morph from a hippy eccentricity to a buzzword that shifts apps by the million. (<a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> has more than 3 million users in 150 countries.) Intrinsic to hygge is the concept of lavishing your full attention on ordinary moments; lighting a scented candle on the family breakfast table, for example. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/some-rain-must-fall-my-struggle-volume-5-by-karl-ove-knausgaard-review\">Norwegian author Karl Ove Knaussgard</a>, whose six-volume autobiography is an immersion in the everyday, a 4,000-page page-turner with barely a cliffhanger, is made compelling by what Zadie Smith called an ability \u201cto be fully present in and mindful of his own existence\u201d. Hygge is being sold by the yard this Christmas, but in its native habitat it is not a trend, but a way of life. There are many mini-rituals connected to hygge: <em>fika</em>, for instance, is a Swedish word for <a href=\"http://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/fika/\">the hygge-esque ritual of breaking for coffee and cake</a> once or twice a day.</p> <p>Hygge reflects the way we live now in that it gathers interiors, entertaining, food and fashion into one cohesive picture, like a perfectly curated Instagram still life. But it is in fashion where it is disrupting the norm, because \u2013 in contrast to almost any other fashion trend \u2013 the hygge wardrobe is about how clothes feel, rather than how they look. Hygge is a verb as well as a noun, and the hygge wardobe is an experience, not an aesthetic. This may be the future of fashion.</p> <p>Which is odd, because we have forgotten how to talk about fabric and construction. A generation that shops online and for whom at-home dressmaking is folklore, rather than family memory are seldom inclined to inspect seams or feel the weight of fabric in the way their mothers would have. Nonetheless, there is a clear appetite for clothes that feel nice, which has already made itself felt in the rise of cashmere as a status tag in itself. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/16/does-cashmere-get-your-goat\">Cashmere is a brand that stands for pleasure and indulgence</a>, like H\u00e4agen-Dazs.</p> <p>This matters, because the biggest change in consumer habits of the past decade is that we spend our disposable income on experience over possessions. Millennials will <a href=\"http://eventbrite-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/marketing/Millennials_Research/Gen_PR_Final.pdf\">choose to spend their money on an event</a>, rather than a thing. There are solid economic factors behind this, not least that the rise in house prices has produced a generation of adults who are not homeowners, and who are therefore inclined to treat their salaries as pocket money rather than housekeeping. Meanwhile, social media has turned individual experience into social and cultural capital. We are aware of the lives of those around us, from their teen sleepovers to festivals to long-haul winter holidays, in real time. Other people\u2019s photos are part of the daily fabric of modern life.</p> <p>Virtual reality is about to explode the market for experiences. The incoming launch of virtual reality at a consumer level will take the possibilities of selling experience to another level. What began with a boom in festivals and live music and eating out, and expanded into augmented reality with Pok\u00e9mon Go this summer, will grow exponentially once VR offers highly desirable \u201cexperiences\u201d through a headset. Just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/17/hephzibah-anderson-fomo-new-acronym\">Fomo-driven debt</a> replaced shoe addiction as the twentysomething\u2019s financial achilles heel, VR could make a skydive over Mount Everest, or a close encounter with a leopard \u2013 or, for that matter, a dinosaur \u2013 available to click and buy. If these temptations make fashion feel two-dimensional, then fully immersive fashion that feels as good as it looks may become more appealing.</p> <p>Balenciaga, which with Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia at the helm is perhaps the most avant-garde, agenda-setting brand in fashion right now, put the tactile experience of clothes at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/02/demna-gvasalia-reinvigorates-balenciaga-with-strategic-disrespect\">its Paris SS17 fashion show</a> a fortnight ago. An exploration of \u201cthe intimate relationship between couture and fetishism which runs beneath the surface\u201d, the show focused on how it feels when fabric touches skin. It was about the intimacy of a couturier pinning and draping fabric around a woman\u2019s body, and the intensity of sensation in wearing wet-look Spandex, or very high heels. All very different from the cosy world of hygge, but the focus on how the wearer experiences what she is wearing is the same. Don\u2019t be fooled by the soporific fireside glow, because hygge is more radical than you might think.</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve never liked competitions. So when I was approached about becoming one of the new artistic directors of \u201cthe Leeds\u201d, my first reaction was to say no. Then I began to wonder if it might be possible to reinvent the competition in terms of what benefits the participants. It still feels like only yesterday that I was entering competitions myself, and I remember only too well how it felt \u2013 and how I wished it could feel different.</p> <p>I was fortunate enough to win some good prizes, including second prize in the London international piano competition. But I always found such contests intimidating. I\u2019m not a naturally competitive animal \u2013 I don\u2019t enjoy getting into a metaphorical boxing ring, playing the piano and waiting to see who\u2019s going to knock me out. I\u2019ll never forget that awful feeling of: \u201cOh God, I played two wrong notes in that Chopin study,\u201d or worrying that I\u2019d lose points for an unusual fingering.</p> <p>So I decided that if I were to take on Leeds, I wanted it to be a competition that got away from all that. I want to create an environment where participants feel they can be heard as a musician, in an atmosphere that\u2019s like a festival, that includes associated events such as masterclasses and talks. You can take technical brilliance for granted; we want a better way to find and nurture the really interesting musical thinkers and communicators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"493e4d4f40e7159bbfadd73dc2253b33ac38bd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/493e4d4f40e7159bbfadd73dc2253b33ac38bd68/0_31_3981_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Tsybuleva, on stage with conductor Mark Elder, wins the Leeds international piano competition 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Tsybuleva, on stage with conductor Mark Elder, wins the Leeds international piano competition 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LIPC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the problem is that while the format of music competitions has remained largely unchanged for more than half a century, the music world in the same period has changed beyond recognition. When I first started attending concerts as a child, I always felt that the performer was someone very distant and terribly famous: there was a tremendous sense of occasion about being in his or her presence. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s still like that. </p> <p>Today, we have to be far more connected to our audience in all sorts of ways: presentation, talking about music, going into local schools to play to the kids, meeting audiences afterwards, and more. This is hugely important: we have to reach out. And I think a competition must reflect what it means to be an international musician in the 21st century.</p> <p>We decided to hold round one in three different places \u2013 Berlin, New York and Singapore \u2013 six months ahead of round two, when 20-25 pianists will be invited to Leeds. These first rounds will all be recorded by the online classical music video streaming platform Medici TV, which will live-stream the second and each subsequent round to a global audience for free. As before, the BBC will broadcast the semi-finals on radio and the finals on TV and radio, but our new digital partnership and our presence in these three cities will help us reach a much larger international audience and show the world what the competition is really about: taking care of musicians, finding real communicators and nurturing them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/15/can-the-leeds-piano-competition-recover-its-greatness\">Can the Leeds Piano competition recover its greatness?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That also means that our responsibility doesn\u2019t end when the winner is announced. I want to help young pianists avoid some of the bear traps associated with winning competitions. Certain contests that offer their laureates management or promotion have a time limit: you\u2019re only the winner until the next one comes along. That outlook is too short. To build a career you must have the longest possible view: good management is essential. And the relationship has to be right: the manager really has to believe in the musician, which is why you can\u2019t say that X will definitely represent the first-prize winner, or that Y pianist will play with Z orchestra. So in the package we\u2019ve put together, the management company <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AskonasHolt\">Askonas Holt</a> will take up one of the three winners, but not necessarily the first-prize winner \u2013 and there will be enhanced partnerships, such as concerts and other opportunities with, among others, BBC Radio 3, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, the Wigmore Hall and Southbank Centre in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e84d33bcedf641eeb05094fc05bf718398d4b8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e84d33bcedf641eeb05094fc05bf718398d4b8be/0_164_4336_5469/793.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Roll, a17-year-old pianist From Leeds, after winning the Leeds competition in 1963.\" width=\"793\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Roll, a17-year-old pianist From Leeds, after winning the Leeds competition in 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another danger for young winners is that they are catapulted very suddenly into the limelight, and must immediately be able to withstand a gruelling schedule and the pressure they are under to blow everyone away whenever they walk on stage. That\u2019s not what I think Leeds should be about. I want to take the long-term wellbeing of its winners into consideration.</p> <p>That is where mentoring comes in. I was enormously lucky to have been mentored by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/29/alfred-brendel-impatience-was-not-a-vice\">Alfred Brendel</a>. I know how vital it is for a musician starting out to have an established, experienced performer taking an interest and being there to advise. Life as a soloist can be lonely; it can feel like an uphill struggle and there are so many potential pitfalls that the sense of support a mentor can offer is incredibly valuable. I\u2019ll be offering mentoring myself, and we are encouraging our jury to do likewise. Nor will it be limited to the prizewinners (a first, second and third prize will be awarded, along with an audience prize which will be voted for online). We will offer mentoring to any competitor we think would benefit. </p> <p>The topic of corrupt competitions, with jury members voting tactically for one another\u2019s students, has been done to death. Leeds will be as transparent as humanly possible. Our jury, rather than consisting principally of full-time teachers, will be performer-led. Some competitions publish all the jury\u2019s marks to ensure transparency; if we decide to do that, too, it\u2019s fine with me.</p> <p>I\u2019d like the repertoire to be as unrestricted as possible. We\u2019re going to ask the 10 semi-finalists to offer two different recital programmes and write 500 words explaining their choices: when you present pianists with the entire piano repertoire and ask them to build something interesting, you can learn a lot about their musical thinking through their choices.

  "<p>My friend Alan Saville, who has died of cancer aged 69, was an archaeologist and museum curator. He was both outstanding prehistorian and industrious committee worker, not least as an executive of the European Association of Archaeologists, whose journal he edited. He began his career in southern England, and, after moving north in 1989, became a prominent figure in Scottish archaeology.</p> <p>His most enduring achievement in the field is an excavation at Hazleton, Gloucestershire, which he directed between 1979 and 1982 while based at Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum. Responding to the agricultural destruction of prehistoric burial mounds in the Cotswolds, he decided to excavate an entire 60m-long Neolithic long barrow, funded, one season at a time, by the Department for the Environment. However, in 1984, the team were made redundant. Cheltenham council stepped in, the work was largely done by 1988, and Alan lost his job again.</p> <p>His report was published two years later. His meticulous work, along with some exceptional finds, gave the previously ignored site international significance. Looking back in 2010, when the Ministry of Justice had decided that all excavated human remains should be reburied (a policy soon dropped), he did not mince words. Successful scientific studies had been conducted on the Hazleton remains long after the dig. This would have been impossible had they not been kept in a museum, he said, dismissing \u201cquasi-religious funerary sanctions to prehistoric human bone\u201d as \u201csimply nonsensical\u201d. </p> <p>Alan\u2019s passion was ancient stone tool technology, which he studied by the barrowful \u2013 and with microscopic attention \u2013 mostly from excavations by others, including significant projects at Grime\u2019s Graves flint mines in Norfolk, and a large Neolithic gathering place on Hambledon Hill, Dorset. He recognised flint blades found by a local archaeology group near Biggar, South Lanarkshire, to be 14,000 years old, and the earliest certain evidence for humans in Scotland. He was a key ally in 1978 when I formed the Lithic Studies Society, which thanks to him continues to thrive.</p> <p>Alan was born in Lewisham, south-east London, son of Doris and Fred Saville. His father was a fishmonger\u2019s assistant, and a driver and messenger at Coutts bank; his mother mostly a housewife. Alan studied ancient history and archaeology at the University of Birmingham. Having worked in the south-west as a freelance archaeologist and curator, he moved to National Museums Scotland as head of its artefact research unit. When that closed, he became head of the treasure trove unit, and finally the museum\u2019s senior curator, earliest prehistory. Among the exhibitions he curated was Prehistoric Japan: the Collections of Neil Gordon Munro (2001), reflecting another of his interests.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Annette Carruthers, whom he married in 1986.</p>",

The ruling not only limited the justice department\u2019s power to stop some voting laws that can have a discriminatory effect; the department is also unable, for the first time in more than 50 years, to send <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-voting-observers-exclusi-idUSKCN0ZX0QR\">election observers of its own</a> without a court order. </p> \n<p>Almost 800 federal election observers were deployed around the country in 2012. </p> \n<p>Challenging voters is itself not a new idea. The GOP tried to do it in Ohio in 2004 by sending postcards to Democratic voters at their last known address and then challenging the legitimacy of anyone whose postcard bounced back in the mail \u2013 a notorious practice dating back to the civil rights era known as vote caging. The courts stepped in to stop the maneuver in its tracks.</p> \n<p>Since then, a conservative poll-watching group called True the Vote has vowed to train 1 million activists to challenge and confront anyone they regard as suspect. The organization <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/publication/bullies-ballot-box-protecting-freedom-vote-against-wrongful-challenges-and-intimidation\">said in 2012</a> it wanted to make the experience of voting for those voters \u201clike driving and seeing the police following you\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Trump\u2019s predictions of a rigged election have put him out of step even with many of his <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rubio-toomey-dispute-trump-rigged-elections-claims-debates-n668006\">fellow Republicans</a>, including his own running mate, Indiana governor <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/16/498152787/mike-pence-we-will-absolutely-accept-the-result-of-the-election\">Mike Pence</a>, who said on Sunday: \u201cWe will absolutely accept the results of the election.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even the former senator Kit Bond of Missouri, who was one of the first to advocate voter ID laws, and memorably claimed to have found a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/voter-suppression-kevin-drum\">springer spaniel</a> who voted Democratic, has said that Trump\u2019s evidence-free pre-emptive allegation of vote-rigging <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/republicans-rigged-election-claim-donald-trump-229630\">\u201cisn\u2019t going to cut it\u201d.</a> </p> \n<p>The split with the party may itself be an obstacle to Trump pursuing any kind of post-election challenge, because the top election officials in several swing states, including Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona, are Republicans.

  "<p>Over the last couple of years I have written several items on this blog about the worrying lack of plurality in the Irish media market.</p> <p>I have pointed in particular to the fact that a billionaire businessman, Denis O\u2019Brien, owns far too wide a range of media outlets. And I have argued that such a concentration of ownership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/07/should-ireland-allow-denis-obriens-media-empire-larger\">poses potential threats to Ireland\u2019s democracy</a>.</p> <p>Now comes a report by four lawyers at two UK-based legal firms which raises similar concerns and calls on the Irish government to intervene.</p> <p>In the report, \u201con the concentration of media ownership in Ireland\u201d, the authors state: \u201cwe consider there to be a perfect storm which poses grave risks to freedom of expression and media pluralism in the Irish market\u201d.</p> <p>That storm is composed of O\u2019Brien\u2019s reach through newspapers and radio holdings in company with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/16/are-denis-obriens-legal-activities-some-kind-of-record\">his penchant for issuing writs against rival media outfits.</a></p> <p>To recap, O\u2019Brien is the largest shareholder in Independent News &amp; Media (INM), which publishes Ireland\u2019s two best-selling newspapers, plus the Sunday World and Dublin Herald. </p> <p>It also owns the Belfast Telegraph, 50% of the Irish Daily Star and 13 paid-for regional weeklies (<a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/media/inm-group-agrees-deal-to-buy-irishowned-regional-newspapers-35017815.html\">with seven more soon to be acquired</a>).<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.inmplc.com/about-inm/profile/\">According to the INM website</a>, it manages gross assets of \u20ac187.6m and is the largest newspaper contract printer and wholesale newspaper distributor on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Then comes radio. O\u2019Brien is chairman and principal shareholder of Communicorp, which owns Ireland\u2019s two leading commercial radio talk stations, Newstalk and Today FM. In addition, it owns Dublin\u2019s 98FM, SPIN 1038, TXFM (soon to close) and SPIN South West.</p> <p>However, the state\u2019s public service broadcaster, RT\u00c9, is dominant in radio (and TV). It has been calculated, <a href=\"http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/mpm2015/results/ireland/\">in an October 2015 study</a>, that Communicorp has a 20% share of the Irish radio market. The company, citing \u201cindustry standard methodology\u201d, has challenged this, <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1689511.ece\">arguing that it is 16%</a>. </p> <p>Whatever the case, INM\u2019s newspaper dominance in addition to Communicorp\u2019s radio assets anchors O\u2019Brien as the country\u2019s major private media mogul.</p> <p>But there is another aspect to O\u2019Brien\u2019s activities that exercises the new report\u2019s authors: Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Jonathan Price of London\u2019s Doughty Street Chambers, and Gavin Booth and Darragh Mackin of KRW Law in Belfast.</p> <p>Arguing that Ireland has \u201cone of the most concentrated media markets of any democracy\u201d, they contend that this \u201calarming\u201d feature has to be viewed alongside another \u201cgravely concerning aspect of the Irish media landscape\u201d.</p> <p>This is the \u201csustained and regular threats of legal action by Mr O\u2019Brien to media organisations and journalists who are engaged in newsgathering or reporting about his activities.\u201d</p> <p>And this has to be seen in the light of what the authors call the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of Ireland\u2019s current defamation laws. They argue: \u201cThis is a toxic combination for freedom of expression and media plurality\u201d.</p> <p>They believe it \u201cimperative that urgent action is taken\u201d and dismiss \u201csuggestions that this is a constitutional no-go area, or an European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) no-go area\u201d.</p> <p>But they concede that retroactive action to break up media holdings \u201cis a difficult area... affecting property rights and impacting upon an existing market\u201d.</p> <p>So they call for a \u201cdetailed multi-disciplinary analysis\u201d to consider \u201ccomplex and nuanced issues... including how precisely to measure plurality\u201d.</p> <p>To that end, they conclude: \u201cWe recommend that the government establish a cross-disciplinary commission of inquiry\u201d in order to examine the issues \u201cand make concrete recommendations, within a tight time frame\u201d. </p> <p>The authors were commissioned to compile a legal opinion by the Sinn F\u00e9in MEP Lynn Boylan on behalf of the European parliament\u2019s left-wing grouping <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_United_Left%E2%80%93Nordic_Green_Left\">GUE/NGL</a>.</p> <p>Boylan presented the study to the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom <a href=\"https://ecpmf.eu/2016/sched.html\">in Leipzig on 6 October</a>.

  "<p>The Treasury blocked other government departments from charging diesel cars to enter towns and cities blighted by air pollution, documents revealed during a high court hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>Legal NGO ClientEarth is challenging the government\u2019s pollution plan, which by law should cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the \u201cshortest possible time\u201d. Air pollution causes 50,000 early deaths and \u00a327.5bn in costs every year, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, and was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">public health emergency</a>\u201d by MPs in April.</p> <p>It is the second time ClientEarth has sued the government over air pollution, which has broken EU legal limits since 2010 in many parts of the country. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\">ClientEarth won in the supreme court in 2015</a> and ministers were ordered to draw up an action plan, but ClientEarth argues even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years\">new plan</a> is illegal and has gone back to court. Government lawyers will put forward their defence on Wednesday, with the judgment expected in the following weeks or months.</p> <p>ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers have used government documents released as part of the legal process to bolster their arguments. One document shows the environment and transport departments wanted diesel cars, a major source of pollution, included the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\">proposed Clean Air Zones</a>. But the Treasury blocked the move, with officials arguing it \u201cwould be politically very difficult, especially given the impacts on motorists\u201d.</p> <p>Another political consideration was how quickly the EU would move to impose fines on the UK for illegally high air pollution. In developing the air quality plan, the environment secretary, then Liz Truss, had sought the \u201cminimum\u201d steps needed to avoid fines, with officials advising that \u201c2020 is likely to be the earliest the EU will move to fines\u201d.</p> <p>ClientEarth argued that basing the target date for compliance on avoiding fines was arbitrary and did not meet the legal requirement to cut pollution in the shortest possible time.</p> <p>The government documents reveal that a more ambitious air quality plan was considered, with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) stating in September 2015 that \u201cthe current plan represented the backstop option to tackle air quality which has already been pared back considerably\u201d.</p> <p>In May 2015, Defra officials had said a \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario would include wider use of low-emission zones in around 16 cities around London rather than six, and a package of wider national measures to tackle issues outside city centres [\u2026such as] scrappage or tax measures.\u201d </p> <p>The government has proposed just five mandatory Clean Air Zones (CAZs) outside London - in Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton, Nottingham and Derby - and rejected a scrappage scheme for older, dirty vehicles. Both the environment and transport departments recommended changes to Vehicle Excise Duty rates to encourage the purchase of low-pollution vehicles, but the Treasury rejected the idea.</p> <p>The government documents release show the chancellor, then George Osborne, was \u201cvery clear\u201d: he favoured the introduction of mandatory CAZs and \u201cnothing more\u201d.</p> <p>ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers also argued that modelling used by the government to assess the impact of its pollution plans failed to account fully for the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/emissions-new-diesel-cars-far-higher-than-official-limit\">diesel cars emit far more pollution on the road</a> than in official lab-based tests. ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers said the documents show the environment department\u2019s officials were aware that their modelling was very optimistic. The existing data shows that 14-18 CAZs would have to be created to ensure pollution falls to legal levels by 2020, not five, according to ClientEarth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37e2c0d4747105f10ea6e614fdf44d8069ed42a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e2c0d4747105f10ea6e614fdf44d8069ed42a1/0_0_4000_2896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CEO of ClientEarth James Thornton (left) and ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews outside the high court in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CEO of ClientEarth James Thornton (left) and ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews outside the high court in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: \u201cGeorge Osborne has some serious questions to answer. The Treasury\u2019s approach in the face of the tragic toll of air pollution in this country was to oppose anything but the bare minimum as too expensive. But what makes [Osborne\u2019s] behaviour even less understandable is that there is also a significant economic impact.\u201d Andrews said action to cut air pollution would benefit the economy more than it costs.</p> <p>ClientEarth is asking the court to order another new, more effective plan that could include a national network of CAZs and a retrofitting scheme for buses and HGVs.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day that passes air pollution is damaging the lungs of children across the UK,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Grigg, an expert on respiratory medicine and member of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/committee-on-the-medical-effects-of-air-pollutants-comeap#membership\">Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants</a>, which advises the government. \u201cIt is therefore not acceptable to hope that air pollution will fall at some point in the distant future. The government must act now to protect this generation of children.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is firmly committed to improving the UK\u2019s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That\u2019s why we have committed more than \u00a32bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities. We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May was recently asked what makes her angry.

She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/22/4500-slavery-victims-supported-by-salvation-army-in-five-years\">has established a \u00a333m fund</a> focused on \u201chigh risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the UK\u201d. She has repeatedly stated that her government will lead the way in defeating modern slavery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/18/70-of-migrants-to-europe-from-north-africa-trafficked-or-exploited-un-united-nations-survey\">Survey finds 70% of migrants arriving in Europe by boat trafficked or exploited</a> </p> </aside>  <p>High-level political commitment to addressing slavery is something <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/\">Anti-Slavery International</a> has long called for. So having a UK prime minister who makes slavery eradication one of her priorities is to be welcomed and is an opportunity to further advance the work many of us have been doing for such a long time.</p> <p>To make a lasting difference, May will need to broaden her perspective beyond a criminal justice response to slavery. Crucially, she will need to ensure that other policy areas that can directly impact slavery \u2013 in particular trade, development, migration and international human rights law \u2013 are not neglected.</p> <p>There is already a risk that the current anti-immigration rhetoric and the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/contents/enacted\">Immigration Act 2016, </a>with its introduction of an \u201cillegal working\u201d offence, will undermine the intent of the Modern Slavery Act. </p> <p>As early as 2006 Anti-Slavery International identified how enslaved people often had their migration status made irregular to increase the power that traffickers had over them, allowing them to be threatened with denunciation to the authorities and deportation. In other words, traffickers typically try to render their victims in a position of \u201cillegal working\u201d as part of the process of their enslavement. </p> <p>It used to be commonplace for victims of trafficking to report a lack of interest of the police in their plight, which, to her credit, May recognises as a considerable failure in the UK\u2019s domestic response to slavery. However, the new offence of \u201cillegal working\u201d can only lead to further confusion.</p> <p>A closer look at statistics of the<a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-capabilities/uk-human-trafficking-centre/national-referral-mechanism\"> national referral mechanism</a>, the UK-wide slavery victim identification and protection system, reveals that immigration status has a huge influence on how likely a victim is to be protected. For example, of those referred to the NRM, 77% of Poles and 67% of Lithuanians were recognised as victims of trafficking in 2015, while only 11% of Vietnamese and 10% of Nigerians were equally lucky. Given this, one cannot blame a trafficked Nigerian for being hesitant to come forward as a victim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/11/rescuing-trafficked-fishermen-cape-town-south-africa-slave-like-conditions\">Bid for freedom: rescuing trafficked fishermen as they dock in Cape Town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was good to hear that a big part of the \u00a333m will be spent in the countries seen as the main sources of trafficking to Britain, such as Nigeria and Vietnam. Poverty and lack of opportunities in source countries are big factors behind trafficking, so development efforts should contribute to minimising those risks. However, rejecting a big majority of potential victims from those countries and most often deporting them is at odds with that approach. </p> <p>As the prime minister prepares to lead Britain out of the EU she will need to find other trading partners. India is being mentioned as one such nation, despite the fact that the wholesale failure of rule of law for millions of Dalits contributes to their enslavement, often in export-oriented industries that provide our high streets with cheap clothes. How likely is it that modern slavery considerations will feature in those negotiations? </p> <p>No doubt, by way of response to these slavery concerns in international trade, May would point to the important transparency in supply-chain provisions in the Modern Slavery Act, which were the result of intense lobbying by ethically minded British businesses. </p> <p>However, even the most robust business action cannot take the place of the essential governmental action required to establish the necessary human rights protections \u2013 in international trade policy and national business and employment regulation \u2013 that are needed to eradicate slavery from international business supply chains. </p> <p>I have no doubt May\u2019s intentions on slavery are honourable.

Crucially, there are no London MPs on the cabinet subcommittee that will make the decision next week. The other two options under consideration are the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick.<br></p> <p>The committee members are: May; the chancellor, Philip Hammond; the business secretary, Greg Clark; the transport secretary, Chris Grayling; the communities secretary, Sajid Javid; the Scottish secretary, David Mundell; the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom; the chief whip, Gavin Williamson; and the party chair, Patrick McLoughlin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/airport_options-zip/giv-140650CV7byeBOAH/\" data-alt=\"Airport expansion options\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/airport_options-zip/giv-140650CV7byeBOAH/\">Airport expansion options</a> </figure>  <p>During cabinet discussions, which lasted more than an hour, May told colleagues she expected any final scheme to be a \u201cboost to business and competitiveness\u201d and that the decision would be taken in the national interest. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/airport-expansion-the-experts-view\">Airport expansion: the experts' view</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her spokeswoman said: \u201cThe prime minister wanted to approach this in a mature way, recognising that a number of ministers have long held views on this issue. And in light of that there would be a certain period of time after the committee had taken its decision where they would be able to express those views and they would not be expected to publicly support the government\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>May was to write to colleagues on Tuesday afternoon to set out the precise details of how the process would work, and the period of time when Tories would be able to speak their mind on the issue.</p> <p>Downing Street said most cabinet members spoke during the meeting, but there was consensus that a decision needed to be made as soon as possible. </p> <p>The spokeswoman hinted that ministers would eventually have to accept the government\u2019s decision. \u201cThe decision will be subject to the ministerial code, in the usual way, including the rules of collective responsibility, but with this special arrangement for a limited time. She would not confirm if the period would cover the timescale for a vote in the Commons. <br></p> <p>\u201cOnce a decision has been taken, certain ministers who have long-held views or particular constituency interests will have some flexibility to set out their personal position.\u201d <br></p> <p>No 10 said it was \u201cnot the expectation\u201d that ministers would be able to actively campaign against the decision that was taken. Johnson has previously vowed to lie down in front of bulldozers if they started work on the third runway. <br></p> <p>Of the MPs on the committee, Javid is the only one who has expressed strong public support for Heathrow expansion. <br></p> <p>Both May and Hammond have expressed tepid concerns about a third runway in the past, and the local council in May\u2019s Maidenhead constituency is one of those vowing legal action if expansion goes ahead. <br></p> <p>In 2008, May said she was concerned that if Heathrow expansion goes ahead the quality of life for her constituents \u201cwill deteriorate significantly\u201d. However, she has been tight-lipped on the issue since entering the cabinet in 2010. <br></p> <p>Hammond, a former transport secretary, has also historically expressed concerns about congestion and pollution from Heathrow, saying the airport should improve rather than expand. However, he is understood to be open to the economic case for expansion.</p> <p>Asked why there was no London MP on the committee, May\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThis is about national infrastructure. One of the things that came through in the discussion was the importance of this for regions across the UK and making sure that, as we take a national infrastructure decision, we take it on the basis of creating a country that works for everyone.\u201d </p> <p>Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate, has said he would resign and trigger a parliamentary byelection if the government approves Heathrow, with his constituency one of the worst affected by the flight path. </p> <p>Goldsmith, who is popular locally, is considering running in any subsequent byelection, leaving May with a difficult decision over whether to stand a Tory candidate against him, or risk reducing her majority.</p> <p> The Liberal Democrats, who also oppose Heathrow expansion, are thought to be preparing an all-out assault in an attempt to win the west London seat, which recorded one of the highest remain votes in the EU referendum, though Goldsmith voted to leave. </p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, made it clear that party policy was to support Heathrow expansion, which is overwhelmingly backed by some of the country\u2019s largest trade unions, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency contains Heathrow, are opposed to expansion. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: \u201cSuspending collective responsibility to avoid a tricky vote is something that Corbyn does to try and paper over the massive schisms in his party, and now, it seems, the prime minister has taken a leaf out of his book.</p> <p>\u201cThe Conservative party made a \u2018no ifs, no buts\u2019 promise to people in west London \u2013 waiving collective responsibility to save the hides of a couple of ministers will not fly. People will remember this and hold the Tories to account for their actions.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>There is something about cities: in music and literature they are places of hope, where fame and fortune are sought, where culture and art flourish, where love is lost and found.

More than 36,000 people are in Quito, including mayors, NGOs, UN agencies, international financial institutions, urban planners, architects, developers, academics and many others. There is much to discuss: the three-day agenda is chock-full of impressive and diverse topics \u2013 from urban forests, to the regulation of real estate markets, the role and responsibilities of local governments, infrastructure, financing, public space, migration and housing.</p> <p>The outcome of the conference is meant to guide sustainable urban development over the next 20 years. The <a href=\"https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda\">new urban agenda</a> has, in fact, already been drafted and merely awaits the dotting of Is and crossing of Ts before it becomes the blueprint for cities into the future. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/05/habitat-iii-global-housing-conference-quito-climate-change\">Habitat III: the global housing conference the world must stop ignoring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conferences like this have the potential to both overwhelm and underwhelm \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/18/world-quito-ecuador-future-cities-local-voices-habitat-3\">Habitat III </a>is no exception. While the text of the new urban agenda is a neither here nor there document, it does commit governments to \u201cwork towards an urban paradigm shift\u201d. To this end, in an unusual move, mayors from across the globe have been actively participating in all aspects of the conference. There appears to be energy from many involved to go beyond business as usual, and an appetite for learning how to do things differently.</p> <p>But in light of the unprecedented challenges facing most cities, mainly related to housing, the \u201cparadigm shift\u201d suggested in the new urban agenda feels more like a nudge than the radical transformation required. </p> <p>Millions of urban residents live on the edge. Some are homeless, others live in housing that is unaffordable or grossly inadequate, without security of tenure or access to basic services. Still more are being evicted, often en masse, to make way for shopping malls, major sporting events, resource extraction or the next luxury tower. To ensure they, too, can enjoy the city will require a fundamentally different way of thinking about housing. </p> <h2>So let\u2019s get radical</h2> <p>The new urban agenda must undo what\u2019s happened to housing in the last 20 years or more. Housing must now be recognised as a human right, no different than the right to vote or express yourself freely. This means understanding that housing cannot be viewed first and foremost as an economic driver or a commodity to add to an investment portfolio; that forced eviction is not development; that land has more than monetary value; and that the private market must be regulated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/05/un-envoy-europe-refugees-housing-human-right-leilani-farha\">UN envoy: Europe faces daunting task on refugees but housing is a human right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also means housing homeless people rather than making them criminals for trying to stay alive, and it means recognising that everyone has the right to live in the city regardless of socio-economic status.</p> <p>If governments were to govern using this new paradigm, the lives of at least a billion people in inadequate housing would shift significantly.

  "<p>In the past 12 months, Jessica Campbell has had her car\u2019s fuel line cut and its wheel nuts loosened. Late last year, she had a GPS tracker surreptitiously attached to her vehicle. She is now accustomed to being tailed by unfamiliar vehicles on Interstate 5 near her home in Cottage Grove, just outside Eugene, Oregon. Strangers have regularly come uninvited onto her property; someone even stripped the barbed wire on her fence \u201cjust to send a message\u201d. Online, she has repeatedly been threatened with rape and death. </p> <p>And last week, when she showed up at the Canyon City community hall in Grant County, she told me that someone shot at her and her entourage. They misread their GPS, took a wrong turn and stopped to get their bearings when a crack rang out with what Campbell thought was a .22 bullet whizzing by their vehicle. </p> <p>Such threats are part of the pushback her work has sparked in rural Oregon. </p> <p>Campbell co-directs the <a href=\"http://www.rop.org/\">Rural Organizing Project</a>, a not-for-profit group that sets out to confront the rightwing insurgency that has been bubbling away in parts of rural Oregon and throughout the west. A political organizer since high school, she now coordinates groups attempting to respond to divisive tactics from rightwing activists on immigration, race and public land ownership. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c54eb050b3f432b72eed497c508162057dac327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c54eb050b3f432b72eed497c508162057dac327/0_206_3769_2644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Campbell, co-director of the Rural Organizing Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Campbell, co-director of the Rural Organizing Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This extremist surge received national media attention during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/oregon-militia-occupation-revolt-motivation-politics-public-land-ranching-environment\">occupation</a> of the Malheur national wildlife refuge by the Bundy group, but it has continued to rise alongside Trump, with his legitimization of white nationalist politics and his apparent inspiration of insurrectionists across the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">Rebel cowboys: how the Bundy family sparked a new battle for the American west</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Patriot movement is an overarching description for a range of anti-government groups \u2013 from organised militia groups to tax protesters and so-called \u201csovereign citizens\u201d.

She fears this trend will continue long after a Trump defeat. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of paramilitary groups recruiting on the basis of a likely Hillary Clinton win,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m seeing a lot of paramilitary groups recruiting on the basis of a likely Hillary Clinton win</p> <footer> <cite>Jessica Campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Trump started talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/17/donald-trump-rigged-election-hillary-clinton-news-live\">rigged elections</a> and how a Clinton win would show that democracy was broken, \u201cit was just amazing seeing how that resonated with people \u2013 a sense of democracy being broken, feeling like the candidates don\u2019t represent them or anything they want to see happen in this country,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Campbell would vastly prefer that Clinton wins but acknowledges that it may be like it was \u201cafter Obama won, where there was a huge growth in Patriot movement organizing. I\u2019m worried that we are going to see the same thing.\u201d The alleged <a href=\"http://[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/kansas-bomb-plot-arrest-somali.html?\\_r=0\">bomb plot</a> by militia members in Kansas, timed for the day after the election, shows the way in which those fears might be borne out. </p> <p>The Rural Organizing Project is not waiting idly for this tide to roll in. The group has just finished a statewide tour in which they presented a <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/2016/10/03/release-major-investigation-toolkit-to-aid-oregon-communities-facing-militia-movements/\">report</a> on the growth of the Patriot movement, which they collaborated on with <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/#\">Political Research Associates</a>, a thinktank that watches the far right. </p> <p>Instead of inviting people to view it online, Campbell and her colleagues went to eight rural towns and delivered the main points in a series of lectures. The tour finished late last week. </p> <p>Each event followed a pattern developed through long experience confronting those who would prefer that progressive voices aren\u2019t heard. At each stop, after Campbell\u2019s brief Powerpoint summary of Patriot movement organizing in Oregon, they invite written comments that are then read out. In Bend, one question asked about the impact of Patriot movement organizing on tourism; in Canyon City, people wanted to know about the economic roots of the far-right insurgency. Small-group discussions follow. The format is designed to de-escalate the tension that has increasingly riven small-town politics in Oregon, and to minimize opportunities for disruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd1e05f1ad3ea0ba7808e5364adc41e801087ece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd1e05f1ad3ea0ba7808e5364adc41e801087ece/0_56_4928_2984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BJ Soper, a militia member, attended an event in Bend, Oregon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BJ Soper, a militia member, attended an event in Bend, Oregon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campbell and her crew also travel with a highly visible security detail, partly made up of Portland members of the <a href=\"http://www.aaprporegon.org/\">All African People\u2019s Revolutionary Party</a>. Earlier this year, attendees of a workshop were harassed in the carpark outside the event, and they decided that positive, protective steps were needed. </p> <p>The events are hosted by local progressive organising groups, and at the largest events, such as the one in Canyon City in Grant County, 50 to 60 people showed up \u2013 a large number in a county of about 7,000 residents. Although many who come represent the active, progressive minority in small towns, resistance to the militia movement has a way of binding people together who may disagree on a range of issues. Campbell says that the Grant County group features people from \u201cacross the political spectrum\u201d who share a concern about who is directing county politics. </p> <p>These numbers underscore something Campbell stresses: while media reports often suggest that patriots and the far right are representative of community opinion, they are frequently no more than a vocal minority. ROP\u2019s presence encourages those who disagree to the far right\u2019s prescriptions to rise above the intimidation they use to silence their opponents. </p> <p>There were clear signs that their strategy \u2013 which for now Campbell calls \u201can experiment\u201d \u2013 is working to empower locals, and even open up a dialogue with those who have been drawn into the orbit of the far right. </p> <p>In Canyon City last January, Judy Schuette heard about the plans of militia members to meet in Grant County and perhaps spread the occupation there. Schuette called for a response and a public meeting on Facebook. On the floorboards of the community hall, she recalls: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how many people would show up, and we wound up with about 70 people.\u201d</p> <p>After being formally organised in February, the group carried out several actions. They visited Harney County to show support for a protest there, and attended meetings of the county court, the local governing council, to protest increasing militia and Patriot disruption of the body. </p> <p>But ROP\u2019s tour doesn\u2019t just let them put on another big public gathering. Activists also get de-escalation training from the security detail and much-needed information about how to fight and win a long-term campaign against the rightwing insurgency in their community. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44de643b4411f16900e15a7e2cc408a0346a6a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44de643b4411f16900e15a7e2cc408a0346a6a0c/0_0_6016_3827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campbell speaks at an event with a security agent alongside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campbell speaks at an event with a security agent alongside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Campbell, local organisers like Schuette are the prime movers for making change in rural Oregon. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re incredibly dedicated and brilliant. They\u2019re mostly women who care about their community. In Grant County and other counties where people are feeling that their lives could be on the line if they don\u2019t act now, that\u2019s where people are doing the best work.\u201d</p> <p>But Campbell is clear-eyed about the roots of the problem, and her diagnosis cuts through a lot of the armchair debate about where the resentment that underpins rightwing insurgency comes from. \u201cIn rural areas the conditions have been ripe for a white nationalist populist movement. Especially in Oregon where we\u2019re facing demographic shifts in a lot of places, and the economy\u2019s hurting so badly, and we\u2019ve had decades of scapegoating of people of colour as the reason why our economies are so bad.\u201d</p> <p>In some Oregon counties, as in other rural areas, libraries are shutting, and sheriff\u2019s departments can\u2019t provide 911 dispatch after dark. Dwindling services lead to a sense of abandonment. The right can easily step in and provide both a clear political narrative to explain this, and a set of simple-seeming solutions. </p> <p>\u201cThe Patriot movement is attracting people who feel disenfranchised. It\u2019s real out here, where people feel like they have not been listened to at the state level, and particularly by Democrats,\u201d Campbell says.</p> <p>The same dynamic has been driving the election. \u201cThe appeal of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders was that they didn\u2019t feel like establishment figureheads. It didn\u2019t feel like they were going to uphold the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats, who hold a rare trifecta of both state houses and the governorship, see no point in outreach to deep red counties in the east and south of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear that rural Oregon has been written off. We\u2019re often the only game in town.\u201d </p> <p>The focus of the tour might be the militia movement, but the real goal is addressing this sense of lost political agency. </p> <p>\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to take down the Patriot movement. It\u2019s to build a rural Oregon where people have some access to democracy and are able to create change and have an impact on their communities.\u201d</p> <p>Helping these communities to demand the resources they need to shut down rightwing insurgencies means having a conversation with them, and not simply dismissing or scapegoating them. It also requires bravery: if you confront the far right on their own turf, you might be threatened, followed or shot at. </p> <p>We haven\u2019t all been given as big a share of courage as Campbell, the rest of the ROP, and local organizers have. But we can at least listen to what they have to say about the origins of America\u2019s rightwing surge. </p>",

  "<h2><strong>Stunting children\u2019s lives</strong><br></h2> <p>I found deeply depressing the comment from World Bank president Jim Yong Kim about stunted children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) not reading a single letter after going through three or four years of schooling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. Fortunately, Peru is showing the way in addressing this dreadful problem of stunting, notably, by giving cash grants to mothers and monitoring children to ensure they are getting the nutrition they need.</p> <p>It worries me, however, that the mother cited in the article, although doing all the right things with the money to prevent stunting in her younger four, had eight children all told. Whether this was by choice or not, the fact remains that for poor families it is easier to feed two children than eight.</p> <p>Perhaps it is correlation rather than causation, but those countries that have a high incidence of stunting also have high fertility rates. Thus it would seem logical, indeed humane, to provide voluntary family planning services in association with the cash handouts and monitoring of children. Most sub-Saharan countries still have very strong cultural preferences for large families; nevertheless, if mothers could be persuaded to space their children a minimum of three years apart, it would allow for better nutrition of babies and toddlers, and indeed of the mothers themselves if they become pregnant again.<br><strong>Jenny Goldie</strong><br>Michelago, NSW, Australia</p> <h2><strong>The Dalai Lama\u2019s worth</strong><br></h2> <p>Squeezing him out is probably not the best solution, but is the Dalai Lama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-dalai-lama-dont-squeeze-him-out\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a> worth all the fuss?

No, he scuttled off out of it.</p> <p>Admittedly, the Chinese have been heavy-handed in their clean-up, but those who regret this most are probably camera-wielding tourists eager to record Tibet \u201cas it was\u201d.<br><strong>Alexandra Tavernier</strong><br>Marcq-en-Baroeul, France</p> <p>\u2022 It is despicable that the world leaders and religious leaders kowtow to the Chinese and fail to acknowledge and condemn the atrocities committed in Tibet and to outlaw probably the world\u2019s wisest man: the Dalai Lama.<br><strong>Caryl Dickson</strong><br>St Ives, NSW, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Hungarian referendum fails</strong><br></h2> <p>Thank you for providing George Szirtes a page to explain the background and contexts of the apparently ambiguous result of prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s anti-refugee referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/hungary-freedom-viktor-orban-rabble-rousers-migrants-refugees-racism\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. Since a whopping 98% of those who did vote favoured the proposal, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s deputy head could claim a \u201csweeping victory\u201d over the EU \u2013 a sort of Hungarian Brexit. Except that it wasn\u2019t. By simply not voting, a majority of the Hungarian people brought it down, constitutionally: to pass, it had needed a 50% turnout and only got 43.9%.</p> <p>Szirtes was a young boy among the quarter-million Hungarians who became refugees after the heroic uprising of 1956 against the Soviet Union\u2019s puppet state. What a heartless irony that a Hungarian prime minister should seek to turn present-day refugees away. And what a strange one that he is in bed with the ruler of Russia. And strangest of all that a candidate for US president would love to join them.<br><strong>John Ridland</strong><br>Santa Barbara, California, US</p> <h2><strong>Brexit future looks bleak</strong><br></h2> <p>As Jonathan Freedland points out, there is a significant minority in the UK who did not vote for Brexit, as well as many dissenters amongst those who did, who cannot accept Theresa May\u2019s Thatcheresque posturing from a position of demonstrable weakness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/marching-mad-brexit-someone-speak-48-per-cent\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a>. The only visible deal to be negotiated is one of a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d that appeases both the Ukip anti-immigration faction as well as the still-dominant Merkel faction, who insist on all EU members accepting some level of free movement and acceptance of refugees. A difficult fence to straddle, if the ultimate goal is to maintain as a minimum the favoured-nation trading status enjoyed by Norway.</p> <p>May\u2019s poker hand is very short on winning cards \u2013 the bluff that the rights of current EU citizens in Britain could be at risk if Britain fails to get the terms it demands seems little short of suicidal, as the current falling value of sterling indicates. May\u2019s only recourse if her terms for a continuing relationship with the EU are rejected, would be a closer relationship with either China or the US, clearly risky options as well as being mutually exclusive.</p> <p>This is clearly a case where the longer-term national interest must take priority over individual or party interest, but where are the champions of this interest? In the unlikely event of the legal challenge to the validity of the Brexit vote succeeding, we might see a consensus of parliamentarians whose vision is broader than that of the current leadership, but without such an outcome, the future looks bleak.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Car travel is far too cheap</strong><br></h2> <p>George Monbiot is, of course, right to point out how we have become addicted to cars, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath about this changing anytime soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/roads-car-use-health-driving\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a>. Far from \u201csitting fuming in a toxic cloud\u201d, most car journeys are actually quite convenient and cheap. And this where the problems start.</p> <p>The marginal cost of running a car is so low that if you own a car you would be mad (or really dedicated) to consider paying at least twice this to use an infrequent bus or train or even walk. We have friends who think nothing of driving a few hundred metres to visit us.</p> <p>Perhaps modern smart-card technology will eventually allow drivers to pay the full cost of their own car as they use it. In our village we have a community car club where cars can be hired by the hour at a fully inclusive rate, but it is still difficult to wean people off their own car. If the fuel duty were increased significantly this would help, but what government would have the courage to do this?</p> <p>Our behaviours that cause climate change are so embedded and habitual, and climate change is seen as so distant, that change will be difficult. If we are serious about tackling climate change we need a combination of the imaginative solutions George Monbiot describes and some real sticks (such as fuel duty increases) to fund these.<br><strong>Martin Mansell</strong><br>Lochwinnoch, UK</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is correct that if a transportation system were designed today with the objective of moving people efficiently, it would not focus on the private automobile. However, at least in North America, our transportation systems were not designed for efficient movement, but rather for auto industry profit.</p> <p>The car companies bought up the streetcar systems of almost every major North American city \u2013 Toronto and San Francisco alone successfully resisted \u2013 in order to tear up the rails and create a market for their product. This eventually resulted in an antitrust conviction \u2013 and a fine of one single dollar.<br><strong>Greg DePaco</strong><br>New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada</p> <h2><strong>A love letter to the Weekly</strong><br></h2> <p>Sitting at the Oslo Central rail station with my coffee and the Guardian Weekly for 7 October, I am reminded again why I love this paper.

  "<p>You might say that Colin Stanbridge is in the confidence business. As <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=3979\">chief executive</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=3922\">London Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> (LCCI) since 2002, he has worked for the interests of thousands of companies in the capital, most of them small and medium enterprises, over a period when even <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Financial-Crisis-of-2008-The-1484264\">global financial crisis</a> and domestic austerity failed to derail the nation\u2019s principal economic locomotive. Now comes the turbulence of Brexit. Stanbridge remains upbeat. </p> <p>\u201cBusinesses, especially the smaller ones, are very pragmatic,\u201d he says. It is the very first thing he says when asked about the impact of the Leave vote, sitting in his office in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Street,_London\">Queen Street</a> in the Square Mile. \u201cThey may well have been shocked, as many people were, that the vote across the country went the way it did, but I have absolutely no doubt that they will find a way through and that London will find a way through.\u201d</p> <p>The optimistic note is struck against a pessimistic backdrop. The <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=6185\">most recent of the LCCCI\u2019s regular Capital 500 surveys</a>, conducted by ComRes during August, unearthed continuing deteriorating expectations that had begun in the run-up to the EU referendum and are now projected into the future. The survey found that during the third quarter of this year, both domestic and export demand for goods and services fell, as did employment levels. It concluded that \u201con balance, 9% of London businesses expected their overall company prospects to decline, moving into negative territory for the first time\u201d.</p> <p>Stanbridge has called for \u201csolid reassurance\u201d from the government and warned against complacency: \u201cAs we said in our <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/14720.pdf\">Brexit response</a>, no one is panicking. However, there are serious issues the government needs to recognise.\u201d For him, the opportunity side of the Brexit balance sheet is largely about concentrating minds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/15/theresa-may-brexit-strategy-could-depend-on-giving-london-more-autonomy\">London\u2019s strengths</a> as a business environment and the value of making them stronger. </p> <p>As employers weigh the pros and cons of re-locating, Stanbridge asks out loud if they really want to ship out to Stuttgart. Or even Paris: \u201cWe have a huge number of advantages in terms of the language, the legal system and, actually, very importantly, as a place to live.\u201d The Chamber is urging support for exporters and has renewed long-standing calls for decisive further investment in transport capacity and for <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/colin-stanbridge-forget-scotland-london-needs-more-power-9276670.html\">greater devolution</a> of powers to London government. </p> <p>The cry is to press boldly ahead with Crossrail 2 <em>and</em> a <a href=\"http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/wra/news/index.cfm/transport-chiefs-look-ahead-to-crossrail-3\">Crossrail 3</a>; <em>and</em> with new river crossings in the east; <em>and</em> with airport expansion - not just one more runway, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/colin-stanbridge-if-we-mean-business-we-must-expand-both-gatwick-and-heathrow-10017904.html\">but two</a>!: \u201cWe need these things. We need them more than ever.\u201d Stanbridge says he wrote to Sadiq Khan and had a meeting with him, urging him to revisit and enlarge on the work of the London Finance Commission (LFC) set up by Boris Johnson, which argued for giving the mayor and the boroughs direct control over the use to which all property taxes raised in the capital were put. Khan, already a convert, did just that. An <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_finance_commission_interim_report_october_2016_v1.0.pdf\">interim report</a> by LFC2 concludes that there is also \u201cscope to devolve an assigned share of one or more major national taxes,\u201d as a way of facilitating growth, making a better job of tackling deprivation and taking \u201csteps towards a better-run country.\u201d </p> <p>And then there\u2019s the the question of labour. \u201cIn our round table discussions with members, the message about talent and migrant workers and the necessity of having those workers in London is huge. We have to find some way to keep them or London will be severely damaged,\u201d Stanbridge says. An advocate of introducing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jul/11/the-case-for-a-more-independent-post-brexit-london-is-gaining-strength\">London-specific work permit or visa</a>, he accepts that the case for foreign migration can be difficult to make. Politicians will speak up for wooing the highly-skilled and qualified but not \u201cthe people who keep the hospitals clean and make the Underground run. They may not be, in those terms, highly-skilled workers, but they are vital.\u201d </p> <p>Anticipating objections that London business favours a liberal line on overseas labour because they provide a source of cheap labour, he speaks of his own ancestry: Polish, three generations back, settling in Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s about the city I want to live in. Some people get angry that they come off the Tubes and buses and don\u2019t hear an English accent in the shops, but I think that\u2019s great. As a citizen of London, I want it to be a city that says, \u2018You know what? You come here, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you are law-abiding, then you are a Londoner.\u2019 If we lose that, it\u2019s bad for the city.\u201d</p> <p>Stanbridge dismisses the idea that the Brexit negotiations should be approached as \u201csome kind of poker game\u201d in which the UK\u2019s hand must remain fully concealed. For him, the broad outline of the best possible deal is already perfectly clear, and London should be at the heart of striking it: if you can\u2019t have full access to the single market and the free movement of people at the same time, then you bargain for the nearest to both you can get. It\u2019s about pragmatism. It\u2019s about confidence. It\u2019s about doing business. </p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">rise in the annual inflation rate</a> to 1% last month is just the start. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/sept2016\">cost of living in Britain</a> is certain to increase noticeably over the next 12 months and likely to peak at about 3%, perhaps even a bit higher.</p> <p>A bit of perspective is needed. By Britain\u2019s recent standards, inflation is still low. Harold Wilson could only dream of 1% inflation when prices were shooting up at an annual rate of almost 26% in 1975. Despite her best efforts, Margaret Thatcher never managed to drive inflation down to its current level.</p> <p>This is a different age. Globalisation, de-unionisation and weak growth have led to the death of inflation. For the past two or three years, the big fear for central banks has been deflation rather than inflation.</p> <p>Britain no longer has that problem. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the referendum on 23 June has banished any fear of deflation for several years to come, because anything that is imported \u2013 from French wine to Apple iPhones \u2013 costs more.<br></p> <p>The upward movement in September from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/uk-inflation-remains-unchanged-at-06\">0.6% in the year to August</a> did not have much to do with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/16/let-the-pound-fall-and-the-economy-rise\">slide in the pound\u2019s value</a>, but make no mistake, the fall in sterling will eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/marmite-bananas-sterling-swings-prices-consumers-shopping\">feed through into higher prices</a> in the shops and at petrol stations.</p> <p>Two factors explain the inflation increase. The first is that some prices are going up. Clothing was dearer, motorists noticed that petrol and diesel were a bit more expensive. Hotel bills were also higher, which is mainly explained by the above inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means\">increase in the minimum wage</a> in April. The higher salary costs that resulted from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-national-living-wage-not-the-end-but-the-beginning\">introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d</a> are being passed on to customers.</p> <p>The second reason for the upward movement is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/uk-inflations-dips-below-zero\">prices were falling in September 2015</a>, due to tumbling global energy costs. That has since ceased to flatter the annual inflation rate.</p> <p>There were further sharp falls in energy prices during the final quarter of last year, so had sterling remained unchanged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade\">on the foreign exchanges</a> in recent weeks, there would still have been a pickup in the annual inflation rate.</p> <p>The fall in the pound to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">lowest level against the dollar</a> since the mid-1980s will accelerate this process. While inflation is still comfortably below the government\u2019s 2% target, it won\u2019t be for long. Expect the annual cost of living increase to reach 2% by early 2017 and 3% by next summer.</p> <p>Competition in the high street could spare consumers from some of the effects of the weak pound. But if businesses find they are operating with lower profit margins, they will seek to save money by tightly controlling wages. One way or another, living standards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/rising-inflation-expected-to-hit-consumers-pockets-pound-sterling-dollar-brexit\">are going to be squeezed</a>.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, government welfare changes mean those on the lowest incomes will be especially hard hit, because George Osborne\u2019s July 2015 budget froze non-pensioner benefits in cash terms for the duration of the current parliament. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8699\">The Institute for Fiscal Studies </a>estimates that 11.5 million benefit claimants would have been \u00a3260 a year worse off by 2019-20 before sterling\u2019s slide. Higher inflation has pushed that figure to \u00a3360.</p> <p>Will higher inflation lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/28/uk-bank-of-england-monetary-stimulus-brexit-vote-effects-minouche-shafik\">Bank of England raising interest rates</a>? Almost certainly not. Threadneedle Street has already said it is prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/prices-to-continue-rising-warns-bank-of-england-governor\">accept a temporary overshoot</a> of the 2% inflation target, rather than risk damaging the economy\u2019s growth prospects. Only if higher inflation looks to be becoming embedded will the Bank move. For the moment, that does not appear to be much of a risk.<br></p>",

  "<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\">Modern Slavery Act</a> consolidated and improved our modern laws on trafficking and slavery, it didn\u2019t create any jurisdiction for the crimes of slavery or forced labour that are committed by UK nationals or companies overseas.<br></p> <p>If a British person or company holds a person in slavery or forced labour abroad \u2013 such as on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/un-gives-qatar-year-end-forced-labour-migrant-workers\">construction sites</a> in the Gulf states or in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">fishing industry</a> \u2013 they can do so with impunity, unless their behaviour is criminalised in that state. </p> <p>Yet any profits obtained from the slavery and extreme exploitation of workers can filter home to the UK company, crime-free.<br></p> <h2>Making slavery a crime everywhere</h2> <p>Having worked and advised extensively at a high level on the legal issues of modern-day slavery for well over a decade, I believe new legislation is required to criminalise slavery and forced labour committed overseas and impose harsh criminal penalties in the UK.<br></p> <p>At present the only requirement on companies under the act is to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transparency-in-supply-chains-a-practical-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">write a statement</a> showing their efforts to eradicate slavery in their supply chain and publish it on their websites. </p> <p>I can imagine that business will say that is sufficient. But as consumers we need a stronger incentive for companies to confront and prevent slavery in the supply chains they receive goods and services from. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/03/modern-day-slavery-explainer\">Modern-day slavery: an explainer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extending our criminal law to cover cases where UK-based or UK-linked businesses intentionally or recklessly engage in slavery or forced labour in their supply chains overseas would plug the gap. </p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that it is often in countries where there is a weak rule of law or an absence of fair worker rights that slavery, forced labour and trafficking thrive. </p> <p>The law currently says if we commit a slavery crime, we will be punished. Why not then the UK companies and individuals who are engaged in supply-chain slavery overseas and profit from the labour of the enslaved?</p> <h2>Abolishing the slave trade</h2> <p>The fact that we need to change a law that only recently came into force is not unusual or unprecedented. If we look back in history we see that all of our slavery-related legislation has had an incremental approach. There were dozens of pieces of English legislation that finally enabled the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in all of its form 200 years ago. </p> <p>It is only through seeing the law in action that we recognise where the gaps lie. The UK criminal offence of holding a person in slavery or requiring a person to perform forced labour was only passed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/71\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 2009</a>, when the legislation gap was exposed by one of my cases, and it soon became the most successful modern criminal legislation geared towards prosecuting and convicting those who enslave. </p> <p>We already have extra-territorial jurisdiction for some very serious crimes. If we think about child sexual exploitation cases involving British people, such as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/dec/19/simon-harris-british-citizens-child-abuse\">Kenya</a>, these people can be prosecuted in the UK. The crime of torture can be prosecuted here too, wherever it took place. Corporate acts of slavery and forced labour abroad need to be treated with the same seriousness.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>We also have the resources ready to investigate companies. Police forces in the UK, admittedly some better than others, have expertise in trafficking and cross-border investigations. They would be able to investigate the slavery complaints of overseas victims and track slavery and forced labour in the overseas supply chains of UK companies, if the legislation could be extended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/07/cheap-seafood-fish-slavery-solutions-thailand-human-rights-abuse\">Our love of cheap seafood is tainted by slavery: how can it be fixed?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Letting victims seek compensation</h2> <p>As well as holding UK companies operating overseas accountable, we also need to extend our domestic slavery law to allow victims of slavery and trafficking in the UK to properly sue their enslavers and traffickers for civil compensation.<br></p> <p>Victims can currently seek compensation in the UK via existing laws. But these traditional compensation laws don\u2019t cover the full spectrum of harm done by traffickers and enslavers, including their use of subtle yet terrifying means of control, psychological abuse and damage, deception, coercion, the destruction of one\u2019s identity, taking a child into slavery, or debt-bondage.</p> <p>If victims had a clear right to civil compensation under British law for slavery, trafficking or forced labour they could bring a claim for damages against those responsible and it would also have a very serious impact on making businesses more accountable for slavery in their supply chains, as well as those individuals who enslave and traffic. The vast majority of trafficking and slavery cases don\u2019t end up in the criminal courts after all.<br></p> <p>In the US there is already a direct civil remedy for trafficking and forced labour in law, introduced <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/tip/laws/61130.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 2003</a>. It was designed to give compensation to victims but also act as a deterrent. In my experience, the best compensation laws for trafficking take this two-pronged approach.</p> <p>Recently, a US company Signal International was found liable and <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/signal-international-lawsuits-re-trafficking-of-indian-workers-in-usa\" rel=\"nofollow\">forced to pay compensation</a> to trafficked workers it deceived, indebted and abused on its construction sites after Hurricane Katrina. After losing a court case under the trafficking compensation laws the company later filed for bankruptcy. It was a chilling warning to companies across the US that they are liable for all the trafficking-related harm done to their victims.<br></p> <p>Civil compensation laws in the UK should be similarly clear: if you traffic or enslave people you will pay your victims for the harm you have done. We now need to modernise our Modern Slavery Act to do just that.</p>",
  "<p>On a rare patch of open grass amid the vertiginous slopes of the river Mach\u00e1ngara gorge in Quito, Ricardo Buitr\u00f3n is outlining his dreams for the future of cities.</p> <p>\u201cWe have always been proposing a new kind of city \u2013 a city for the people; a city whose residents can all have a voice in its planning and organisation.\u201d</p> <p>Buitr\u00f3n\u2019s ambitions are strikingly similar to what\u2019s being said elsewhere in Ecuador\u2019s high-altitude capital this week, even if the settings could not be more different. Across the city, on the other side of the hills, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/08/what-is-habitat-3-united-nations-quito-summit/497624/\">the Olympics of urbanisation</a>\u201d, Habitat III \u2013 a once-every-20-years United Nations conference to discuss the future of the planet\u2019s cities \u2013 has landed with a bureaucratic bang on the pristine, cut-grass lawns of central Quito\u2019s El Arbolito park.</p> <p>As many as 45,000 delegates \u2013 including at least 200 city mayors, 140 national delegations, plus many of the world\u2019s leading academics, architects and urbanist thinkers \u2013 are gathered here to discuss how to make cities more \u201csustainable, inclusive and resilient\u201d, to quote three of the conference\u2019s favourite buzzwords.</p> <p>But Buitr\u00f3n is not among them. He is, in fact, an activist and coordinator for <a href=\"https://resistenciapopularhabitat3.org/2016/06/14/resistencia-habitat-3-sera-el-espacio-de-las-organizaciones-sociales-en-quito/\">Resistencia H\u00e1bitat III</a>, an \u201copposition\u201d of more than 40 community groups from Quito and around Ecuador \u2013 an eclectic mix of indigenous and <em>barrio</em> (neighbourhood) groups, women\u2019s organisations, cycling and climate-change activists \u2013 come together to highlight the local issues they say are being ignored by the global convention on their doorstep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3effffe68f5553b13e06eb3e56042836ea8abc94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3effffe68f5553b13e06eb3e56042836ea8abc94/0_115_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for the resistance group\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for the resistance group</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis event is good because it gives us a pretext to gather together, to make proposals for our cities, and to question the models being used in Habitat III,\u201d Buitr\u00f3n says. \u201cMany of the topics being discussed there are important \u2013 but the voices of local people are not being heard.\u201d</p> <p>Quito is \u201creaching a point of no return,\u201d Buitr\u00f3n explains with urgency. \u201cThe city is becoming unliveable because cars are so dominant. The municipality invests a lot of money in projects, but there is no integrated plan to make things work for the majority of people here.\u201d</p> <h2>Barriers to inclusivity</h2> <p>Like a giant Post-it note to attendees of the conference, one of the Habitat III billboards around the site\u2019s perimeter states, \u201cINCLUSIVE CITIES\u201d. The impact of this sign is, however, lessened by the fact it is attached to a wire security fence which rings Habitat III\u2019s park campus.</p> <p>For the duration of the conference, inside the fence is officially United Nations territory, with UN laws superseding those of the host country outside. The feeling of separation is exacerbated by the many road closures and heavy police presence in the surrounding blocks.</p> <p>Appropriately for a conference on urbanisation, this is a high-density event, with thousands of delegates crowding into the section of park around the stylish, circular Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana building. But as a result, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_ireland_/status/788080181869211648\">the morning queues</a> for airport-style security checks have been hellish, with lines of attendees snaking back through the rest of the park as they wait for hours in the equatorial sun to get on site.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06127f04125e6b01107db83e01afa2ee5f0d2b13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06127f04125e6b01107db83e01afa2ee5f0d2b13/0_169_3145_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fences protect the main Habitat 3 site, while attendees queue into the distance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fences protect the main Habitat 3 site, while attendees queue into the distance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With so many dignitaries assembled, security was always going to be a huge headache. But according to Jaime Izurieta, a Quito-based architect and urbanist, \u201cThe perimeter fence feels symbolic of the fact the global cities movement is failing in its ambition to be inclusive.\u201d</p> <p>In Ecuador\u2019s capital, Izurieta says, much time and money has been invested in the conservation of historic buildings such as the <a href=\"http://www.teatrosucre.com/escenario/teatro-nacional-sucre\">Teatro Sucre</a> in the historic centre. (In 1978, Quito was one of the first two cities to be declared <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/2\">Unesco world cultural heritage sites</a>.)</p> <p>\u201cBut then they put up fences when an opera is performed there, to avoid those attending having to mix with the rest of the city\u2019s population. We have failed to integrate the majority of people here \u2013 and the city\u2019s interventions, such as building restoration and road building, do not help everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Habitat III\u2019s headline achievement is the New Urban Agenda; in the UN\u2019s words, \u201can action-oriented document which will set global standards of achievement in sustainable urban development\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">UN\u2019s 2015 Paris climate change agreement</a> \u2013 which created a legally binding commitment to restrict member states\u2019 carbon emissions \u2013 there is nothing strictly enforceable in the New Urban Agenda. Instead it is a 23-page theoretical (some have said \u201cutopian\u201d) wishlist of what makes for better cities, based on the research and inputs of a global collection of academics and other urban experts \u2013 which were then haggled over until the final draft was agreed in New York on 10 September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62be6861b76f934d119787c46969aa9e0076a21e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62be6861b76f934d119787c46969aa9e0076a21e/0_0_4096_2609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and the mayor of Quito listen to a debate at Habitat III.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and the mayor of Quito at Habitat III.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Jacome/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest tensions in this process came over the question of inclusivity. Despite a push from Canada for the inclusion of a statement about rights for LGBTQ citizens, other countries, including Iran and Russia, would not countenance such language in the final agenda \u2013 leading to a forceful response from Julian Castro, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development\">United States secretary of housing and urban development</a>, who said the US was \u201cdisappointed, frankly, that some delegates would have derailed the negotiations entirely, rather than include LGBT protections\u201d.</p> <p>Another bone of contention concerned the \u201cright to the city\u201d \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/19/right-city-social-movement-transforming-urban-space\">growing political movement</a> that seeks to enshrine the equal rights of all citizens at the heart of a city\u2019s governance. Ecuador, indeed, was a pioneer in incorporating this idea into its constitution, but other UN member states, including the US, were unhappy with anything more than a passing reference. </p> <p>Despite these differences, the word \u201cinclusive\u201d appears in the final New Urban Agenda document no fewer than 36 times. </p> <h2>\u2018City of protest\u2019</h2> <p>One of the key groups in the Resistencia H\u00e1bitat III movement is the committee of residents living in Bola\u00f1os, the precarious neighbourhood on the steep hillsides of the Mach\u00e1ngara gorge. As it stands, a proposed major road infrastructure project from the municipality threatens to displace them from their homes, and they are fighting for their right to stay.</p> <p>Bola\u00f1os is made up of a smattering of family homes among forest, thick vegetation and patches of productive land to help feed the community. Crowning the neighbourhood is the busy Interoce\u00e1nica highway, leading to the Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn tunnel nearby which connects to the centre of the city. The tunnel is notoriously gridlocked: cars queue for hours, with passengers unable to open their windows because of the fumes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dcb445b8abe3af3b3229975e9230d9e53a20e732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcb445b8abe3af3b3229975e9230d9e53a20e732/0_72_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bola\u00f1os\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bola\u00f1os residents live on the steep slopes of the river Mach\u00e1ngara gorge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Car drivers in the city are exasperated \u2013 and the mayor\u2019s solution (named <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQfp3J-Ig5o\">Soluci\u00f3n Vial Guayasam\u00edn</a>) is to build two new road bridges and add more lanes to busy highways like Interoce\u00e1nica to increase capacity for Quito\u2019s cars. For a city apparently so keen on sustainability, the project looks surprisingly like a 1960s car-led approach to urbanism.</p> <p>With the new infrastructure, it has been deemed too risky for the residents of Bola\u00f1os to stay (the bridges will pass over the neighbourhood). The local government are consequently encouraging them to leave \u2013 and if they don\u2019t comply then forced evictions may well take place. </p> <p>\u201cThe neighbourhood is not for sale. If they want us to move they will need to wait until we are dead,\u201d declares local resident Mar\u00eda Luisa Achig, perched on an outcrop overlooking the valley, a hat protecting her from the sun\u2019s intense rays. \u201cThis neighbourhood was established by our ancestors. We built our houses with our own hands. We cannot lose the land.\u201d</p> <p>Every Thursday, a group of residents from Bola\u00f1os stage a protest in Plaza Argentina in central Quito in an attempt to stop the project. Demonstrations like this are quite normal: locals call Quito \u201ca city of protest\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e58f65afd15ed75abd372ab14cdecf4daa35557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e58f65afd15ed75abd372ab14cdecf4daa35557/0_229_1123_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mar\u00eda Luisa Achig\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mar\u00eda Luisa Achig</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nataly Pinto Alvaro, who runs <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Inspira-RED-1626504157562856/\">a social enterprise consultancy</a> focusing on local economic development, sustainability and human rights, has worked alongside other professionals to support the Bola\u00f1os residents by offering legal and administrative assistance. \u201cWe help them protest to make sure they are not alone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about them. Displacement, community and rights to housing are issues that affect us all in Quito. We have to make a stand together.\u201d</p> <p>On a Saturday in mid-October, the Bola\u00f1os residents are working together to carefully uncover what they believe to be an ancient road on the hillside next to their community. Nearby, they explain, were two Incan fortresses \u2013 and they are convinced the stones they have found beneath the soil and vegetation are part of an ancient road connecting the two sites. \u201cThis used to be the entrance to Quito from the Amazon,\u201d one resident explains. </p> <p>The road is particularly symbolic for the residents, as the routes which once connected them to neighbouring communities were destroyed with the construction in the 1970s of Avenida Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, one of the main highways that leads into the centre of the city. Now, they feel, another infrastructure project is threatening their neighbourhood.</p> <p>Of course, if the residents can prove they are sitting on an ancient Incan route, it would provide a strong argument to stop the bridge project from going ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will find ancient remains,\u201d suggests Izurieta, who believes the project is unnecessary and will only worsen congestion, \u201cbut if they do, it will change everything.\u201d</p> <p>The collective clearing of this supposedly ancient route is an example of a <em>minga</em>, a particularly Andean tradition whereby the community comes together on regular days to make improvements to their neighbourhood \u2013 everything from cleaning up and planting flowers to building new infrastructure. \u201cI call it native Ecuadorean placemaking,\u201d says Izurieta, who is bringing the idea to a more central neighbourhood in the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c65b9636e9b253d1b540eb1ee35b3082e4d74df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c65b9636e9b253d1b540eb1ee35b3082e4d74df/0_230_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bola\u00f1os residents clear vegetation as part of the \u2018minga\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bola\u00f1os residents clear vegetation as part of the \u2018minga\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although mingas traditionally happen in the poorer neighbourhoods of cities, Izurieta believes it is a model that could be transformative in communities across Quito and cities further afield. He is currently involved in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/opuslamariscal/\">Opus La Mariscal</a> project, in one of the central neighbourhoods in Quito, full of bars, restaurants and nightlife. The area was once thought of as dangerous, but now is Quito\u2019s \u201cparty zone\u201d. As a result, not many people live there. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to make La Mariscal into a residential district again,\u201d he explains. The project involves working with the local businesses and some residents to improve the public realm, fix pavements, plant trees, restore houses and even create urban farms. \u201cEverything is done through the minga process,\u201d says Izurieta. \u201cEveryone is a volunteer and loves being involved. But the municipality doesn\u2019t like it \u2013 they see it as competition.\u201d</p> <p>To feel threatened by the minga feels illogical when grassroots neighbourhood improvements have the potential to take the pressure off financially stretched city authorities. Izurieta believes the idea of the minga is a positive urban model that Quito should be sharing with the world at Habitat III.</p> <p>\u201cIt could help cities everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt strengthens community relations and brings positive transformation to neighbourhoods. It means people are more involved with their city.\u201d</p> <h2>Common vision for cities?</h2> <p>Habitat III is the global swansong of Ban Ki-moon, whose 10-year reign as UN secretary-general ends on the last day of 2016. And in Quito he \u2013 just like Ricardo Buitr\u00f3n of Resistencia H\u00e1bitat III \u2013 has been quick to demand a more inclusive approach to the governance of cities.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55313#.WATuNxMrKjQ\">gathering of mayors</a>, dubbed a new \u201c<a href=\"http://citiscope.org/habitatIII/commentary/2016/09/global-parliament-mayors-can-lead-devolution-revolution\">global parliament</a>\u201d, Ban highlighted goal 11 of the New Urban Agenda, which \u201cpledges to make human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\u201d. He urged the 400-odd mayors and regional officials present to \u201ctake strong ownership of this vital agenda. Stand up for the people you represent.\u201d</p> <p>So could Habitat III prove the \u201cbeginning of a common vision for cities\u201d \u2013 or is it more likely a load of ineffectual \u201curban wash\u201d, however well intended? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2c638ff2b29195460fd61283d3ffaedd5b6559a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2c638ff2b29195460fd61283d3ffaedd5b6559a/0_33_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ban Ki-moon urged mayors to \u2018stand up for the people you represent\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ban Ki-moon urged mayors to \u2018stand up for the people you represent\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Cevallos/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://habitat3.org/quito-implementation-plan\">Quito Implementation Plan</a> is the summit\u2019s attempt at holding member states and cities to firm, long-term commitments, be it relating to climate change (the world\u2019s cities are responsible for at least <a href=\"http://unhabitat.org/books/cities-and-climate-change-global-report-on-human-settlements-2011/\">70% of the planet\u2019s carbon emissions</a>) or provision of public space.

The trend for devolution of power away from national governments towards city mayors in particular is key to progress, M\u00fcller says, adding: \u201cThe New Urban Agenda only has a chance of succeeding if cities are allowed to be involved in its implementation.\u201d </p> <p>But what about the residents of Quito? What will happen to their city once this great urban juggernaut has rumbled away again at the end of this week? Will anything have changed for the better?</p> <p>Daniel, a cafe owner and neighbourhood leader in La Mariscal, who is starting his own coffee-roasting business, ponders these questions as he spreads out the beans on a net to dry. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Habitat III will be good or bad for the city, though I hope it will have positive impacts.

  "<p>Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s coach, Roger Schmidt, made a trip to London to watch Tuesday\u2019s Champions League opponents, Tottenham Hotspur, take on Manchester City at White Hart Lane this month. He scouts all of his opponents but he was particularly looking forward to this one as he would see a coach very similar to himself, Mauricio Pochettino, take on someone whom he had faced many times \u2013 and for whom he made life very difficult \u2013 in the Bundesliga, Pep Guardiola.</p> <p>Over the course of seven matches, Schmidt\u2019s side took points off Bayern on four occasions. In a league that appreciates any team that makes life difficult for Bayern Munich, Schmidt was quickly heralded as an exceptional coach and it was even suggested that he may be the long-term successor to Guardiola at the Allianz Arena.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/tottenham-son-heung-min-global-brand-bayer-leverkusen-champions-league\">Son Heung-min became a global brand at Leverkusen but still faces difficult return | David Hytner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet on a cold, Sunday afternoon in north London he witnessed Spurs not only take points off Guardiola, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">out-press them in a 2-0 victory</a>. \u201cI know Pep Guardiola\u2019s football from his three years in Germany very well and how he likes to play,\u201d Schmidt tells the Guardian. \u201cBut Tottenham made sure the game was played their way \u2013 it was a super game.\u201d</p> <p>It is no surprise that Schmidt took delight in watching Pochettino\u2019s side play. Attacking, aggressive football with a high defensive line and a clear desire for a quick transition from defence to attack sums up both Spurs and Leverkusen under their current coaches. Two teams, two coaches but an almost identical way of playing.</p> <p>Since taking over from the coaching duo Sami Hyypia and Sascha Lewandowski in the summer of 2014, Schmidt has turned Bayer from a functional team of traditional, physical players into something that best resembles a mix of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Borussia Dortmund<em> </em>side of the not\u2011too\u2011distant past and what Guardiola implemented at Bayern.</p> <p>Rather than give a flashy name to his style of play, Schmidt laughs and simply suggests that his side are at their best when the other team are uncomfortable. Rather than tweak his tactics for each match, he believes his team should play in a way that demands their opponents play Leverkusen\u2019s kind of football. Not the other way round.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy when the game is intense,\u201d Schmidt says with a confident smile. \u201cEven against teams that are supposedly better than us, like Bayern Munich <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/09/bayer-leverkusen-barcelona-champions-league-match-report\">or Barcelona last season</a> in the Champions League, we try and make them play our football \u2013 that\u2019s what we demand of our opponents, and if it works we normally win the game.</p> <p>\u201cI look at teams and I know what the manager is like and what kind of football they like to play. I\u2019m excited about the comparison and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how we handle the situation. These two games against Tottenham will be a huge challenge for us.\u201d</p> <p>Schmidt \u2013 unlike Pochettino \u2013 did not have a very successful playing career. He was an attacking midfielder who spent a large chunk of his days in the regional semi-professional leagues of Germany\u2019s north Rhine-Westphalia while also working as an engineer. \u201cI never wanted to be a football manager,\u201d he says when asked to recount the early days of his career. \u201cIt was a hobby to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>Yet while that hobby may have began as a coach at the age of 37 at Delbr\u00fccker SC, it quickly developed into a full coaching role at Preussen M\u00fcnster, Paderborn and then Red Bull Salzburg. Within eight years Schmidt went from part-time player-coach to full-time leader of a side expected to win the Austrian Bundesliga.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc824bf63b91d73c99fcfdd7b46dfb4f8cdca45a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc824bf63b91d73c99fcfdd7b46dfb4f8cdca45a/0_0_5484_3605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Schmidt talks to his squad during training on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Schmidt talks to his squad during training on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Salzburg he met the sporting director Ralf Rangnick, who shared Schmidt\u2019s love for attacking football. \u201cWe exchanged a lot of ideas and worked well together for two years,\u201d Schmidt says as he looks back on the league title the side won only one year after his arrival. \u201cAt the end of it, a football that was even more extreme than what Ralf knew from Hoffenheim was born.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/tottenham-manager-confident-toby-alderweirelds-injury-not-a-big-issue\">Mauricio Pochettino confident Toby Alderweireld injury \u2018not a big issue\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His impressive work in Austria did not go unnoticed and after only two seasons Schmidt was packing his bags for Leverkusen. There he finished fourth in this first season, third in his second and is widely expected to challenge Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Borussia Dortmund for second place this time. Bayer have had an uneven start to the season and are currently 10th in the Bundesliga but they did beat Dortmund 2-0 at the start of October. \u201cThe way we\u2019ve played has been a huge boost to our confidence,\u201d Schmidt says when asked about the consequences of the results. \u201cVery important, not just that we won but how we won. I think it was a deserved win against a very strong team and we played like people know Leverkusen can play.\u201d</p> <p>It is this insistence on the way his team play almost irrespective of the result that makes Schmidt stand out. Rather than become a product of their league, Leverkusen are playing the 49-year-old\u2019s style of football in every game and competition. This is something Schmidt also sees in Tottenham. \u201cEvery country has its own culture, but all teams have become a bit more international recently,\u201d the German coach suggests. \u201cMany of Tottenham\u2019s players are international, so is their manager. I think it\u2019s more fluid. I don\u2019t think you can say this is English football, this is Italian football. Instead this is Tottenham football.\u201d</p> <p>It will be a fascinating clash of philosophies at the BayArena on Tuesday. Both sides are desperate for a win with only a point separating them in second and third place of Group E and both will be confident of winning. Only one thing is guaranteed: it will be frenetic.</p>",
  "<p>There is one certainty as we survey our future: Britain must go through a highly complex and unprecedented procedure to detach itself from Brussels after more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/a-timeline-of-britains-eu-membership-in-guardian-reporting\" title=\"\">four decades of European Union membership</a>. The nation may have voted to leave, but there are many possible ways forward. So there must be torturous talks over several years with 27 states all seeking to protect their own interests, and the outcome felt in homes and firms across the country.</p> <p>The negotiation results will shape our nation for decades. They could lead to the break-up of the union, disrupt sectors of the economy and alter Britain\u2019s standing in the world. It is little surprise there are strong feelings on both sides of this debate over the best way forward given the hopes and fears. Yet suddenly there seems to be a sense of panic among those that pushed for this break as they close down discussion over the seismic consequences of the electorate\u2019s decision.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Brexit camp fought under the banner of democracy and sovereignty.

Clearly, divisions fuelled by the referendum are worsening, inflaming reluctance among leavers to accept challenge to their one-eyed view of the world after a shock victory. I saw this at the Tory party conference, where as someone opposing the idea of our nation turning inwards, I was constantly accused of being a sore loser. Typical was one leading leave voice who threatened to stop following me on social media since I refused to share his optimism.</p> <p>Now Stewart Jackson, parliamentary private secretary to key Brexit minister David Davis, suggests \u201cpatriots\u201d should stop buying The Economist due to its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stewart4Pboro/status/787425569982050306\" title=\"\">\u201cRemoaner whining\u201d</a>.

The government has taken a number of steps and made policies to try to address the problem. But <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/Towards_an_arsenic_safe_environ_summary(english)_22Mar2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">despite a country-wide campaign and social mobilisation activities by the government and NGOs</a> (pdf), knowledge and awareness levels among communities remain far below expectations.</p> <p>We know that there are cheap and potentially life-saving solutions to this problem. What we need to do now is promote these solutions, and increase access to them.</p> <h2>An invisible problem </h2> <p>Arsenic doesn\u2019t change the taste or colour of water so the first problem we encounter is making people understand that it is present in their community.</p> <p>From skin lesions, stomach cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting blood, to cancers of the bladder, lungs, skin and kidneys, the symptoms and effects of arsenic poisoning are debilitating and palpable. But without a proper diagnosis, often people do not know whether they are suffering from typical diseases or ones caused by long-term exposure to arsenic. </p> <p>It is even more difficult, therefore, to make people realise that prolonged contact with arsenic-contaminated water may cause illness or even death. Liza Akhter, a 21-year-old girl in Bagerhat District, south-west Bangladesh, said to one of my colleagues: \u201cThe thing about arsenic is you get poisoned slowly, so you don\u2019t know who has been affected around you already. Arsenic kills you every day, slowly.\u201d</p> <p>It is the poorest who face the biggest problems and those suffering from the symptoms of arsenic poisoning often find themselves in a vicious circle. Even though they may be suffering from multiple debilitating diseases, they often cannot afford to get treated.<strong> </strong>Many do not have enough land to install a water point so they are reliant on community points or the traditional untreated shallow tube wells. Often the roof of their home is not strong enough to support a rainwater harvesting system.</p> <p>Those who are better off are more involved in the decision-making process and therefore have more control over where water is distributed. Very often, they can afford to install deep tube wells on their own land and access safe sources of water below the contamination levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2015/nov/13/polluting-the-worlds-water-in-pictures\">Polluting the world's water \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>So what can be done?</h2> <p>In affected areas Practical Action has been working to educate people about the symptoms of arsenic poisoning. We have provided testing kits so that people can check if their water supply is contaminated and, if need be, install arsenic-removal systems or look into alternative safe water supplies.</p> <p>Arsenic removal systems, where contaminated water if filtered through four chambers, are one available option. Due to a lack of testing systems, however, households don\u2019t often know whether the removal system is working properly. We also find that the distribution of these filters is usually done in an ad hoc manner through government projects or by NGOs. </p> <p>The distribution of arsenic removal systems should be linked with suppliers to ensure post-installation services for repairing, replacing and changing the filter for long-term sustainability. Proper pricing plans are also essential for running a community-managed water point sustainably, and ensuring they are not abandoned due to financial problems. </p> <p>Rainwater harvesting does offer an alternative, but a lack of rain and the deterioration of water quality and taste during the dry season make it less popular. Usually, the equipment is not cleaned properly before the monsoon season which means that the water can become contaminated, causing sickness and diarrhoea. Other alternative sources of water could be found through \u201cconjunctive use\u201d, where surface water is stored in a groundwater basin in wet years, and withdrawn in dry years.</p> <p>Facilities to test water quality are also needed at home along with a national testing mechanism; science clubs in schools or laboratory facilities in colleges could even be explored for establishing such facilities. Most importantly, an integrated approach between the health and water sectors is needed for working with the communities in arsenic affected areas. We would also like to see government mapping of awareness levels among communities, as this is something we just do not know presently. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/29/the-indian-village-fighting-fluoride-poisoning-with-vitamins-and-clean-water\">The Indian village fighting fluoride poisoning with vitamins and clean water</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All patients suffering from arsenic poisoning \u2013 <em>arsenicosis</em> \u2013 have less capacity to work, their income reduces, and their households are gradually marginalised.

Which is true.<br></li> <li>If the government had not welched on the deal, the Adler would have come into the country with the <strong>lowest possible rating</strong>. </li> <li>Leyonhjelm still wants the ban lifted. He believes the Adler should be in the lowest category \u2013 which would make it most accessible.</li> <li>Labor thinks the ban should stay in place but have not committed so far to whether it should be let in by state and feds. </li> <li>I am seeking an answer from the government on which category the Adler should be in. </li> </ul> <p>So there are two issues:</p> <ol> <li>Should the Adler be allowed in at all?</li> <li>If so, what category should it be in?</li> </ol> <p>This has allowed many straw men to flourish.</p> <p>The National Firearms Agreement \u2013 or the Howard gun laws \u2013 will still be in place, no matter what the outcome for the Adler. <strong>Because this is the framework for the gun laws.</strong></p> <p>This means that the government can say rightly they are still committed to the Howard gun laws.</p> <p>But if the Adler is allowed in on the lowest category \u2013 as Leyonhjelm wants \u2013 there will be a more lethal weapon available to ordinary shooters.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T05:47:41.842Z\">at 6.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5805a37de4b0cd26ff71e324\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T04:23:51.656Z\">5.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AHRC president <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong> is being asked about <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18c.html\">complaints made under s18C of the Racial Discrimination Act</a> in Senate estimates.<br></p> <p>Triggs notes that <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html\">s18D provides an exemptions</a> for works that are done reasonably and in good faith.

What that meant was that, in the views of many law enforcement officials,<strong> the 1996 National Firearms Agreement</strong>, <strong>John Howard\u2019s</strong> gun laws if you like, had not kept up with technology. </p> <p>There was a need for the Council of Australian Police Ministers, justice ministers, the law, crime and community safety council to consider this matter and the commonwealth has sought for them to reach consensus and reclassify these lever-action guns. </p> <p>Because there had been a failure to reach that consensus, the government imposed a ban on importing lever-action shotguns of more than five rounds. So that was not designed to weaken or vary John Howard\u2019s gun laws. </p> <p>It was to hold the ring and prevent the lever-action guns of that capacity to be imported at all. That ban had a 12-month duration. When it came up for expiry, it was renewed. The minister is working hard to ensure his counterparts in the states agree on a reclassification of these guns.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T03:48:06.529Z\">at 4.48am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58059301e4b005f21833a845\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T03:15:08.745Z\">4.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turnbull rules out watering down Howard gun laws</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Shorten to Turnbull</strong>: This morning the prime minister was asked what should be the easiest question a Liberal or Labor prime minister is ever expected to answer.

It seemed like a good idea at the time but, after the election, the government benches were whittled back to a one seat majority. </p> <p>The two bills would establish a Australian Building Construction Commission and regulate registered organisations, ie unions. Today the first bill returns to the house, in a neat two-step following <strong>Bill Shorten\u2019s</strong> endorsement of former Health Services Union official <strong>Kimberley Kitching </strong>and an outbreak of factional farnarkling. </p> <p>In an interview with <strong>Fran Kelly</strong>, Turnbull has, on the one hand, attacked union thuggery in the CFMEU and, on the other, endorsed the bills as a great thing for the health of unions. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not anti-union. This is not union busting. If the Labor party were to support this legislation, they would build public confidence in the unions, because the unions would be run in accordance with the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly asks, why not get the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to regulate unions as they do the banks? Why bust unions and not banks? Turnbull says the government is doing lots on the bank front and now they are doing lots on the union front. He is an equal opportunity regulator.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Right across the board, what we\u2019re doing is addressing the issues that have been raised and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the industrial relations field too.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Overnight, you might have seen <strong>David Leyonhjelm</strong> has raised the prospect of horse trading over the ABCC bill. He wants a ban lifted on the importation of the Adler shotgun. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The regulation of firearms is dealt with by Coag in effect, by states and territories and the commonwealth working together and so the importation <strong>ban on the lever-action Adler shotgun, over more than five rounds,</strong> was introduced and has been maintained because of a failure to date of that state and territory group to reach a resolution on it. </p> <p>So it is a collaborative effort. But I want to stress to you ... we have among the most, if not the most rigorous laws on the regulation of firearms in the world. It\u2019s one of the great achievements of <strong>John Howard</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fran: The world\u2019s leading human rights body is accusing your government, our government, of torture. You need to respond to that, don\u2019t you?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I reject that claim totally, it is absolutely false ... And I just note that the minister, Mr Dutton, offered to go onto to the Four Corners program and be interviewed live to deal with those allegations and that offer was rejected.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fran played some audio of one of the articulate children on the program last night.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve heard from this young lady and it is, it is a ... It is a very sad story that she tells. But, you know, there are 1,200 people, many of them young women too, no doubt, from whom we can never hear, because they drowned at sea under the Labor party\u2019s reckless failure to keep our borders safe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turnbull says the government is negotiating with other countries but he accuses \u201cmany people in Australia\u201d of telling refugees to hold out in the hope of coming to Australia. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that\u2019s a tough policy. I know that is hard. But the alternative is what we had under Labor \u2013 50,000 unauthorised arrivals and 1,200 voices that were silenced, that cannot go on Four Corners, that cannot talk on Radio National because they drowned at sea.</p> </blockquote> <p>On same-sex marriage, Turnbull says there was a still a chance the Senate could pass the bill, in spite of what \u201cyour fellow distinguished journalist, <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>, from the Guardian said at a press conference.</p> <p>Q: You think there\u2019s still a chance it will pass?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course. Of course ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Arguments ensue on the merits of the plebiscite ...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>It is a perfectly reasonable argument to say this is not consistent with our parliamentary tradition.</strong> But the fact is it is perfectly democratic.

Do we want to continue to ignore the severe problems so many of us face or do we work together to build the decent, fair society we can have?</p> <p>The Conservative party says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\">migrants are the problem</a>. And Labour, so entangled in its own internal struggles, has had difficulty finding any voice as opposition \u2013 let alone a strong one. It has no coherent position on free movement, while the Green party has been the voice standing up for migrants. I am fighting for Cameron\u2019s seat in Witney because I know we can do so much better.</p> <p>I have lived in Oxfordshire since 1969. During many years as a local councillor and campaigner I have seen large numbers of people, who need our mutual support, driven to the wall. Over the last few years Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour county councillors in Oxfordshire have voted for devastating cuts to care for the elderly and disabled, children\u2019s centres, libraries, homeless people, dangerously damaged roads and pavements and lifeline rural bus services. Only the Green councillors voted against them. The cowardice of the other parties in Oxfordshire is visible in doorways as homeless people bed down for another cold night.</p> <p>Of course, such choices are not only being made in Oxfordshire. As health spokesman for the Green party I stood beside doctors as they tried to stop the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tearing apart the delicate structure they had created to do their best with inadequate resources. Theresa May\u2019s government is continuing the process of the largest cut in funding in the history of the NHS. The <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/14714446.Health_leaders_in_Oxfordshire_approve_millions_of_pounds_of_cuts/\">Oxfordshire clinical commissioning group </a>has just announced that it has to strip out 20% of its spending over the next four years. It has opened discussion on <a href=\"http://www.greenoxfordshire.com/all_oxfordshire_community_hospitals_to_go\">closing all nine of the county\u2019s community hospitals</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-36898639\">first GP practice closures</a> have been announced. These cuts cannot be achieved without unnecessary death and suffering. The structures for privatisation created by Labour, the coalition and Conservative governments costs the NHS over <a href=\"http://nhap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WEB-VERSION-NHS-Privatisation-past-present-and-future-Without-Notes.pdf\">\u00a35bn a year</a>.

They need a \u00a310-an-hour minimum wage.</p> <p>Catastrophic climate change is speeding up around the globe.

  "<p>Margaret Thatcher has narrowly beaten David Cameron to be named the worst prime minister of the past 100 years by historical writers.</p> <p>The Historical Writers\u2019 Association surveyed its membership on their views of the 19 prime ministers who have led the UK since 1916, in advance both of this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.harrogateinternationalfestivals.com\">Harrogate History festival</a> later this week, and Theresa May\u2019s 100th day in office on 22 October. Thatcher, who died in 2013, came in first with 24% of the vote, followed by Cameron (22%) and Neville Chamberlain (17%).</p> <p>Authors singled out Thatcher\u2019s attitude to society as a chief problem with her premiership. \u201cShe destroyed too many good things in society, and created too many bad ones, then left a social and moral vacuum in which the selfishly rich and unimaginatively fortunate could too easily destroy still more of what they don\u2019t need and can\u2019t see that everyone else does need,\u201d said the writer Emma Darwin.</p> <p>\u201cThatcher made the idea of society, in the sense of a community that cares for all its members and accepts the premise that people need support and should not be stigmatised for it, an anathema,\u201d wrote historical novelist Catherine Hokin in her response. \u201cIt is easy to demonise politicians and resort to ad hominem rather than policy attacks, but Thatcher encouraged the worst behaviour across all aspects of society and we are still reaping her poisoned harvest.\u201d</p> <p>But Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, begged to differ: \u201cI disagreed with Mrs Thatcher, I fought her all the way. But I thought she was a great and necessary destroyer. Some of those old structures she pulled down had to be pulled down, but what she wasn\u2019t was a builder. </p> <p>\u201cOddly enough, this will offend some, I put her down as one of the most successful PMs of all time, not because I agreed with her, but because she laid out her stall and she achieved it, and Britain in many ways was stronger afterwards \u2013 although in many ways it was also weaker, particularly our sense of communities,\u201d said Ashdown, who will speak at the festival later this week about his latest book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/paddy-ashdown-i-turned-to-my-wife-and-said-its-not-our-country-any-more\">Game of Spies.</a></p> <p>Former HWA chair Manda Scott said she voted for Thatcher for reasons of \u201cneoliberalism, de-industrialisation, free-market ideology, Scottish poll tax, selling council houses and failing to act on early stages of global warming\u201d, while the historical crime writer DE Meredith said that Thatcher \u201cspawned a terrible lack of compassion at the heart of British politics, which we still live with today\u201d, pointing in particular to her quote: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as society.\u201d<br></p> <p>Tony Blair was in fourth place, with 11% of the vote, followed by Gordon Brown and Edward Heath with 8% each. Anthony Eden, Herbert Henry Asquith and Andrew Bonar Law were all tied, with 2% of the vote. The remaining 10 PMs were not nominated by any of the 45 writers who responded to the survey.</p> <p>According to Ashdown, the second-placed Cameron was \u201cone of the most dangerous prime ministers we\u2019ve had, not because he\u2019s not a decent man, he\u2019s a very decent man, but because he just didn\u2019t think, in his casual Eton-bred insouciance, about taking this huge and vitally important decision for Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Others agreed with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/paddy-ashdown-i-turned-to-my-wife-and-said-its-not-our-country-any-more\">politician turned writer\u2019s</a> assessment of the former PM. \u201cDavid Cameron is a mediocrity who\u2019s single-handedly brought on the UK\u2019s biggest crisis in 75 years,\u201d said the author Tom Harper, programming chair of the Harrogate History festival, which will take place from 20-23 October. \u201cNeville Chamberlain had to contend with Hitler, Eden with Nasser: Cameron couldn\u2019t see off Nigel Farage.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe gambled with the country\u2019s future prosperity and lost,\u201d added novelist Angus Donald. \u201cThen ran from the battlefield leaving the rest of us to pick up the pieces.\u201d</p> <p> But the third-placed Chamberlain was Ashdown\u2019s personal choice for the \u201cworst prime minister\u201d label. \u201cI think Chamberlain could have personally prevented the second world war,\u201d said Ashdown. \u201cHe was certainly warned by the German opposition what Hitler was and he chose to ignore it, and the consequence was eight million people dead. I don\u2019t blame him for those deaths but I remain of the view that if he\u2019d taken the right decision, as he was encouraged to when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, the second world war would not have happened.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In July President Barack Obama addressed the national convention of the Democratic Party and ended perhaps the last great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/emotional-obama-democratic-convention-speech\">speech of his tenure </a>by returning to the theme of \u201cthe audacity of hope\u201d. </p> <p>Stark dividing lines have been drawn in the US election contest between hope and fear, between a yearning for simpler times and a belief that the best is yet to come. It is not hard to draw a parallel with some of Britain\u2019s own political challenges; the tension between those excited by a more global and connected future and those who fear being left behind in this brave new world. </p> <p>Much has been written about how to make globalisation work for all, and a solution remains elusive. A challenge we can meaningfully wrestle with as an industry is how we make an increasingly connected society work for the many, making technology a source of hope, not a source of anxiety and exclusion. </p> <p>The internet has arguably been one of the most powerful forces for democratisation the world has ever known, giving a voice and opening a market to many who were previously disenfranchised. Platforms from <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/campaigns/smart-communications-txtbks.html\">TXTBKS</a>, which provides old sim cards into condensed text books for underprivileged schoolchildren to crisis-mapping software <a href=\"https://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> show the potential of the simplest technologies to make major differences. Yet within our own society we have been slow to make innovation relevant and accessible to those most apprehensive about or underserved by new technologies, to tackle real, everyday problems such as access to credit, access to a GP within an overloaded NHS, or access to meaningful roles within a fast-changing labour market.</p> <p>The fintech industry for example can often seem preoccupied with wooing millennials with slick data visualisations and effortless mobile transactions. Yet <a href=\"http://www.financialinclusioncommission.org.uk/facts\">1.5 million adults in the UK do not have access to a bank account</a> \u2013 while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/feb/24/payday-lending-will-shrink-but-only-a-complete-ban-will-do\">1.8 million a year</a> access payday loans in the absence of more affordable credit. With high street branches closing at ever faster rates, the digital banking revolution can exclude those most in need of assistance.<br></p> <p>Yet the technology exists to make access to banking services and credit possible without access to a traditional bank account. Services such as Kenya\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/what/m-pesa.html\">MPesa</a> enable any user with access to a mobile phone to deposit and transfer funds, no bank account required. Meanwhile almost half of finance executives surveyed believe blockchain technology will mean <a href=\"http://which-50.com/nearly-half-finance-execs-say-blockchain-herald-end-banking-know-study/\">\u201cthe end of banking as we know it\u201d,</a> creating entirely new models for the transfer of funds. </p> <p>How then can we apply these technologies to providing accessible and affordable credit to those in immediate need, or to ensuring urgent benefit payments are as swiftly available as possible? </p> <p>In the realm of healthcare, private enterprises in the US are applying the Uber model to medicine via apps such as<a href=\"https://getheal.com/\"> Heal</a> and <a href=\"https://pager.com/\">Pager</a> which identify the nearest doctor, their ratings and reputation and their price for a real-time consultation. Could we apply the same principle to clusters of local surgeries within the NHS, enabling patients to identify the nearest available appointment to them, dynamically updated to take account of changes and cancellations? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-gig-economy-time-to-get-serious-about-casual-work\">The Guardian view on the gig economy: time to get serious about casual work | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once hailed as an empowering force for change, the gig economy has come under fire in recent months over working conditions and the status of workers. Perhaps a more equitable and interesting approach is to ask how traditional infrastructure and traditional roles can be re-purposed \u2013 meeting the needs of the on-demand economy in a different way. <a href=\"https://www.passmyparcel.com/\">Pass my Parcel</a>, a venture from distribution firm Smiths News, works with independent local stores to facilitate same day delivery on behalf of Amazon. Retailers receive a small fee for each parcel collected, and increased footfall in store while Amazon receive an increased footprint for same-day delivery services. New technology leveraging traditional infrastructure. </p> <p>In a similar vein, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/02/sugata-mitra-school-in-the-cloud\">The School in the Cloud</a> takes advantage of dormant skills in retirees to facilitate remote learning among some of the world\u2019s most underprivileged children, tapping into a resource that might otherwise be unused and undervalued. Yet there is no reason a similar principle cannot be applied more broadly. Imagine the impact on an over-burdened education system of thousands of retired teachers, craftspeople, scientists or writers signing up to provide even an hour or two of virtual tuition a week. </p> <p>In a nutshell, imagine a world where we stop designing products and services with young, urban and affluent populations at the forefront of our minds. They won\u2019t mind \u2013 they\u2019ve got Pokemon to catch. The opportunity is to design services that are simple, scalable and solve real problems; so how do we make it a reality? </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/09/the-vision-for-gov-uk-is-to-make-government-work-for-users/\">team behind Gov.uk</a> have done an extraordinary job in making it simpler to access government information and services. Is the next phase of that journey to move beyond making existing services accessible and towards developing new service propositions? Or can the private sector lead the way, re-engineering the on-demand economy to be not just egalitarian but genuinely fair for both workers and consumers?</p> <p>Either way, there is a genuine opportunity for the tech community to prove that it is not a \u201cliberal elite\u201d designing for fellow liberal elites but a community committed to making technology a force for hope, not just a force for change.

One is Geoff, who has been in out and of prison in the past and responded to being \u201cthe shortest, poshest kid\u201d inside by expanding horizontally.

A combi tool is dropped and the group is forced to waddle in the mud as punishment. It\u2019s horribly entertaining in the voyeuristic tradition of extreme survival shows. The deeper question of why \u201croguish, misfit-ish\u201d men might seek brutality and extreme discipline over softness and a hot meal remains unanswered, as&#xa0;usual.

For now, it remains an unreconstructed, ultra-macho environment, and it\u2019s hard to see, without the culture changing wholesale, how women might carve a space in it. It\u2019s a brutal and mirthless environment where men are ordered to stop whining when they hurt themselves. Where they do not speak&#xa0;about their emotional lives. Where they just fall apart and leave.</p> <p>The rules of detective fiction, according to Andrew Marr\u2019s lighthearted trawl through the genre, <strong>Sleuths, Spies and Sorcerers: Andrew Marr\u2019s</strong> <strong>Paperback Heroes</strong> (BBC4, 9pm), are hardly less stringent. In the first of a three-part series, Marr sets out to dissect the perfect crime novel, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/agathachristie\" title=\"\">Agatha Christie</a> to Scandi-noir. His rules are as conventional as the genre. Such as number four: the detective is the original superhero.

  "<p>I have just returned from Kenya\u2019s North Eastern Province where one night, camped out in a dry riverbed with just a mosquito net for cover, a herd of elephants emerged out of the dark \u2013 a great and almost silent mass of shapes. </p> <p>They passed through our makeshift camp, looming over us, their tusks white against the night. I was close enough to hear them breathe, to hear the sound of their feet in the sand. Another minute and they were gone, leaving me awestruck, in the truest sense of the word. </p> <p>There is little to compare to encountering elephants, many of them bulls, up close. To do so at night, in the community-owned conservancies of <a href=\"http://www.nrt-kenya.org/sera/\">Sera</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nrt-kenya.org/melako/\">Melako</a>, was both a dream come true and a vindication of the mixed land-use, community-based conservation strategies that, I believe, are the answer to many of the problems facing the wild African elephant today. <br></p> <p>From the late 1970s, elephant conservation strategy took two interrelated forms: fortress conservation, and more open, mixed land-use models. The first of these, by which we mean variously protected areas designed to either exclude or severely limit human activity, are the blunt, necessary and temporarily effective means by which we save the severely endangered. It limits movement and protects genetic stock intensively growing numbers, while we await the estimated five to 10 years it will take to effect a sea change in attitudes, and begin to reduce ivory demand in Asia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/01/frontline-bloody-battle-save-africa-elephants\">Saving Africa's elephants: 'Can you imagine them no longer existing?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I say blunt and temporary, I don\u2019t mean to downplay the significance of Africa\u2019s national parks and reserves in any way. On the contrary; I\u2019ve lived and worked in protected areas home to some of the finest populations of elephant. Take Botswana\u2019s Chobe national park as an example. If you\u2019ve been, and have spent time observing at close quarters a family of elephants drinking water by Chobe river, then you\u2019ll know what I mean. </p> <p>The term \u201clife-changing\u201d is something of a hackneyed phrase in this age of travel, but it describes perfectly the moment you chance upon elephants in the wild \u2013 be that in a park such as Chobe, or on a dry riverbed in the North Eastern Province. It\u2019s akin to finding religion, and Chobe is one of the best places in Africa to do so. </p> <p>Unfortunately, even the best examples of fortress conservation become victims of their own success eventually \u2013 particularly in terms of elephants whose populations and range-potential soon outgrow their protected areas. Hemmed in by fences or human habitation and unable to travel, elephant herds can severely denude the environment, stripping and destroying trees. They will try to enter surrounding farmlands, exacerbating tensions between humans and elephants. In short, the natural by-product of a growing and boxed-in population is an ecosystem unable to properly sustain its elephants. </p> <p>Fortress conservation strategies are, by definition, exclusive. Whatever the employment and rent opportunities offered by parks and reserves, surrounding local communities are not always the chief beneficiaries of these models. When key stakeholders are denied the substantial economic rewards of tourism, communities have little sympathy for elephant populations. Elephants become less one of the world\u2019s natural wonders, and more of a giant and dangerous pest \u2013 at least from the point of view of possibly non-compensated, impoverished local communities. It\u2019s easy to see how difficult it is to persuade the very people, in whose hands it\u2019s future lies, that the African wild elephant matters. </p> <p>All this when there\u2019s been a <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/25/new-elephant-estimate-documents-major-decline/\">continent-wide decline of more than 110,000 elephants since 2006</a> \u2013 largely due to the astronomical rise in poaching. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/7-billion-people-how-protect-wildlife-endangered-species\">In a world of 7 billion people how can we protect wildlife?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a growing need for a more long-term approach to elephant conservation, one which establishes buffer and cross-border zones, links up protected and already established areas, involves and supports key stakeholders, and leads to the creation of a network of corridors and destinations large enough to support resident and migratory populations. </p> <p>Initiatives are gathering pace throughout wild Africa. One excellent example is the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJzvKcxeHPAhVCOhQKHStECwAQFggfMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrt-kenya.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdYiC9A6UPPNPlSJhIYTTAHFYMDw&amp;sig2=VEsSobTO953Ek0lbCKbpjw&amp;bvm=bv.135974163,d.bGs\">Northern Rangelands Trust</a> (NRT) in the North Eastern Province, where a switched-on NGO is empowering local communities, linking conservancies and recreating a wonderful north Kenyan wilderness. An equally fine example is <a href=\"http://www.kavangozambezi.org/\">Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area</a> (Kaza) which, with the help of the <a href=\"http://www.peaceparks.org/\">Peace Parks Foundation</a>, has negotiated a free-to-range mandate for wildlife from five southern African countries, covering 520,000 square kilometres and linking 36 protected areas.</p> <p>Both NRT and Kaza are subtle, nuanced and highly complex arrangements between multiple and, sometimes, competing stakeholders. The task of protecting wild African elephants is not simply seen as a moral obligation but as a significant wealth generator \u2013 something which is key to the strategy. </p> <p>A dead adult elephant is worth around $21,000 (\u00a317,000) in ivory sales. A live one is worth <a href=\"http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Dead-or-Alive-Final-LR.pdf.\">$1.6m</a> (\u00a31.3m) in tourist income. Proposing that the 11-year moratorium on ivory sales be lifted and the proceeds from confiscated stock sales be reinvested in local communities \u2013 as Namibia and Zimbabwe did at Cites (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) this year \u2013 therefore makes little sense. The return on ivory sales pales in comparison to the financial rewards generated by mixed land-use conservation strategies. The eco-tourist industry, which is driven and grown by elephants, is more than capable of compensating for land lost to migratory corridors.</p> <p>What\u2019s good for the elephant is good for the ecosystem as a whole, which is why countries like Zimbabwe and Namibia \u2013 both, incidentally, key players in the Kaza initiative \u2013 must be persuaded of the folly of ivory stock sales. It would send the wrong message to the world and, as previous one-off sales have shown, result in a rise in killings by poaching. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/debate-can-legal-ivory-trade-save-elephants\">Debate: Would a legal ivory trade save elephants or speed up the massacre?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All countries should destroy current stocks publicly and make it illegal to stockpile. They should develop new community-based and mixed land-use strategies and send the message that ivory is worth nothing. It works, as my trip to Kenya\u2019s North Eastern Province shows. Elephant killings are down by 52% and the community is thriving. Managed well, elephants more than pay their way.</p> <p>If we carry on as we are, the only elephants we\u2019ll see in 50 years times are those in highly-protected, fortress-type conservation areas. Changing direction, however, unites the lands necessary for healthy and ecosystem-friendly populations of elephant, and involves the people that these open and mixed land-use strategies rely on. All the evidence points to a much brighter future: lost wildernesses reclaimed with the wild African elephant flourishing. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s worth it. The future of Africa\u2019s elephants depends on us getting it right \u2013 and quickly.</p> <p><em>Will Jones is a fellow of the National Geographic Society and founder of <a href=\"http://www.journeysbydesign.com/wild-philanthropy\">Wild Philanthropy</a>, a charity designed to support at-risk ecosystems and communities in Africa.</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Last October, video game developer Playground Games sent six staff members from its studio in Leamington Spa to a tiny town 120 miles south-west of Sydney called Braidwood, New South Wales. Armed with a custom built 12K-resolution camera worth tens of thousands of pounds, they weren\u2019t there to capture the scenery or film movie sequences with a cast of actors. They were there to record the sky.</p> <p>Released in September, Forza Horizon 3 is widely credited as one of the most visually impressive console games ever made. A driving simulation based in and around a fictitious car festival, the game gives players hundreds of miles of accurately modelled Australian scenery to explore, from dense rain forests to sun-bleached outback wastelands.</p> <p>There are races to enter, challenges to attempt and hundreds of new vehicles to unlock, but it\u2019s the developer\u2019s obsession with detail that has really stood out. The game provides a neat indication of where real-world simulation is heading in this ever-more graphically ambitious industry. And it all starts with those skies.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve played Forza Horizon 3, you will have noticed them: dramatic, ever-changing panoramas of cloud, punctured by light rays and accompanied by evolving weather patterns.</p> <p>For the previous game in the series, Playground did what most studios do: they created a bunch of cloud models, then lit and rotated in them in various ways to suggest a seemingly changeable skyscape. For the third title though, the art team had a new idea: what about taking a high resolution camera, pointing it at the sky and capturing the whole expanse over many hours, as a detailed time-lapse sequence. </p> <p>For a while, it was just that \u2013 a crazy idea. Until they tried it.</p> <p>\u201cWe shot a pre-production test here in Leamington Spa, just sitting in a field,\u201d explains the lead lighting artist, Jamie Wood. \u201cAnd what we got from it, frame by frame \u2026 there was so much more nuance to the lighting changes. In just an hour, we had more variety than the whole of the system we used last time.\u201d</p> <p>So the plan was hatched to send a team out to Australia to capture the country\u2019s very specific lighting, weather and cloud formation patterns. It wasn\u2019t just about replicating pretty cloud shapes: in the Forza series, as well as a lot of modern video games, the game\u2019s lighting effects are physics-based.</p> <p>In other words, the game simulates a realistic sun. All the variations in light and shadow that the player sees in the world are calculated in real-time, based on how light is dispersed and how it is occluded by objects between the source and the surface; whether that\u2019s a rain cloud blocking the light, or buildings casting shadows across the road. And the direction and length of those shadows is calculated based on the real-world light direction. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afda736955642cdd22ef80c5c91dbf673ea61cc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afda736955642cdd22ef80c5c91dbf673ea61cc2/0_275_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playground Games shot the Australian sky through the summer, in total recording 30 24-hour periods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playground Games shot the Australian sky through the summer, in total recording 30 24-hour periods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Murray/www.seanmurray.com.au</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was quite a romantic idea,\u201d says Wood. \u201cTo take the research footage of the light out there and bring that into the studio and project it into the game; to give players the experience of those cloud scapes and how that lights the world. But it was a very risky concept, with a lot of sensible push-back internally, we were thinking: should we really do this?\u201d</p> <p>For a start, the creative director, Ralph Fulton, had to weigh up the practicalities of sending experienced staff into the Australian bush for several weeks of expensive development time. </p> <p>\u201cI mean, how do you insure them for something like that?\u201d Fulton said. </p> <p>And then there were the logistics and uncertainties of a reasonably unprecedented shoot. Wood said: \u201cDuring our two year development period we only had one window to capture an Australian summer. We had to plan so much in ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, three teams of two carried out the shooting process, beginning in October 2015, and running throughout the Australian summer. Each team headed out into the countryside near Braidwood, set up a camp, pointed the camera at the sky and waited as it took thousands of high-resolution images over 24-hour periods. </p> <p>\u201cThe skies are captures as an interpolated series of frames, like a movie but with shorter increments,\u201d says Wood. \u201cPer frame, we derive an image-based specular cue for reflections and also a diffuse light source. So whatever the sky\u2019s doing, whether it\u2019s got really sharp shadows or its very hazy, it will be picked up frame by frame.\u201d</p> <p>But travel to the other side of the world? Why not use the Leamington test footage? \u201cThe heat in Australia generates a lot of different clouds that we don\u2019t tend to see here,\u201d says Wood. \u201cYou have a lot of big cumulonimbus and amble clouds. But it\u2019s more to do with the arc of the Sun, the timings of sunsets and how dark it gets at night. </p> <p>\u201cBecause the sun actually drops much lower below the horizon in Australia in summer than it does here, you get these pitch black nights and very quick dramatic sunsets \u2013 and the sun will be much higher in the sky during the day. We took light probes and captured all that data - we didn\u2019t have to guess what the light would be like.\u201d</p> <p>All of this is visible in the game. Whizzing along the cliffs beside Byron Bay at sunset, the sky quickly drops from broad daylight to almost hallucinogenic orange, the strong midday sun above Surfer\u2019s Paradise, cutting great sharp shadows into the road \u2013 it all adds to the visual grandeur. </p> <p>But in this era of HDR visuals, where subtle gradients of light are detectable, some of the most impressive effects in modern games will come from how light is treated when it hits and reflects off objects. \u201cForza Horizon 3 uses a voxel-based global illumination system to calculate light bounces in real-time,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cThis system uses the HDR sky, other light sources and offline-generated occlusion data to work out which surfaces the light bounces onto. </p> <p>\u201cFor an easy way to see the impact that bounced light has on a scene, look at locations with complex shadows like the entrance to a cave or crevices in a rock formation \u2013 in Forza Horizon 2, those shadows would have had a single colour value which meant the shadow would be uniform everywhere there was no direct light. In Forza Horizon 3, we calculate how light \u2013 and hence colour \u2013 bounces into partially occluded areas so shadows have a much higher variation in darkness and colour. The depths of a tunnel, with no direct and minimal indirect light, will be almost black; whereas the edges of shadow will bleed naturally from dark to light based on indirect bounced light.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the team caught 30-days worth of 24-hour sky shoots, which are used to create the game\u2019s naturalistically evolving skyscape. In free roam mode, the game will effectively \u201cplay\u201d a full day\u2019s footage across the game sky, the data streamed in, on the fly, from the hard-drive. \u201cIf you sit in the same place, you\u2019ll see the sky elapse as it did in real life,\u201d says Fulton. The only difference is, in the game, the footage is sped up so that a Horizon day doesn\u2019t last 24-hours. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the knock on effects of this system was that it made our days much longer than in Forza Horizon 2\u201d says Fulton. \u201cSpeeding up time beyond a certain point makes the cloud movement look ludicrous. I think that benefits the game \u2013 sunsets are longer, sunrises are longer, but we mitigate the slower passage of time by using in-game events \u2013 a cutscene, the start of a race etc \u2013 to jump around a bit and prevent monotony.\u201d</p> <p>The weather system is connected too, so when dark clouds roll in, the rain starts on cue, altering the surface feel. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18728c59969652c417bf27f028384c329251a19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18728c59969652c417bf27f028384c329251a19f/34_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"forza horizon 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lightning makes all the difference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople have asked us, why are you so obsessed with the sky?\u201d says Fulton. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a massive part of our frame. In a driving game you have sky, car, terrain, road. But it\u2019s more than that: the sky is the lightsource, so everything in the world benefits from a realistic system.</p> <p>\u201cThrough the detail of the light and the reflections, the cars, the leaves on the trees, the tarmac, all of them benefit from the much higher detail lighting data that\u2019s coming from the sky. So the whole scene looks better - not just the blue bit at the top.\u201d</p> <p>The teams shot for three weeks, a physically demanding task that required camping out with the cameras, which would get clogged with dust and grit. </p> <p>\u201cWe needed to clean the lenses every half an hour, and the light sensors after every shoot,\u201d says Wood. \u201cWe also needed to change the lenses every sun rise and sunset. Because we were capturing the whole dynamic range of the Sun, once it dropped away, we\u2019d need a more sensitive camera set-up for night.\u201d </p> <p>There was also the local wildlife to contend with, including unidentifiable but scary-looking spiders climbing into the camera cases, and other terrifying fauna. </p> <p>Wood said: \u201cSomething kept landing on my arm during one shoot, it was a fly the size of a mouse. One of the locals saw it on me and said, \u2018whoa, that thing is not your friend, you need to get that off right now\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The vagaries of the weather also added to the challenge. \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of what the sky is doing that given day,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cThere was a lot of amateur meteorology going on, trying to predict the periods we should be out in the field.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a list of all the skies we needed for the game, but it was down to luck if we\u2019d manage it. Sometimes we\u2019d get a whole week of identical clear days. It was the most expensive blue sky we\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p> <h2>The car\u2019s the star</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f682c03be295c5687668d0a1931f645d42f63a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f682c03be295c5687668d0a1931f645d42f63a/0_742_4191_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lamborghini Centenario\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Lamborghini Centenario on show at the Geneva International Motor Show on 1 March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similarly obsessive level of detail went into the car models. When the deal was struck to include the new Lamborghini Centenario in the game, it still hadn\u2019t been announced, so Playground had to send a staff member over to Italy to photograph the one production model available. He took thousands of images and measurements, but once again, there was significant time pressure.</p> <p>\u201cThey were still building this car as we were building our model,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cThey announced it at Geneva in April and we were building it to show at E3 in June \u2013 but it takes six months to build a car for Forza. That shoot was the last day that the car was actually complete - the next day Lamborghini tore it apart to make the moulds for the production parts.\u201d</p> <p>From there, it\u2019s a process of modelling a mesh of the car in the art package 3D Studio Max, turning all those images and measurements into a highly accurate representation. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to identify where different materials need to be placed in the car,\u201d says the principle vehicle artist, Simon Gibson. \u201cWe also have to construct models that will allow the doors to open. We used to try to match cinematic levels of detail. We\u2019re beyond that now.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, the process of creating a 3D model of a car for a game is now almost as intensive as producing the actual model for production. The real Centenario production car uses more than 620 different types of materials, including carbon fibre, various alloy metal types, and plastic and composite materials on the exterior, as well as leather in the interiors and heat shield materials in the engine.</p> <p>Playground has sought to simulate all of these \u2013 \u201cto the sub-pixel level\u201d, insists Fulton. Most manufacturers will supply their blueprints and CAD data to development studios working on licensed racing games, so that their cars are as authentically reproduced as possible.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a convergence now between how cars are designed and how we make game models,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cWe actually borrow each other\u2019s software. But some cars don\u2019t have CAD information, so you have to use your skill as an artist to reproduce them.</p> <p>\u201cWith older cars especially, the panels were hand-beaten together so even if you make an accurate representation, that\u2019s only accurate to one car. You have to think about how each car was produced in reality in order to recreate it.\u201d</p> <p>Another challenge was tracking down some of the more specialist vehicles to garner modelling details from them. When the designers thought it would be fun to include a Reliant Regal in the line up, it took weeks to track one down. They eventually found a collector who\u2019d converted one into a tribute to the famous Only Fools and Horses van. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bee7a48be29abb23abcf5137919165480e62e40a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bee7a48be29abb23abcf5137919165480e62e40a/590_293_3101_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A beautifully lit coastal scene in Forza Horizon 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A beautifully lit coastal scene in Forza Horizon 3.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Playground Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s fascinating about the video game production process is how these extravagant techniques are combined with ingenious short cuts and workarounds. The sea is an expensive element to include in a game, with wave simulation requiring a lot of complex physics. But then Playground discovered that another nearby Microsoft studio was working on similar technology. </p> <p>\u201cThe sea in Forza Horizon 3 is also the sea in Sea of Thieves,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cDoing proper sea tech is incredibly complex. We knew the guys up the road at Rare were working on the same problem. They\u2019re doing more deepsea stuff, but we got in touch with them, shared a bit of code, and we optimised it back and forth, so we\u2019ve both benefited.</p> <p>\u201cOur challenge was making the sea interact with the beach, so lapping waves, foam, wetting and drying the sand correctly \u2013 that was a whole other area of work. The 12 Apostles area is a sort of hero image for us, and we wanted the car to be down there racing. If you\u2019re going to be on a beach, the sea has to look good. That work paid off because driving the cars into the sea looks awesome.\u201d</p> <p>Some interesting workarounds were also employed in the sound design. When the audio team decided to move on from the collision samples they\u2019d sourced for Forza Horizon 2, they went to a scrapyard and recorded themselves smashing the hell out of an old Ford Ka with sledgehammers.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our team had a car he was going to scrap, so we said, wait a minute, we need this,\u201d says the audio designer Fraser Strachan. \u201cWe ended up spending a day throwing stones at it, to simulate the sound of gritty road surfaces. It didn\u2019t look good at the end.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, when they wanted to get the isolated sound of tyres on a beach, they took a bunch of microphones up to St Andrews and recorded kite buggies. A more modest field trip than Australia, but still a symbol of the growing importance of accurate source materials in the age of photorealism.</p> <p>So does Playground think that the sky system in Horizon 3 will instigate a new era of month-long location shoots throughout the games industry? Wood doesn\u2019t think so.</p> <p>\u201cThe practicalities of it were crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably lead the field on this going forward because the thought of copying it ... you\u2019d be mad to try. I could tell you all our secrets, but you still wouldn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p>",

As well as collecting information on the prevalence of forced labour and organ trafficking, the surveys also asked about marriage, and forced marriage, while in transit. Fewer than 1.5% of respondents said they had received an offer of marriage in exchange for money along the route. <br></p> <p>On the eastern Mediterranean route \u2013 where migrants travel overland via Turkey and Greece \u2013 14% of migrants reported signs of human trafficking and exploitation. About 6% reported being held against their will, 7% said they worked without pay. As many as 4% said they were forced into work against their will, most of these instances occurring in Turkey. Incidents of organ and blood trafficking were reported in Turkey, Greece, Albania, Macedonia and Serbia. </p> <p>The IOM said its surveys are the first attempt to quantify the prevalence, scale and frequency of labour and other forms of human trafficking on the major migrant routes. </p> <p>\u201cWhat these surveys show is that human trafficking networks are becoming brutal and efficient at exploiting and making profit from the vulnerability of migrants,\u201d says Simona Moscarelli, anti-trafficking expert at the IOM. </p> <p> \u201cThere is still very little real recognition of the scale of this business or just how much money is being made from the misery and labour of people fleeing war or poverty.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Hyland, the UK\u2019s independent anti-slavery commissioner, said that the surveys provide further evidence that the migration crisis is being used by human trafficking networks to target and exploit the most vulnerable. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a need for urgent action to protect these people,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that a key focus for the UK and other governments must include collaborating with partners to prioritise safeguarding against the risks of modern slavery as part of the response to the migration and refugee crisis.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Household energy bills in four years\u2019 time will be \u00a317 higher annually than planned because of the number of windfarms and solar panels installed in recent years, according to the government\u2019s spending watchdog.</p> <p>The amount of money levied on bills each year to pay for renewable energy subsidies is capped under a system called the levy control framework, to limit costs for consumers and businesses. The cap was set at \u00a37.1bn for 2020/21, but government officials warned last year it was on track to hit \u00a39.1bn because so much green energy was being deployed. </p> <p>The National Audit Office revised this down on Tuesday to \u00a38.7bn, or \u00a3110 of what is forecast be a \u00a3991 average annual household bill by 2020, up \u00a317 on what it would have been if the cap was met.</p> <p>But energy department officials were quick to point out that the new forecast is within the 20% of \u2018headroom\u2019 that is allowed over the cap.<br></p> <p>The NAO said the framework had failed to provide value for money because the expected overshoot meant there was now little money to support further new renewables up to 2020. Spending more later would have been more cost-effective because the price of building green energy is coming down, the watchdog said.<br></p> <p>Sir Amyas Morse, auditor general of the NAO, said: \u201cThe levy control framework has helped make some of the impacts of renewable energy policies on consumers clearer. But government\u2019s forecasting, allocation of the budget and approach to dealing with uncertainty has been poor, and so has not supported value for money.\u201d</p> <p>In a report published on Tuesday, the NAO blamed the expected overspend on the energy department being slow to see that more renewable energy was being deployed than expected because of the subsidies. Offshore windfarms have generated more electricity than expected, too. Officials were also accused of failing to gather market intelligence frequently enough.</p> <p>But lower than expected fossil fuel prices had also played a small role, because the most recent subsidy schemes for windfarms \u2013 contracts for difference \u2013 pay their operators a top-up payment above the price of wholesale electricity, which has been lower than was forecast.</p> <p>\u201cThe department took too long to discover that it was on course to exceed the framework cap,\u201d said the report. \u201cOne reason for increased forecast costs was the global slump in fossil fuel prices, a development which energy market experts in general were not expecting.\u201d</p> <p>The NAO said the Department of Energy and Climate Change, now part of an enlarged business department, had got better at managing the framework since 2015. The future of the framework and support for green energy beyond 2020-21 is not yet clear, but energy experts have said they hope for clarity in the autumn statement.</p> <p>The report also said that the cost of paying gas and coal power station operators to provide standby power during the winter - under the \u2018capacity market\u2019 - would account for an increasing cost on bills. The scheme, plus a levy to make the draughtiest homes more efficient and the cost of fitting smart meters is expected to make up \u00a354 of an average household bill in 2020, though these are not covered by the levy control framework.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cOur top priority is ensuring that families and businesses have a secure, affordable, clean energy supply. Our actions have reduced projected costs on the levy control framework by around \u00a3520m, and we continue to make further improvements to deliver value for money for consumers.\u201d<br></p>",

firearms agreement\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Turnbull told the chamber the Coalition stood by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/australias-gun-laws-stopped-mass-shootings-and-reduced-homicides-study-finds\">John Howard\u2019s gun reforms.</a></p> <p>Just before question time, Leyonhjelm released correspondence between himself and the Abbott government from 2015 where the government clearly agreed to a 12 month sunset clause on the Adler ban in return for his vote on migration legislation.</p> <p>The correspondence indicates that Abbott had himself horse traded on gun laws with Leyonhjelm in return for his support for other, non-related government legislation \u2013 some history that flies in the face of the former prime minister\u2019s criticism of Turnbull on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Labor picked up that correspondence in question time, asking a series of questions about whether the government had ever offered to weaken Australia\u2019s gun laws in return for support in the Senate.</p> <p>The justice minister, Michael Keenan, suggested to parliament that agreeing to the sunset clause wasn\u2019t indicative of the government\u2019s long term disposition on the Adler.</p> <p>He said the government had \u201calways been 100% clear in our position that we will restrict their import until we get an agreement with the states about where they were to be classified\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull insisted there was no prospect of weakening the Howard agreement on gun control.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no prospect, no chance of my government ... weakening, watering down John Howard\u2019s gun laws. And I might say there is no proposal being made to do so,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>Shorten asked whether Turnbull could confirm that he had spoken directly to Leyonhjelm about the ban on the lever-action Adler shotgun, and whether he could confirm reports that he was willing minister \u201cto discuss the regulation of the Adler gun in connection with support for the ABCC legislation?\u201d</p> <p>Leyonjhelm had earlier told Sky News he\u2019d discussed the issue with the prime minister in August, and Turnbull had been sympathetic.</p> <p>Turnbull ducked the question in the House, saying he respected cross bench senators.</p> <p>The prime minister said Leyonhjelm was entitled to his view about the Adler, and he also said shooters were entitled to their views.</p> <p>\u201c[Leyonjelm]\u2019s entitled to express [his views] to me or to any other minister. But what he has not proposed, at least not in my hearing, is any weakening of the national firearms agreement as it stands,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a view as to the manner in which it should be strengthened. He is entitled to have that view as indeed are other shooter organisations and their representatives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe government, of course, listens to those views as I\u2019m sure justice ministers and premiers in other jurisdictions do as well.\u201d</p>",

His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New England\u2019s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didn\u2019t want to create extra headlines.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is right now. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of headlines to make, and I\u2019ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. I\u2019ve been in an organization where we\u2019re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we don\u2019t do the trash-talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always thought is I don\u2019t want to be a distraction for the team. That\u2019s what my goal is. Not that there are things I\u2019ve said and done that haven\u2019t been, but you try not to be. It\u2019s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions it\u2019s even harder to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>However, Brady\u2019s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201c[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, \u2018I don\u2019t condone it\u2019 and then walk off the stage. The optics of it weren\u2019t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time he\u2019s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. I\u2019m not responsible for what comes out of my friend\u2019s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good time with him\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/tom-brady-donald-trump-press-conference-distraction\">Tom Brady says he ducked Trump questions to avoid team distractions</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58054a18e4b0cd26ff71e1d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T22:01:59.374Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Juanita Broaddrick, on Donald Trump\u2019s accusers:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If these accounts are true, yeah.

This is one of the big-breaking stories of our time, in my opinion - this shows corruption at the highest level, and we can\u2019t let it happen as American citizens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo let\u2019s see how the press covers it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe press likes not to cover it because the best thing that Hillary Clinton has going is the media. Without the media, she wouldn\u2019t even be in this race. This is collusion between the FBI, the Department of Justice and the State Department to make Hillary Clinton look like an innocent person when she\u2019s guilty of very high crimes.
