  "<p>Another day, another Colin Kaepernick controversy. This time, it\u2019s about socks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/31/colin-kaepernick-protest-support-military-veterans\">Colin Kaepernick receives support from America's military veterans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Photographs emerged on social media of the San Francisco 49ers quarterback wearing socks showing cartoon pigs in police hats. Kaepernick reportedly wore the socks during several practice sessions during the off-season \u2013 weeks before his refusal to stand during the national anthem.</p> <p>Some people, including the head of a national police organization, were upset with the socks, but Kaepernick released a statement to insist that what he chooses to wear on his feet shouldn\u2019t \u201cdistract from the real issues\u201d.</p> <p>Kaepernick said on Thursday: \u201cI wore these socks, in the past, because the rogue cops that are allowed to hold positions in police departments, not only put the community in danger, but also put the cops that have the right intentions in danger by creating an environment of tension and mistrust. I have two uncles and friends who are police officers and work to protect and serve all people. So before these socks, which were worn before I took my public stance, are used to distract from the real issues, I wanted to address this immediately.\u201d</p> <p>According to reports, Kaepernick reportedly wore the socks as early as 10 August, but has not been asked about them until now.</p> <p>Bill Johnson of the National Association of Police Organizations said Kaepernick\u2019s socks dishonored his officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous that the same league that prohibits the Dallas [Cowboys] football club from honoring the slain officers in their community with their uniforms stands silent when Kaepernick is dishonoring police officers with what he\u2019s wearing on the field,\u201d Johnson said, according to USA Today Sports. \u201cI think the league is in a downward spiral regarding their obligations to the public under [commissioner] Roger Goodell, and this is just another example of that.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick is scheduled to start Thursday night\u2019s preseason finale against the San Diego Chargers,&#xa0;who will be holding their annual salute to the military at the game. But Kaepernick said he won\u2019t be standing for the anthem.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll continue to sit,\u201d he told NFL Media. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me, this is something that has to change. When there\u2019s significant change, and I feel like that flag represents what it\u2019s supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way that it\u2019s supposed to, I\u2019ll stand.\u201d</p>",

The only survivor of the side that toured India in 1993, three years earlier, was Alec Stewart, and given his international career spanned 14 years and 140 matches it\u2019s quite tricky to find a side without him in it. But he didn\u2019t play in the fifth ODI of that India series, Richard Blakey taking the gloves. Which means the team of August 29 1996 vs Pakistan in Manchester contained no survivors from the team of March 1st 1993 vs India at Jamshedpur. Scorecards: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64414.html\">1993</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65020.html\">1996</a>. Having done all that leg work, I fully expect someone to come along and produce a side from two years ago that looks nothing like today\u2019s, but I\u2019ve established that I\u2019m a tragic cricket geek so there is that at least.\u201d</p> <p>Good work. Generally, looking at teams straight after a World Cup shambles makes sense. I was going to suggest 2003, the Jim Troughton Years, but I think that team had Goughie in it.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c86c15e4b09a68e9b64d68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T18:00:48.493Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>10th over: England 52-</strong><strong>2 (target 248; Root 28, Morgan 0) </strong>Pakistan are in cornered-tigers mode, which is great to see after their insipid bowling performances earlier in the series.

If a preamble is the thing that comes before an amble, it feels spot-on for England today. They\u2019ve won the series with two games to spare, they\u2019ve set a new world record for a team total, and they\u2019ve broken a 23-year-old national record for the highest individual score: if all that doesn\u2019t earn them a walk in the park, it\u2019s hard to say what a 444 is for. Eoin Morgan will be telling them otherwise, and pointing out that they are still only <a href=\"http:// http://www.icc-cricket.com/team-rankings/odi\">fifth in the world at this kind of cricket</a>. But they could be forgiven for a certain amount of ambling. And it might make for a better contest \u2013 though the game itself, with its love of a good levelling, may have something to say about that.</p> <p>Pakistan have three targets at Headingley today, apart from the obvious one of claiming a consolation victory. They need to regain their self-respect, play as a team and field like professionals. These one-day players are markedly younger than the Dad\u2019s Army Misbah-ul-Haq has somehow turned into the world\u2019s top Test side, yet their fielding is even worse. If Azhar Ali can\u2019t persuade them to make routine stops, there\u2019s not much point having him in charge \u2013 especially as Sarfraz Ahmed, the Twenty20 captain, is in this team, in good form, and looking a lot more up for it than some of his team-mates. <br></p> <p>Play starts at 2pm.

  "<p>A cross-party group of MPs are backing a new law that could force multinational corporations to disclose where they do business, the money they make and the tax they pay.</p> <p>An amendment to the finance bill, which has crossbench support, proposes that the government should agree in principle to release information currently held by HM Revenue and Customs. </p> <p>Campaigners have argued that such an amendment could ensure that multinationals, which operate across several countries, adhere to \u201cpublic country-by-country reporting\u201d. </p> <p>It follows the landmark ruling of the European commission this week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">order Apple to pay back the Irish state</a> up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in taxes. </p> <p>A Treasury official said on Thursday that the amendment is being carefully considered. Theresa May promised to be tough on tax evasion and avoidance during her campaign to become leader of the Conservatives. </p> <p>Drawn up by the Labour MP Caroline Flint, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0047/amend/finance_rm_0831.pdf\">the amendment</a> has gained the support of more than 60 MPs \u2013 including the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee (PAC) and Conservative members of the committee. </p> <p>\u201cMPs and the public are saying it is time to shine a light on these secretive tax arrangements and make sure big multinational enterprises pay the right amount of tax,\u201d Flint said. \u201cThis public country-by-country reporting is a simple way to tackle a huge problem of avoidance.\u201d</p> <p> Other MPs supporting the amendment include members of the Scottish National party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. The House of Commons is expected to consider the remaining stages of the bill on Monday and Tuesday, including Flint\u2019s amendment. It has already completed the committee stage. </p> <p>Flint, a PAC member, first put forward a similar amendment to the bill in June that, if it had been accepted, would have forced multinationals to make disclosures on tax. While welcomed in principle by the then tax minister David Gauke, it was opposed by the government because, he argued, it needed to be implemented with international cooperation.</p> <p>Flint said that the new \u201cpermissive\u201d amendment would mean that the government could accept the principle of transparency but implement it at a later date. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe have changed the amendment so that it no longer binds the government to a strict timetable, but would commit ministers to the principle of transparency,\u201d she added. \u201cThe only reason they might reject this is if they really do not want it to happen.\u201d</p> <p>The amendment is supported by Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC \u2013 which scrutinises HMRC. She said: \u201cIf the government is serious about greater tax transparency by multinationals then it should have no fear in agreeing to this amendment.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Treasury is already proposing new rules to punish offshore tax evaders who fail to come clean about their finances before September 2018, with fines of up to 200% of the amount owed. It has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/16/can-theresa-may-get-wheels-british-business-turning-industry\">acted swiftly to signal a tougher stance with greater powers</a> for tax inspectors.</p> <p>Treasury minister Jane Ellison has previously voiced her support in principle for country-by-country reporting.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK has led the way in driving forward greater international tax transparency, initiating work on country-by-country reporting at the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development], introducing a public beneficial ownership register in the UK and launching a new global initiative to automatically exchange information on who really owns companies,\u201d she said. \u201cAlongside this we have taken the lead in calling for international public country-by-country reporting.\u201d</p> <p>In a further development, the chief executive of Apple has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/political-crap-tim-cook-apple-tax-ruling\">dismissed the EU\u2019s tax ruling as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d</a> and said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> was being \u201cpicked on\u201d, as he promised to push ahead with expansion plans in Cork. In an <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/no-one-did-anything-wrong-here-and-ireland-is-being-picked-on-it-is-total-political-crap-35012145.html\">interview with the Irish Independent</a>, Tim Cook suggested the European commission might be trying to use state aid rules to harmonise tax rates across the EU.</p>",
  "<p>It is less than a week since the International Geological Conference declared that we should recognise that we entered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\" title=\"\">a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene</a>, in around 1950. The changes that we have made to the planet are now irreversible and their effects will continue for millennia to come. None the less, this may prove to be the shortest of all geological epochs, since there is no guarantee that humans, who made it, will survive the results of their own activity.</p> <p>Not for the last 2.5bn years or so, since the cyanobacteria <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event\" title=\"\">filled the earth\u2019s atmosphere with free oxygen</a>, poisonous to almost every other form of life at the time, has any one species had such an effect on the environment as we have done. But we are not bacteria. We are the only species capable of reflecting on our impact. We have moral agency. We can foresee the likely consequences of our actions, consider them, and then make choices. In relation to the environment, these choices have frequently been wrong and show little sign of being right in time to save us from very large and damaging climate change.</p> <p>The problem is a classic one of game theory and it is one that liberal democracies are ill-fitted to handle. Trust and co-operation would lead to the best result for everyone, but each player or nation state will benefit more in the short term from a policy of selfishness and treachery. The shortness of electoral cycles in the rich world means that almost all governments need economic growth today, whatever the cost to be repaid with cruel interest in the future. That will be someone else\u2019s problem, just as the effects of climate change now appear to be someone else\u2019s problem, until these other people start fleeing war, starvation and disease and turn up at the edges of the richer world.</p> <p>Climate change is a global problem, and it can only be countered by some kind of global consciousness and a sense of the common good that embraces the whole of humanity. This is where the efforts of the world religions become important. Edmund Leach, the great British anthropologist, said <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/1967_reith1.pdf\" title=\"\">in his Reith lecture in 1967</a>: \u201cMen have become like gods\u2026 Science offers us total mastery over our environment and over our destiny.\u201d But this confidence looks hollow today. Even if \u201cscience\u201d were offering us this total mastery \u2013 and phenomena like antibiotic resistance suggest that it is not \u2013 Leach assumed a world in which scientists were authorities acknowledged above all political squabbling. The rise of climate change denialism shows just how wrong he was to do so.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, we need the help of people who are clear about the distinction between humans and gods. Enter <a href=\"https://laudatosi.com/\" title=\"\">Pope Francis</a>, who has swung the weight of his papacy behind the environmental movement in an unprecedented way. He is not alone. All of the organised world religions now have a strong environmental consciousness. All of them are affected. To be a world religion is by definition to have adherents among both the unimaginably poor and the unimaginably wealthy. However, Pope Francis has devoted considerable effort and political capital to the attempt to construct a coherent theory that can show how damage to our environment also harms us, and not just our hypothetical descendants. This really matters. Self-interest will only work to the common benefit if it is understood that we ourselves are mutually dependent creatures who harm ourselves when we harm one another.</p> <p>As the pope puts it: \u201cHuman beings are deeply connected with all of creation. When we mistreat nature we also mistreat human beings.\u201d The difficulty is to link such sentiments with practical action, and this is what <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/pont-messages/2016/documents/papa-francesco_20160901_messaggio-giornata-cura-creato.html\" title=\"\">his latest initiative</a> imaginatively suggests. Care for the environment is henceforth to be considered by faithful Catholics as a \u201cwork of mercy\u201d \u2013 what the outside world would call a charitable act. They are called to \u201ca grateful contemplation of God\u2019s world\u201d as a spiritual discipline, but also to the kind of small, slightly inconvenient gestures like recycling, using public transport, or even just turning off unneeded lights, which by themselves are almost meaningless, but when practised by billions of people make a real and very necessary change.</p> <p>All of these, he says, are to be understood as \u201csimple daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness\u201d; and while the world undoubtedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground\" title=\"\">needs huge and dramatic actions</a> to break the cycle of exploitation and climate change, it also needs ordinary people to play their part with just such simple acts.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing to acknowledge is the impact of David Luiz\u2019s second coming at Chelsea will not just be felt out on the pitch. The Brazilian will inject charisma into team and dressing room, livening up Cobham and reminding a squad still haunted by last year\u2019s torrid title defence of the spirit that claimed the European Cup and Europa League only a few years ago. The self-styled social media #geezer had been integral to both successes. It will be refreshing to hear his raucous laughter echoing round the corridors of the training ground again.</p> <p>Glance at his first interview back at the club he left two years ago and the buzzwords betray a man delighted to be back. \u201cIt is fantastic to have a second opportunity to play for this club,\u201d he grins. \u201cIt will be an amazing opportunity for me to show the fans again how I love this club, how I love to play for this club. Let\u2019s try to continue the nice history with a lot of joy. I can\u2019t wait to wear the shirt at Stamford Bridge again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/chelsea-valencia-aymen-abdennour-loan-deadline-day\">Chelsea confirm deal struck for David Luiz to return from PSG</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His last two visits back to south-west London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/12/david-luiz-brazilian-psg-chelsea-champions-league\" title=\"\">had seen Chelsea eliminated from the Champions League</a> but the locals will forgive him almost anything after that wholehearted, one-legged performance in Munich. They have pined for the entertainment that would veer from comical to thrilling on a weekly basis, a mesmeric combination of crunching tackles and flamboyance on the ball. Centre-halves are supposed to be dour and dogged and should not hog the limelight to this extent, but the unpredictability he offers was always entrancing. He will be a breath of fresh air, albeit one that could eventually cost north of \u00a334m.</p> <p>Chelsea, of course, have not forked out on a court jester. David Luiz was not Antonio Conte\u2019s first choice and he is certainly not a figure who screams tactical cuteness or defensive discipline. Those are qualities he is unlikely to develop overnight at the age of 29. Paris Saint-Germain were initially reluctant to part with the player until he made it obvious to the president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, and the sporting director, Patrick Kluivert, that he wanted out. Yet the new head coach, Unai Emery, had made clear during pre-season that the third-highest earner at the club would be third-choice at centre-half. Marquinhos and Thiago Silva, once fit, is PSG\u2019s defence of choice.</p> <p>Maybe that has played on David Luiz\u2019s mind but his 62-minute performance in Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat by Monaco, which included the clumsy concession of a penalty for rugby tackling Jemerson, suggested his powers were on the wane. Certainly PSG eventually leapt at the chance to recoup the vast majority of their outlay from 2014 \u2013 which had the potential to rise to \u00a350m, but was actually closer to \u00a340m \u2013 in selling him back. That does not bode well. Nor does the reality Conte would instinctively have preferred Kalidou Koulibaly or Alessio Romagnoli, both players steeped in the relative rigidity of Serie A, or even Marquinhos, as to whose availability Chelsea had initially inquired this week.</p> <p>But, in giving the pursuit of David Luiz the green light on transfer deadline day, the manager must believe he is not purchasing a liability. He knows the player\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and that each defensive blunder will draw the focus not least because a player of his stature, all frizzy hair and maniacal grin, tends to invite more scrutiny. Regardless, he will provide an option this squad had lacked. There are now three senior centre-halves, in David Luiz one with a burst of pace to go with a towering presence, granting the Italian the choice of playing them all across the back-line as he did at Juventus and with&#xa0;Italy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/premier-league-2016-summer-transfer-window-club-by-club-verdicts\">Premier League 2016 summer transfer window: club-by-club verdicts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It will be intriguing to see whether the player is permitted to express himself as he once did. Will David Luiz be granted the leeway to maraud upfield in possession? Even Conte may struggle to drum those instincts out of him but maybe he considers N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s busy presence in midfield a safety net to protect the team from the centre\u2011half\u2019s eccentricities. He could even experiment with the Brazilian alongside Kant\u00e9 for some fixtures.</p> <p>The pragmatist in Conte will make this eye-catching transfer fit his needs. Chelsea had given the impression they were a club floundering as the deadline approached, wounded by all the knockbacks and, it seemed, hamstrung by their inability to offer European football to those they coveted. The prices quoted were too mind-boggling, even for them. So, ultimately, they turned to familiar allies to find a solution.</p> <p>The agents Kia Joorabchian and Giuliano Bertolucci have worked closely with Roman Abramovich\u2019s club for years. They have smoothed the arrivals of Willian \u2013 plucked from Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s training ground \u2013 and Oscar, as well as the youngsters Kenedy, Wallace, Lucas Piazon and Matt Miazga. They have coaxed huge fees from PSG and Jiangsu Suning for David Luiz and Ramires respectively. The unsuccessful but relatively inexpensive loan signing of their client Alexandre Pato in January had offered the Brazil forward a route back into European football \u2013 he is now contracted to Villarreal \u2013 and felt almost like a favour. So, when Chelsea threatened to draw a blank, it is no surprise the same agents delivered a solution late on deadline day. It was needed.</p> <p>Returning to a familiar face may appear a retrograde step, and hardly a pat on the back to an extensive scouting department, but this was an awkward window for plenty of clubs, and there was a logic in recruiting someone who knows the setup. Chelsea have John Terry on a one-year deal, Kurt Zouma recovering from long-term injury and Andreas Christensen in the second season of a two-year loan at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. The youngster is improving weekly in the Bundesliga and the hope is he will return next summer ready to make his mark in the Premier League. Until then, while plenty voice their scepticism, Chelsea will revel in the return of a talisman to raise the mood.</p>",

Hell or High Water, he says, was a \u201clove at first sight&#xa0;experience\u201d, when he was sent Sheridan\u2019s script as a spec project: \u201cI&#xa0;very rarely read a script that I don\u2019t feel I want to change a lot.\u201d Mackenzie acknowledges that the Hollywood new wave comparisons are apt \u2013 \u201cIt had the freewheeling vibe to it that I love in 70s movies\u201d \u2013 but suggests that depression-era outlaw stories (of which the new wavers made plenty, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/bonnie-clyde-crime\">Bonnie and Clyde</a>, Dillinger and Thieves Like Us) was as much of an influence on Hell or High Water\u2019s social comment. \u201cIt\u2019s a reclamation of some kind against forces that are bigger than people.

I can shine a light on them, I can touch on them, but I am not in a position to ram them home. That\u2019s not my sensibility anyway.\u201d</p> <p>But exactly what is Mackenzie\u2019s sensibility? Though a staple of the festival circuit, and a pillar of the Scottish film industry, he is remarkably hard to pin down, as a director at least. Hell or High Water is Mackenzie\u2019s ninth feature, released 14 years after his first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/09/artsfeatures6\">The Last Great Wilderness</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping\">Young Adam</a>, the Alexander Trocchi adaptation he released in 2003, remains probably his most admired film; the Jack O\u2019Connell prison flick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/23/starred-up-review-prison-drama-mark-kermode\">Starred Up</a> \u2013 until Hell or High Water came along \u2013 the closest he has come to a popular success. He has a proper body of work to his name, but if it is distinguished by anything, it is by its pinballing, switchback nature: a determined effort not to go over old ground, to the extent that the usual evidence of directorial signature is almost entirely absent.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are connections between them,\u201d Mackenzie says, frowning. \u201cBut it\u2019s true, it\u2019s quite hard to pin down what they are. I\u2019m not doing it wilfully; in the early days, I was just trying to do something original each time. Signature film-making seems rather dull to me; it\u2019s about finding something you can do something with, and running with the ball.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff2f3780a1f4c8528614e99c2ed8440a65b8c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff2f3780a1f4c8528614e99c2ed8440a65b8c51/0_88_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack O\u2019Connell in Mackenzie\u2019s 2013 film Starred Up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack O\u2019Connell in Mackenzie\u2019s 2013 film Starred Up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Film4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mackenzie talks about \u201ctuning into\u201d or \u201cassimilating\u201d into the world of each film \u2013 whether it is the Marfa, Texas, of Hell or High Water, or the grimy sludge of T in the Park for his guerrilla-shot music festival romance You Instead. \u201cA lot of cinema is about the game of authenticity \u2013 do you feel it\u2019s real?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a director, when you embrace a project, you try to understand as much as you can about its world, and you do that by embracing and engaging with people who are in that world. Then it\u2019s down to your best instincts, which is what most directing is about anyway.\u201d Describing himself as a \u201cnavy brat\u201d, he mentions an itinerant childhood as a possible source for this habit (he is the son of <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/obituaries/14177989.John_Mackenzie/\">Rear-Admiral John Mackenzie</a>, a senior officer in the Royal Navy). Directing, he says, \u201cis all about an alchemy, a dance\u201d; on set, he says, he is \u201ctrying to steer towards what\u2019s needed\u201d. \u201cIf you ever have to do any hard steering, it feels less than ideal. It\u2019s a gentle dance. I don\u2019t know if I explained that very well.\u201d</p> <p>Despite You Instead attracting some unkind reviews, Mackenzie credits the film with loosening him up as a director: choosing to shoot an entire feature in five days in \u201cthe most uncontrollable environment you could possibly make a film in\u201d was \u201can amazingly liberating experience\u201d. \u201cWe had to roll with the blows and the circumstances at any given moment. We had to evolve our technique, shooting with longer lenses so people wouldn\u2019t notice the camera.\u201d Now, he says, he doesn\u2019t \u201creally give a fuck about originality\u201d, and is less uncomfortable with genre films. It is no coincidence, surely, that his recent critical and commercial surge has been due to taking on those very genre films \u2013 Starred Up, Hell or High Water \u2013 that he spent so long avoiding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a296da6206cee9a61e55ad79909854ed7b1f1273\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a296da6206cee9a61e55ad79909854ed7b1f1273/602_0_2491_1496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ewan McGregor and Emily Mortimer in Young Adam, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ewan McGregor and Emily Mortimer in Young Adam, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Hanway Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thinking back, he says that in the late 90s and early noughties, when he was making award-winning short films and developing his first features, his main inspiration was Danish cinema, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/25/how-dogme-built-denmark\">Dogme 95 movement</a> in particular. \u201cIt punched above its weight for a small country and made some incredible stuff. It was very hard not to admire it from the outside, and think that it was possible to do something like that in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work out that way, says Mackenzie, but Sigma Films, the company he founded with his production partner Gillian Berrie, has been very thick with Lars von Trier\u2019s Zentropa over the years: joint credits include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/27/thriller\">Red Road</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1099881,00.html\">Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself</a> (from the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XUsqlE-OmOcC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22advance+party%22+von+trier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi12qnc0JjOAhVrCcAKHfnRAuoQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22advance%20party%22%20von%20trier&amp;f=false\">\u201cScottish Dogme\u201d scheme Advance Party</a>) and von Trier\u2019s Dogville. Zentropa also helped Mackenzie\u2019s debut, The Last Great Wilderness, into production; it looks very Dogme-ish now, with its frenetically mobile low-tech video camera.</p> <p>His attachment to Danish cinema may also have led to his career low point; he readily admits to finding his ambitious end-of-the-world fable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/perfect-sense-film-review\">Perfect Sense </a>\u2013 from a script by Danish writer Kim Fupz Aakeson, and backed again by Zentropa \u2013 a difficult and, at times, disorientating experience. He says he found it \u201cemotionally hard\u201d, and that he \u201ctried really hard, but I was going home every night and asking whether we really knew what the idea was supposed to be.

The barebones simplicity of You Instead was, he says, a reaction to Perfect Sense\u2019s overwrought, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/29/melancholia-film-review\">Melancholia</a>-style imaginings, while Perfect Sense was itself a high-minded response to his first, not entirely comfortable, American production: the Ashton Kutcher sex comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/31/spread-review\">Spread</a>. Released in<strong> </strong>2008, Spread is by some way Mackenzie\u2019s most unlikely film; and one that, despite its confidence and fluency, appeared to sour Mackenzie against a planned full-time shift to LA. He doesn\u2019t go into detail, but admits: \u201cThere was a little bit of negativity between myself and the producers, and it left a nasty taste in my mouth. I don\u2019t really want to go there, as it feels a long time ago and the final film is my vision \u2013 but gentlemanly behaviour wasn\u2019t going on.\u201d Instead, he went back to Glasgow and got on with Perfect Sense.</p> <p>Hell or High Water is his first venture in the US since Spread, and it seems that the credibility he derived from Starred Up put him back on the radar of US producers. Starred Up wasn\u2019t a commercial success in the US, he says, but \u2013 as he rather sheepishly points out \u2013 despite \u201cnot being particularly macho in the way I live my life, somehow or other it allowed Americans to regard me as someone able to deal with macho subjects\u201d. Having extracted what could well be a career-changing performance from Pine, Mackenzie would appear to be set fair for a proper tilt at Hollywood.</p> <p>Only then does his careful, diplomatic manner break down, after I suggest that Marvel \u2013 with its current penchant for indie directors \u2013 might be considering putting in a call. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking bear superheroes, so I won\u2019t be doing one of those.\u201d It is the nearest he gets to actual asperity; fortunately, Hollywood is a big place, and Marvel is not the only game in town. \u201cI look forward to the day when the general public get tired of these things \u2013 I\u2019ve been tired of them for a long time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/simone-biles\" title=\"\">Simone Biles</a> won four gold medals in Rio last month, she was the latest in a line of charismatic female gymnasts whose Olympic acrobatics have captured imaginations far beyond the world of sport. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/dec/14/50-olympic-moments-nadia-comaneci\" title=\"\">Nadia Com\u0103neci</a> (in 1976) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/06/50-stunning-olympic-moments-olga-korbut\" title=\"\">Olga Korbut</a> (1972) are two famous examples. But V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, who has died aged 74, was the first and the bravest.</p> <p>\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1\u2019s seven Olympic golds, won in Tokyo in 1964 and Mexico City in 1968, included back-to-back golds as best all-round gymnast, an achievement matched only once in Olympic history. The second of these was won by a points margin unparalleled until Biles\u2019s 2016 triumph \u2013 and marked the culmination of a four-year period in which \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 won 19 individual gold medals at major international championships. She remains the only gymnast, male or female, to have won Olympic gold in every individual event. But what made her a global celebrity was not the number of her triumphs, but her character.</p> <p>The third daughter of a grocer from the Karl\u00edn district of Prague, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 showed early athletic promise but initially tried to channel her talents into ballet and figure skating. At 14, she was taken under the wing of Eva Bos\u00e1kov\u00e1, the leading female gymnast in what was then Czechoslovakia. Within four months she was competing internationally. By 1958, aged 16, she was good enough to be taken to the world championships in Moscow; the team won a silver medal.</p> <p>In 1960 she was part of the Czech team that won silver in the Rome Olympics. But it was in Tokyo four years later that she established herself as the greatest gymnast of her generation \u2013 notwithstanding a fall from the asymmetric bars. Her three gold medals (vault, balance beam and all-round) and team silver barely began to reflect her dominance.</p> <p>Look at the 1964 footage today, and it all seems absurdly simple, compared with the gravity-defying aerobatics of Biles. At the time, it was unprecedented. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 took a discipline that had been largely dance-based and injected it with athleticism and daring. \u201cIt has to be seen to believed,\u201d reported the Times. She was muscular: her US rival Kathy Corrigan described her as \u201cbuilt like a spark-plug\u201d. Yet she competed with grace and charm as well, winning hearts as freely as medals.</p> <p>The latter continued to accumulate, including all-round titles in both world (1966) and European (1965 and 1967) championships. Then came 1968: the high point and turning point of her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79f0fa314031b14e92b3aec35455223f8d4a4f58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f0fa314031b14e92b3aec35455223f8d4a4f58/339_85_1686_2108/800.jpg\" alt=\"V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in gym practice, Czechoslovakia, 1964.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in gym practice, Czechoslovakia, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA P/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the year began, two decades of hardline communist tyranny in Czechoslovakia were giving way to an unprecedented experiment in \u201csocialism with a human face\u201d. Alexander Dub\u010dek, who coined that phrase, became first secretary of the Communist party. Censorship was abolished, political prisoners were rehabilitated; there was talk of a \u201cPrague spring\u201d. The Soviet Union complained furiously that the reforms were \u201cthreatening the foundations of socialism\u201d. In June, the author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk published a provocative manifesto, known as The Two Thousand Words, urging the reformers to hold firm in the face of Kremlin intimidation. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was among the public figures who signed it (as were the nation\u2019s other great Olympic idols, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/23/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Emil</a> and Dana Z\u00e1topek).</p> <p>It did not help. On 20 August 1968, a huge Soviet-led Warsaw Pact army <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/21/1968theyearofrevolt.russia\" title=\"\">invaded Czechoslovakia</a>. Widespread passive resistance caught the world\u2019s imagination; the tanks, inevitably, triumphed. Dub\u010dek\u2019s experiment was dead.</p> <p>\u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, fearing arrest, retreated to a remote forest hideout in the Jesen\u00edk mountains, where, for the final weeks of her training for the Mexico City Olympics, she swung from branches, lifted sacks of potatoes and practised her beam exercise on a log. At night, she shovelled coal to prevent her hands from becoming soft.</p> <p>It seemed to work. Given last-minute clearance to travel to Mexico, she went to the Olympics \u201cdetermined to sweat blood to defeat the invaders\u2019 representatives\u201d. This furious resolve was sublimated into a series of routines of breathtaking energy and panache. Spectators found her irresistible; her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYqG7IG4b4U\" title=\"\">floor routine</a>, to Mexican \u201chat dance\u201d music, was a particular hit. But the trauma of recent events could not be banished.</p> <p>A controversial judging decision cost her gold in the beam; an even more controversial revision of scores saw her forced to share the gold for the floor routine. In each case, the beneficiary was a Soviet. On the medals podium, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 twice made her displeasure plain, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dykBBhaoczg\" title=\"\">looking pointedly downwards and away while the Soviet anthem was played</a>. The gestures would cost her dear.</p> <p>She ended the Olympics with four golds and two silvers, and rounded things off with a celebrity-packed wedding in Mexico Cathedral to her team-mate, Josef Odlo\u017eil, the 1500 metres runner. The <a href=\"https://www.olympic.org/the-ioc\" title=\"\">International Olympic Committee</a> declared her the most popular female athlete of the Games; another survey ranked her the second most popular woman in the world, surpassed only by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis\" title=\"\">Jackie Kennedy</a>.</p> <p>Returning to Prague, \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 remained defiant, publicly handing one of her gold medals to the embattled Dub\u010dek. Her compatriots voted her sportsperson of the year. But the tide of events was against her.</p> <p>The following spring, Dub\u010dek was ousted. Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k, who replaced him, began a programme of \u201cnormalisation\u201d in which all dissent was purged from Czechoslovakian life. \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 was prevented from travelling abroad or participating in public events at home \u2013 in effect, she was forced into sporting retirement. After resisting pressure to withdraw her signature from The Two Thousand Words, she was also barred from coaching. She worked for a while as a cleaner, but regularly presented herself to Anton\u00edn Himl, chairman of the national sports federation, to declare herself available for coaching work.</p> <p>Her fame gave her some leverage. In 1972, the Czechoslovak government bowed to international pressure and allowed her to travel to the Munich Olympics. When West German footage showed her among the celebrity spectators, the Czech TV commentator ignored her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c08b4092c1267159489a146dd0cdf717c855b70f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08b4092c1267159489a146dd0cdf717c855b70f/0_176_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in Prague, 2012.

From 1974 \u2013 after presenting herself to Himl dressed in a leotard \u2013 she was allowed to coach children, discreetly, at the Sparta Prague sports club. From 1975 she was allowed to advise coaches to the national team. Eventually, she was permitted to spend time abroad, coaching in Mexico from 1979 to 1981. After that, the sports federation gave her an obscure desk job in Prague, sharing an office with the similarly disgraced Emil Z\u00e1topek.</p> <p>The Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought a new president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/vaclav-havel\" title=\"\">V\u00e1clav Havel</a>, to power. He signalled \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1\u2019s rehabilitation by making her an official adviser. She also became chair of the national Olympic committee and from 1995 to 2001 was a member of the IOC.</p> <p>By then she was divorced; she and Odlo\u017eil had parted in 1987. But her family troubles were not over. In 1993, Odlo\u017eil got into a fight with their teenage son, Martin, in a night club in Doma\u0161ov, and died shortly afterwards of his injuries. Martin was jailed \u2013 Havel pardoned him, controversially, in 1997 \u2013 and \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 fell into a deep depression.</p> <p>For many years she was barely seen except by her closest friends and family. But she remained revered by her compatriots, and in recent years she had seemed to be regaining her appetite for life. By 2012 she was describing her new-found energy as \u201cmiraculous\u201d and had recovered enough joie de vivre to delight a Mexican crowd, as a guest at a gymnastics event in Acapulco, by demonstrating spontaneously that at 70 she could still do the splits.</p> <p>She ended her life with an embarrassment of honours, including the Olympic Order, the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play prize and the Czech Order of Merit; but she wore her past glories lightly. One friend, the publisher Tom\u00e1\u0161 Dimter, was surprised to find no trace of her achievements when he first visited her house. \u201cWhen I asked her where all her medals were, she just waved her hand and pointed to a wooden shed in her garden. There were hundreds of medals and trophies, secured with a simple latch.\u201d</p> <p>She remained a woman of stubborn principle, speaking out on behalf of refugees. \u201cShe was a lifelong fighter,\u201d said her friend Karel Engel, a former Olympic wrestler. \u201cShe never reconciled herself with injustice.\u201d</p> <p>She is survived by Martin and by her daughter, Radka.</p> <p>\u2022 V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, gymnast, born 3 May 1942; died 30 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>The columnist George Monbiot won\u2019t easily forget the late Lord McAlpine.</p> <p>After defaming McAlpine via Twitter in 2012, Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2012/11/10/lord-mcalpine-an-abject-apology/\">publicly apologised</a> and <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2013/03/12/my-agreement-with-lord-mcalpine/\">agreed to do charity work</a> worth \u00a325,000 over three years from March 2013.</p> <p>That agreement is now discomforting the Guardian, which was not a party to it.</p> <p>In a clear breach of editorial standards on conflicts of interest, Monbiot in some of his published Guardian pieces assisted two charities without disclosing to readers that he was under an obligation to work on the charities\u2019 behalf.</p> <p>\u201cIt is always necessary to declare an interest when the journalist is writing about something with which he or she has a significant connection,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/aug/05/the-guardians-editorial-code\">say the Guardian\u2019s guidelines</a>. \u201cThis applies to both staff journalists and freelances.\u201d</p> <p>As journalists routinely remind governmental and corporate figures, disclosure matters when circumstances mean that a person can reasonably be regarded as having conflicting loyalties. In journalism, the impetus for managing conflicts properly is the same as in other fields. Mismanagement, especially a failure to disclose, can erode trust.</p> <p>On seven occasions between May 2013 and December 2015, Monbiot\u2019s Guardian work referred favourably to Trees for Life and its founder Alan Watson Featherstone, or to Widehorizons, an educational charity that gives children experiences of the natural environment.</p> <p>Two references to Trees for Life were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/oct/24/ripping-up-the-sea-floor-on-behalf-of-royal-profits\">brief</a>, made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/27/my-manifesto-rewilding-world\">in passing</a>, as was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/pope-encyclical-value-of-living-world\">one</a> to Widehorizons. Two to Widehorizons were central: in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/education-children-not-feral-enough\">column about education</a> and in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/apr/08/time-to-rewild-your-child-george-monbiot-video\">video</a> showing Monbiot introducing children to a seashore environment. <br></p> <p>In another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/britain-wild-nature-rewilding-ecosystems-heal-lives\">column</a>, Monbiot declared an interest in Rewilding Britain, which he helped to found, but not Trees for Life. The seventh reference was published under Monbiot\u2019s influence but not his name. <br></p> <p>Last December, the Guardian published its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/guardian-new-year-honours\">alternative New Year\u2019s honours list</a>. Among 35 named individuals, including Angela Merkel, Barack Obama, Edward Snowden and Malala Yousafzai, was Alan Watson Featherstone.</p> <p>Monbiot nominated him for his work to bring back lost Caledonian forest and the species that inhabited it.</p> <p>Neither the sincerity of Monbiot\u2019s nomination nor Featherstone\u2019s merits are in question here. The point is Monbiot ought to have disclosed to the editors of the list his obligation to Trees for Life derived from the McAlpine agreement.</p> <p>I learned of Monbiot\u2019s arrangements with the two charities from a reader who sought an investigation and said he planned to write an article. Monbiot co\u00adoperated readily with my phone and email inquiries and acknowledged frankly his failing: \u201cI did not pay sufficient attention to the guidelines and should have declared an interest.\u201d</p> <p>Initially, Monbiot was to help three charities but it was reduced to two. Monbiot, not McAlpine, chose Trees for Life \u00ad because he already knew Featherstone and his work. He selected Widehorizons from 130 charities which responded to his call\u00adout on Twitter after publicising his agreement with McAlpine.</p> <p>The Guardian guidelines say that a declaration should be made to a head of department or editor during the preparation of items. \u201cFull transparency may mean that the declaration should appear in print and on the website.\u201d</p> <p>Monbiot told me he cannot be sure, and has no written record of it, but he thinks he recalls telling the names of the charities to two senior editors with whom he liaised at the Guardian. Both editors have since left the Guardian. I contacted them and both said they had known of the agreement but could not recall Monbiot having told them the names of the charities. <br></p> <p>The editors who succeeded the pair during the remainder of the three\u00ad-year period told me that Monbiot had not disclosed the names to them.</p> <p>Monbiot\u2019s other work for the charities included lectures, teaching, advice and introductions. From the charities\u2019 perspective, the mentions in the Guardian were not insignificant. Monbiot\u2019s public profile was a large part of what made him valuable to them, and the leaders of both told me they were pleased and grateful for his involvement, which Monbiot and the charities say they intend to continue.</p> <p>The venality which can characterise conflicts of interest cases is absent from this one. Readers were not misled in a material way. The choice of the charities was consistent with the environmental advocacy for which Monbiot is well known. This is relevant in assessing potential harm to trust.</p> <p>Had Monbiot failed to disclose an agreement to assist, say, a big oil or coal company, the impact on readers\u2019 trust in him, the Guardian\u2019s trust in him, and perhaps readers\u2019 trust in the Guardian, would have been justifiably severe.</p> <p>The two lawyers who negotiated the agreement for McAlpine confirmed Monbiot\u2019s statement that there was no formal agreement document. The charities said the same about their relationships with Monbiot. Nor was there a formula for valuing elements of Monbiot\u2019s work so that progress towards the \u00a325,000 total could be calculated. <br></p> <p>The lawyers said they were satisfied with the workings of what they and Monbiot described as a gentlemen\u2019s agreement. McAlpine, who died in 2014, was a fair man who had been impressed by Monbiot\u2019s apology, said the senior lawyer, Andrew Reid of RMPI LLP.</p> <p>No formal progress reports had been sought from Monbiot. \u00ad \u201cWe took him to be a man of honour,\u201d Reid said.<br></p> <p>Monbiot told me that not making a declaration \u201clooks stupid in retrospect but, as far as I can recall, it just didn\u2019t cross my mind\u201d.</p> <p>Referring to the column which gave Widehorizons prominence, he said that after seeing the charity\u2019s work with children he was so enthused he just plunged into the article as he would any other.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I was concerned, the work I did for the charity was the teaching, and the article was work for the Guardian. This does not make it right, of course: as the editorial guidelines make clear, I should have declared the connection. But I had no intention to mislead anyone and no interest in doing so.\u201d</p> <p>The independence the Scott Trust grants to the readers\u2019 editor to investigate and to publish has resulted in necessary disclosure. Disclosure notes will be added to each of the seven items for future readers of the Guardian\u2019s online archive.</p> <p>Apart from vigilance, the Guardian cannot do much more.

She insisted her party was autonomous, with policy decided by its membership and shadow cabinet, and answerable to Scottish voters. </p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, is due to unveil her programme for government in Holyrood next week which is expected to include a new enabling bill to begin preparations for a second Scottish independence referendum.</p> <p>Dugdale said that bill would confirm that the SNP was obsessed with constitutional disputes rather than improving lives by using Holyrood\u2019s new tax powers to implement a new 50p top tax band, and to prevent further spending cuts from the Treasury. </p> <p>Suggesting 13 bills in total, she said a Labour administration would lead off with a new education bill to enshrine a new \u201cfair start fund\u201d for schools in deprived areas, abolish exam appeals charges and establish breakfast clubs in all primary schools.</p> <p>A new work and trade union bill would synchronise Holyrood\u2019s new powers over the work programme and create a skills agency to offset the UK government\u2019s reforms of trade union rights. Care workers would receive new employment powers and fracking for unconventional gas onshore would be banned. </p> <p>\u201cThe Labour party I lead cannot and will not vote for a budget that passes on more Tory austerity to Scotland, whilst not asking even the richest in our society to pay a penny more,\u201d Dugdale said.</p> <p>With Scottish Labour now the parliament\u2019s third largest party after it was beaten to second by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/ruth-davidson-never-been-caught-out-tells-you-something-interview-leader-scottish-conservatives\">Ruth Davidson</a>\u2019s Scottish Conservatives, Sturgeon is likely to brush off Dugdale\u2019s attacks. The SNP remains comfortably ahead in opinion polls. </p> <p>Offering to collaborate with the Scottish Green party, whose six MSPs will also be wooed by Sturgeon\u2019s minority administration, Dugdale accused the Tories of failing to produce any meaningful policy proposals. </p> <p>She said Davidson was more interested in quick soundbites on Twitter, while Davidson\u2019s influence with the UK government was weakened by her attacks during the EU referendum on pro-leave Tories who are now in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, including Boris Johnson, now foreign secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary. Dugdale wrongly described her as energy secretary in her speech. </p> <p>\u201cRuth Davidson cannot escape the fact that her party is taking us headlong on a path out of the EU,\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cA path that, at worst, will weaken our economy and, at best, will create years of instability. Senior members of the [UK] government she supports are the same people who eight weeks ago Ruth Davidson said were lying to the British public.</p> <p>\u201cHow can we believe a word the Tories say when just eight weeks ago they sold the British public a proposition that even their Scottish leader accepts was a bunch of lies?<br>  \u201cNo amount of comic tweets is going to disguise the fact that the Tories are Scotland\u2019s Brexit party.\u201d <br></p>",

How blessed is rugby that its participants remain so grounded and so at ease in the face of adversity?</p> <p>It is this mandatory depth of character that ultimately saves the sport from itself. It also helps to deflect the nagging fear player wellbeing still involves a touch of Russian roulette. The former Scotland wing Shaun Longstaff, now a player agent, offered some fascinating observations this week, suggesting to BBC Scotland the game was warping into something even he, as a former international, struggled to rationalise. According to Longstaff, coaches are openly asking agents to \u201cfind us a freak\u201d and judging players on their G-force readings when smashing into rucks. Longstaff particularly frets for younger players, desperate to retain or gain a contract, who feel compelled to push their bodies and heads too far: \u201cI don\u2019t know the way forward. I just know I\u2019m worried and have been for ages.\u201d He is far from alone but not everyone is listening.</p> <p>In 20 years\u2019 time it can only be hoped the global structure has fewer kinks in it. There will certainly be more international sevens tournaments in these islands, alongside higher-profile women players. It will seem crazy that more people did not glimpse the potential earlier but what of the professional 15-a-side club scene: exactly how far can it go?</p> <p>For all the Premiership\u2019s charms \u2013 and its competitiveness and clannishness are second to none \u2013 there remains room for improvement.

Many of Wasps\u2019 vaunted signings, for example, are unavailable to start the season while Charles Piutau and George Smith have departed.

Until the 2000s, western gatekeepers were excessively powerful and decided what reached fans in Europe and North America \u2013 with an often-lamented, neo-colonial aspect to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d and fetishising of the music and its creators.</p> <p>For Clayton, the internet has transformed this arrangement, creating \u201cworld music 2.0\u201d \u2013 making entire genres accessible at the click of a button, first via chat-rooms and file-sharing sites, and now YouTube or online shopping \u2013 but in some respects, the industry gatekeeping remains. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fed024de24ff1810893647afc9083e559bb39d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fed024de24ff1810893647afc9083e559bb39d73/0_59_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jace Clayton aka DJ/Rupture.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jace Clayton aka DJ /rupture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Lakner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor me, the \u20182.0\u2019 refers to all the crazy, slippery digital stuff you can access out there as an online listener,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut once you get into the specifics of European or American tours, or the festival circuit, suddenly that same industry infrastructure, selection and contextualisation by a few people occurs. So you\u2019re still told \u2018<em>This</em> is the Saharan desert blues band that you must hear\u2019 \u2013 as if there aren\u2019t hundreds of different bands, doing hundreds of different things.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a process that remains arbitrary and mysterious \u2013 Syrian dabke musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/omar-souleyman-syrian-wedding-singer-wooing-the-west\">Omar Souleyman</a> is a prime example: signed to world music label Sublime Frequencies, he has released several albums in the west, played Glastonbury and sold thousands of albums and concert tickets in Europe and the US \u2013 but Clayton is slightly baffled. \u201cNone of the dabke fans I\u2019ve met have ever heard of him. I get most of my dabke in Arab music shops here in Brooklyn, and it\u2019s crazy and interesting, all this weird stuff \u2013 but I\u2019ve never seen Omar Souleyman\u2019s CDs.\u201d</p> <p>Clayton is not out to criticise Souleyman or his label, but observes that some of the same arbitrary cherry-picking processes remain in place from the pre-digital age; he tells the story of the Master Musicians of Jajouka, a traditional Berber group beloved across the west, first produced by Brian Jones in 1971, they also received visits and collaborations from Mick Jagger, Billy Corgan, Ornette Coleman, William Burroughs and Lee Ranaldo. And yet despite this fame, the group are \u201cunknown a few towns over\u201d, and their music is unfindable at local tape stalls. \u201cIt slowly dawned on me,\u201d Clayton writes in Uproot, \u201cthat the music that got lauded within Morocco had virtually no overlap with the stuff successfully presented outside its borders.\u201d</p> <p>Uproot\u2019s strength is Clayton\u2019s determination to look beyond the easy answers: he enthuses about the liberatory potential of the new connections, fusions and mutations encouraged by digital music, and globally available cheap software like FruityLoops, but is keen we shouldn\u2019t overlook its limitations. \u201cThe first time I noticed this was back in 2002: I remember Kid606 saying to me, \u2018Hey check out this music\u2019, and it was just really bad, generic techno. I asked him \u2018Why are you playing me this?\u2019 and he said \u2018Because it\u2019s from Algeria!\u2019. He\u2019d picked it up in an obscure chat-room. And there was a moment of realisation where we both said, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re just using the same FruityLoops presets in Algeria\u2019.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/06/highlife-dj-auntie-flo\">Living the Highlife: the global party scene taking world music into the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same, he said, goes for remix apps for smartphones and tablets, which vastly constrain the possibilities of what a remix might be: \u201cJust looking around, I\u2019m slightly horrified, because it\u2019s so minimal, the changes you can make: \u2018press this button for \u2018siren\u2019, \u2018press this button to change the backing beat to \u2018rock\u2019, it\u2019s so limited.\u201d</p> <p>Generally, Clayton is excited about the same things the music industry panics about, and the way even big stars like Kanye and Beyonc\u00e9 are tinkering with old logic and protocols \u2013 \u201cI want the giants to fall even faster,\u201d he writes in Uproot, \u201cso we can see what weird flowers start blooming in the spaces left vacant.\u201d </p> <p>One of very few manifesto-style demands he makes is for technological innovators to find a way to compensate artists for the music they make \u2013 directly, and as fully as possible. \u201cThat came from looking into the huge cellphone banking boom in Africa,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt feels like the technology is almost in place, to allow that if someone makes a beat on their laptop, they could sell it on their phone, and get all the money for it, direct. It comes down to this basic thing \u2013 how to give, say, a weird Angolan techno producer their dues?\u201d</p> <p>For Clayton, the threats to the old ways are mostly a litany of new opportunities \u2013 he describes the Egyptian genre sha3by<em> </em>(the 3 is not a typo \u2013 it\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet\">Arabizi</a>) as \u201cantisentimental and ultralocal\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t that apply to all the music he loves? \u201cDefinitely, a lot of the stuff I talk about falls into that category. This sense that there\u2019s nothing sentimental about the act of creation, but instead more generosity, and messiness. Let\u2019s not be sentimental about musical history, and respect it too much: we\u2019re not tied down to the past, we\u2019re here now, let\u2019s just make something and throw it out there.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Uproot: Travels in 21st Century Music and Digital Culture is out now via FSG<br></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>NORTH v SOUTH</h2> <p>A new season starts with an old argument. The global calendar, a concept which has for most of the decade casually been kicked around like a ball in a warm-up, is an issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/25/premiership-rugby-mark-mccafferty-global-calendar-talks\">that is now being taken seriously</a>.<br></p> <p>There is no fit-all solution, no prospect of the seasons in the hemispheres being played simultaneously so one has to operate in its summer. It is about trying to find a way of playing club/regional/franchise rugby in a different window to the international game. And trying is the word.</p> <p>New Zealand have applied electric shock therapy by saying they are not prepared to sign up to a new Test tour schedule to replace the one that runs out after the 2019 World Cup if it means the two hemispheres trudge on tour at the end of their respective long seasons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/lions-tour-treadmill-premiership-pro-12-rugby\">Lions tour the prize but first comes treadmill even robots would find wearing | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The All Blacks would go it alone. If one of the European nations wanted them to visit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/24/global-rugby-union-season-talks-stall-2019-fixture-list\">it would have to strike a deal</a>, something that would also operate in reverse. Under the current tour agreement, the host nation banks all the profits from a match, paying the visitors\u2019 hotel and transport expenses.</p> <p>The four home unions and France earn (much) more from a match against the All Blacks than New Zealand do for playing any one of them at home. Market forces: there are millions more chimney pots in Europe than there are in the major southern hemisphere nations; New Zealand\u2019s population is not much more than half of London\u2019s.</p> <p>The New Zealand Union has done remarkably well to sustain success at international level at a time when French clubs are offering players seven-figure salaries and Japan has become a major importer of talent, but it feels it has maximised its financial potential at home and so has to look elsewhere.</p> <p>It knows that as it continues to produce players of such quality that even figures such as Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Ma\u2019a Nonu and Conrad Smith are barely missed, so it will have to work harder to hold on to them. The All Blacks\u2019 jersey is so alluring that McCaw denied himself the chance of earning substantially more abroad to continue wearing it, even if at the same time he probably extended his playing career.</p> <p>Australia and South Africa are not so fortunate, two of the game\u2019s superpowers who look in decline, with England now closest to New Zealand in the world rankings \u2013 they have been prey to the greater financial muscle of clubs in Europe. If the current tour schedule works in any way for them it is to make French owners ponder the wisdom of signing players who may not be around for much of the first three months of the season, and June; not that it has stopped them so far.</p> <p>There is little sympathy in Europe for the relative financial weakness of the south and even less enthusiasm to split the proceeds from tour matches evenly, although that stance has not stopped some on the four home unions from arguing the next Lions deal with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa should give them a chunk of the profits from each tour. Yet there would be significant ramifications here should countries which have customarily been in the top five of the world rankings in the professional era, and very often in the leading three, lose their lustre.</p> <p>One argument why there should be no revenue sharing is that the unions here have all redeveloped their grounds at considerable expense and should be able to enjoy the rewards. New Zealand, Australia and South Africa play Test matches all over their countries rather than in one base, although two of the Tests against the Lions next year will be at Eden Park, and only Sydney competes with Twickenham, Paris and Cardiff in terms of capacity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19a143a61c643b8c37eb57517098a11c9a346bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19a143a61c643b8c37eb57517098a11c9a346bac/0_0_5184_3109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twickenham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The RFU recently entered into a \u00a350m revolving credit facility with RBS over five years to finance the east stand redevelopment at Twickenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stadium development was funded by loans: earlier this year the Rugby Football Union entered into a \u00a350m revolving credit facility with RBS over five years to finance the east stand redevelopment at Twickenham, which will start after next year\u2019s Six Nations, as well as the laying of artificial pitches at community level, two-thirds of which has already been drawn down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/31/ben-teo-worcester-rugby-union-league-sam-burgess\">Ben Te\u2019o: \u2018Some people in union love that Sam Burgess went back\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Loans are granted not least on income projection. Take out autumn home matches against New Zealand, South Africa and Australia and the three Celtic unions are in financial trouble and the RFU\u2019s \u00a3152m annual turnover suffers a tumble. The hemispheres are in it together and a danger of failing to agree a tour schedule after 2019, or taking talks down to the wire as seems to be the way now, would be to create a vacuum that would probably be filled by clubs, and not just ones in England and France.</p> <p>The game has stretched itself in the last 20 years to generate the money to pay players and coaches: even the RFU blew its international playing budget last season through generous bonuses for the Six Nations title and the grand slam. A season that used to run from the beginning of September to the end of April, with a June tour more occasional than routine, now starts with friendlies in August and extends to the end of May \u2013 longer in France where the Top 14 will again stretch into June having kicked off two weekends ago.</p> <p>A global season, in which everything was synchronised, would work only if Test sides were fed by a league made up of sides from the two hemispheres, Super Rugby meets the European Champions Cup. The two windows would be separate, but that would devalue domestic leagues, something the Top 14 and Premiership rugby would not consider, never mind accept.</p> <p>And so the debate will go on, more questions than answers. The new campaign promises much in England, where if Gloucester and Bath pick up, Harlequins add growl to their bite and Northampton loosen up, the battle for the top four places will be intense. The Pro12 needs the Welsh regions to come out of hibernation, while Conor O\u2019Shea\u2019s move to Italy should galvanise Treviso and Zebre.</p> <p>The global season issue will run in the background.

In a world where even the most ardently future-facing artists are eventually pinned down and pigeonholed, she\u2019s spent much of the last decade bulldozing her way through fads and phases, sidestepping the new boring, upstaging the queen of pop and \u2013 somehow, throughout it all \u2013 sustaining sonic relevance.</p> <p>Even in a year in which our most prominent artists are exploring their creative limits \u2013 Frank Ocean\u2019s week-long carpentry live stream; <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/08/29/beyonce-mtv-video-music-awards-performance-gun-violence-police-shootings\">Beyonce\u2019s interpretation of the atrocities of gun crime</a> aired on primetime TV \u2013 the Sri Lankan rapper\u2019s originality remains unmatched.

Sure, there is vision, scope and experimentation \u2013 there\u2019s even an inexplicable cameo from the world\u2019s most famous former boy band member \u2013 but for the most part, AIM is frustratingly unfocused.</p> <p>It\u2019s disheartening, not least because the initial signs around her fifth album were so promising. The hypnotic teaser song Swords (which features on the deluxe version of AIM) is sparse and slick, fusing samples of clanging metal and arriving with a triumphant video starring a group of sword-wielding female dancers. Then came her official return with Borders \u2013 released at the tail end of 2015, it exhibited MIA\u2019s ability to scale a pop culture framework while providing serious political messages. A stark, brutalist construction, it infused eastern and western sounds, and pit basic, benign web-speak (\u201cbeing bae\u201d, \u201cbreaking the internet\u201d, \u201cqween\u201d) against sincere statements of compassion.

Joyousness is something MIA has imbued in many of her hits, from the braggadocious Bucky Done Gun to the glamorous world-beat of Bad Girls.

The same fleeting pleasure can be felt on Bird Song, a lumbering list of winged animals set to a kazoo-like caw. On Jump, as MIA\u2019s vocals stutter and overlap rather than creating the rhythmic soundscape she may have intended, it pushes the limits of the listener\u2019s patience. Freedun, which features the subtle, syrupy vocals of former One Direction member<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/lessons-from-adele-justin-bieber-and-zayn-on-having-a-hit-number-one-no-1\"> Zayn Malik</a>, is a better example of her buoyant capabilities; it bubbles and crunches, a cartoonish creation that elevates the middle section of the album, even if Malik and Maya appear to be channelling different spirits.</p> <p>Her mellifluous excursions work best. \u201cWhat haters say about me don\u2019t worry me, I keep it moving forward to what\u2019s ahead of me,\u201d she raps on Finally, a breezy dalliance with dancehall. Its approachability does not exist on the majority of AIM. These are global-facing pop songs that somehow have no place: too slow for a club, too confrontational for the bedroom, too skatty for the radio. It sounds as if AIM was made exclusively for MIA\u2019s benefit: one final eruption of inventive and sometimes incoherent ideas. Apt, perhaps, that an artist so vehemently punk bows out with an album so stubbornly hers.</p>",
  "<p>The vote that sealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeached-president-brazilian-senate-michel-temer\" title=\"\">Michel Temer\u2019s installation into power in Brazil</a> took place precisely one week after the end of the Rio Olympic Games and just days before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/china-hangzhou-propaganda-facelift-g20-summit\" title=\"\">G20 summit</a>. Major disturbances were avoided during the Games and the new president was confirmed in his post just in time to take his flight and enjoy a convenient round of handshakes and photos with world leaders in China. Everything was carefully planned to make the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-brazil-dilma-rousseffs-downfall-wont-cure-all-her-countrys-ills\" title=\"\">arbitrary removal of a democratically elected president</a> look like business as usual.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say the new leadership in Brazil isn\u2019t worried about whether it appears legitimate. Over the past few months, the alliance forged to oust Dilma Rousseff rejected calling the impeachment process that it was sponsoring a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Some even threatened to take legal action against those making this claim in official debates. Their narrative insisted that constitutional procedures were observed.</p> <p>It is true that, unlike the sudden impeachment carried out after just a couple of days in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/22/paraguay-fernando-lugo-ousted\" title=\"\">Paraguay in 2012</a>, or the clear use of force in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/29/manuel-zelaya-honduras-coup-protests\" title=\"\">Honduras in 2009</a>, formalities were observed in the surreal trial of Rousseff. For over five months alleged government accounting irregularities were treated as one of the most serious crimes in Brazilian political history and were carefully analysed by zealous legislators, including some accused of many crimes themselves, ranging from corruption to money laundering. Suddenly the same country that was capable of silently coping with a routine of impunity in notorious cases of state violence, such as the mass murder of street children or landless workers, became fixated on the legality of administrative budgeting orders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rousseff\u2019s fate was decided long before the last vote in the senate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Irrespective of such bizarre and creative legal analysis, Rousseff\u2019s fate was decided long before the last vote in the senate, by the collapse of the heterogeneous coalition that sustained her government and that made her the easy prey of an ultra-conservative legislature rattled by uncontrolled corruption investigations.</p> <p>This transition sheds light on the structural weaknesses of Brazil\u2019s democracy. The conservative congressmen who led the process of impeachment had been, in fact, key supporters of Rousseff, and of all other presidents of Brazil since the end of the dictatorship in 1985. Without their support, government majority in parliament would be impossible. With the arrival of Temer to the top post, this collection of ultra-conservative and corrupt forces has finally achieved hegemonic control over the executive and legislative branches.</p> <p>Even with the careful re-arrangement of forces in the parliament and the enthusiastic support of the Brazilian mainstream media (often controlled by politicians), it is hard to believe that Temer will enjoy the same calm mood he should now meet in China. Judicial investigations of corruption are still ongoing and threaten Temer personally and his most direct allies, and political polarisation remains at an all-time high in Brazil.</p> <p>The impeachment of Rousseff will leave deep scars in political and institutional life. Not only will the country be headed by an artificial leadership arrangement; the new coalition comes to power imposing a radical turn to the right which was defeated in four previous elections. Law reforms are to be pushed through by the new leadership to undermine laws protecting workers and severely restricting mandatory expenditure in health and education over the next decades as the magical solution to restore global trust in the country\u2019s economy. Parliament is also on the verge of concluding a stream of measures undermining rights in critical areas such as the defence of indigenous lands and the environment, as well as threatening sexual and reproductive rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-brazil-dilma-rousseffs-downfall-wont-cure-all-her-countrys-ills\">The Guardian view on Brazil: Dilma Rousseff\u2019s downfall won\u2019t cure all her country\u2019s ills | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Brazilian crisis is not unique. Perhaps as a late consequence of the global economic debacle of 2008, mainstream political forces in all regions are now dealing with very high levels of dissatisfaction and battling strident voices and movements. In some places, this new wave is resulting in violence and serious damage to the rule of law and democracy.</p> <p>In Brazil it is clear that the combined economic and political crisis is offering a golden opportunity for an ultra-conservative alliance to regain control of power and demolish part of the legacy of the brief democratic experience. Such a dramatic ending of what was once believed to be one of the very few positive experiences of pragmatic left leadership in the global south will certainly resonate beyond its borders, particularly in Latin America. The tasks of promoting democracy and human rights in an extremely unequal society are far more complex than Brazil once made the world believe.</p>",

  "<p>Many of us have had a perfect day in the garden, the kind of day that we hope would never end. A day when the herbaceous borders burn brightly with colour, and the trees and shrubs stand green against the blue sky. A day when the grass is soft and rolling. A day when there is a warm sweetness in the air while you prune and weed and plant out seedlings. It\u2019s a kind of day that leaves you feeling calm, collected, and aware.<br></p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever had a day like this, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve achieved, at least for a few moments, a mental state known as mindfulness. In the last few years, mindfulness has had a great deal of media attention. Simply put, mindfulness is about being more aware of what is happening both inside and outside ourselves. Mindfulness stems from eastern Buddhist traditions and practices. In the west, it has been embraced and modified and is now considered a useful tool to help focus the mind. Many have found it particularly useful for mental health problems, and it is recommended for issues from anxiety to depression. Even the <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/pages/mindfulness.aspx\">NHS</a> has endorsed mindfulness. Their website states that, \u201cBecoming more aware of the present moment can help us enjoy the world around us more and understand ourselves better.\u201d There are now hundreds of books on how to become more mindful. There are classes being offered in church halls and offices. There are apps, CDs and DVDs. </p> <p>For me, the perfect activity to truly become mindful, the thing which allows me to genuinely engage with the world around me, is something I can find right outside the back door \u2013 my garden. I do practise mindfulness meditation in the classic way (eyes closed and belly breathing), and I have found it to be very useful. I\u2019ve even been known to light the cliched stick of incense or two. In short, guided meditation is good. But nothing connects me more to my surroundings than gardening. We gardeners know that on a good day, when all the plants around us are reaching toward the sky, when the soil in the vegetable beds runs richly through our hands, that we feel totally connected to the present moment. There is a calm in gardening which cannot be found anywhere else.</p> <p>My peace comes in those long days adrift in the garden. As I pot on seedlings, carefully lifting them by their new bright leaves so as not to damage their delicate stems, or saw strenuously on the branches of an overgrown privet hedge, I disappear into the act of gardening. The horizon in my mind seems to become smooth and level like the open sea. At this point I have entered what psychologists call \u201cflow\u201d: a term used to describe a person\u2019s state of mind when they are completely absorbed in an activity. The feeling of flow is closely associated with mindfulness. When I\u2019m lost in the act of gardening, few things can draw my attention. Yes, I\u2019ll stop what I\u2019m doing if my daughter asks me to play with her on the grass or if the grumbling of my stomach tells me it\u2019s time to stop and get something to eat. Family and food always come first \u2013 after that, it\u2019s the garden.</p> <p>Trite as it may sound, I feel as if all the individual threads of my mind are woven properly together by the act of gardening. We\u2019re taught in school that humans have five major senses (though in reality I\u2019m told there are many more), and if mindfulness means being fully aware of the world around you, fully engaged with your senses, then I can think of no better task than gardening to become more mindful, for what keen gardener has not closed their eyes and bent down to inhale the gentle fragrance of a flower? When I\u2019m gardening, a great point in the year is when I can begin to harvest early peas. It\u2019s always exciting to pull the first one from the vine, pop open the pod, tip my head back, and with a flick of my thumb pour a handful of sweetness into my mouth. Then there\u2019s the other senses: the dazzling sight of cherry blossom in spring or the sound of grasses dancing in an autumn breeze.</p> <p>These experiences are not the preserve of the elite; nature is all around us. My garden is no rural estate; I live in a quiet suburb attached to a larger city. My plot of land is typically narrow and long. There is nothing unique about where I garden. And that, is the beauty of gardening; it is an activity which is available to almost anyone. Most of us do not have acres of land, but around <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5811433/More-than-two-million-British-homes-without-a-garden.html\">90%</a> of British households do have access to some kind of garden. For those who do not have any outdoor space, there are allotments and community gardening schemes across the country. With a modicum effort and a decent trowel, we may all be able to find our little piece of Zen.</p> <p>Gardening and mindfulness seem like a perfect match. There are so many aspects of modern life which people seem to disconnect from \u2013 long monotone office meetings, spreadsheet filled computer screens, cramped train rides or traffic jams. Due to the stressful and fractured nature of life, people often want to be somewhere else. It doesn\u2019t need to be like this. If you want something that reconnects you to the world around you, which makes you more mindful of the present moment, than look no further than the green grass beneath your feet.

This risk is, in my view, too large to take.\u201d </p> <p>Recent developments have led to heightened concern at the fund about the drift towards economic nationalism.

Weak prospects for growth could depress investment and slow down trade, leading to even weaker demand and limiting the scope for productivity gains. \u201cAt the same time, income growth has not only been meagre, it has bypassed low-income earners in many countries, raising anxiety about globalisation and worsening the political climate for reform.\u201d</p> <p>The report said there were more downside than upside risks to its forecasts, with low inflation, China\u2019s transition to an economic model less dependent on exports and the uncertainties caused by Brexit \u2013 particularly for other European countries \u2013 singled out as specific concerns. <br></p> <p>\u201cFinancial markets have largely recovered from their lows following the United Kingdom referendum, but potential weaknesses remain in the financial sector.

Well, that\u2019s something she and Corbyn\u2019s most loyal followers can agree on, some of whom summarily responded by describing her as a \u201cfilthy liberal\u201d and other unpleasantries.</p> <p>Rowling is part of a small super-rich elite in a world where billions of people live in abject poverty. In my leftwing paradise, we wouldn\u2019t be able to say that. But then again, in my leftwing paradise, a lot of things would be different. For a start, the Labour party wouldn\u2019t be engaging in a seemingly eternal civil war while tanking in the polls, the public wouldn\u2019t have chosen to align itself with the right every time it\u2019s been asked to vote on something since 2005, and the decline of the industrial working class \u2013 and with it the traditional institutions of the left \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be happening.</p> <p>So I guess we\u2019re not living in my leftwing paradise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, brewing tensions in the Labour party have erupted into all-out war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I suspect Rowling wants things to be different too. She\u2019s used her substantial platform to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/18/jk-rowling-government-poor-people\" title=\"\">speak in favour of the welfare state</a>, drawing on her experiences of writing her first book as a single mother relying on benefits and has paid so much in tax and charitable donations that she was <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jk-rowling-is-no-longer-a-billionaire-booted-off-forbes-list-2012-3?IR=T\" title=\"\">excluded from the Forbes list</a> of billionaires in 2012. Rowling is not responsible for the vast inequalities brought about by global capitalism, and she\u2019s done a great deal more than most of the world\u2019s super-rich in trying to combat them. Her books have also been a hugely positive contribution to the world. I always remember kids in my school who struggled to read being able to identify the words \u201cHarry Potter\u201d on a page. In 2010, Shami Chakrabarti described Rowling\u2019s fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as a metaphor for the war on terror, saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful is that [Rowling] got people reading this \u2013 about intrusive surveillance and torture, but also about solidarity and resistance and great human virtues.\u201d</p> <p>In light of all of this, I would normally argue that Rowling is an ally the left cannot afford to alienate. But these are not normal times for the British left. Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, brewing tensions in the Labour party have erupted into all-out war: sides have been chosen and battles are being fought. Unlike the fight against Voldemort, however, it\u2019s not clear which Labour supporters are good and which are evil, and both sides have been guilty of unpleasant behaviour and acting in bad faith.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/this-isnt-bloody-funny-jk-rowling-laments-corbyns-strong-position\">JK Rowling laments Jeremy Corbyn's strong position: 'This isn't bloody funny'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So the row generated by Rowling\u2019s comments is best understood as a microcosm of the Labour party\u2019s general woes, rather than a random attack on a beloved children\u2019s author. The aggression towards Rowling was unwarranted and counterproductive, but she too behaved irresponsibly by identifying fairly anodyne critics to her 8 million Twitter followers, possibly subjecting them to an avalanche of abuse in return. The whole thing has played out like every other Corbyn-related spat between Labour supporters over the last few months: attempts at dialogue and respect have been drowned out by a small minority of aggressors (and believe me, these are not unique to Corbyn supporters), and those aggressors have been painted as representative by their opponents in order to discredit whatever faction they happen to be part of.</p> <p>This cycle is now so familiar to anyone following the party\u2019s predicament that it is now tedious to behold, and it begs the question: where does the left go once this whole sordid event is over and done with?</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the coup against Corbyn has been a disaster, and it robbed Labour of a unique opportunity to hold the government to account for the catastrophic EU referendum result. But once it ends \u2013 and for the love of God let that be soon \u2013 Labour members will need to figure out where to go next. And that may involve working with people they have been traducing for the last four months.</p> <p>A good first step would be to tone down the acrimony, recognise that most Labour members are acting in good faith, and that none has the perfect solution. Or, as Dumbledore put it: \u201cUnderstanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.\u201d</p>",

But they are reluctant to say so explicitly - because for a democrat to ignore the results of a popular vote is problematic, to put it mildly - and instead pro-Europeans are mostly focusing on demanding a second referendum.</p> <p>The former prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong> is as keen on staying in the EU as anyone and, in an interview with the French radio station Europe 1, he has explicitly said that Britain could stay in the EU. Public opinion could change, he argued. It is hard to think of any British pro-European politician who has been this explicit, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/brexit-is-not-inevitable-says-former-civil-service-chief\">although Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, has said something similar.</a></p> <p>You can read the Europe 1 account of the interview <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4raxat_brexit-pour-tony-blair-le-debat-continue-et-un-maintien-dans-l-ue-reste-possible_news\">here.</a> And you can watch the video <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4raxat_brexit-pour-tony-blair-le-debat-continue-et-un-maintien-dans-l-ue-reste-possible_news\">here</a> too. Blair conducted the interview in French. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from the Press Association account.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Blair said it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the UK could remain in the EU if public opinion shifted.</strong> This was not likely, he conceded. But he said there were several factors that might shift opinions, pointing to the fall in the value of sterling, damage to the financial services industry and car manufacturing and an expected reduction in foreign investment in the UK. Asked whether it was possible for opinion to shift enough to avoid Brexit he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the moment, today, it is not probable, but the debate continues and I believe it is possible.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that Remain supporters simply had to accept the result of the referendum. </strong>The British people \u201chave the right\u201d to change their minds, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Who made a rule that we have to stop the debate now?</p> </blockquote> <p>He said Theresa May had to adopt the \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d position for the sake of Conservative party unity. But he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the rest of us, we are free to have a debate.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said at the moment there was \u201cconfusion\u201d as to what Brexit actually involved.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have done something rather bizarre with Brexit. It\u2019s like moving house without having seen the new house. We have made an agreement to exchange, but we don\u2019t yet know the terms of Brexit, we don\u2019t know the costs and the consequences.</p> <p>There will come a moment when we have had the negotiations and we can see the terms we are being offered by the rest of Europe and we will be able to say that it is a good idea or perhaps that it is a bad idea with major consequences.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c8261ee4b09a68e9b64c7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T13:01:34.323Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more from the Corbyn rally in Stoke.</p> <p>From the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelPDeacon/status/771312887222636544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Corbyn rally in Stoke.

She has written <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/kerry-mccarthy/defra-badger-cull-pmqs_b_11705704.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\">a long article for Huffington Post</a> about the experience of serving in his shadow cabinet.</p> <p>It does not contain any shock, horror revelations. But McCarthy provides a string of anecdotes that call into question Corbyn\u2019s efficiency or competence, and collectively their impact is quite strong.</p> <p>Here are some of the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McCarthy says Corbyn failed to show leadership in shadow cabinet.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My concern steadily grew over what I was hearing from colleagues, such as Heidi, Thangam and Lilian, and what I was seeing at shadow cabinet meetings, where Jeremy tended to read from a prepared script, didn\u2019t respond to our questions, and didn\u2019t convey any sense of strategic direction or leadership.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says Corbyn could not admit that he backed big business.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Again at PLP, Emma Reynolds asked Jeremy if he \u201csupported big businesses like Jaguar Land Rover who employ thousands of people in my constituency\u201d. His answer was \u201cof course I\u2019m aware that big businesses exist and I\u2019m also aware that many of them don\u2019t pay their taxes\u201d. He simply couldn\u2019t bring himself to express support.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says that Corbyn had a \u201clack of grasp\u201d when it came to detail and sometimes said the wrong thing. </strong>She cites at least three examples. Here is one on badgers:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy also accused the government of \u201cgassing badgers\u201d. Months earlier I\u2019d asked him to reaffirm Labour\u2019s opposition to the cull when he got a chance, as people had, somewhat unfairly, been accusing him of going quiet on what he\u2019d said during the 2015 leadership campaign. We hadn\u2019t heard anything since, and were a little surprised to hear him bring it up during the EU campaign. The cull is actually about shooting badgers, not gassing them - gassing was outlawed in 1982 - so that was a bit of a \u2018head in hands\u2019 moment in my office, but no-one else seemed to notice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is another.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At one PLP meeting Jeremy started talking about how vulnerable people \u201cwere being forced to borrow money from hedge funds\u201d. Angela Eagle and I caught each other\u2019s eye. Did he really not know the difference between loan sharks and hedge funds? </p> </blockquote> <p>But McCarthy seems particularly concerned by Corbyn\u2019s errors over Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy came in for a lot of criticism for saying on June 24th that Article 50 should be triggered \u201cnow\u201d. At the PLP hustings a few weeks later he showed he still hadn\u2019t got his head round the process, responding to a question from Meg Hillier by saying \u201cwe have two years in which to trigger Article 50\u201d. But the two years comes after Article 50 is triggered. It\u2019s how long we have before we actually have to leave the EU. That lack of grasp, when he\u2019d presumably been prepping for such a question, bothers me.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says that the shadow environment team had just one meeting with Corbyn in her nine months in the job. </strong>At the meeting she raised various issues, but Corbyn had just two requests; that she look at agricultural colleges and market gardens. Otherwise she was not given any \u201csteer\u201d as to what she should do, she says.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She says Corbyn\u2019s office did not consult her when they did intervene on environment issues.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the leader\u2019s office did venture into Defra territory, they didn\u2019t talk to the shadow team. We weren\u2019t consulted before Jeremy made his call for the pumps in Bridgwater, Somerset to be moved up to the flood-hit areas of the North, which he later had to backtrack on. And we weren\u2019t asked for our input before Jeremy led on air pollution at PMQs: an issue we\u2019d been doing a lot of work on, challenging government complacency and inaction in the context of the Client Earth court case and the Volkswagen scandal.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says Corbyn\u2019s office was disorganised.</strong> On one occasion she tried unsuccessfully for months to get Corbyn\u2019s office to commit to a visit that Corbyn said he wanted to make. She also spent months trying to set up a meeting with Corbyn with environmental groups. And in some cases it took months for letters to be passed on that needed a reply. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>His office was clearly under-staffed and in a bit of a muddle.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb825ca2f3f2ebc7a972bcb5ed8d1126677dc813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb825ca2f3f2ebc7a972bcb5ed8d1126677dc813/94_77_5399_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry McCarthy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kerry McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinendra Haria/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:16:39.845Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c80db5e4b06b4ac17488f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T11:33:25.207Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Working-class applicants 'missing out on City jobs because of dress code'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The<strong> social mobility commission</strong> has published<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549387/Socio-economic_diversity_in_life_sciences_and_investment_banking.pdf\"> a report (pdf)</a> today saying young people who do not come from privileged backgrounds are being excluded from City jobs because they don\u2019t conform.

But Labour was defeated, Balls lost his seat, and today his principal contribution to national life is as a contestant on Strictly. Still, on a relatively quiet day, he\u2019s worth a mention on the Politics Live blog. He has got a memoir to plug, and extracts have already appeared in the Times. He had more to say this morning in an interview with Nick Robinson on the Today programme. Here are the key points. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Balls said it was a \u201cdelusion\u201d to think that Labour lost the 2015 general election because it was not leftwing enough.</strong> Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have consistently argued that Labour lost because it was not radical enough. But Balls described this as \u201cnonsense\u201d.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a great delusion, in a constituency like mine, to think that people who voted Liberal Democrat in 2010 and went to the Conservatives in 2015 did so because they thought Labour was not radical enough. In the end it was a matter of trust on the economy, and whether we would spend the money wisely ... The idea [Labour lost] because we weren\u2019t leftwing enough I\u2019m afraid is just a nonsense.</p> </blockquote> <p>He was also asked to explain <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/08/ed-balls-brandishes-corbyns-labour-a-leftist-utopian-fantasy/\">the claim in his memoir, Speaking Out, that Corbyn indulges in \u201cleftist utopian fantasy\u201d.</a> Balls told Today\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was making a broader point than just about Jeremy. I was talking about what we are seeing in America in Bernie Sanders, and with Donald Trump - an issue of left and right - and saying it is a complex, difficult world, in which populations are angry, incomes have not risen, people are worried about identity, the globalisation of labour, and there is a tendency for some to peddle a simple solution and say \u2018We can just solve the problem, it\u2019s all the fault of the bankers, or immigrants, or a neoliberal conspiracy, or welfare scroungers\u2019. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Balls said it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Labour MPs opposed to Corbyn to form an independent group in the House of Commons if Corbyn is re-elected leader.</strong> Some MPs have reportedly being considering this option, as an alternative to setting up a completely new party. But Balls said that would be a \u201cterrible thing to do\u201d. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My advice would be that would be a disastrous thing to do. I think one of the messages of my book is that to walk away from challenges is a mistake. </p> </blockquote> <p>Setting up a separate group in the Commons would be a particular mistake because Labour could be facing an early election, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested that his relationship with Ed Miliband during the 2015 general election was even worse than Tony Blair\u2019s famously dysfunctional relationship with Gordon Brown.</strong> In his book,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/ed-balls-labour-did-not-deserve-to-win-election-ed-miliband\"> as the extracts published already have revealed, </a>Balls says he only spoke to Miliband about twice during the election campaign. Asked about this he told Today:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would have preferred it if it had been more. I would rather have been on the inside of that strategy ... In the era of Brown and Blair, even when their relationship had become difficult, when it came to elections, everybody came together and they were speaking once, more than once, a day. That was not the case in our election campaign.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was \u201cpretty unlikely\u201d that he would return to politics - but he did not rule it out.</strong> He also said it was a mistake for MPs who lost their seats to try to come \u201cstraight back\u201d - implying that returning to the Commons after a break would be much wiser.

  "<h2>Yours sincerely, wasting away</h2> <p>What is Stage 2? A new development of luxury apartments built on the site of the Washington Plant and ideal for a young family? The level you access only after you\u2019ve beaten the big bad of E Corp in hand-to-hand combat? A situation that only occurs once a disease has truly suppressed the immune system?</p> <p>Whatever it is, Stage 2 is Elliot\u2019s idea. We know this because he hacked the phone of Xun, a Dark Army lieutenant, who told us as much. Darlene was monitoring the calls, and so became the first to know. This puts her in a sticky position, not just because her brother might be working in the interests of the Chinese government, but also because she beat her lover up with a baseball bat thinking it was he who knew all about Stage 2.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbae6558a04a95facc93bf80aea7543131e7be54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbae6558a04a95facc93bf80aea7543131e7be54/59_0_1212_727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot\u2019s Dissociative Identity Disorder has got to the point where nothing makes sense any more.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elliot\u2019s Dissociative Identity Disorder has got to the point where nothing makes sense any more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elliot, for his part, would seem unlikely to be as surprised as his sister by the news. Not because he remembers what Stage 2 is \u2013 he does not \u2013 but because his Dissociative Identity Disorder has deteriorated to the point where very little makes sense any more. This week, Elliot has three out-of-body experiences, where he watches himself \u2013 as Mr Robot \u2013 from a distance. Also, and just as unusually, he actually shouts at someone (Xun, when he meets him in person). As Elliot consciously tries to take on more qualities of Mr Robot \u2013 assertiveness, determination \u2013 \u201cElliot\u201d is being subconsciously pushed to one side. And yet \u2026 his encounter with his mother, where he asserted himself upon a mute party, suggested a non-chaotic alternative for our hero. He used an idea of his mother to keep himself sane in prison. Maybe he will gird himself again in battles to come.</p> <p>[As a sidenote, I enjoyed the introductory sequence of Elliot\u2019s prison compadres in their actual environment. As suspected, Ray was the governor.]</p> <h2>Will you still need me, will you still feed me \u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4784e53a98f805eb6a32b34c82e67d3679dfa15f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4784e53a98f805eb6a32b34c82e67d3679dfa15f/0_0_1215_729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That darned dog!

Elliot in the prison yard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several plot twists this week. We know why Elliot went to prison (that darned dog!). We know that Mrs Wellick has worked out who Elliot is. Dom DiPierro, meanwhile, could turn out to be Angela\u2019s best ally, while there\u2019s something going on in Sharon Knowles\u2019s apartment. But for all the plotting, the psychology of the characters remains the most compelling aspect of this excellent drama.</p> <p>Elliot\u2019s may be the most complex, but watching Phillip Price at work is always gripping. The CEO of Evil Corp is the greatest villain in Mr Robot, mainly because we don\u2019t know the depths to which he is prepared to sink. This week he faces off against Whiterose, his main rival in perfidy. Rose, who is both queen hacker and Chinese minister of state, reveals that she killed the last CEO of Evil Corp (and then, for effect, actually pisses on his grave). Such behaviour doesn\u2019t cut much ice with Price. \u201cI\u2019m a mercenary,\u201d he informs Whiterose. \u201cI do what I want. Order will not protect you any more, I will rain chaos, even if it hurts me. Because I would rather see you lose than win myself.\u201d That\u2019s some baddie talk right there.</p> <p>It\u2019s a standoff. Price needs a bailout to refloat Evil Corp, while Whiterose can\u2019t afford for the Washington Plant to close. Price asks Whiterose to get the Chinese government to step in, which may be humiliating for him. That said, his position is not as sticky as his opponent, who may threaten all he likes but can\u2019t afford to see Evil Corp go bust.</p> <p>Unless I\u2019ve missed a vital scene (it has been known), we have no idea what the pair\u2019s ultimate motives are. Price, after all, appears to be complicit in the hack that brought his company low in the first place. What Whiterose wants with all that leaky nuclear material is unclear too (though maybe one could have a guess at something military). I suspect we will learn more next week.</p> <h2>Indicate precisely what you mean to say</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b862b9c5bab5f9340c1dde2b0f9a1961994d486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b862b9c5bab5f9340c1dde2b0f9a1961994d486/171_0_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A quick learner on e-sabotage \u2026 Angela.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A quick learner of e-sabotage \u2026 Angela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Angela turns out to have been a quick learner when it comes to electronic sabotage. She used her rubber ducky again, this time to hack into Evil Corp and get all the files on the Washington Plant. She wasn\u2019t even nearly caught this time neither, as the one old doofus to stumble upon her couldn\u2019t tell one woman from another and mistook Angela for a secretary.</p> <p>Far less sophisticated was her subsequent willingness to share what she\u2019d found with a federal body, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Surely if there\u2019s one thing she\u2019s learned from her time inside a massive conspiracy, it\u2019s that it\u2019s best to trust no one. Anyway, she may have to trust again after Dom played her hand. She knows a lot of what Angela has been up to, and suspects the rest, but she knows not to trust her superiors after the Chinese shootout and so might be able to offer Angela the kind of arrangement she needs. As she says to her: \u201cYou\u2019ve got one hand left to play and it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <h2>Order v chaos rating: 8</h2> <p>So Big Phil declared war on order (thus subscribing to Elliot\u2019s \u201ccontrol is an illusion\u201d mantra). But a more visible assault on everyday life is the arrival of electricity \u201cbrownouts\u201d. With the economy floundering, electricity providers are struggling to generate enough power to meet demand. As a result everyone\u2019s lighting is dipping to a moody shade of \u201ccyber yellow\u201d (yes, that\u2019s a real thing). Also, credit cards don\u2019t work any more. And if that isn\u2019t anarchy I don\u2019t know what is.</p> <h2>Self-assault index</h2> <p>Well the two aspects of Elliot\u2019s personality are being pulled apart rather than pushed together. But this may yet may be more destructive. After all, had Mr Robot not been on the other side of the video signal at a closed circuit court hearing, Elliot might not have gone to prison in the first place.</p> <h2>Questions</h2> <p>You know, what is Stage 2? Why did the Chinese shootout affect the bail-out? What\u2019s in Susan Jacobs\u2019s apartment? And where is Tyrell Wellick?</p>",
  "<p>Graduates with first-class degrees from elite universities are being \u201clocked out\u201d from jobs in investment banking if they commit the crime of wearing brown shoes, look uncomfortable in a suit, or have the wrong \u201cpolish\u201d or \u201caura\u201d, according to a new study into social exclusion.<br></p> <p>The exclusion process is even more brutal for non-privileged candidates from non-elite universities and schools, found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/socio-economic-diversity-in-life-sciences-and-investment-banking\">the report by the Social Mobility Commission</a>, which uncovers a world where, according to one interviewee: \u201cThere are some areas in the bank \u2026 where the concept of diversity is about taking a different year group from Eton or from Harrow; if some of the departments are really ambitious they might include St Paul\u2019s and Westminster school.\u201d</p> <p> In its report, Socio-Economic Diversity in Life Sciences and Investment Banking, published on Thursday, the commission, chaired by former minister Alan Milburn, reveals that the mainstream recruitment and selection processes of investment banks has \u201cset up barriers for individuals from non-privileged backgrounds\u201d. </p> <p> By \u201cnon-privileged\u201d, however, the report aims high, by defining \u201cprivilege\u201d as having rich and important parents who could be useful to the banks, going to a select few private schools \u2013 and an even more select few universities \u2013 having completed three or four periods of unpaid work experience by the age of 17, and social skills honed by attending drinks and dinner parties from an early age with their parents.</p> <p> \u201cIt is important to note again that these processes are becoming more pronounced within the sector,\u201d noted the report. \u201cBanks acting alone may be reluctant to reverse this trend for fear of their competitors capturing all the \u2018best\u2019 candidates at an early stage.\u201d</p> <p> Preparing for a successful career in banking starts early, the report found. Candidates for front-office roles in banks must have scored 520 points in the old A-level tariff, equivalent to two A* and two As. </p> <p> \u201cStudents who achieve strong grades at a target university but have performed less well at school, may be automatically eliminated during rigid pre-screening,\u201d the report notes. Applications from these students will not even be read by banks, even if the student is on track for a first-class degree. </p> <p> While achieving these A-level results, students must also be able to show a variety and often extensive list of extracurricular activities on their CV, including leading societies and sporting clubs. </p> <p> From school, candidates must attend the very narrow group of universities in the UK from which investment banks prefer to select, including London School of Economics (LSE), University College London (UCL), Imperial College London, and Oxford, Cambridge and Warwick Universities.</p> <p> Just 7% of all UK children attend fee-paying schools but 34% of new entrants to the banking sector who were educated in the UK had attended a fee-paying school, rising to almost 70% of new entrants in private equity. More than 50% of current leaders within the banking sector who are from the UK were educated privately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/fixing-wealth-inequality-future-generations-will-think-us-mad-and-they-will-be-right\">Fixing wealth inequality: future generations will think us mad, and they will be right | Wayne Swan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oxbridge entrants to the City are more likely to be privately educated than Oxbridge graduates who go elsewhere: 42% of all Oxbridge graduates went to private schools but 65% of Oxbridge entrants to the banking sector went to private school. </p> <p>During their time at the university, aspiring bankers are expected to continue expanding their CVs with extracurricular activities. These requirements have, the report says, \u201carguably contributed to a relative \u2018arms race\u2019 as, faced with increasing competition and an ever increasing need to stand out, aspirant bankers engage in increasingly focused efforts to build their CV\u201d. </p> <p>The report says that \u201cin other careers, university might provide the environment in which students from non-privileged backgrounds can identify and refine their career aspirations, ready to apply to internships during their second year. Yet for investment banks, students from non-privileged backgrounds who apply at this point may be competing against others who have already added several internships, Spring Week programmes, and/or insight days to their CV.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb619d38cb45a7bf101f0aab9914d4e59228a306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb619d38cb45a7bf101f0aab9914d4e59228a306/0_186_3700_2221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eton public school boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eton College pupils.

They do two, or three, or four\u201d This requirement is becoming more pronounced.</p> <p>But these periods of work experience and internships, which may lead to permanent jobs, are frequently offered to individuals whose friends and family are of strategic importance to the bank, including in relation to the expansion of their business on a global basis. </p> <p>One interviewee said: \u201cIt\u2019s not nepotism the way we actually think about it. It\u2019s actually very calculated, profit-motivated, rational thinking.\u201d </p> <p>Internships, however, are not for learning the ropes: they are for climbing into already formed networks. \u201cIt is possible to build networks during internships [but] existing social networks may also play a role as interns seek to build internal networks within the bank and secure all-important \u2018face-time\u2019 with influential senior bankers \u2026 [while] impress[ing] a sufficient number [of current traders] who would act as referees for a permanent position,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Even for candidates who get this far, there is another hurdle to scale: that of \u201ccomportment\u201d. This, the report notes, are opaque modes of speech, accent, dress and behaviour which are \u201cactively sought by hiring managers during the selection process\u201d and which, a senior member of the profession revealed, are best learned alongside one\u2019s parents while at school, at dinner and drinks parties. </p> <p>These attributes, the report adds, are undefinable \u2013 and therefore, unachieveable for the non-privileged \u2013 but can be described as a \u201cpolish\u201d or \u201can aura\u201d. Not having that \u201caura\u201d can be exposed, said one interviewee, by a candidate simply \u201cnot saying much or if they do say it, they\u2019re not quite saying it the right way\u201d. Another interviewee added: \u201cPeople without this polish will be just be crushed underfoot.\u201d</p> <p> These opaque codes of conduct also extend to dress. For men, the report found, wearing brown shoes with a business suit is generally considered unacceptable. Unless you come from continental Europe. </p> <p>\u201cInterviewees suggested that [these issues] do play a material role in the selection process, once again, as a demonstration of [a candidate\u2019s] \u2018fit\u2019 [inside the bank],\u201d said the report. </p> <p>One interviewee said it was easy to spot candidates from non-privileged backgrounds: \u201cFrom my experience [they] \u2026 don\u2019t have a haircut \u2026 their suit\u2019s always too big \u2026 they don\u2019t know which tie to wear,\u201d they said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b5301c37060d5394a3da709405692a9c105f2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b5301c37060d5394a3da709405692a9c105f2c/0_0_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shirt and black tie (or blue tie)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wrong tie could put off potential employers, according to one interviewee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Tooth/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another interviewee, from a non-privileged background, described feedback he received from a mentor after an interview: \u201cHe said: \u2018You interviewed really well.\u2019 He said: \u2018You\u2019re clearly quite sharp, but \u2026 you\u2019re not quite the fit for [this bank] \u2026 you\u2019re not polished enough\u2019 \u2026 he looked at me and said: \u2019See that tie you\u2019re wearing? It\u2019s too loud. Like you can\u2019t wear that tie with the suit that you\u2019re wearing\u2019 \u2026 what kind of industry is this where I can be told that I\u2019m a good candidate, I\u2019m sharp, but I\u2019m not polished enough?\u201d</p> <p>Another interviewee agreed: \u201c[In corporate finance] if you\u2019ve got the wrong cut of suit, if you are wearing the wrong shoes, or tie, or you look awkward in a suit, you\u2019re done before you start.

  "<p>Christiane Heinicke showered about once a month. That\u2019s 12 showers over the course of a whole year, while living with five others in a 36ft-wide dome in Hawaii to simulate life on Mars.</p> <p>\u201cWe took the water conservation very seriously and used paper towels with Febreze if we were really rank,\u201d said fellow crew member Tristan Bassingthwaighte. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of those things where if you\u2019re in a really smelly place, after the first week you don\u2019t notice anything any more because there\u2019s no new stimulus, much in the same way that you can\u2019t see your nose unless you think about it, even though it\u2019s right there.\u201d</p> <p>In between showers, Heinicke washed with a bucket of water. \u201cIt was actually quite effective,\u201d she said this week, just a few days after the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/28/mars-scientists-nasa-dome-hawaii-mountain-isolation\">left the dome</a>. \u201cI never felt dirty or greasy and certainly nobody ever complained about me smelling.\u201d</p> <p>For 12 months, they lived together inside a white dome planted on the side of the mountain Mauna Loa. The experiment studied the feasibility of life on Mars, and was the longest Hawaii Space Exploration Analogue and Simulation (HI-Seas) experiment to date. </p> <p>During this Nasa-funded project, the crew\u2019s communication with the outside world was limited, and they experienced a 20-minute one-way delay, similar to the limitations one would experience on Mars. The restrictions made it difficult to maintain ties with the outside world, and several crew members said they felt forgotten after the first few months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"408c0ff358504092a67d7be0ac3f6ddf6eed8dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/408c0ff358504092a67d7be0ac3f6ddf6eed8dc4/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"The crew for the 12-month Mars simulation in Hawaii.\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The crew for the 12-month Mars simulation in Hawaii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christiane Heinicke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the isolation and smells were the least of their worries.</p> <p>\u201cThe confinement was far worse,\u201d Bassingthwaighte said. \u201cIsolation is a reprieve.\u201d The constant thumping of duct-taped shoes against a treadmill served as a constant reminder that in such a small space, he was never truly alone. </p> <p>\u201cThe walls are thin, the floor is loud, and you can hear nearly everything,\u201d crew commander Carmel Johnston noted in <a href=\"https://snowballschanceonmars.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/10-steps-to-surviving-on-smars/\">one blogpost</a>. \u201cNo matter how quiet somebody tries to be, it sounds like elephants taking dance lessons.\u201d</p> <p>As an architecture PhD candidate, Bassingthwaighte noted that some features, like the living room\u2019s tall, church-like ceiling, helped the crew cope by creating the illusion of space. But other features, including the room placement and thin walls, proved to exacerbate an already challenging situation.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, the design was very mission-centric, not people-centric,\u201d he observed.</p> <p>Bassingthwaighte often wore headphones to drown out the sounds. But even then, he found himself waiting for the inevitable knock on his door \u2013 another crew member with a question or anecdote. The constant knowledge that interruption could be moments away kept him on high social alert. </p> <p>The crew\u2019s only escape was through simulated Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). During these mock Mars excursions, crew members donned spacesuits and traversed the surface of the surrounding lava fields, studying various rocks and exploring lava tubes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/29/scientists-complete-year-long-mars-simulation-in-hawaii-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xtep\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2690413\"            data-video-name=\"Scientists complete year-long Mars simulation in Hawaii \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c3a0cce4b0396caaf99ed3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/29/160829marsmission_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/29/160829marsmission.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/29/160829marsmission_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/29/scientists-complete-year-long-mars-simulation-in-hawaii-video\">Scientists complete year-long Mars simulation in Hawaii</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For German crew physicist Heinicke, these missions saved her sanity. \u201cThey were very important to me. First from a physical perspective, just being able to walk in a straight line. But also emotionally, to be in a different place, and to get away from others.\u201d</p> <p>According to the HI-Seas website, group cohesion and composition was a primary focus of the study, with the ultimate goal of identifying which traits compose a highly effective team. While scientists continue to analyze the data, crew members have formulated their own opinions based on the experience.</p> <p>Bassingthwaighte said that \u201cfor a successful group, you need a balanced mix of extroversion and introversion. You need to be extroverted in a sense, because if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re going to end up excluding yourself from group activities and relationships that over a long duration are going to become necessary. </p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cif you\u2019re an extrovert all the time, then everybody around you is going to want to stuff a sock in your mouth.\u201d </p> <p>Heinicke said that adaptability was crucial: \u201cYou have to be open to new experiences, because nothing can prepare you for life in the dome.\u201d</p> <p>Like composting toilets that were always over capacity. </p> <p>Once a week, a crew member took a turn donning a paper apron and gloves and digging 20lb of accumulated excrement out of the toilet. The reward for scooping the poop: an extra long shower \u2013 three minutes.</p> <p>(On average, showers for most crew members were one minute and 45 seconds, once per week.)</p> <p>These weekly routines became one of the only ways for crew members to maintain any sense of time. In a <a href=\"https://walking-on-red-dust.com/2016/04/05/hazy-time/\">blogpost</a>, crew astrobiologist Cyprien Verseux coined the term \u201chazy time\u201d to describe an inability to differentiate between the seemingly identical days that strung together.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all kind of a big crazy blur right now,\u201d said Bassingthwaighte. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a moment to myself in 370 days now, and what I need more than anything is two days to sit down and just be left alone by the universe so I can start to organize my brain.\u201d</p> <p>Back on \u201cEarth\u201d, the crew are already beginning to formulate plans to use their experience to further their work within their respective fields. Heinicke plans to submit a research proposal on space habitats, and is a potential candidate to be the first female German astronaut.</p> <p>As for Bassingthwaighte, he will return to finish his PhD in architecture and hopes to use his experience in the dome to help design the future Mars Colonial transporter.</p>",

  "<p>Lady Leshurr has just come back from the US. She has been spending a&#xa0;lot of time there this year, she says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Atlanta, LA, New Orleans, Miami, New York.\u201d She played a sold-out gig in the latter, the audience\u2019s enthusiasm apparently undimmed by the fact that she raps with a distinct Brummie twang: \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to understand me, didn\u2019t think my accent, of all accents, would have crossed over like that. But they were singing my lyrics back at me. It was hilarious, hearing people with American accents saying \u2018bredrin\u2019 and \u2018wasteman\u2019, all that British urban slang.\u201d</p> <p>But mostly, she\u2019s been working on her debut album. \u201cWorking with a producer called Deputy, who made Rihanna\u2019s Bitch Better Have My Money; Bangladesh, he made Lil\u2019 Wayne\u2019s A Milli, and Diva and Video Phone for Beyonc\u00e9. I\u2019ve got a&#xa0;session with Scott Storch, he\u2019s coming back now as well. And you know Timbaland?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/31/best-music-autumn-2016-bjork-david-bowie-pink-floyd-saint-etienne-autumn-arts-preview\">It's oh so cultural: the sharpest sounds of autumn 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Timbaland, the celebrated, groundbreaking producer of Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake and Beyonc\u00e9? The visionary auteur behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/may/14/timbaland-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">more than 100 hit singles on both sides of the Atlantic</a>? I\u2019m aware of his work, yes.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been doing a few bits with Timbaland. Timbaland is amazing. He just rang me up on my mobile one day.\u201d The girl born Melesha O\u2019Garro giggles. \u201cI\u2019m just working with a few legendary producers.\u201d</p> <p>Here, should you want it, is empirical evidence of UK rap\u2019s sudden ascent to prominence in the US, a country traditionally resistant to the charms of the British MC, and, moreover, of the fact that a lot of people think Lady Leshurr is about to become very famous indeed. In fact, she\u2019s already famous \u2013 over the course of our interview outside of a north London wine bar, she\u2019s interrupted not once, not twice, but three times by fans. Her fame is largely thanks to a series of five freestyles called The Queen\u2019s Speech, which she released herself on iTunes and uploaded to YouTube, accompanied by low-budget videos, becoming a viral sensation. Last August\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyodeHtVvkA\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s Speech 4</a> racked up a fairly staggering 31m views.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yyZBLvLDFE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9yyZBLvLDFE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Their lyrics were both dextrous and extremely funny, a blur of highly original put-downs \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll upload a picture of your dog and sell it on Gumtree\u201d \u2013 and pop-culture references; they also frequently came equipped with the kind of hooklines you can imagine being chanted in playgrounds: \u201cThat\u2019s nasty, change your panties\u201d, \u201cBrush your teeth\u201d, \u201cYour lips look like crispy bacon\u201d. Moreover, they seem to have attracted a different audience compared with other UK rappers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen videos of 60-year-old women and men in America saying \u2018Brush your teeth\u2019 and stuff, videos of a little baby watching it and laughing, do you know what I mean? I get parents saying to me: \u2018Wow, you\u2019re the only artist I let my kids listen to,\u2019 because I don\u2019t swear in my lyrics. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. My mum brought me up really well, I&#xa0;don\u2019t swear unless I\u2019m really, really angry.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s too cool, everyone wants to be drinking alcohol in their videos and driving flash cars, wearing big chains. I&#xa0;don\u2019t want to do that, because I don\u2019t live that. All my music, you\u2019ll never see me with my breasts hanging out or showing so much flesh that you can\u2019t show it to your kids or things like that. Because, one, I respect myself as a person; two, I want to make people understand that you don\u2019t have to go that route to be successful. If you\u2019ve got the talent, let the talent talk. Look at what I\u2019m wearing afterwards, if you have to, but listen to me first, do you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>In person, Lady Leshurr is charismatic and funny and smart. You can see why her new major record label \u2013 she\u2019s signed to Sony\u2019s RCA imprint \u2013 might think she\u2019s a hot prospect; in the past 12 months, she has gone from a hugely productive one-woman cottage industry, of the kind that\u2019s fuelled grime\u2019s commercial resurgence in Britain, to an artist that Timbaland and co are queuing up to work with. \u201cAll these major established artists reaching out,\u201d she frowns. \u201cI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/05/akon-charities-africa-lighting-energy-access\" title=\"\">had people like Akon</a> calling my phone. Busta Rhymes. I\u2019ve no idea how he even got my number. Young Money Records tried to reach out to sign me.\u201d She laughs again. \u201cI\u2019m saying it all like it\u2019s so casual, but it\u2019s just because I don\u2019t really let things excite me like that. I try to be calm with it. I\u2019m not like: \u2018Oh my God, oh my God.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s something to do with the fact that she\u2019s been here, or at least somewhere like it, before. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/20/lady-leshurr-interview-blazin-video\" title=\"\">When the Observer profiled her</a>, in 2013, her career appeared to be about to blast off: a major label had offered her a deal, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m7ur5jeqeY\" title=\"\">her single Blazin\u2019</a> had just deposed Justin Timberlake from No&#xa0;1 on the MTV Base chart, she was talking about launching a clothing line, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq_HHnEe1oY&amp;list=PLxlY4t6rUn9FY_2WYVbl0qqYl9kknSO3-\" title=\"\">Friggin\u2019 L</a>, winningly named after one of her mixtapes. But then everything went wrong, of which more later.</p> <p>Or perhaps it\u2019s something to do with her background, which is substantially grimmer than the bubbly image she projects suggests. Before she became a rapper, she says, she started out writing poetry \u201cbecause I wanted to express myself. I grew up in a very strict family. My father was very strict, very violent: he had been brought up in a violent background and it\u2019s probably just a cycle. But I think that was the push to try and express myself in another way. I couldn\u2019t really express myself to him or anybody else. I was very shy, always looked down, I\u2019d never have any eye contact with people, so I&#xa0;put all that into poetry, writing down my frustration, what I felt and what I\u2019d seen, or stuff written from my mum\u2019s view, as if I was my mother. I started thinking, \u2018You know what? Why don\u2019t I&#xa0;just rap?\u2019 Because it\u2019s just poetry with a beat behind it, really.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLFd6xaRLN0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WLFd6xaRLN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>She learnt to \u201crap, produce, mix, master, everything\u201d at a youth club across the road from her home in Solihull. \u201cWe would all be in one room with the mic, someone would be DJing, the lights would be off, it\u2019d just be sweaty, loads of men. No other girls at all. At first, they were like: \u2018She\u2019s good for a girl\u2019, or \u2018Ah, she\u2019s sick because there\u2019s no other girls about\u2019 \u2013 there was always an excuse. So I thought: Fine, I\u2019m going to show you that I\u2019m better than the next man, not \u2018good for a female\u2019. So it pushed me to work hard, to write the best.\u201d</p> <p>She produced her first mixtape at 14: \u201cI had no idea how to promote, or how to get my things in shops, so I just used to leave CDs on the bus when I was on my way to school. I\u2019d hand them out to strangers, leave them on park benches, anywhere I thought people might see them and pick them up.\u201d</p> <p>Amazingly, it was a strategy that worked. Someone uploaded its contents to a website \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t even remember what it was called, but it was big for UK artists at the time and it got loads of hits\u201d \u2013 but her burgeoning career was still hampered by her home life. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed out of my area. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go anywhere my friends were allowed to go to. I was always told by my father: \u2018No, you\u2019re not allowed to do this; no, you\u2019re not going to make it.\u2019 There was a time when he sat all the brothers and sisters down in a room and he wrote down job professions and he put them in a hat and whatever we picked out, we had to be. So all my sisters are like nurses, carers, my brothers are carpenters, mechanics, but I wouldn\u2019t do it. I knew that if I picked what was in that hat, I\u2019d have to start studying for it. Me and one brother who\u2019s now a footballer were the only ones stood up to him. It caused a whole heap of madness, and I just ran away for a couple of hours. He wasn\u2019t there when I got back, and from that point, I was just trying to dodge him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce849bfebea7cf6908e52516637287ae9d991680\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce849bfebea7cf6908e52516637287ae9d991680/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Leshurr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She left home after landing a role in a local film called One Day by rapping for the director. The film was withdrawn from cinemas \u2013 \u201cIt was about gangs in Birmingham and when they showed it in Birmingham both gangs turned up to the cinema and people got stabbed and stuff\u201d \u2013 but it brought her to the attention of \u201cWiley and Kano and Ghetts, all these people I\u2019d grown up listening to ... I didn\u2019t tell my parents I was moving to London. I just packed one suitcase, I left and I never went back. I think I told my mum I&#xa0;was going on a trip with the college or&#xa0;something.\u201d</p> <p>Her real break came when she uploaded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N-2G917g-E\" title=\"\">a syllable-perfect parody video of Chris Brown and Busta Rhymes\u2019s Look At Me Now</a> to YouTube: it got 100,000 views in half a day, and Atlantic Records in the US offered her a deal. \u201cThey flew me out and we had a conversation, but their idea was that they were going to pit me against Nicki Minaj. It was like: \u2018She\u2019s the biggest female MC and you need to take her down,\u2019 and I wasn\u2019t feeling that at all. That whole stereotype of female rappers and their supporters having to compete with each other \u2013 it seems to be a crime to be a fan of two female rappers that are successful. So I turned it down. The amount of money they were offering me was amazing. I\u2019ve always turned to music to get my mum out of the house, out of that situation, so to see that type of money thrown at me ... I\u2019m not going to lie, I cried on the plane home, because I thought I\u2019d made a mistake and my mum needed the money. It might have been my only chance. But I know by now I would probably have been dropped and my career would have been ruined.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the UK, she elected to put her career on hold for a year. \u201cI was going through a lot myself, personally. I was living on couches, living out of bags and boxes, sometimes I wouldn\u2019t even know where I was sleeping the next day. And then I went through a situation where someone completely tried to destroy my career, someone I thought was a friend, who deleted all my social networks. So I had to start again, basically. So I was like: \u2018You know what? I\u2019m starting again as a brand new artist if you\u2019re going to do that.\u2019 I&#xa0;thought: I grew up on Missy, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, they had all those funny, rewatchable videos with crazy visuals and I think that\u2019s what was and still is missing in the scene. Humour was definitely something I thought would work, I thought it would be different if I brought that to the scene, with the beats I\u2019m using, which I&#xa0;co-produce. I wouldn\u2019t quite call them grime, they\u2019re a bit slower, people say they\u2019re a bit trap. I just wanted to create something new and fresh.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N-2G917g-E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-N-2G917g-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It was a plan that has clearly worked beyond her wildest dreams, although she says she\u2019s keen not to be seen as just \u201ca funny person ... The album\u2019s going to do the talking, because everyone\u2019s thinking this is all I do, the funny stuff, and the album\u2019s going to show that it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>The album isn\u2019t the only thing on her mind at the moment. She\u2019s still thinking about a clothing line, although, alas, the Friggin\u2019 L name has been retired. She\u2019s talking about going back into acting. She\u2019s starting work on her own sketch show, starring a selection of alter-egos she created on Snapchat. Whatever happens, she says, she has already managed to achieve her dream: with the money she made from The Queen\u2019s Speech\u2019s iTunes sales and YouTube hits, she\u2019s buying her mum a house. \u201cI just kept setting money aside, and it\u2019s all still in the process at the moment. You know how mortgages are. But I\u2019m eventually going to take her there, and it\u2019s going to have a massive bow on it, and I\u2019m going to pretend it\u2019s my house that I\u2019ve bought in Birmingham and then tell her it\u2019s hers. She has no idea.\u201d Unless she reads this, of course.</p> <p>She drains her glass of fizzy wine. \u201cSo much has happened just because of uploading a couple of videos, you know. I\u2019ve had all these offers and artists reaching out, I\u2019ve got to fly around the world and experiment with things I\u2019ve never tried before. I\u2019ve got half a million subscribers on my YouTube channel, I\u2019ve got my own machine. So, that\u2019s basically made me realise: I\u2019m on the up.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Thirteen years ago, when Babalwa Mbono was eight months pregnant with her second child, she went to her clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, to have a routine HIV test.</p> <p>\u201cI went with confidence because my first child was negative and I was negative then,\u201d she says. When the test came back positive, Mbono couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWhen the counsellor who tested me showed me the results I thought, \u2018you\u2019re joking!\u2019 I even asked her if she was sure.\u201d</p> <p>Mbono left the clinic in a daze and went home to reflect on the news, still in denial. She looked healthy and well, unlike her sister who had died three years previously from Aids-related tuberculosis. \u201cFor me, [the result] was something that was not real,\u201d Mbono adds.</p> <p>Nowadays many people in South Africa know about HIV. The country has the biggest and most high-profile epidemic in the world, with an estimated 7 million people living with the condition, according to <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/southafrica\">UNAids figures</a>. But in 2003 it was not a big topic, and discussions usually revolved around death, says Mbono. The fear of what having HIV might mean for her unborn child started to creep in, and she worried that she would not live long enough to care for a baby who might be infected.</p> <p>When Mbono found out that she had HIV, South Africa\u2019s government was still deciding whether to make antiretroviral treatment (ARVs) available to all, <a href=\"http://www.medwiser.org/hiv-aids/around-the-world/hivaids-in-south-africa/\">despite a third of pregnant women testing positive</a>. Today, 48% of infected South African adults are on ARVs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/03/aids-hiv-antiretroviral-drugs-treatment-prevention\">Can WHO\u2019s new \u2018test and treat\u2019 HIV policy reach those who need it most?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back at the clinic, Mbono was linked up to a mentor mother employed by mothers2mothers (M2M), an Africa-based NGO that is funded, in part, by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The scheme started in 2001 and has helped 1.4 million HIV-positive mothers in nine sub-Saharan African countries. It currently operates in Kenya, South Africa, Malawi, Lesotho, Uganda, Swaziland and Zambia \u2013 seven countries where it has virtually eliminated mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) among its patients, with a 2.1% transmission rate (the UN classifies virtual elimination as less than 5%).</p> <p>Mbono\u2019s HIV-positive mentor allayed her fears about death and her anger towards her husband, whom she blamed for giving her HIV after he tested positive with a much higher viral load. Through M2M,<strong> </strong>Mbono learned about taking ARVs to reduce the risk of MTCT in the womb and during breastfeeding, and about how to change her lifestyle to live a long and happy life with her children.</p> <p>Last year, South Africa was one of six priority countries (all in sub-Saharan Africa) to meet a <a href=\"http://emtct-iatt.org/global-plan/\">Global Plan</a> target of reducing MTCT by 90%, with 95% of pregnant women with HIV on ARVs and an 84% reduction in new HIV infections among children.</p> <p>Over the past year, Cuba, Belarus, Armenia and Thailand \u2013 non-priority countries \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-programming/prevention/prevention-mother-child\">managed to eliminate MTCT</a> altogether. In South Africa, mother-to-child transmission of HIV has <a href=\"http://www.mrc.ac.za/Media/2016/13press2016.htm\">fallen to an estimated 1.4%</a>, putting the country within reach of eliminating paediatric infections, although maternal mortality remains high. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/13/hiv-radio-young-people-south-african-safe-space-talk\">Comfort and support: how a radio show for people with HIV made a difference</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The M2M programme \u201cmakes the person feel supported\u201d, Mbono says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sisterhood, and it makes you feel like you have a family to cry on.\u201d Through counselling, which helps to breaks down the stigma still attached to HIV/Aids in South Africa despite its high prevalence, Mbono also found the courage to confide in her parents and siblings.</p> <p>And six months ago, she decided to disclose her HIV status to her daughter Anathi, who had just turned 13. \u201cIt really felt shocking,\u201d says Anathi, who feared that there would be no one to look after her seven-year-old brother, who was born HIV negative. \u201cI was afraid that she would leave us.\u201d</p> <p>Mbono reassured her daughter that she had tested negative when she was 18 months old, but Anathi decided to go alone to the clinic and be tested anyway, where she also accessed free counselling from health workers.</p> <p>\u201cI was so, so scared, but eventually they just sat with me and told me to not freak out and to not think negative things about my mum,\u201d Anathi says.

  "<p>It\u2019s easy to pigeonhole herbs. Rosemary goes with lamb, sage goes with pork, dill with salmon, basil with tomatoes. While, yes, they do go with those things \u2013 and wonderfully \u2013 they also make for loads of other, less expected, combinations to thrill the tastebuds.</p> <p>A few years ago, I made a simple salad with crisp apples and lots of soft, fresh tarragon, dressing the whole lot with peppery olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and black pepper. I\u2019d never paired apples with tarragon and was astounded by their delicate harmony. It made me think a little more about how I use herbs in my cooking and I began to tinker with combinations I hadn\u2019t explored before. I would serve roast ham with lovage sauce and raw oysters with sweet cicely. I\u2019d barbecue fish on fennel branches until everything caught fire. I\u2019d infuse custards with bay leaves or lavender for ice-creams and creme brulees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/25/spaghetti-with-tomato-and-fried-chicken-recipe-gill-meller-cook-residency\">Two recipes to make the most of this season\u2019s fresh tomatoes | Cook residency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I grow a few perennial herbs in the garden \u2013 sage, rosemary and thyme are three favourites that I put to work a lot. Herbs elevate fruit, defining and giving it a different expression. Sage goes with almost anything. This summer I\u2019ve been putting it with peaches cooked on a barbecue with black pepper and olive oil. These I served with fresh goat\u2019s curd and, on another occasion, charred squid. Sage\u2019s earthy, bitter perfume works amazingly with the sweet fruit.</p> <p>Today, we have three recipes for fruit with herbs, all hovering between sweet and savoury most satisfyingly. Pears and pork are happy partners in crime, and their latest double act in my kitchen is a warming autumnal roast bridged by rosemary, that strong, resinous and elegant herb, which binds the pears to the bacon magically. For me this is pretty much an all in one supper. You could embellish it, perhaps, with some crumbled blue cheese or tumble through some bitter chicory leaves, but it doesn\u2019t need much.</p> <p>Sage and apples is not an entirely unheard-of pairing \u2013 who doesn\u2019t love sagey apple sauce alongside roast pork? Here, the combination manifests itself as a pudding. Baked apples with lemon, sugar (so far, so traditional), and generous handfuls of sage stuffed in too, adding a flavour that almost haunts the fruit and all the sweet, buttery cooking juices.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had a bit of a wild obsession with thyme since I started cooking at River Cottage many years ago. The garden was always full of different varieties, which I would pick in the morning before beginning work in the kitchen. I used this woody perfumed plant in almost everything I cooked, and I\u2019m sure it nearly always improved it.</p> <p>Just like the other herbs I\u2019ve mentioned, thyme is so good with fruit. I like to add it to a simmering pan of blackcurrants when I make a cordial. Although it\u2019s subtle when you drink a glass, the thyme\u2019s notes are unmistakable. It grounds the dizzy sugar of the raspberries and late summer sweetness of blackberries. I use it with lemon and orange when baking, with fresh figs and honey when I\u2019m grazing, or with dried fruit such as dates, prunes or apricots. And, today, with stewed blueberries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd28849f7d238c37adce1c40a40aa77afec2f52a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd28849f7d238c37adce1c40a40aa77afec2f52a/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pears with bacon and rosemary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pears and pork are happy partners in crime, and rosemary binds the pears to the bacon magically.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pears with bacon and rosemary</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4 \u2013 6</strong><br>4-6 medium ripe pears, quartered and cored<br>300g large smoked or unsmoked bacon lardons<br>A small handful of rosemary sprigs<br>4 tbsp olive oil<br>1 tbsp runny honey<br>Salt and black pepper</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

  "<p>Just two cars deliver their advertised fuel economy when on the road, with the thousands of other models 30% worse on average in the real world, according to comprehensive new data. </p> <p>Some cars, such as the Fiat 500 and Ford Fiesta, gave barely half the mileage advertised.</p> <p>The result is that drivers are being misled and paying far more to drive, say experts, who warn that a stricter official test coming in 2017 will only close about half the gap between official and real fuel efficiency.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://equa.emissionsanalytics.com/fuel-economy-index/\">Equa Index data</a> from leading testing company <a href=\"http://emissionsanalytics.com/\">Emissions Analytics</a> covers 60,000 models and was published on Thursday, the first such database available to the public. It uses onboard equipment to measure mileage over four hours of real-world driving. In contrast, the official regulatory test is a gentle lab-based exercise.</p> <p>The worst gap between official miles per gallon (MPG) and real-world performance was for the Fiat 500, which is rated at 70.6MPG, but only delivered 39MPG on the road, a 45% drop. Other popular petrol cars performing at least 40% worse on the road include the UK\u2019s most popular car, the Ford Fiesta, as well as the Ford Focus, Toyota Yaris and Mini Hatch. Some diesels, which generally have better fuel efficiency, also had 40% gaps, such as the VW Golf and Peugeot 308.</p> <p>The only cars to produce better fuel efficiency on the road were the 4.7-litre engine Aston Martin Vantage, which gave 21.5MPG in the real world, 5% higher than in the lab, and the 3.7l Nissan 370Z, which was 1% better on the road at 26.8MPG.</p> <p>The best on-the-road mileage was produced by the Honda Civic, which did 61.8MPG in the real world, though this was still 21% lower than its official mileage of 78.5MPG. The Citroen C3 was next best, with 60.3MPG, 28% lower than its official rating. The worst actual fuel economy came from the BMW X5, with just 16.2MPG, the Range Rover Sport (17.5MPG) and the Porsche Cayenne (17.8MPG), all well below official ratings.</p> <p>From 2017, a new official test comes into force, which is more strenuous on the car\u2019s engine but is still lab-based. \u201cDrivers have been misled by the official numbers, but even when the new system comes in next September, it won\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d said Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics. \u201cCurrently the real-world performance of cars is on average 29% worse than the official test. Our estimate is that this gap will close by about half, meaning a 10-15% gap will still exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is still a lab test, with no hills, cornering or operating air conditioning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to test on real roads to know what cars really do in normal driving.\u201d This happens in the US, where road tests are used to police the system. </p> <p>Julia Poliscanova, clean vehicles manager at campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, said: \u201cThe fuel consumption gap has become a vast chasm. Carmakers\u2019 manipulation of the weak, outdated lab test is widespread, affecting diesel and petrol cars. This means a total waste of motorists\u2019 money and an increase in global warming emissions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNational regulators have been turning a blind to this evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cSo Europe now needs to cross this chasm and introduce on-road testing. The equipment to do this has been widely available for years, but the political will, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal\">Dieselgate</a> has shown, is sorely lacking.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/emissions-new-diesel-cars-far-higher-than-official-limit\">Emissions from new diesel cars are still far higher than official limit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of UK trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said: \u201cThe current test for fuel consumption is outdated and a new, more stringent lab test from later next year is welcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis will be much more representative of on-road driving and provide the necessary repeatability to allow consumers to compare accurately individual model performance,\u201d he said. \u201cNo single lab test can ever replicate exactly real-world conditions, given infinite variations in temperature, load, speed, maintenance, gradients, and traffic, but industry will continue to invest in new technologies to deliver ever greater fuel economy.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, the Emissions Analytics data showed that cars with small engines had the biggest gap between official fuel economy and actual performance, and those with the biggest engines had the smallest gaps.</p> <p>\u201cThe official test cycle is too gentle, so it encouraged the downsizing of engines to go too far,\u201d explained Molden. \u201cA little one litre engine will do very well, often 80MPG, on the official test, but that has no hills, no passengers, no operating air conditioning. So they suffer disproportionately when you put some weight in the boot and take it up a hill - it is basically underpowered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Aston Martin Vantage is the opposite: it is overpowered,\u201d said Molden. \u201cIt does badly in the lab test and on the road it doesn\u2019t do any worse. It has just got more power than you could possibly need for normal driving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1nawzva1_XORk5tnzU8_URsx3IxnsrbUudeMyi5lwGIM\" data-alt=\"Worst performers table\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1nawzva1_XORk5tnzU8_URsx3IxnsrbUudeMyi5lwGIM\">Worst performers table</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1AT6PNocIZn9JWEIPGqenkJKZxA7pkNt2383_oSTf6eg\" data-alt=\"Best performers table\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1AT6PNocIZn9JWEIPGqenkJKZxA7pkNt2383_oSTf6eg\">Best performers table</a> </figure>",
  "<p>Another day, another piece of news that suggests the economy is coping with the result of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote much better than expected. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">The latest health check of manufacturing</a> suggests that the record plunge suffered in July was a kneejerk response to the result of the referendum.</p> <p>All the lost ground was made up in August \u2013 and then some. The closely watched Markit/Cips report recorded the joint biggest monthly increase in industry\u2019s performance in the 25-year history of the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), taking it to its highest level since last October.</p> <p>A couple of words of caution are in order. Sentiment is clearly volatile and, as Lee Hopley of the EEF pointed out, it is possible that an overshoot downwards has been followed by an overshoot upwards. What\u2019s more, manufacturing accounts for only one-tenth of the economy\u2019s output, so a more complete picture of how the economy is faring in these early post-Brexit-vote days will only emerge when the services sector PMI is released on Monday.</p> <p>Even so, a number of tentative conclusions can be drawn. The first is that manufacturers are being helped by the fall in the value of the pound, which is making UK goods more competitive on global markets. Although there is evidence that the fall in the value of sterling is pushing up manufacturers\u2019 costs, movements in the currency market since 23 June have been broadly positive, since they have supported activity and will help rebalance the economy.</p> <p>The second conclusion is that policy decisions have made a difference. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\">Theresa May\u2019s swift coronation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">stimulus provided by the Bank of England</a> have made manufacturers more hopeful that they can not just survive but thrive after the referendum.</p> <p>Finally, while it is still early days and companies are still mulling over big hiring and investment decisions, predictions made ahead of the referendum that the economy would be plunged into an immediate recession by a vote to leave look wide of the mark.</p> <p>Indeed, most of those who did forecast instant dire consequences are already retreating to their fallback position: that Brexit will be a slow burn, with the impact only felt over time. That seems sensible. It is still quite possible that the economy will slow in the second half of 2016, but there has been scant evidence so far to suggest that it is spiralling into the abyss.</p>",

  "<p>Our father, Martin George, who has died aged 86, championed the conservation of the Norfolk Broads. He was one of the last great naturalists of his generation.</p> <p>His achievements were many and varied, those around him recalling his enthusiasm and energy as new sites and species were found. He put several initiatives in place, including the Hoveton Great Broad nature trail, which he designed and implemented. He led the Nature Conservancy\u2019s ground-breaking 1965 report on Broadland, which alerted the public and government to its ecological challenges, and played significant roles in the subsequent establishment of the Broads Authority and launch of the Broads grazing marsh conservation scheme, the forerunner of national agri-environment payments to farmers.</p> <p>Martin was born in the Hambleden valley, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, the youngest son of Charles George, an engineer and company director, and his wife, Phyllis (nee Webb). He formed an early love of nature while exploring the flowery chalk downland of the Chilterns with his mother. His father died when he was six.</p> <p>Later, after applying his passion for nature at Radley college, and with a doctorate in entomology from London University, he worked at the Field Studies Council\u2019s Dale Fort field centre in Pembrokeshire, where he met his wife, Barbara, a geographer.</p> <p>In 1960, moving with Barbara to Norfolk, he joined the staff of the Nature Conservancy, which later became Natural England. He became the regional officer for East Anglia in 1966, a role he held for 24 years until retiring in 1990.</p> <p>On his retirement, appointed OBE for his services to nature conservation, he continued to fight for the environment, and wrote the definitive book Land Use, Ecology and Conservation of Broadland (1992). He shared his knowledge with students, undertook a variety of committee responsibilities, gathered seeds for storage as a principal collector for the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew and, just before he died, completed a paper chronicling the history and ecology of the Hickling Broad nature reserve.</p> <p>Martin shared his passion for steam engines, sports cars and music, including violin playing, with all the family. He particularly enjoyed sailing and flying kites on family holidays on Scolt Head Island.</p> <p>His infectious enthusiasm and ability to share his curiosity, knowledge and joy about the natural world with others affected everyone around him. Many people will remember him for the opportunity to see and photograph their first swallowtail butterfly, one of the UK\u2019s rarest, in his garden overlooking the RSPB\u2019s Strumpshaw Fen reserve.</p> <p>He is survived by Barbara, by their four children, Lucy, Mark and ourselves, and by six grandchildren.</p>",

<p>Welcome to Thursday on politics live. Deficits are the key today, sleep deficits that is. As you will see with <strong>Mike Bowers\u2019</strong> picture gallery, the press ball went to the wee hours last night. This is normally a midwinter event but, with the eight-week campaign, it became an almost spring ball.<br></p> <p>So with the coffee carts and the cafe packed to maximum capacity, we had best get on with the day. There is a lot around this morning. The government has 16 more bills coming to the parliament, including the company tax cuts. The Coalition agenda is dominated by budget measures but there were red faces all round late yesterday after Labor discovered a $107m counting error in the omnibus bill. The resulting mathematical haircut takes the value of the savings bill below $6bn.<br></p> <p>Labor is meeting with victims of shonky financial advisors to press the case for the bank royal commission. Labor\u2019s point is that the small business ombudsman\u2019s inquiry is not broad enough. <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/labor-kept-at-bay-over-banks-20160831-gr5kes\">Phil Coorey at the Fin</a> reports the ombudsman <strong>Kate Carnell</strong> will be looking at 23 specific cases that were concerning Coalition bank critics. While this approach obviously stops those critics from crossing the floor, you do wonder about the rest of the victims who have not managed to make contact with a Coalition backbencher.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Hawke</strong> is in the house! The former PM will be launching Anthony Albanese\u2019s biography by journalist <strong>Karen Middleton</strong> at 11am. I will bring pics and hopefully a bit of colour from that event.<br></p> <p>And at 9am, the current prime minister will be making a statement to the house regarding counter terrorism. I can\u2019t tell you anymore because ... actually, I don\u2019t know anymore than that.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s lots more besides. Stick around and chat in the thread. I\u2019m on the Twits @gabriellechan and he is @mpbowers. I\u2019m on my second litre of water, the sun is shining, the birds are singing and its the last sitting day of the parliament. What\u2019s not to love?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T00:19:44.840Z\">at 1.19am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s factories saw a strong rebound in output and new orders in August, according to a survey that suggested manufacturers quickly shrugged off the shock of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>A closely watched measure of factory activity swung to a 10-month high in August from a 41-month low recorded in July. But there were signs a weaker pound was stoking inflation, as it raised the cost of imported materials for UK factories and they passed those higher costs on to customers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/b2d9d18dacd14cb3a1c6b7836894b80f\">The Markit/Cips UK Manufacturing PMI</a> (pdf) rose to 53.3 in August from 48.3 in July. That was the joint greatest month-to-month jump in the survey\u2019s nearly 25-year history. The last time there was a five-point jump was between February 2009 and March 2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>The latest reading was well above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and far ahead of the consensus forecast for a reading of 49.0, in a Reuters poll of economists. The pound strengthened against the US dollar and hit a one-month high against the euro after the stronger than expected report.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/29/busy-week-of-economic-data-gives-further-clues-on-brexit-vote\">City analysts have already been adjusting their outlooks for a post-referendum slump</a> on the back of indicators showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">household spending has held up well</a>. These latest figures are likely to prompt more economists to shift to a brighter outlook for the UK economy over coming months.</p> <p>Rob Dobson, senior economist at the manufacturing report\u2019s compilers IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe August PMI data indicate a solid rebound in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector from the steep downturn that followed the EU referendum. </p> <p>\u201cCompanies reported that work that had been postponed during July had now been restarted, as manufacturers and their clients started to regain a sense of returning to business as usual. The domestic market showed a marked recovery, especially for consumer products, while the recent depreciation of sterling drove higher inflows of new business from the US, Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East and Asia.\u201d</p> <p>The survey of purchasing managers at more than 600 industrial companies showed:</p> <ul> <li>Output recovered at one of the fastest paces on record.</li> <li>New orders enjoyed one of the strongest month-to-month rebounds.</li> <li>Manufacturing production grew at the fastest pace in seven months.</li> <li>Companies reported solid inflows of new work from domestic and export customers.</li> <li>New export business grew at the fastest pace for 26 months.</li> <li>Input price inflation hit a five-year high.</li> <li>Output prices also rose at the fastest pace for five years.</li> <li>And employment rose for the first time this year.</li> </ul> <p>\u201cInflation is raising its ugly head,\u201d said Dobson, commenting on the effects of the pound falling against other currencies, which makes UK imports more expensive but exports more competitive.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too early to say whether the rebounds in growth and inflation will be sustained, but the upturn in August suggests that the weaker exchange rate and recent policy action have helped to avert a downturn,\u201d he added.<br></p> <p>The rebound for manufacturers follows action by the Bank of England to restore confidence among businesses and households after the 23 June referendum. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">The Bank cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25%</a> and expanded its programme of electronic money creation, known as quantitative easing, on 4 August.</p> <p>That followed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\">warning from Bank governor Mark Carney before the referendum that a vote to leave could tip the UK into recession</a>.</p> <p>Economists have warned that despite signs of a rebound this summer, the decision to leave the EU could be felt more acutely once negotiations to leave the bloc begin in earnest. </p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the news \u201cprovides a lot of relief that manufacturing activity is still on the up\u201d but that August\u2019s performance was unlikely to be sustained.</p> <p>\u201cManufacturers, unnerved in July by the referendum outcome, appear to have their mojo back in August,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the heightened volatility in the indicator in the last couple of months still raises questions about whether sentiment has overshot somewhat and, rather than this pace of expansion being sustained, some moderation is likely in the coming months.\u201d</p> <p>Economists are awaiting the purchasing managers\u2019 index report for the smaller construction sector on Friday and, more importantly, for the much larger services sector on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Raihan Abir glances at the book in his hands, his eyes focused on the religious symbols that dot its reddish brown cover.

Abir and his wife were forced to flee Bangladesh, ending up in Toronto. </p> <p>The attacks are part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/bangladesh-murders-bloggers-foreigners-religion\">a killing spree that has targeted activists, bloggers and professors in Bangladesh</a>. Since 2013, extremists \u2013 many of them wielding machetes \u2013 have killed more than 50 bloggers, secularists, LGBT activists and religious minorities, according to Human Rights Watch. Scores of others have been seriously injured.</p> <p>Many of those killed had publicly expressed opinions on religion, science, sexuality or music. Both Isis and Ansar al-Islam, a militant group linked to al-Qaida, have claimed responsibility for the killings.</p> <p>The common thread linking the lives of many of the victims is <a href=\"https://mukto-mona.com/en\">Mukto-mona</a>, meaning Free Thinker, a Bengali-English website dedicated to the discussion of topics that range from atheism to science. Abir became involved with the site in 2007, drawn to what he describes as a window on to a world long hidden in conservative Bangladesh. </p> <p>\u201cI was living in a bubble with lots of propaganda fed to me by society,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really easy to reach the age of 22 in Bangladesh and never hear about the science of evolution rather than intelligent design propaganda.\u201d </p> <p>When he and Roy released Philosophy of Disbelief, the book became an instant hit, feeding into the fledgling conversation ignited by websites such as Mukto-mona. </p> <p>But it also caught the attention of Islamist extremists who were determined to make Bangladesh reflect their own conservative beliefs . Abir points to the 2013 murder of secularist blogger <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/two-sentenced-death-bangladesh-blogger-ahmed-rajib-haider\">Ahmed Rajib Haider</a>, hacked to death in front of his home, as the first of what would become a terrifying pattern of murders in the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eaec7ac3d2eaf5b0b26a5a931edfb11cb8b9f34b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaec7ac3d2eaf5b0b26a5a931edfb11cb8b9f34b/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Raihan Abir, Samia Hossain and their daughter Sophie.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raihan Abir, Samia Hossain and their daughter Sophie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samiul Alam Anik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later \u2013 as Abir was becoming accustomed to regularly receiving death threats by email and text \u2013 the number of attacks began to spike. \u201cIt got out of control,\u201d he says. </p> <p>The death of his co-author left him racked with grief. Apprehension set in months later, after another blogger, Washiqur Rahman, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/blogger-hacked-death-bangladesh-dhaka\">hacked to death outside his home</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI knew it was my turn,\u201d Abir says with a wry smile. The idea began to permeate every moment of his life. Each morning his wife, Samia Hossain, would emerge first from their home to check for attackers. \u201cOnce she said it was clear, we would hit the road on our motorbike,\u201d he says. Hossain kept constant watch behind them as he drove. </p> <p>Despite the sweltering heat, he would keep his motorbike helmet on as walked through the university campus where he was completing his PhD in biomedical engineering. \u201cMy physician friends said you have to keep your helmet on to keep your head intact.\u201d </p> <p>When his PhD supervisor decided to attend a medical conference in Toronto, he urged Abir to join him and seek refuge in Canada. Abir hesitated, torn by the idea of leaving behind his research on the use of telemedicine in rural areas and still tied to the challenge of carving out a school of secular thought in the increasingly polarised country. </p> <p>The final push came with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/third-atheist-blogger-killed-in-bangladesh-after-knife-attack\">the death of Ananta Bijoy Das</a>, an editor of Philosophy of Disbelief. The two had been in constant contact as Das \u2013 worried about the death threats he was receiving \u2013 attempted to secure a visa to Sweden. Soon after his application was rejected by Swedish authorities, he was attacked by several masked men wielding machetes in broad daylight. </p> <p>In June of last year Abir travelled to Toronto, leaving behind Hossain who was six months pregnant at the time. Neither had any idea when they would see each other again. \u201cI knew that I might not be able to see her for three or four years,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Still, she was ecstatic to see him go. \u201cWhen the plane left and was in the air, I knew he would be alive. I was so happy,\u201d says Hossain. An architect by training, she followed in her husband\u2019s footsteps, applying for a visa to attend a conference in her field in Toronto. Two months later, a very pregnant Hossain was on a plane to Toronto.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it would be the happiest day of my life,\u201d says Abir. But while Hossain was in the air, news came of another death among their tight-knit circle of friends. Atheist blogger Niloy Neel had been hacked to death in his home. \u201cIt was a really stressful time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were losing the brightest minds of Bangladesh one by one.\u201d </p> <p>Things soon began to fall into place for the young couple. Days after they found a place to call home in Toronto, their daughter Sophie was born. Their application for refugee status was accepted a few months later. </p> <p>Slowly the pair allowed themselves to shake off the fear that had coloured their lives in Dhaka. \u201cIn Bangladesh I literally would take one step and look behind my back. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be alive,\u201d says Abir as he sits at a table in the couple\u2019s sparsely decorated apartment. His wife nods sombrely in agreement as she sits next to him. \u201cYeah, he wasn\u2019t.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/bangladesh-murders-bloggers-foreigners-religion\">Inside Bangladesh\u2019s killing fields: bloggers and outsiders targeted by fanatics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toronto\u2019s sizable Bangladeshi community, however, has meant the couple hasn\u2019t been able to let their guard down entirely.

So far, according to Human Rights Watch, this has largely translated into the detention of some 15,000 suspects with scant evidence. </p> <p>Thousands of miles away from Dhaka and its climate of fear, Abir\u2019s hope for the country continues to run deep. \u201cNow, yes we are being attacked, our atheist writers, our bloggers are refugees in the world. But things will change, Bangladesh is not like that.\u201d He continues to work with Mukto-mona, his passion for its ideas now accompanied by a deep sense of responsibility as one of the few who made it out alive.</p> <p>His focus is now on the dozens of Bangladeshi writers still under threat in the country, many of them in hiding and fearing for their lives. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make connections with the outer world and get them to safe places.

  "<p>As Olympians return victorious from Rio 2016, it\u2019s likely that many will be offered lucrative sponsorship packages from brands eager to harness Olympic glory. As advertising is increasingly avoided and ways of talking to consumers proliferate, celebrity sponsorship is set to continue its meteoric growth.</p> <p>If it works, the sponsorship route can cut through the clutter of today\u2019s marketing.

Earlier this month, for example, the Kardashian clan was called out by nonprofit consumer group Truth In Advertising (TINA) for failing to indicate that over 100 product placements on their Instagram accounts <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/08/23/kardashian-family-accused-deceptive-marketing-over-paid-instagram-endorsements\" rel=\"nofollow\">were actually paid for</a>. In this case, both the Kardashians and the brands in question neglected to disclose their commercial relationship, proving that trust needs to go both ways in influencer marketing.</p> <p>Of course, the Kardashians aren\u2019t the only brand ambassadors to compromise their integrity. When it was revealed last week that US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/25/ryan-lochte-charged-rio-police-false-report\">lied about being robbed at gunpoint</a>, several brands were faced with a major trust issue, ending in the retraction of lucrative sponsorship deals including Speedo and Ralph Lauren, reported to have been <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/speedo-usa-ends-sponsorship-deal-with-us-swimmer-ryan-lochte-10547895\" rel=\"nofollow\">worth an estimated total of $1m (\u00a3758,000</a>). Speedo quickly disassociated itself from Lochte when his misdemeanours were exposed, saying: \u201cWe cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.\u201d</p> <p>This situation, of course, isn\u2019t new; from <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/michael-jacksons-sponsorship-deal-with-pepsi-goes-flat-1504383.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pepsi\u2019s withdrawal of its Michael Jackson sponsorship</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/22/drugsandalcohol.vikramdodd\">Chanel distancing itself from Kate Moss</a>, celebrity association has always been a risky business. So what makes this incident with Lochte different?<br></p> <p>In the past, messages could be carefully controlled and cultivated. Bad news could be hidden, rumours silenced by smart crisis PR teams. But in the age of digital democracy, where consumers are only ever three or four clicks away from finding out anything about a brand, mistakes will be outed. Through social media, consumers now influence opinion much more than any brand or institution. Mistakes are not only revealed, but rapidly amplified.<br></p> <p>What has also changed is how the public responds to different types of misdemeanour. Brands need to take note \u2013 and monitor this on social media \u2013 before diving into kneejerk reactions, such as Speedo\u2019s.</p> <p>First, there\u2019s the genuine mistake, which is almost always forgiven. Tennis star Maria Sharapova was given a two-year suspension earlier this year when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/08/maria-sharapova-banned-two-years-failing-drugs-test-meldonium\">revealed she\u2019d failed a drugs test</a>. Her major sponsors (Nike, Head and Evian) stood by her. When the failed drugs test came to light, Sharapova apologised for her mistake straight away, and her racket supplier Head emphasised how she was a \u201crole model and woman of integrity\u201d. The balance of social media agreed. By standing by Sharapova, Head actually improved its reputation. Had it not, it would almost certainly have been vilified for cowardice or lack of constancy.</p> <p>The second level of misdemeanour is lying, which is the category Lochte falls into. From Bill Clinton to Tiger Woods, this is nothing new. What can now be observed, however, is that if the reason for the lie is explained and understood, if the perpetrator appears genuinely contrite, then the public can be remarkably forgiving. <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/online-backlash-sponsors-endured-dropping-lochte/1406471\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to research</a> by marketing technology company Amobee, who analysed over 600,000 sites, the majority of social comment around Lochte was actually neutral or even positive. So should Speedo have reflected public opinion, created a platform for Lochte to express his contrition and stood by him? Would that have made Speedo appear more human and more in touch with the public?</p> <p>This leads us onto the third, and ultimate misdemeanour: hypocrisy. Brands need to tread carefully when it comes to \u201cbehaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for\u201d, as Speedo puts it. Hypocrisy is not tolerated by the public and rouses genuine feelings of anger on social media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jul/12/end-big-bold-brand-promises-marketing\">The end of big, bold brand promises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conversely, what does generate criticism and a true breakdown of trust, is when celebrities or brands do act hypocritically. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear if there was now an army of citizen journalists trying to find out instances where Speedo has acted controversially. At the 2008 Olympics swimming records were being broken by improbable margins with the swimmers having one thing in common \u2013 FastSkin \u2013 one of Speedo\u2019s performance\u2013enhancing swimsuits; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/23/swimsuits-world-championships-fina\">leading to the brand being accused of \u201ctechnological doping</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>So was Speedo right to act so decisively and quickly? On the one hand, any delay would seem like tacit endorsement, but on the other, it\u2019s now set a rod for its own back. Any future misdemeanour on its part will be seen as hypocrisy.<br></p> <p>Perhaps the answer lies in a single word: humanity. To err is human, but forgiveness doesn\u2019t require divinity, just the capacity to take a step back and listen. Social media may have hijacked brands\u2019 ability to conceal the truth, but it has also given them the ability to listen to how the public is feeling and align themselves with public sentiment, which is a powerful tool.</p> <p><em>Charlotte White is global strategy partner at <a href=\"http://www.carat.com/global/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carat</a></em></p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>In 2013, Brendon Chung\u2019s short, sharp game about a heist gone wrong, Thirty Flights of Loving, was listed as one of the finalists for the Narrative Award at the Independent Games Festival. Before that, the game had been discussed by critics as one of the \u201cvery best narratives\u201d in video games. Its use of the jump cut, borrowed from film-making, was a novelty, and Chung used it to great effect, tying together vignettes to tell a story that hurtled by with the kind of confident pacing that video games rarelyachieve.</p> <p>You might question, then, why Chung decided to move away from all this fanfare with his next game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/quadrilateral-cowboy-hacker-simulator-cyberpunk-blendo-games\">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>. While working on it back in 2013, he told IGN that he \u201cwanted to go in a very different direction from Thirty Flights [of Loving] and let the player experiment in a sandbox and figure out their own solutions to problems\u201d.</p> <p>True to his word, when that game came out in July, it proved to be less narrative-focused than Chung\u2019s previous work. Quadrilateral Cowboy puts players in the role of three agents who attempt a series of break-ins into corporate facilities and office blocks. The game is played from the perspective of a computer hacker, meaning players have to input coding commands into their \u201cdeck\u201d to turn off cameras and security lasers, and open doors. Each level offers a number of different ways to achieve each goal, encouraging players to experiment with the gadgets at their disposal. These include a turret in a suitcase, a remote-control bug robot and a portable launch pad that makes crossing gaps a breeze. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"317879b0f4039951f5dcabc6f7228afa3f0162e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317879b0f4039951f5dcabc6f7228afa3f0162e9/0_8_500_300/500.jpg\" alt=\"brendon.chung\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendon Chung</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a moment near the beginning of Quadrilateral Cowboy when the player has to collect the parts of a computer and assemble them. A data chip, power supply, hard drive and processor are all picked out of individual cabinets and inserted into a motherboard. The attention to detail here is remarkable, as the player is able to watch as each of the computer parts are wired up with loving animation. Chung couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cThere is something comforting in being able to actually see mechanical pieces interlocking and moving together,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a clarity there. They\u2019re not hiding anything, everything is visible to the naked eye.\u201d Chung\u2019s affections for analogue technology is why Quadrilateral Cowboy is set during the 1980s and why he describes it as \u201c20th-century Cyberpunk.\u201d The point of this label is to signify the aesthetic and the era of technology that the game\u2019s world is set in: \u201cless touch-screen and more mechanical buttons and dials.\u201d</p> <h2>An appreciation of workmanship</h2> <p>Chung fostered his passion for analogue technology as a child growing up with it all around him. His interest in it now is a kind of nostalgia, but it\u2019s also more than that. It\u2019s what Chung identifies as an \u201cappreciation for workmanship\u201d. It\u2019s obvious where this came from: his dad. \u201cMy dad is one of those people who knows how to fix anything,\u201d Chung says. \u201cCarpentry, plumbing, automobiles, electronics \u2013 whatever you got, he can mend it, improve it, or salvage something from it.\u201d</p> <p>Chung grew up with his father, mother, and two siblings in a middle-class, three-bedroom house in Los Angeles. It was a creative household, with each member of the family having their own pursuits. Chung\u2019s dad submitted cartoons to newspapers as a kid, his mother is an avid musician, and his sister is now a graphics designer and illustrator. \u201cI work very hard to create my work, but whatever success I\u2019ve achieved wouldn\u2019t have been possible without my folks,\u201d Chung says. \u201cI think we\u2019re shaped by our environments, and I feel extremely lucky to have been surrounded by a lot of support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe84fdb8de270212bf21a6729c59cee0a4b1d09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe84fdb8de270212bf21a6729c59cee0a4b1d09/43_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a direct result of the environment that Chung grew up in\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quadrilateral Cowboy is a direct result of the environment that Chung grew up in</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s obvious that Quadrilateral Cowboy is a direct result of the environment that Chung grew up in. During his childhood, Chung\u2019s father would enlist the help of his children as he built cabinets from scratch, fixed a leaky pipe fixture, and snaked cables under the floorboards. Chung has memories of sitting behind the steering wheel and being told to push the gas pedal down to see what noise the car would make after his father had tampered with the engine.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne thing I learned was that whatever task you had at hand, there was absolutely always some hyper-specific tool that was the perfect fit for the job,\u201d he says. \u201cThat extremely specific thing you\u2019re trying to do? Yeah, there\u2019s an obscure tool built just for that. As a result, we had a garage full of power tools and hardware and equipment amassed over decades.\u201d</p> <p>That computer assembly scene in Quadrilateral Cowboy exists as a kind of love letter from Chung to technology then, but it also serves to draw the player into his mindset. \u201cEverything\u2019s just a pile of moving parts, and when you have the means of cracking them open, you get to see how those moving parts all play together,\u201d Chung says. \u201cI remember that electric feeling of seeing a panel held shut by plain ol\u2019 screws - that meant it was easy to open up, take a peek at its guts, and put it back together.\u201d</p> <p>If nothing else, Quadrilateral Cowboy is built to facilitate that \u201celectric feeling.\u201d Players are taught through repetition and intuition to see the literal nuts and bolts in the game\u2019s blocky environments, eager to open them up with their set of tools. They become like the childhood Chung, who built marble-roll roller coasters out of kebab sticks, and who had assembled a pile of WWII and Star Wars model kits. \u201cI remember loving kitbashing. Kitbashing is a term used in scale models, when you cobble together scrap parts from various model kits in order to make something,\u201d Chung said. \u201cThe original Command &amp; Conquer had come out and was the hot game, and I remember kitbashing together my own little Nod Buggy by scavenging pieces from various cars and planes.\u201d<br></p> <p>At university, this same passion lent itself to Chung\u2019s film projects. \u201cThe way I tended to work was I would look around my dorm room, take stock of what I happened to have with me, and then create a film project around those things,\u201d Chung says. \u201cAs a result, a lot of my projects revolved around the same crappy golf club and green winter jacket, over and over again.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a013c293cf61b116300f148dfb7e58e400608498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a013c293cf61b116300f148dfb7e58e400608498/0_21_1680_1008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a kind of love letter to technology\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quadrilateral Cowboy is a kind of love letter to technology</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quadrilateral Cowboy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The connection between his childhood toys and his university films is Chung finding ways to express himself through iteration and crude or mundane objects. It\u2019s this type of expression that Chung looks out for in the video games he plays, too. He\u2019s most fond of details such as a game letting its players rearrange the objects in a room, being able to sit down anywhere, or deciding whether to leave toilet seats up or down. \u201cOne of my favourite examples of this is in The Unfinished Swan,\u201d Chung said. \u201cIn that game you play as a child lost and alone in a strange world. It has a feature, not taught or mentioned anywhere during the game, where if you press the d-pad, it makes the kid say \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cAnyone there?\u201d \u201cHellooooooo???\u201d It has zero effect on the gameplay and it\u2019s just such a great way of letting you play a role.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Allowing players room for expression </h2> <p>It is no surprise that allowing players similar room for expression is one of Chung\u2019s goals when making his own games. It\u2019s this that he really wanted to dive into with Quadrilateral Cowboy and what he meant when saying that was taking it in a different direction from the narrative-directed Thirty Flights of Loving.<br></p> <p>The environments in Quadrilateral Cowboy are testament to this. One of Chung\u2019s rules when designing them was that if something looked interactable then it had to be. Whether is was a cupboard, light switch, or a window, everything had to allow players to fiddle with it. He also wanted there to be loose props that players could pick up and physically handle, rearranging the room carefully, or throwing everything around in disarray if they choose.<br></p> <p>Thirty Flights of Loving and Chung\u2019s other first-person games also contained this environment design philosophy. But where he goes further is with Quadrilateral Cowboy\u2019s heist missions. \u201cDuring the heists themselves, players are given free range on what kind of operative they\u2019d like to be,\u201d Chung said. \u201cSneak through like a ghost and don\u2019t leave a trace? Go for it. Snatch the vault and program your remote-control robotic rifle to shatter the second-floor window so you can leap out? Go for it. I\u2019m so delighted when people find creative ways to use the game mechanics to be themselves.\u201d<br></p> <p>Since the game has come out, Chung has also opened Quadrilateral Cowboy up for modding. This is possible due to the game being built in idTech4 (also known as the Doom 3 engine), which has a \u201cvery open structure,\u201d according to Chung. \u201cAll of its content files are just plain text files,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone wished to open up one of the existing maps/items/whatever and see how it was implemented, they are free to do so. Additionally, the source code to the executable is open-source and available for download. So, just about everything in Quadrilateral Cowboy is modifiable.\u201d<br></p> <p>His hope is that people will take that liberty and conduct experiments to see how they can change the game. Perhaps someone will even go down the same path as Chung did, growing an interest in seeing how video games work, and then looking to make their own with the knowledge they acquire through toying with the code that holds them together. Chung would surely be thrilled with such an outcome.<br></p> <p>He encourages it, of course. \u201cAlways collect new tools, always crack things open and learn how people before you did it,\u201d Chung says.<br></p>",
  "<p>The members\u2019 lobby of the House of Commons is dominated by larger than life statues of four great British prime ministers. When entertaining younger visitors I would usually pause and invite them to identify the figures. Everyone recognised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/winston-churchill\" title=\"\">Churchill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\" title=\"\">Thatcher</a>. Many, after a bit of head scratching, got Lloyd George. Rarely, however, could anyone put a name to the fourth figure, despite his having a fair claim to being the most successful peacetime prime minister of the 20th century. It is, of course, Clement Attlee.</p> <p>Perhaps we should not be surprised. Attlee was a modest man, lacking in charisma, an unimpressive public speaker, underestimated by friend and&#xa0;foe alike. Goodness knows how he would have survived on today\u2019s frenzied political scene (even at the time he was much criticised for his apparent lack of dynamism). Yet he presided for six years over a government whose legacy endures to this day.</p> <p>Everything about Attlee suggested a small-c conservative. Born in the late Victorian era, the son of a prosperous lawyer, educated at a leading public school (to which he remained attached for the rest of his life), a patriot with a distinguished war record, he could so easily have ended up on the other side. Destined to follow his father into the law, he opted instead to run a boys\u2019 club&#xa0;in the east London docklands and&#xa0;this was the experience that shaped his politics.</p> <p>One has to pinch oneself to recall that until little more than 100 years ago unemployment and old age often meant hunger, malnutrition and destitution. Destitution meant the workhouse and the dreaded means test. Death by starvation was not unknown in the early years of the 20th century. In the 1890s, when Attlee was growing up, only one child in 270 went into secondary education. In the pit villages of Yorkshire, the infant mortality rate was&#xa0;250 in every thousand \u2013 and this in&#xa0;what was then the richest and most powerful country in the world. Add to that the destruction and misery wreaked by the first world war and it\u2019s evident what propelled Attlee into politics.</p> <p>His rise was not at all predictable. Elected as the MP for Limehouse in 1922, he was a junior minister in the first Labour governments. As with most successful politicians, luck played a part. He might never have become leader but for the Labour split of 1931, which meant that, even four years later, competition for the top job was not as stiff as it might have been. Even then he might not have survived but for the outbreak of war and formation of a coalition in which he became deputy prime minister.</p> <p>Come the end of the war, he went on to lead a government which, in the teeth of almost insurmountable difficulties, established a comprehensive system of social insurance, providing unemployment pay, sickness benefit, maternity leave, widow\u2019s benefit, family allowances (child benefit) and a one-off death grant to help with funeral costs. It established the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\" title=\"\">National Health Service</a>, raised the school leaving age, and took into public ownership the coal industry, the railways, gas, electricity and the communications firm Cable and&#xa0;Wireless. In addition, it successfully demobilised more than 2 million men from the armed forces and began the dissolution of the empire. The government played a leading part in the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\" title=\"\">Nato</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\" title=\"\">United Nations</a> and even found time to set up the first national parks. All this was achieved against a background of a&#xa0;global economic crisis, confrontation with Stalin\u2019s Russia and a renewed outbreak of war in Korea. There has been nothing like it before or since.</p> <p>In this monumental biography, John Bew sets out to explore, not just the scale of the achievement (which others before him have done), but to discover what made Attlee tick \u2013 no easy task given the extraordinary reticence of his subject. He has looked at a vast array of sources, but one original feature is his use of the politician\u2019s correspondence (mainly with his brother) to discover what he was reading at any given time, and then to explore this material to get a&#xa0;sense of his mind.</p> <p>As a result many chapters include excursions into Attlee\u2019s reading habits, ranging from Edward Bellamy\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/looking-backward-2000-1887.html\" title=\"\"><em>Looking Backward</em></a> and William Morris\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/news-from-nowhere.html\" title=\"\"><em>News from Nowhere</em></a> to Kipling, Trollope and Gibbon (Attlee found time during his premiership to read all six volumes of <em>The</em> <em>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire)</em>. He even tried his hand at writing a satirical novel \u2013 incomplete and unpublished. This is a good book about a remarkable man, but I remain unconvinced that Attlee\u2019s reading or writing habits tell us much that we don\u2019t already know. His beliefs were shaped by his work among the impoverished of the East End and the events through which he lived (two world wars and a great depression). He was a practical man, not a great thinker (many of the observations recorded in his letters to&#xa0;his brother are banal). To be sure, he&#xa0;was a patriot, but his was not the patriotism in which scoundrels take refuge: \u201cAttlee\u2019s patriotism meant not fidelity to caste or cohort, but to the commonwealth.\u201d He believed, too, that citizenship involved responsibilities as well as rights.</p> <p>These days, all sides in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/28/corbyn-accuses-labour-officials-of-suspending-party-members-without-explanation\" title=\"\">fractious Labour party</a> claim to be heirs of Attlee but, as the author points out, there is \u201ca convenient element of amnesia in the exhumation of Attlee for modern political purposes\u201d. He faced no fewer than four attempts to force him out of the leadership and almost incessant criticism from within his own party, from both right and left. \u201cThe extent of the hostility shown towards him,\u201d Bew writes, \u201cshould caution us against the disingenuous myth-making around him today.\u201d</p> <p>For all his inscrutability, Attlee was not without a sense of humour. Witness the epitaph that he wrote for himself: \u201cFew thought he was even a starter, / There were many who thought themselves smarter. / Yet he ended PM, / CH and OM, / An earl and a Knight of&#xa0;the Garter.\u201d What matters more than the honours showered on him in retirement, of course, is the vastly more civilised world that he bequeathed to future generations.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Mullin is a former Labour minister.

Unfortunately, it also suggests she is easily distracted and may not complete what she has started, so achieves best with short-term targets.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad9041195a2aafa470c5281003da8ab512af7bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad9041195a2aafa470c5281003da8ab512af7bc7/0_118_383_479/383.jpg\" alt=\"paisley floral doodle with black biro\" width=\"383\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Intuitive perfectionist</h2> <p>\u201c<em>All of my doodles are a variation of this paisley, floral pattern.

It\u2019s a very feminine doodle, full of feeling in the wavy lines and tear drops, and flowers in full bloom creating a happy mood.<br></p> <p>This person (probably a woman, but not necessarily) likes to work closely with others and will promote harmony in the workplace by avoiding conflict and creating a pleasant environment. She is sensitive, with an intuitive understanding of people and situations and is naturally accommodating, like the winding flower stems. Her evident delight in tiny decorative patterns shows she has a meticulous eye for detail and is capable of doing repetitive work requiring great precision or manual dexterity. However, being a perfectionist means she is unwilling to take short cuts so may not always be efficient and is likely to get stressed if put under pressure.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be971079dc729351ded536adbbc4413d3c76d1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be971079dc729351ded536adbbc4413d3c76d1cc/0_63_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"felt tip doodle of a grenade with a face\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Independent optimist</h2> <p>\u201c<em>A reaction to baffling requests or directives from clients.

Rapidly drawn in cartoon style with firm strokes softened by a felt-tip pen, it reflects this man\u2019s warmth and love of life as well as his lively intelligence, spontaneity, good physical coordination and self-assurance in action.<br></p> <p>With its grim but boyish humour this solitary, solid object shows he is independent, strong minded and not inclined to be pushed around. Rows of straight lines are a sign of systematic work and self-control, but the pointed tongue shows how rude he would like to be, while the crossed eyes and raised eyeline capture his disbelief and scepticism as he listens with one ear only, ready to pull the plug.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"846cbc6489c031362413af3f79a315b112b10ea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/846cbc6489c031362413af3f79a315b112b10ea2/52_0_512_640/400.jpg\" alt=\"sad face doodle\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Strong, mature and sensitive</h2> <p>\u201c<em>I\u2019ve always doodled while working.

The face that emerged here is that of a strong, mature and sensitive man who appears to be reflecting on his life as he looks down through the years. To the right is a blank space, as if he would rather not think about the future. The expression is questioning and anxious, though the eyes are partially obscured, suggesting he may be reluctant to see this in himself. The lips, too, are shaded and hardly open, as if experience has taught him the wisdom of discretion, especially in business.<br></p> <p>Strong men avoid showing weakness but in later life may find themselves more in touch with their feminine side as they have less to prove. Crossed and circular patterns represent opposite personality traits, so the presence of both in the background suggests this process may have begun.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e90822176c6891a976c0cdb6476a138873327d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e90822176c6891a976c0cdb6476a138873327d9/2_68_545_327/500.jpg\" alt=\"spiky drawing\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Calm, collected and determined to succeed </h2> <p><em>\u201cStill thoughts\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/elestial\">elestial</a></em></p> <p>This doodle grew slowly, line by line, creating a form that took on a life of its own, like an exotic plant or strange bird. It took a steady hand to draw this, most probably a woman\u2019s as curves represent typically feminine traits.<br></p> <p>Cool, calm and collected is how she is likely to appear, judging by this beautifully smooth and self-contained drawing. The exceptional control and finesse in this elegant, formal design shows she has high standards and likes to be in control, so takes great pains over preparation and presentation. The sharp points and fine lines dissecting the interior indicate that she has a keenly critical, analytical mind and demands much of herself. And the exterior beak-like shapes, with their dark shading hinting at underlying aggression, show she is determined to succeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b99c6b744eaf17f97221bcd6d10424e27a5d12d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b99c6b744eaf17f97221bcd6d10424e27a5d12d/79_44_422_528/400.jpg\" alt=\"joybranigan\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>High intellect introvert</h2> <p>\u201c<em>It starte</em><em>d with the central square when I started my working life 27 years ago and has developed since then\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/joybranigan\">joybranigan</a></em></p> <p>A highly developed intellect is indicated by this constellation of triangles and stars that appears to float in space. It shows exceptional clarity of thinking, ability to understand abstract concepts and good powers of reasoning, analysis and organisation. The straight lines and heavy infill indicate she also has strong willpower, but can lack flexibility.<br></p> <p>The integral spaces reflect the active inner life of an introvert who must have space to think and work. Dealing with people is not her strong point, but the growth of an outer ring to her doodle suggests she has widened her social circle.<br></p> <p>Triangles show energy and drive being channelled into work and achievement, but compression in the top right \u201conwards and upwards\u201d area shows tension associated with her career. Whether she is being held back or is holding herself back is unclear, but a clue may lie in the inner square which suggests security is still a concern for her.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d70ee857c54dc36d3a69d37f9614c35312807c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d70ee857c54dc36d3a69d37f9614c35312807c4/0_2_509_636/400.jpg\" alt=\"flower doodle\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Cheerful, confident and proud team player</h2> <p>\u201c<em>This doodle was during a recent, long telephone confere</em><em>nce call.

Flowers relate to people and rings of petals to social circles, so these groups of three and six may represent her family or team. The cheerful mood, upright stems and rising shape of the arrangement reflect self-confidence and pride in her family or achievements, while the balanced spacing is a sign of good teamwork.<br></p> <p>The orderly line of waves shows deep feelings kept well under control, persistence in the face of adversity and a strong sense of responsibility, but the butterflies suggest she would also like to be free to enjoy herself.<br></p> <p>Squares relate to material security and boxes to organisation and planning, so this tier of boxes suggests her career is very much part of her plan for the future. The variety of shapes they contain shows some mixed feelings, but her high hopes are reflected in the largest flower that resembles a shining sun.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dcabe5b0b93eb8bc0e6ac0114de4f4f8991d6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcabe5b0b93eb8bc0e6ac0114de4f4f8991d6a7/35_27_510_306/500.jpg\" alt=\"health insurance doodle\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Stressed and hungry for more rewarding work</h2> <p>\u201c<em>I work in a call centre for a health insurance company.

The roughly crossed mouth expresses their frustration and rage, the drooping moustache their despondency, the stitched-up cuts their scars and the haunted eyes their pain.<br></p> <p>Their pen goes round and round in circles as this person listens to the same sorry stories, but it helps their concentration as they diligently persist with repetitive tasks. Nevertheless, the large head with eyes looking up suggests they have confidence in their abilities, so are setting their sights on a higher position for themselves. Drawing off the top of the page shows they feel limited and want to break into something new. At the moment this stress is finding an outlet in this disturbing doodle, but it may also be prompting them to take action to find more rewarding work.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf1f72c35c6a07bf2aed7a58ba470bef56ad3914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1f72c35c6a07bf2aed7a58ba470bef56ad3914/0_23_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"eye doodle\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Optimistic but frustrated and looking for new challenges</h2> <p>\u201c<em>The most common thing for me to d</em><em>raw is an eye or pair of eyes.

There is optimism in this bright eye, but sadness in its dark colour and lines beneath, frustration in the roughly drawn upper lashes and anxiety in the peripheral shading. She may feel overlooked and want the opportunity to shine.<br></p> <p>The rapid, simple sketch of a broad nose and closed mouth shows her intelligence, discretion, drive and efficiency in being able to recognise what is essential and prioritise. The holly with its cluster of berries, soft prickles and extended leaves suggests she has an affectionate nature as well as a sharp mind, and may be looking out for something more challenging and enjoyable to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb115be9df7a93cf7f40ca520cd5f7686f36d963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb115be9df7a93cf7f40ca520cd5f7686f36d963/25_0_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"blue biro doodle\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Diligent but restless</h2> <p>\u201c<em>This doodle started small and simple, but grew little-by-little with every client call.

This carefully worked drawing with its smooth unbroken lines shows great concern over presentation and correctness, with close attention to finer points and details. Patterns of checks and parallel lines indicate that routine work is approached diligently and tasks carried out in a disciplined, methodical way.<br></p> <p>However, the movement in the waving tentacles and lively variety of patterns suggest this person is also restless and finding work dull, so is putting out feelers and considering options. The horn shape rising to the edge of the page shows ambition and desire to move on, but the coils turning this way and that reflect mixed feelings and uncertainty as to which direction to take.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>In the Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya, when the fierce heat of the sun has softened into a gentle evening glow, David Daballen and I climb into a jeep to find some elephants.<br></p> <p>As we drive through the savannah, Daballen, a conservationist at Save the Elephants, points out family groups and individuals within them. \u201cThese are the Butterflies, this group is Storms, here are the Spices,\u201d he says. We have been looking out for Cinnamon, the Spices\u2019 matriarch, and suddenly there she is: around 50 years old, huge and tuskless, having been born without any precious ivory. Close to her is Habiba, who was orphaned along with seven siblings when poachers killed their mother in 2011. The orphans were adopted by Cinnamon and the rest of the Spices.<br></p> <p>Daballen reckons he can identify and name between 400 and 500 elephants. In the jeep, he keeps up a stream of names. \u201cThat\u2019s Jonathan,\u201d he says as we spot an elephant\u2019s rear end, some 50 metres away. How can he tell one from another? \u201cLook at their ear patterns: the nicks and holes and tears. Look at their tusks: some are short, some are long, some are curved, some are straight. Look at the pigmentation: some have pink skin, some are light, some are dark. But also look at their faces. They are like our faces, every one is individual.\u201d It\u2019s not just physical characteristics that are distinguishing, he adds. \u201cWhen you spend time with elephants you understand they all have different personalities. They get into your mind. I probably know more elephants than people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/26/160826Elephant1_V3_4M_vp8.webm\" data-alt=\"Rollover to play video\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/26/160826Elephant1_V3_4M_vp8.webm\">Rollover to play video</a> <figcaption>\u2018When you spend time with elephants you understand they all have different personalities,\u2019 says Daballen.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Daballen\u2019s colleagues tells me later that the recognition and respect is mutual. \u201cThe elephants trust him, they will come to him,\u201d she says. Indeed, one evening our jeep, parked with the engine switched off, is surrounded by a dozen elephants, nudging against the vehicle, trunks nosing almost under our tyres to find clumps of grass, their eyes slowly blinking as they meet ours. It\u2019s a magical moment.</p> <p>After the group moves on, we drive back though near-darkness without headlights. Daballen navigates the jeep between thorn bushes and over furrows, guided by a rising moon and his intimate knowledge of the terrain.</p> <p>At 36, Daballen has spent 16 years working for <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/\">Save the Elephants</a> (STE), and the 20 years before that living among them and other wild animals in the village of Marsabit, some 200km north of Samburu. When he was a child, he tells me, \u201cthere were a huge number of elephants up there, but they\u2019ve been devastated by poaching.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"80ae82f003758760ed7f8acad05ec869c65ad509\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ae82f003758760ed7f8acad05ec869c65ad509/0_306_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Samburu National Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1800 there may have been 26 million elephants in Africa alone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would often encounter the animals walking to and from school, or while herding his father\u2019s cows and goats. \u201cEvery other day we would be chased by elephants. At first it was frightening, and then it became a game,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI grew up close to them. Wildlife was part of us, part of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>After finishing high school, he went to join his older brother, who was by then working for the Kenya Wildlife Service in Samburu. One day Daballen saw a jeep with a Save the Elephants logo on the side. Curious, he discovered the organisation researched elephants \u2013 how they live, and how they die.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are a crucial part of the ecosystem, and an iconic species.

Then it was just two tents and a vehicle \u2013 almost nothing. I spent two months with them, then two months became four months, and four months became a year, and then they never let me go.\u201d Now, he adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s very likely I\u2019ll spend my life doing this.\u201d</p> <p>During Daballen\u2019s time at STE, the tents have become a cluster of rudimentary eco offices, communal areas for meeting and eating, and cabins for sleeping. The one vehicle has become a fleet of battered jeeps and a Cessna 185 for aerial surveillance and transport across the vast tracts of savannah and hills in northern Kenya. Daballen the intern has become head of field operations, and an eloquent ambassador for the elephants of Samburu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46efd215d9c967de02f24a53f3cffd04b81f1613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46efd215d9c967de02f24a53f3cffd04b81f1613/0_406_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Samburu National Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservationist David Daballen says he can name up to 500 elephants in the Samburu reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at the research station, he elaborates on his love of the creatures. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt so many things from them. The love and compassion they have for one another. Human love is very conditional, but theirs is unconditional. They are so close, they really care for one another \u2013 better than humans in many ways. The energy and excitement they show when they meet family members, even after a short period. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u2018oh my god, where have you been?\u2019 They are clever, intelligent creatures. They can navigate over huge distances and remember their routes and safe places. They mourn their dead. They are a crucial part of the ecosystem, and an iconic species.

A phone call from the rangers\u2019 commander quickly followed. His message: poachers are shooting elephants, bring reinforcements.</p> <p>Daballen and his colleagues immediately rushed to STE\u2019s research camp in Samburu. As the word spread quickly through the wildlife protection network, rangers and anti-poachers from the local community gathered, ready to help. Among them was Chris Leadismo, the organisation\u2019s military-trained security liaison officer.</p> <p>Leadismo and six others, armed with G3 automatic rifles, headed south. Knowing the poachers would hear the vehicles approach, they left their jeep on a dirt road and continued in silence, pausing periodically to listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70f2b24d294f9262ab46584502ddae0236fd6081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f2b24d294f9262ab46584502ddae0236fd6081/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant skull Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory between 2010 and 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe rangers were crawling through the grass, inching forward, lying still, taking one more step, lying still. It\u2019s a game of who sees who first \u2013 and it was now getting dark,\u201d says Daballen. Two groups of heavily armed men, a herd of threatened elephants, poor visibility; danger was all around.</p> <p>The poachers had separated a big bull elephant with long valuable tusks from the females. As the terrified females fled, another six shots rang out. \u201cThe rangers could hear the bull making death sounds \u2013 a loud rumble. Then they saw him. He was standing, but barely,\u201d says Daballen.</p> <p>Using night vision binoculars, Leadismo could see blood pouring from the bullet wounds in the elephant\u2019s head and body. \u201cHe was full of blood, it was everywhere,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rangers could hear the bull making death sounds \u2013 a loud rumble</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The poachers and the rangers were aware of each other\u2019s presence and knew that any movement could start a gunfight. The night crept on in wary limbo.</p> <p>\u201cThe guys are lying on the ground in pitch black, not moving, not talking, no torches \u2013 nothing,\u201d says Daballen. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous out there at night. Then suddenly one of the rangers was bitten by a scorpion, and he cried out. That was the poachers\u2019 luck.\u201d In the commotion and darkness, the villains made their escape.</p> <p>By then, Koitelel, a 30-year-old elephant, was dead with 16 bullet wounds in his carcass. The rangers carefully removed his tusks for safe storage and left his body for the hyenas. <br></p> <p>Now, two years later, Koitelel\u2019s bleached skull and bones still lie scattered amid the thorn bushes, a poignant memorial to an Africa-wide orgy of elephant killing, which some believe is threatening the very survival of the species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"040c2f0b904a5e3ec2abf1f4a0af9096cdc729c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040c2f0b904a5e3ec2abf1f4a0af9096cdc729c7/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants at the Samburu National Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year, more elephants were killed for their ivory than were born.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The ivory conflict</h2> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Across the continent, elephant poaching is happening on an industrial scale. According to the shocking results of <a href=\"http://www.greatelephantcensus.com/\">one study</a>, released today, the population of savannah elephants declined by 30% between 2007 and 2014. There are roughly 400,000 savannah elephants left and that number is falling by 8% per year. </p> <p>Vulcan\u2019s* Great Elephant Census gathered detailed statistics over two years by flying over and counting herds of elephants as they roam the plains beneath. Dead elephants are counted too. A \u201ccarcass rate\u201d (the ratio of living to dead) of more than 8% indicates poaching at a high enough level to cause the population to decline. In Mozambique and Angola, the rate was more than 30%. Among Cameroon\u2019s small elephant herd it was 83%. </p> <p>Other research has come up with similarly bleak findings. A 2014 <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/36/13117.abstract\">scientific study</a> estimated that 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory between 2010 and 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\" data-alt=\"Current range of African elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\">Current range of African elephants</a> </figure>  <p>The rest of Africa\u2019s elephants are forest elephants and they are by definition harder to count. Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/african-forest-elephants-extinction-study\">study released this week</a> found these creatures to be one of the slowest reproducing mammals. Even if poaching stopped tomorrow, it might take 90 years for forest elephants to recover to their 2002 population.</p> <p>\u201cThis is largely due to poaching,\u201d says Chris Thouless, a conservationist who works with STE as a strategic adviser and who contributed to the status report. We meet over tea and home-baked cookies at his house overlooking the Borana private reserve, 10 minutes\u2019 flying time south of Samburu. </p> <p>Like diamonds and other valuable minerals, ivory is at the heart of a conflict over Africa\u2019s natural resources; a war prosecuted by organised crime syndicates motivated by the enormous profits to be made from illegal poaching, smuggling and trading.<br></p> <p>In the early years of this conflict, demand for ivory came mainly from Europe, America and Japan, fuelling a genocide that saw the African elephant population fall from a conservative estimate of 1.3 million in 1979 to less than half that within a decade. Some 700 tonnes of mostly illegal ivory \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23504364_Banking_on_extinction_ivory_storage_and_elephant_conservation\">equivalent of tusks from about 70,000 elephants</a> \u2013 were leaving Africa each year, most of it heading for China to be processed and re-exported to markets elsewhere.</p> <p>But in 1989, the <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) banned ivory trading, and the next 15-20 years saw a hiatus in the elephant slaughter. The population showed incipient signs of recovery.</p> <p>Ten years ago, however, the killing started again, this time stoked by rising demand in China itself as a result of its booming economy and its burgeoning moneyed elite. Now China is the end destination for 70% of illegal ivory; its price tripled between 2012 and 2014, reaching a peak of $2,200 (\u00a31,675) per kilo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not like the battle has been won \u2013 the threat is still very real \u2013 but it\u2019s not on the scale of a few years ago</p> <footer> <cite>Chris Thouless</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some countries the slaughter has reached an obliterative scale. Mozambique and Tanzania, both significant elephant countries, <a href=\"http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-08-30-counting-africas-beleaguered-elephants-massive-two-year-census-finds-alarming-declines/#.V8bFeDYrKcY\">lost 53% and 60% of their elephants in just five years</a>. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the elephant population has been almost eliminated. Central African Republic has lost almost all its savannah elephants. Sudan, Zimbabwe and Gabon are among countries that have seen widespread killing. Last year, some 20,000 elephants were being killed for their tusks in Africa \u2013 more than were born. In Asia, the other great homeland for elephants, it\u2019s estimated that <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0\">fewer than 50,000 remain</a>, a decline of 50% in the past 100 years.

We\u2019ve come through the eye of the storm \u2013 but that\u2019s not the case across Africa.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/23/share-your-encounters-with-elephants\">Share your encounters with elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Thouless, \u201cpoaching is still a real issue, but [in Kenya] it\u2019s under control. One doesn\u2019t want to talk about acceptable levels of poaching, but poaching is no longer driving elephant levels down. It\u2019s not like the battle has been won \u2013 the threat is still very real \u2013 but it\u2019s not on the scale of a few years ago.\u201d</p> <p>And, he adds, although elephant killing is down in Kenya, the country is still a key component in the smuggling routes out of Africa to Asia. \u201cSome of the biggest smuggling networks are based in Kenya. [The port of] Mombasa remains a huge suction point for ivory, particularly from Tanzania.\u201d</p> <p>There are a number of intertwined reasons why poaching has been contained in Kenya over the past two years. A key global factor is the slump in the price of raw ivory in China following an agreement signed jointly by the US and Chinese presidents in September 2014, pledging to end the ivory trade and as a result of the faltering Chinese economy. The price per kilo has fallen from $2,200 to $1,100 \u2013 although, says Thouless, it is still at a level \u201cwe\u2019d have been horrified at five years ago\u201d and \u201cit hasn\u2019t come down enough to act as a deterrent\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bda7cbb463fca9658520bfca029d17186fe043cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bda7cbb463fca9658520bfca029d17186fe043cd/0_406_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"schoolchildren Nasuulu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooperation between local communities and conservationists is vital to preserve elephants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But local changes have been hugely significant. The Kenyan government has shown a political will to act against poachers and enforce justice. In April, the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/kenya-to-burn-largest-ever-ivory-stockpile-to-highlight-elephants-fate\">ceremonially burned more than 100 tonnes of extremely valuable ivory</a>; in July, syndicate leader <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-crime-poaching-idUSKCN1021YT\">Feisal Mohamed Ali was sent to prison for 20 years and fined $200,000</a>. Public opposition to the ivory trade has grown, and cooperation between conservationists and local communities has had a dramatic impact.</p> <p>This last factor is crucial, says David Daballen. Persuading nomadic communities and local farmers of the merits of conservation has, he says, taken time. In nearby Nusuulu, where ivory poaching was rife a few years ago, it took a year to persuade elders from four tribes to come together and agree to create a conservation area on their land. \u201cIt means sitting under a tree for days and days and days \u2013 people talking, yelling, fighting \u2013 until sense prevails,\u201d says Daballen.</p> <p>Since the Nasuulu conservancy was created in 2011, large-scale elephant killing has stopped, security has improved and inter-tribe conflict has declined. A dozen or so local men are employed as rangers, scouts or drivers. Software is being developed to warn farmers when elephants are close so they can protect crops. STE has launched a scholarship programme for bright children in Nasuulu and other local conservancies. And, a mobile education unit leads classes and field trips to teach children how people and elephants can and should coexist in harmony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fde1545635a1ad7810b2d37e07cc962ee179d070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fde1545635a1ad7810b2d37e07cc962ee179d070/0_241_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Samburu National Reserve, elephants in the river\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Samburu National Reserve is situated on the banks of the Ewaso Ng\u2019iro river in Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A humbling effect</h2> <p>On my last day we take to the air.

In less than a minute we\u2019re airborne over Samburu and the neighbouring reserve, Buffalo Springs, scanning the savannah below for elephants.</p> <p>The plane is used to monitor and track elephants in a complementary operation to the ground excursions. In Samburu, 60 elephants have been tranquillised \u2013 in often difficult circumstances \u2013 to allow loose collars with GPS devices to be fitted, making these northern Kenyan elephants the most closely monitored in Africa. The signal is beamed to a satellite and back to STE\u2019s research camp, giving regularly updated locations for the elephants which are transmitted via an app to the staff\u2019s phones and tablets.</p> <p>But Douglas-Hamilton has accidentally left his phone on the ground, so we are freewheeling over the savannah, relying on our eyes. He points out an area vacated by a group of nomads to allow the elephants free range. \u201cThese sorts of compromises are essential between elephant and man,\u201d he says. When we spot a group of elephants, Douglas-Hamilton executes a stomach-heaving turn to get a closer look. He wants to note where they are, how many are in the group, which family it is, how close they are to water, livestock and people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/30/160826Elephant6_h264_mezzanine_4M_vp8-1.webm\" data-alt=\"Rollover to play video\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/30/160826Elephant6_h264_mezzanine_4M_vp8-1.webm\">Rollover to play video</a> <figcaption>Though poaching is a major issue for elephants, urbanisation poses another risk to their survival.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 74, Douglas-Hamilton has devoted his life to elephants.

He founded <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/about-ste/\">Save the Elephants in 1993</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve focussed on elephants all my working life. But you also have to get deeply interested in politics, community issues, human welfare \u2013 because man is the most important determinant of the elephant\u2019s future,\u201d he says. Ensuring a future for elephants and their environment means creating positive co-existence between humans and elephants \u2013 and this will become increasingly important with the exponential growth of the human population across the continent, which is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34188248\">expected to double to 2.5 billion between now and 2050</a>.</p> <p>His brother-in-arms Thouless also expounds on the relationship between the growing population and economies of African countries and its wildlife. As conservationists, he says: \u201cWe may have to curb our ambitions. It\u2019s not just the increased number of people, it\u2019s also the increased footprint of those people as you get economic development. Poaching dominates our thoughts, but the implications of plans for transcontinental railways, roads and pipelines are massive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elephants have a humbling effect on humans; they make us realise that perhaps we are not the masters of the universe</p> <footer> <cite>Chris Thouless</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcbff779240035521984a458319988a1877dc0cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcbff779240035521984a458319988a1877dc0cc/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"elephant foot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re in danger of throwing away three billion years of evolution.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt may be unrealistic to expect vast untrammelled landscapes across which elephants can move freely.

If you\u2019d never seen an elephant, and encountered one, you\u2019d think it was absolutely amazing, like a dinosaur. They are a window into our past.

What might be a challenge in Ghana, they\u2019ve already found a solution [for] in Tanzania.

Frequent exposure to open water sources for bathing and washing, coupled with little or no education about how to swim, mean that daily tasks can quickly become fatal: in one village in Tamil Nadu, India, 90% of drowning deaths involved water in a pot, well or pond, <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/143893/1/9789241564786_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1\">the World Health Organisation (WHO) found</a>. <br></p> <p>But drowning rates are severely under-reported, experts believe.

Yet, the organisation claims that many of those who work in development \u2013 including NGOs, national governments and UN agencies \u2013 are largely unaware of these statistics and how they affect overall mortality levels, particularly those of children. <br></p> <p>Tackling child mortality is a target of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">sustainable development goals</a>, yet drowning \u2013 which kills nearly as many children as malnutrition \u2013 is not mentioned. In Bangladesh, where <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs347/en/\">drowning is the leading cause of death</a> for children aged one to 17, this is a major oversight, says Wills.</p> <p>Since the RNLI\u2019s international outreach programme began in 2012, more than 100 delegates from more than 30 countries have participated, learning about topics from water safety and aquatic survival, to beach lifeguarding, flood and maritime search and rescue, and equipment requirements. Every year, one or two delegates learn how to swim, RNLI staff say; Conteh is learning alongside a female Indonesian delegate.</p> <p>Very few participants have come from government-run search and rescue teams. Instead, most are volunteers from charity organisations and international groups, including the Red Cross, and rely on donor funds and donated equipment. <br></p> <p>In Brazil, for example, which boasts more than 4,600 miles of Atlantic coastline in addition to numerous rivers and vast waterways including the Amazon and Pantanal, drowning is a serious yet heavily under-reported issue, says participant Marcelo Ulyssea, who founded the rescue organisation <a href=\"http://www.anjosdomar.org/\">Sea Angel\u2019s Brazil Institute</a> in 2011. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/01/bangladesh-hidden-epidemic-children-drowning\">Bangladesh tackles 'hidden epidemic' of children drowning | Syed Zain Al-Mahmood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSafety is a cultural issue,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at the data, 90% of the drowning victims in Brazil are from lower-income families.

It\u2019s pretty long. Here are just a couple:</p> <h2><strong>On people illegally in the US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201cThey\u2019re treated better than our vets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the risk of being removed from the country.</p> <p>Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.</p> <p>The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.</p> <h2>On the number of people in the US illegally</h2> <p><strong>Trump:</strong> \u201cOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> The government actually has an idea. The homeland security department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.</p> <p>The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The government compares the number of people whom the census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government.</p> <p>Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7967be4b0df5f040dc160\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T03:00:52.067Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today in Campaign 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Let\u2019s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump\u2019s speech:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44/0_0_4128_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a \u201csoftening\u201d - as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential candidate in the modern era.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a \u201csunset\u201d on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don\u2019t deport undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to reporters after the speech\u2019s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen Bannon was instrumental in the speech\u2019s crafting.</p> <p>The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump\u2019s own aggressive rhetoric on undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general election.</p> <p>Not all conservatives are pleased, however.</p> <p>A member of Donald Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Extremely disappointed.</p>&mdash; Tony Suarez-NHCLC VP (@tonysuarez80) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c795c3e4b0f6cb85628bed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T02:45:53.618Z\">3.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Donald Trump, in conclusion:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.

And it must be solved - it must be solved quickly. Not fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber two: having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial. We rec the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, weapons and drugs,\u201d Trump said. The move is \u201cparamount to both the United States and to Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber three: Dismantling drug cartels,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis can only be done with cooperation, and intelligence and intelligence sharing.</p> <p>\u201cImproving Nafta, number four. Nafta is a 22-year-old agreement that must be update to reflect the realities of today,\u201d Trump said, which would make both countries \u201cstronger and keep industry in our hemisphere. We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world. Keep it in our hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber five: Keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere. When jobs leave Mexico, the US or Central America and go overseas, it increases poverty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bond between our two countries is deep and sincere, and both our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI call you a friend.

The visit is also a timely distraction from embarrassing reports, which have dominated recent headlines, that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">plagiarized</a> his law degree thesis. </p> <p>This week\u2019s bad press, which includes the <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20160830-mexico-federal-police-chief-sacked-drug-cartel-executions-michuacan\">sacking</a> of Mexico\u2019s police commissioner following allegations of cartel executions, follows months of looming scandals plaguing his own administration. These include large teacher strikes, allegations of the use of torture on ordinary citizens and most recently<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/mexico-first-lady-florida-property-government-contractor-documents-reveal\">reports</a> that the Mexican first lady\u2019s home is owned by a potential government contractor. All of the above have sent Mexican confidence in its president plunging.</p> <p>The embarrassing thing is that we can actually see Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s logic at work in real time as this disaster unfolds. The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy. There\u2019s only one problem with this plan. Trump may well hijack that narrative, frame the meeting to his advantage and then straight-up lie about the details in Arizona with a straight face.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/pena-nieto-mexico-visit-trump-approval-ratings-backfire\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto's making a dangerous gamble with Trump's Mexico visit | Daniel Pe\u00f1a</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:40:45.113Z\">at 6.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c70edae4b0f6cb85628b1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:11:10.748Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Democrats\u2019 <strong>efforts to swipe a US senate seat in Wisconsin are looking good,</strong> in a new Monmouth University poll of likely voters that has challenger (and former senator) Russ Feingold up 13 points, 54-41, on incumbent Republican Ron Johnson. </p> <p>Clinton leads Trump in the poll by a much smaller margin, five points, in a four-way race:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771031136751521792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wisconsin (Monmouth)<br><br>Clinton 43%<br>Trump 38%<br>Johnson 7%<br>Stein 3%</p>&mdash; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771031136751521792\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771032155409481728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last Republican to win WI was Reagan in 84, but there have been two very near-misses: W lost by 5k votes (0.2%) in &#39;00 and 11k (0.4%) in &#39;04</p>&mdash; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771032155409481728\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771032339099033600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Solid result for Trump, through mainly bc Clinton low <a href=\"https://t.co/ZeYyxRdbYF\">https://t.co/ZeYyxRdbYF</a></p>&mdash; Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771032339099033600\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cThe current presidential election race in Wisconsin is looking a lot like the 2012 contest right now,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.</p> <p><strong>Update: and Marquette University </strong>has issued a new poll, minutes after the Monmouth poll, with a five-point lead for Clinton among registered voters in Wisconsin but only a three-point lead among likely voters:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pbump/status/771035873509052416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Marquette in Wisc.: <br>Clinton +5 (RV)<br>Clinton +3 (LV)<br>Was Clinton +15 w/ LV on 8/7, Clinton +4 w/ LV on 7/10<br>Farewell, convention bump.</p>&mdash; Philip Bump (@pbump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pbump/status/771035873509052416\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MULawPoll/status/771036116199804928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Huge percentage&quot; of electorate not supporting any of the four candidates, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PollsAndVotes\">@PollsAndVotes</a> says. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mulawpoll?src=hash\">#mulawpoll</a></p>&mdash; MULawPoll (@MULawPoll) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MULawPoll/status/771036116199804928\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:30:30.875Z\">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c70d32e4b04fe839bc5303\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:01:17.945Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former president Fox stays after Trump on Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/771029599098589184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> will explain the &quot;unexplainable&quot;?

  "<p>More than 3,500 churches across Britain have moved their electricity supply to renewables, or are planning to do so, according to data released on Thursday.</p> <p>Those switching away from fossil fuels include the majority of the Salvation Army\u2019s sites, about a third of Quaker meeting houses, and about 2,000 churches belonging to 16 Catholic dioceses which are running entirely on renewable energy.</p> <p>The number represents a relatively small proportion of the <a href=\"http://faithsurvey.co.uk/download/csintro2.pdf\">50,000 Christian churches estimated to be active across the UK</a>.</p> <p>Fitting churches with renewable energy generation devices, such as solar panels, mini wind turbines and ground or air-source heat pumps, is often difficult, owing to the expense and fact that many are listed buildings. However, parishes can also opt to buy their electricity from green suppliers. Much of the energy used by churches is for heating.</p> <p>The move follows an increasing focus on climate change and the environment in recent years, and the data publication is timed for the <a href=\"http://catholicclimatemovement.global/world-day-of-prayer/\">World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation</a>, which takes place on Thursday.</p> <p>Many of the Catholic dioceses making the switch were influenced by the Pope\u2019s encyclical last year, <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">Laudato Si</a>, in which the pontiff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/popes-climate-change-encyclical-calls-on-rich-nations-to-pay-social-debt\">expressed his concerns over global warming</a> and the harm that our activities are bringing to the natural environment. Pope Francis has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/guardian-view-on-laudato-si-pope-francis-cultural-revolution\">particularly concerned over the plight of poor people around the world</a>, who are among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/31/climate-change-poor-suffer-most-un-report\">most vulnerable to climate change</a>, and has called on the rich to provide assistance.</p> <p>John Arnold, bishop of Salford, which is one of the dioceses, called on other churches to follow suit in moving to renewable power: \u201cThere are many ways in which we respond to the threat and reality of climate change. Adopting renewable energy for our church buildings must be a priority [and by doing so] we will directly help people threatened, and already most severely affected, by climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Others have signed up through the <a href=\"http://www.bigchurchswitch.org.uk\">www.bigchurchswitch.org.uk</a> website, the brainchild of the Christian Aid and Tearfund charities.</p> <p>The new day of prayer for creation has been designated as the start of the <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/media/.../creationtide_and_environment_resources....\">\u201cCreationtide\u201d</a> season, running from 1 Septemberto 4 October this year, which will incorporate the traditional - and more familiar to many - festivals to celebrate the harvest, which often involve gifts of farm produce to the poor in parishes throughout the UK.</p> <p>Nicholas Holtam, bishop of Salisbury, and the lead for the Church of England on environmental issues, said: \u201cCelebrating Creationtide marks a shift in the Christian understanding of our relationship to creation under God. The consequences of teaching over recent centuries that humanity has been given domination over creation are clear in the complex environmental crises we now face.

  "<p>The government is falling behind on its commitments to switch a proportion of Britain\u2019s car fleet to electric vehicles, an influential committee of MPs said on Thursday.</p> <p>Take-up of electric vehicles has been slower than hoped in the UK, but the technology is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, and tackling the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/15/diesel-vehicles-take-record-share-of-the-market-on-londons-roads\">air pollution produced by the increased number of diesel cars on the road</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/.../ulev-2015-2020.pdf\">According to the guideline target recommended by the government\u2019s climate advisors</a>, ultra-low emission vehicles such as electric cars should make up 9% of the fleet by 2020, but current forecasts by the Department for Transport (DfT) show the figure by the end of the decade is likely to be about half that. Ministers have not said what should happen if the target is not met, nor produced a plan for beyond 2020.</p> <p>Parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee said ministers were failing to put forward the incentives and infrastructure needed to encourage drivers into electric cars, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/london-takes-just-one-week-to-breach-annual-air-pollution-limits\">air pollution was breaching regulations</a>, with 38 of 43 clean air zones exceeding acceptable levels of nitrogen oxides.</p> <p>In addition, the committee said the lessons of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars\">Volkswagen emissions scandal</a>, in which the manufacturer was found to have cheated on tests to make vehicles seem greener than they really were, had not been learned. Affected models were only starting to be withdrawn from the market, the MPs were told.</p> <p>Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the committee, said: \u201cThe uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles is too low to meet the UK\u2019s climate change targets at the lowest cost to the public. Air quality targets that were supposed to be met in 2010 won\u2019t be hit until 2020 at the earliest. And it\u2019s been almost a year since we discovered VW had fitted cars with cheat devices, but the government has still to decide what action to take against the company.\u201d</p> <p>Electric vehicles do not produce emissions at the point of use, and the UK\u2019s electricity sector is becoming lower-carbon through the increased use of gas and renewable energy. They are <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/charts-data/ukemissions-by-sector/transport/\">one of the few options for removing carbon from transport</a>.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the industry in the UK, told the Guardian that manufacturers were investing billions of pounds in developing new electric and hybrid models, pointing to the rise in the range of makes available from five in 2011 to more than 30 at present. He urged ministers to provide more incentives to drivers.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe welcome the committee\u2019s call for policy and fiscal certainty to drive the uptake of ULEVs [ultra-low emission vehicles], which will help the government meet its air quality and climate targets. Given this is still nascent technology which carries a price premium, the committee\u2019s call for support across government, from the Treasury to DfT, to help stimulate market demand, is well made.\u201d</p> <p>Nissan, which manufactures the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/09/nissan-leaf-car-review-zoe-williams\">Leaf car</a>, told the Guardian that sales were progressing well and that it expected further acceleration in future. An important advance, the company said, was that 98% of motorway service stations were now equipped with rapid chargers, a key consideration for drivers, and by 2020 it expected charging stations to outnumber fossil fuel filling stations.</p> <p>Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, which runs the Electric Highway charging network, added: \u201cWe share the committee\u2019s concern over the vagueness of the 2020 target for ULEVs - that target is a loose range, the mid-point of which is barely half what the Committee on Climate Change has said is required to keep us on track for our 2050 carbon targets. The government urgently needs to write our existing EU targets on renewable energy and air quality into UK law and set out clear policies for achieving them.\u201d</p> <p>The committee also called for a new target for two-thirds of cars and vans to be ultra-low emissions by 2030. Car manufacturers, including Nissan, would be given a greater incentive to manufacture such vehicles in the UK if clearer signals were evident in government policy, said Creagh.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth said the government should go further still, to have a hope of halting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/nearly-9500-people-die-each-year-in-london-because-of-air-pollution-study\">public health crisis from air pollution</a>, which claims tens of thousands of lives a year and affects the quality of life of many more.</p> <p>Jenny Bates, campaigner, said: \u201cRoad traffic [is] the biggest problem, and diesel the worst of all. [The government] must create a plan for phasing out diesel use on Britain\u2019s roads, along with cutting traffic levels and preventing road-building adding to the problem. We know it can be done: the Netherlands and Norway are planning a ban on new diesel and petrol cars from 2025, which large parts of Copenhagen are traffic free.\u201d</p> <p>Air quality targets, set by the EU, were also at risk following Brexit, according to the report, entitled Sustainability in the Department for Transport. There has been no certainty yet from government as to whether these targets will be retained in UK law.</p> <p>The committee also called on ministers to set out a clear plan for dealing with the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal, which could include bringing a prosecution against the company, and for the rail industry to clarify its steps towards reducing emissions, particularly from diesel locomotives.</p> <p>Creagh said the government should redraw the priorities for the DfT to give greater weight to environmental issues. \u201cTransport authorities throughout England have told us they have had problems with getting sustainable transport projects off the ground, because the DfT places more importance on economic benefits rather than the health benefits of improving air quality.\u201d</p> <p>The DfT said it was committing \u00a3600m over the current parliament to encouraging ultra low emission vehicles, for instance through grant schemes.</p> <p>While the target of 9% of vehicles being low emissions by 2020 is endorsed by the Committee on Climate Change, a department spokesman pointed out that the government\u2019s own aim is much lower, at between 3% and 7% of vehicles by the same date. The lower end of this target is forecast to be met.</p> <p>\u201cWe see ultra-low emission vehicles as the future of road travel and we have set goals for almost all cars and vans on our roads to be zero-emission by 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are confident there will be significant further growth in the market.\u201d</p> <p>On the VW scandal, the spokesman said ministers took the matter \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and the department was calling for a Europe-wide investigation, for VW to resolve the issue for affected consumers, and for better tests that reflect real-world performance.<br></p>",
  "<p>Two centuries ago, after the Napoleonic wars had laid waste to large parts of central Europe, the continent\u2019s rulers decided to redraw the border between Austria and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> along the Saalach river, right between Salzburg and one of its suburbs, now a Bavarian town called Freilassing. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria\">Austria</a> joined the Schengen area in 1995, the border in effect became obsolete: only a short white line in the middle of the motorway bridge still marks the division between the two countries.</p> <p>But a year ago this month, the Freilassing bridge once again become a symbol of the barriers between nations and cultures.

He claimed he was spat at and threatened with a knife when handing out bottles of water, and one night heard shots on the bridge \u2013 police insist the banging sound was created by a van running over a traffic cone. </p> <p>\u201cGenerators were running 24 hours a day and made my bedroom vibrate. I bought this house with my own money, and as a carer it\u2019s not like I earn \u20ac5,000 a month.\u201d<br></p> <p>Borchers said he remembered \u201cpositive moments\u201d from his week of volunteering, but in the coming weeks he became more and more disillusioned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything to do with politics, but I called the Social Democrats to complain, I called the mayor of Freilassing, and I called the district office, but none of them would listen to me.\u201d Then, he said, he called a nearby branch of Germany\u2019s new rightwing anti-immigration party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), \u201cand they took the time to listen\u201d. He has since joined the party.</p> <p>On 24 October, the AfD held a demonstration with more than 1,000 protesters and several hundred counter-demonstrators against Merkel\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d management of the crisis. </p> <p>A year on, Borchers said, his town feels \u201cscarred\u201d. \u201cMy neighbourhood is divided between left and right \u2013 there\u2019s nothing in between. You are either pro-refugee or against.\u201d</p> <p>Others in the town disagree. Mayor Josef Flatscher said descriptions of Freilassing as a town divided were \u201ccompletely over the top\u201d. Last September the politician, a member of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union party, was driving back from a family holiday in Italy when he heard the news of the resumption of border checks between Austria and Germany on the radio. But when he drove across the bridge into his hometown an hour later, there were no border guards to be seen.</p> <p>The next morning, local police set up makeshift patrols in the middle of the bridge. By the afternoon, they were replaced with members of the national police force, who still carry out sporadic border checks.</p> <p>Twelve months on, Flatscher said: \u201cI feel reassured about the situation in Freilassing, but of course we are keeping an eye on the broader macroclimate,\u201d pointing to news of 6,500 migrants being rescued off the Libyan coast in a single day this week. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop completely.

Having arrived in Germany in November 2014, the 21-year-old Syrian shares a room with three other young men, on the ground floor of a spacious three-storey house with a little garden and several large trees in the front, home to 60 refugees who have been located here while their asylum applications are being processed. The ground floor is reserved for men, one side for Arabic speakers, mainly from Syria, the other side for refugees who speak other languages, most of them from African countries.</p> <p>Last September and October, when about 1,500 refugees arrived on the bridge from Salzburg every day, Misho had already been in Germany for almost a year and spoke basic German. \u201cSo I went to the bridge to support volunteers who distributed food and clothes and to help with translations. Both German officials and refugees seemed grateful when I helped, but a few times it turned out that the presumed Syrians didn\u2019t speak any Arabic at all. I have no idea where they were from, but certainly not from Syria as they had claimed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-31T17:03:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-31T17:03:41/embed.html\">Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016</a> <figcaption>Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, the number of arrivals has dropped considerably.

But then I always just answer them in German and then they are intimidated and confused by the fact that I speak German. That is my best way to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of September, Misho is starting a new job in a restaurant at Chiemsee, a nearby lake and tourist destination. He would mainly be preparing salads, he said, but hoped he could work his way up.</p> <p>Yet not every refugee who made it across the Freilassing bridge has reason to be hopeful.

With a marker pen, he drew a fat A on the wrists of the first 10 people in the queue, then set up a dividing line on the ground. The next 10 got a B, the next 10 a C, and so on. Soon, M\u00fcller was on to decimal places.</p> <p>After a few days, one of the local papers likened M\u00fcller\u2019s system to the Nazis marking up Jewish prisoners in a concentration camp, which made the pensioner very cross. \u201cAll we were trying to do was to create a just, fair system,\u201d he said. The deputy mayor of Salzburg eventually donated boxes full of colourful wristbands normally used at political rallies, which M\u00fcller used instead.</p> <p>After months of volunteering, during which he often slept for little more than two to three hours a night in a makeshift bed in one of the camps, M\u00fcller is ambivalent about the future, drawn between sympathy for anyone trying to make their way into Germany and understanding for those who are worried about the long-term effects of immigration. \u201cYou have to respect everyone who doesn\u2019t want more refugees. We can manage this, but only if the population at large is involved in the process.\u201d</p> <p>With his vast archive of documents, wristbands and children\u2019s drawings, he plans to set up a museum in his home. \u201cSomeone has to keep the story of what happened here last year alive.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There was no pivoting. There was no softening.

He even seemed to indicate in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">he might support a path to legal status</a> for undocumented immigrants. He quickly <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">backed off</a> that statement \u2013 the result was a policy that looked like a muddled mess, as even rightwing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">admitted</a> of the nominee: \u201cI never took him seriously on immigration.\u201d </p> <p>There had been signs, too, of a moderate tone earlier on Wednesday when Trump met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press stop with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian crisis, claiming that he didn\u2019t discuss with the Mexican president his infamous pledge that Mexico would pay for a border wall.</p> <p>It turned out this was only technically true \u2013 there was no discussion, but only because the Mexican president had immediately begun their conversation by saying he would not pay.</p> <p>In his Phoenix speech Trump brushed all that off. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump renewed his call for what he called a deportation taskforce. Without using its title he yet again endorsed Operation Wetback, the infamous Eisenhower-era policy of mass deportation, while lamenting shortcomings. \u201cThey would drop them across, right across, and they\u2019d come back.\u201d Instead Trump pledged to take those he deported \u201cgreat distances\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He repeated testimonials from the parents of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants, using these to frame the issue not as humanitarian or even economic, but about crime and \u201cthe wellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>Trump did not explicitly call for the all-out deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 something he has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">signaled support</a> for in the past despite even most immigration hawks opposing the idea. But he still insisted: \u201cAnyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not touch on the controversial topic of birthright citizenship, which he has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/19/birthright-citizenship-history-law-donald-trump-republicans\">opposed in the past</a>, even to the point of claiming this constitutional provision can be reversed with an act of Congress \u2013 a view few credible legal scholars would endorse.</p> <p>The theater around the speech felt like a reversion to Trump\u2019s rowdy ways in the primary race. \u201cThis will not be a rally speech per se,\u201d he said at the outset. But nor was it a detailed policy rollout. Much of it comprised traditional talking points and railing against Hillary Clinton, while taking detours to mock \u201cmedia elites\u201d who viewed \u201cglobal warming\u201d as a problem.</p> <p>Down to the \u201cMake Mexico Great Again Also\u201d hats, worn by the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, it was a return to the unpredictable showmanship that has defined Trump\u2019s campaign. Red meat for his party\u2019s conservative base, with nothing to attract moderate suburbanites, let alone Latinos or African Americans, who have been alienated by his harsh rhetoric.</p> <p>It represented the final chapter in what has been a back and forth debate within his campaign about whether Trump should try to act like a conventional candidate or simply be himself. That debate outlasted multiple campaign managers, the Republican primary itself, and continued well into the general election.</p> <p>It is now over. There will not be a more moderate Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump.</p> <p>Instead the same candidate who announced that Mexicans are \u201cbringing drugs, bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists\u201d is the one who will appear before voters in November.</p>",
