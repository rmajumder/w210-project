But what we really want is drunk chicks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny particular sort of drunk chicks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, chicks off their faces with their skirts over their heads, or their face mashed into the grass, or spewing into a De Bortoli gift bag, or mounting bins, assaulting cops, or simulating fellatio with an empty Pringles container or falling over.

And the blokes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf a chick is mounting them or if they are covered in rubbish \u2013 like literally all over \u2013 and an ibis is eating their face off.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOright.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/rape-survivors-victims-activism-millennial-women\">'Breaking the shackles of shame': the rape survivors leading a new wave of activism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m imagining a conversation between a tabloid news editor and a photo agency ahead of Melbourne Cup day.</p> <p>The real sport is not the horse race anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the drunk chicks after 4pm. It\u2019s the hot, lukewarm and cold messes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve not read an interview with the jockey who won the cup but I\u2019ve seen at least two interviews with the 23-year-old \u201cbin rider\u201d \u2013 a racegoer who climbed on to a bin, and pretended to ride it like a horse. Pictures of her went viral on the internet. She told the Daily Mail, \u201cIt\u2019s just so embarrassing \u2013 all my family\u2019s going to see it.\u201d</p> <p>I loved her. She looked like she was having fun and she wasn\u2019t hurting anyone. </p> <p>But she had to take down her social media accounts after receiving \u201cnasty\u201d comments from strangers after the pictures were published. She told the Daily Mail she did not expect to be photographed while at the cup. LOL. How naive. She was a woman having an uninhibited good time. Of course in this day and age, without her consent she would be photographed, put on the internet and publicly shamed.</p> <p>Throughout history, public shame has been used to punish women who had not preserved their honour. In a primitive, pre-technical age, the criminal was place in a public seat \u2013 in a town square for instance \u2013 where they could be subject to scrutiny, judgment and the mob.</p> <p>After the second world war, women had their heads shaved and were paraded through the towns of France and Germany as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war\">a punishment for consorting with Nazis</a>. Shaving the heads of women as a public humiliation has biblical origins and has been used as a punishment in Europe since the dark ages. Nakedness or semi-undress was often packaged as part of public punishment \u2013 the exposed body itself becoming another site for shame. </p> <p>Now women who are seen to have abandoned their honour are shamed in the global public square of the internet. The photographs are taken from angles which emphasise exposure \u2013 from the front, when she is on the ground and her skirt has ridden up, or from the side when her dress straps have fallen down her shoulders and her chest is partially exposed.</p> <p>Women who may have agonised about their outfit, spent a tonne on their hat and hair, are \u2013 as depicted in these photos \u2013 brought low by their own hand. Often the photos are devoid of context. Have you tried wearing uncomfortable shoes for hours on end and then walking through the turf? You don\u2019t have to be drunk to fall over \u2013 even Gina Rinehart fell over \u2013 and the photographers were there to capture it, just as they captured her pre-fall \u201cshowing off her curves in a white dress\u201d.</p> <p>On the internet, we are invited to scrutinise and judge these degraded women. The comments section below is a good place to throw metaphorical rotten fruit.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there were lots of men getting trolleyed but type \u201cdrunk people at the Melbourne Cup\u201d into a search engine and the majority of pictures will be of women.</p> <p>Where are the blokes? Where is the equal opportunity shaming?</p> <p>As a society, we\u2019re used to the drunk man \u2013 at the races, at the football, at the pub. But the drunk woman still holds our attention,<strong> </strong>and \u2013 in some quarters \u2013 is still blamed for any crime committed against her while intoxicated. Complicated feelings are unleashed.</p> <p>French philosopher Rene Girard  was writing about society\u2019s need for a scapegoat 40 years ago. The scapegoat is a representative who must be subject to violence in order to restore order out of chaos. Societies\u2019 need for somebody to blame is deeply coded. </p> <p>He could have been writing about the internet age when he wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are all going to gather against the same opponent, they gather speeds and ultimately one victim must be killed and this is what I call the scapegoat.</p> </blockquote> <p>We have to have a scapegoat on Melbourne Cup day because we get off our collective tits and the results can be ugly. It\u2019s good to have someone who is perhaps in worse shape than us, whom we can hide behind.</p> <p>On Melbourne Cup day we create an environment \u2013 all around the nation \u2013 that is conducive to people getting really drunk. The Melbourne Cup bin rider told the Daily Mail, that \u201cfree champagne on the day had contributed to her inebriated state\u201d. </p> <p> The Birdcage \u2013 the posh enclosure at the Melbourne Cup \u2013 is a drunk\u2019s dream, with an unlimited open bar and specialty cocktails. If you are with friends trackside or in the carpark, it is considered good hospitality to have an inexhaustible supply of alcohol.</p> <p>You can be a thousand miles away from the Melbourne Cup and alcohol is still flowing. We create these conditions for drunkenness and then expect women to self-regulate and act like something from the 1950s in the ladies\u2019 lounge \u2013 sipping quietly on their shandies. Well that horse has bolted. </p> <p>If drunk women at the races so shocks us, then shouldn\u2019t we dig deeper and ask why it is that we celebrate in this way? And why it is that we drink too much and why is booze and sport intertwined and why are we never really taught to drink properly? </p> <p>It happens when you are young behind the hall at the school disco: quickly and roughly, a shot of this mixed with a slug of that, down the hatch before teacher comes, drink it all up, dance, then fall down. That is how it goes \u2013 that and the fake IDs and the parties when the parents are away. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/07/almost-half-of-young-australian-adults-binge-drink-every-month-report-says\">Almost half of young Australian adults binge-drink every month, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, before we know it, we are unleashed on the world and taught that drinking on Australia Day, Anzac Day, any national holiday, and while watching any kind of sport, is part of what makes us Australian.</p> <p>In our grown-up heels and cocktail dresses, in our fancy hats and the plastic glass filled with \u2026 something \u2026 in the midday sun, we have no idea how to regulate ourselves. We ride bins, and forget to eat, and have one more for horse and one more for the road. Some of us get in fights.</p> <p>Many of us, men and women, need a lesson in boozing properly, particularly now, as party season kicks in in earnest \u2013 and the type of behaviour we see at the Melbourne Cup (and much worse) is on the streets, at taxi ranks, in pubs and restaurants and clubs.</p> <p>The big department stores are filled with stylists to advise on the hats. What we need is a booze consultant. </p> <p>Until then, all we have is the tabloids holding up the dirty mirror. They are a regulator, our judge and jury, our court of final appeal.

  "<p>Marjorie Greenfield has many stories to tell about how employers are failing to create a workplace that encourages women to excel.</p> <p>Greenfield, author of The Working Women\u2019s Pregnancy Book, recalls an interview with a female pilot who worked for an airline that didn\u2019t allow women to fly during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy because of morning sickness and fatigue. The first time the pilot became pregnant, she notified her boss immediately and was taken off work, despite feeling fine.</p> <p>So when she was pregnant with her second child, she kept the news secret until her second trimester so she could continue working.</p> <p>The story of the pilot shows the complexity of finding the right approach to help employees balance work and pregnancy without making them feel unproductive or worse \u2013 less competent. Failing to do so could cost employers significant money: <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-right-and-wrong-ways-to-help-pregnant-workers\">a new study</a> found that the more help a pregnant woman received at work, the more she wanted to quit her job after her baby was born.</p> <p>\u201cThere are unintended consequences of well intentioned efforts to support women,\u201d said Judith Clair, associate professor in the management and organization department at Boston College in Massachusetts and co-author of the study. \u201cSome of those efforts can backfire.\u201d</p> <p>Clair and her three co-authors tracked 120 working pregnant women and had them fill out weekly surveys about their experiences at work. They then followed up with the women nine months after their babies were born to see how the support that they received at work while pregnant influenced their career decisions postpartum.</p> <p>The study found that women who received more help were more likely to develop negative views about their abilities to be working mothers. The type of help mattered. Pregnant women tended to be grateful for practical help, such as getting to leave early for a doctor\u2019s appointment, or being allowed to take a short nap during working hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/15/women-workplace-promotions-raises-mckinsey-leanin-study\">Why your 'personality' is getting in the way of a promotion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More problematic was help that aimed to ease employees\u2019 workload and stress, such as being taken off a challenging assignment when the employee felt capable of taking it on. The negative reaction reflects a psychological theory called the \u201cthreat-to-self-esteem\u201d model, in which assistance can sometimes confirm the fears of people who already question whether they are performing as well as usual.</p> <p>According to the study, women do worry about their job performance during pregnancy and how they will balance competing demands, such as coping with morning sickness while still keeping up their workload.</p> <p>\u201cThese worries and challenges set women up for a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d write the authors of the report. \u201cWhen help is received, women take this as a sign that they can\u2019t keep up any longer.\u201d</p> <p>These worries aren\u2019t unfounded. The stigma of pregnancy in the workplace remains very much alive. Pregnant workers are often seen as a safety risk. There are also more insidious factors at play with how people respond to the pregnant body, and a belief, often unconscious, that a pregnant woman belongs in the home. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/511799?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents\">Studies have shown</a> that pregnant workers are viewed as less competent and dependable \u2013 and more caring and irrational \u2013 than women who are not visibly pregnant.</p> <p>This prejudice has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/24/maternity-leave-discrimination-54000-women-lose-jobs-each-year-ehrc-report\">cost women</a> promotions, or even their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cPeople still have a lot of stereotypes about whether mothers are good workers, and those come into play when women are pregnant,\u201d said Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for Workplace Justice at nonprofit National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cThey may assume, without realizing they\u2019re assuming, that once she gets pregnant, her job is not her priority and may treat her accordingly, and that\u2019s discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>The study focused more on the informal interactions between pregnant women and their superiors and colleagues rather than company policies and support programs for women.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s harder for organizations because it requires companies to increase awareness of managers and colleagues about appropriate and inappropriate interactions,\u201d said Clair. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to track those kinds of behaviors.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/03/constituency-statues-workplace-innovation-mit-google-android-apple-facebook-linkedin\">This little-known state law promotes happy employees and innovative ideas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For instance, one of the study participants met with her manager to discuss her maternity leave and specified when she planned to return to work. Her boss responded by telling her to keep her plans loose because she couldn\u2019t predict how she would feel when the baby arrives and starts to make heavy demand of her time and energy.</p> <p>\u201cHer boss was well-meaning, but he was projecting onto this woman and sending signals about how she was being viewed, creating an environment where she was starting to question herself and how people valued her,\u201d said Clair.</p> <p>It\u2019s not an easy terrain for companies to navigate, said Clair. The study said businesses should instead design programs and management training that allow room for their pregnant workers to have more of a say in the kind of help they receive.</p> <p>\u201cWhat some women truly experience as supportive might be quite different from one person to the other, and these aren\u2019t easily resolved tensions,\u201d she said. \u201cOrganizations should appreciate the complexities and recognize that things we think are well meaning might have ill effects.\u201d</p> <p>The issue gets even more complex in industries where safety and liability are overriding concerns, said Greenfield, who is also the director of general obstetrics and gynaecology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. But employers don\u2019t have the legal right to decide whether a job is safe or not simply because a woman is pregnant, Martin noted. Rather, it\u2019s up to the pregnant woman herself to assess the risk unless she has the potential to cause harm to people around her \u2013 which one could argue was the case with the airline pilot.</p> <p>\u201cEmployers should not be assuming that women want changes on the job,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIf an employer responds to a pregnancy by taking her off big accounts or assuming she doesn\u2019t want to travel anymore, even if it\u2019s motivated by some desire to help her, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>While there isn\u2019t research into the costs of retaining pregnant workers versus hiring new candidates, studies show that replacing a salaried employee can cost a business as much as <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/research/documents/retaining%20talent-%20final.pdf\">50% to 60% of the worker\u2019s annual salary</a>. The number<a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CostofTurnover.pdf\"> increases the higher up the position</a>, and replacing a top executive can cost a company 213% of annual salary.</p> <p>Considering women make up<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm\"> nearly half</a> of the workforce and more women are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/31/working-while-pregnant-is-much-more-common-than-it-used-to-be/\">working while pregnant</a> than they did 50 years ago, companies need to figure out the most effective ways to accommodate pregnant employees.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can make an environment that supports women and help them ease back in, they\u2019re going to be more loyal to your institution,\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cThe bottom line is don\u2019t make assumptions. Talk to the woman about what her needs are and be respectful.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland is to set up a compensation fund for small business customers who claim they were badly treated by the bailed-out bank, in an attempt to draw a line under the long-running scandal.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The bank, 73% owned by the taxpayer, has repeatedly defended itself against persistent claims from small businesses that they were deliberately pushed to the brink of collapse to enable it to make a profit.</p> <p>Its chief executive Ross McEwan, who has previously admitted that RBS let some small businesses down, is now preparing to announce a scheme to pay redress to customers in its global restructuring group \u2013 known as GRG and since disbanded.</p> <p>The bank would not comment on Monday amid expectations that announcement would be made before the stock market opened on Tuesday.

Bailey is likely to face questions about this during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, which will be chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/25/rbs-accused-business-profits-regulators\">surfaced in 2013</a> when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an advisor to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier of allegations that RBS was deliberately wrecking small businesses to make profits for the bailed-out bank. At the time Tomlinson said he been approached by businesses which had ended up in GRG and had their properties sold to the bank\u2019s specialist property arm, West Register. </p> <p>It prompted RBS to commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/17/rbs-no-evidence-fraudulent-activity-report\">a report from law firm Clifford Chance</a> which \u201cfound no evidence that the bank \u2018low-balled\u2019 bids to customers in the hope or expectation of acquiring properties at a low price\u201d.</p> <p>But the law firm did say that \u201cboth in relation to the handover process and the restructuring process more generally, some [RBS] customers complained that they experienced insensitive, rude or aggressive behaviour.\u201d <br></p> <p>Clifford Chance explicitly criticised the bank for a lack of transparency on fees.</p> <p>But the claims of mistreatment by small businesses have refused to die down and delays to the official FCA report have fuelled anger from business people who claim they have lost their livelihoods.</p> <p>The report was first expected in December 2015, delayed to April 2016 and then in October the FCA said it had received the final report from the so-called skilled person, the firms Promontory Financial Group and Mazars. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThere are a number of steps for the FCA to complete before we are in a position to share our final findings, which will include an assessment of all relevant material, of which the skilled person\u2019s report is one.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president.</p> <p>Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c27e4b029b92ca464fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:23:59.316Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher.

The expectation is that the case will be heard in the early part of December, and it will take two or three weeks I expect to get the judgment written up. But I think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the judgment we get from the supreme court, full stop.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis rejected calls from several MPs for the government to hold a vote on triggering article 50 before the supreme court judgment.</strong> It was right to wait until the supreme court issued its decision, he said. But he told the Conservative <strong>Nicky Morgan</strong> that, although he could not agree to her proposal for an early vote on a one-line article 50 bill, he was \u201cvery tempted\u201d by the idea. And when <strong>Peter Bone</strong>, a Conservative, said the government should just hold a vote on a resolution backing triggering article 50, Davis said that the government was not proposing that, but that the Commons itself could decide to have a vote. He also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers generally, not least because they cover decisions like going to war.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50, the supreme court ruling could say something different.</strong> He was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article 50, or whether just passing a resolution (a quicker, easier process) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme court.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the independence of the judiciary, although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 50 ruling. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of pillars of our democracy, one of them is the independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for centuries, and one of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after centuries.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said some of the online trolls who have attacked Gina Miller, the woman who brought the article 50 case, should be prosecuted.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me comment on the issue of Gina Miller.

It needed to work out its stance, he says.</p> <p>He says the government thinks it can trigger article 50 using prerogative powers.</p> <p>But the high court came to a different view, he says.</p> <p>He says the court took the view that the government cannot use prerogative powers to change the law of the land without using legislation. And it decided that the effect of leaving the EU would be to take away rights created by the European Communities Act 1972, he says.</p> <p>He says the government values the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press.</p> <p>The government still thinks triggering article 50 is a matter for the government using prerogative powers.

He has identified three.</p> <p>First, the UK government should have been more ambitious.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First: we under-bid. In fact, though we had plenty of media and party political tactics, we went into the talks without a sufficiently clear strategy for change in Europe. Cameron\u2019s brilliant 2013 Bloomberg speech \u2013 envisioning sweeping EU reform (but not mentioning immigration ironically) \u2013 was incrementally distilled down to a less ambitious opening bid in the renegotiation. Even some European leaders suggested more ambition. As one diplomat put it, \u201cIn Europe, we ask for 10 things in order to get 6, you ask for 4 things to get 4. Why?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Second, the politicians gave officials too much power.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The second mistake: we outsourced political decisions to UK and EU civil servants, who, naturally, are more cautious about what\u2019s achievable. Between June and mid-autumn 2015, the most substantive discussions were conducted between officials from the UK, European Commission and European Council. These \u201ctechnical talks\u201d were meant to be purely legal but were in reality at least in part political, with options effectively being taken off the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, third, the government ran out of time.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The third mistake: we got timed out. European partners knew we were very unlikely to walk away from the table at the EU summit in February this year as that would kill a June vote. That self-imposed deadline hurt our leverage.</p> <p>The two year time-table contained in Article 50 is, arguably, the government\u2019s biggest challenge in achieving a successful Brexit. Control over the clock equals leverage. The government should jump at any opportunity to build in more time.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is his conclusion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there is one rule for a Conservative prime minister in EU talks it\u2019s probably that you can get more than your civil servants claim, but less than your backbenchers think. I suspect that will be true of the Brexit talks as well.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58205304e4b029b92ca463a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T10:13:59.566Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sky News says the government is preparing a bill in case it loses the supreme court appeal against the high court ruling saying parliament must be consulted on triggering article 50.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobNisbetSky/status/795567594900246536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BethRigby\">@BethRigby</a> breaks news that government is preparing a bill (not a resolution) to trigger Article 50, despite appeal, to hit March timetable.</p>&mdash; Robert Nisbet (@RobNisbetSky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobNisbetSky/status/795567594900246536\">November 7, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, dodged a question on this this morning (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/07/labour-wants-brexit-plan-but-will-not-block-artice-50-outright-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-58204d3ce4b0d073c27d22c9#block-58204d3ce4b0d073c27d22c9\"> 9.50am)</a> but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581b4d4de4b07ceadb3a2123#block-581b4d4de4b07ceadb3a2123\">David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said last week that there would have to be primary legislation</a> and it is not surprising to hear that lawyers have started drafting a bill in case it is needed.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5820503ae4b07ceadb3a3267\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T10:00:42.250Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the event with her Indian counterpart <strong>Theresa May</strong> also said that Britain\u2019s willingness to relax visa rules for Indians coming to the UK would be linked to India\u2019s willingness to take back nationals who have overstayed.</p> <p>She said the government would consider further improvements to its visa offer \u201cif at the same time we can step up the speed and volume of returns of Indians with no right to remain in the UK.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58204eade4b07ceadb3a325d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T09:56:19.020Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Theresa May</strong> is speaking at the press event with Narendra Modi now.</p> <p>She has announced plans for the London listing of a second wave of Indian rupee-denominated \u201cmasala bonds\u201d.

The British people have spoken and article 50 will be triggered when it comes to Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>This morning Starmer was on the Today programme. Broadly he was taking the Watson view, saying at least twice that Labour would \u201cnot frustrate the [article 50] process\u201d. But he also said four times that Labour would \u201cnot simply vote down article 50\u201d, implying its support for article 50 was conditional, and that it would only back triggering article 50 if the government gave certain assurances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course we must have discussions about [the terms of Brexit].

So of course we need that discussion.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when Starmer was pressed on this, he did at one point say Labour would \u201cnot vote down article 50\u201d without including the word \u201csimply\u201d. He also said Labour would not vote down article 50 \u201ccome what may\u201d (ie, under any circumstances).</p> <p>He said Labour wanted the government to set out its plans for Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to have the plan before parliament. That needs to be subject to scrutiny ... This is the future of all of us, and the future of our children. We should be proceeding on the basis of a consensus across parliament, not forced divisions. </p> </blockquote> <p>But he left it unclear what Labour might do if the government failed to proved it with the assurances it is seeking. He ruled out blocking article 50 completely, but he did not rule out using the legislation that will have to go through parliament (assuming the government loses its case in the supreme court) to attach some sort of conditions to article 50 approval.</p> <p>I will be covering any reaction to his interview that comes in.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>1.45pm:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, visits the University of Sheffield, where she will later deliver a lecture on \u201cScotland and the UK: economic policy after the EU referendum\u201d.</p> <p><em>3.30pm: </em>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is expected to give a Commons statement about the high court ruling last week saying parliament must be consulted on triggering article 50.</p> <p><em>Around 4.30pm: </em>MPs are due to begin a debate on exiting the EU and workers\u2019 rights, the first of several debates being scheduled by the government ahead of article 50 being invoked.

  "<p>The iconic white cliffs of southern England are eroding 10 times faster than they have over the past few thousand years, a new study has revealed. </p> <p>The cause of the huge acceleration is likely to be human management of the coastline, which has stripped some cliffs of their protective beaches, as well as changes in storm intensity. Climate change, which is bringing higher sea levels and fiercer waves, will make the erosion even worse, say scientists.</p> <p>Researchers analysed rocks from Beachy Head and Seaford Head in East Sussex and discovered that the cliff erosion rate over most of the past 7,000 years was just two-six centimetres a year. But the erosion rate over the past 150 years has been much higher at 22-32cm a year.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very surprised at the stark difference,\u201d said Martin Hurst, at the University of Glasgow, who led the new work, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613044113\">published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. \u201cIf you have a nice thick and wide beach in front of a cliff, that reflects wave energy. But the beaches have all but disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>Coastlines have often been managed to try to protect specific beaches, using groynes or the shifting of sand and gravel. But management near Seaford has led to the cliffs to the east, including Beachy Head, being starved of sediments. \u201cWe need to be aware that when we manage the beach in one place, there is a knock-on effect somewhere else,\u201d said Hurst.</p> <p>He said the new information on the long-term rates of erosion will enable researchers to make better predictions for the future about how global warming will affect coastlines: \u201cWe are concerned that increasing sea level rise and more storms will drive more erosion.\u201d Almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/28/7000-uk-properties-sacrificed-rising-seas-coastal-erosion\">7,000 homes in England and Wales are expected to fall into the sea</a> in coming decades as coasts erode.</p> <p>\u201cHumans have significantly altered this coastal system,\u201d said Prof Rob Duck, at the University of Dundee, who was not part of the research team. </p> <p>He said that past gravel extraction was also to blame. \u201cThe gravels of the beaches of the south coast were much-prized materials for a whole range of construction activities and were extracted in massive amounts over long periods. This has certainly aggravated the problems of erosion on the south coast of England and it will only get worse as relative sea level and storminess increase due to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists were able to calculate the historic erosion rates by measuring the amount of an isotope of beryllium in the rock platform under the cliffs.

He moved to Radio 2 in 1973 and filled the early afternoon slot until he retired in December 2002.</p> <p>Young, who had a successful music career before becoming established as a broadcaster, interviewed each prime minister of the day during his time at the station, as well as many other leading world figures. </p> <p>He had been off air for several months after surgery but returned for his final fortnight. The show is now presented by Jeremy Vine. <br></p> <p>The former prime minister Margaret Thatcher appeared on Young\u2019s show 14 times. But presenting was only one of his talents. He began his showbusiness career as a successful crooner with two No1 records to his name.</p> <p>He was born Leslie Ronald Young in 1921, the only child of a miner in Cinderford, in Gloucestershire.<br></p> <p>His love of music came from his mother, who taught him to play the piano at the age of seven. He went on to become a choirboy at Gloucester Cathedral.</p> <p>A bright child, he won a scholarship to East Green grammar school and matriculated at 15. But his parents could not afford for him to continue his education and he left school to become a baker\u2019s boy.</p> <p>He moved to South Wales, where he worked as an electrician, and in 1939 he joined the RAF as a trainee pilot.</p> <p>When an illness prevented him from flying, he became a PT instructor and spent seven years posted in Burma.</p> <p>On his return to Britain, he married his first wife, Wendy. They had a daughter but divorced after three years.</p> <p>Young worked as a Ministry of Education clerk and managed a hair salon but his heart was set on a career in entertainment. He sang and played piano on the club circuit and, in 1949, he finally landed a record deal after being spotted by a producer. </p> <p>In the same year, he met his second wife, the singer Sally Douglas. But that marriage also ended in divorce after seven years.</p> <p>Young\u2019s first hit single was Too Young in 1951 and he went on to sell more records than any other British male singer. His live performances were often the scene of hysteria among teenage fans.</p> <p>He became the first British singer to have two consecutive No 1 hits, with Unchained Melody and A Man Called Laramie in 1955.</p> <p>But, by the end of the 1950s, his style had fallen out of fashion and Young would later say that the success of Elvis Presley killed off his singing career.</p> <p>Instead, he turned to radio work, which he had begun in 1955 as presenter of Housewives\u2019 Choice. Other shows included The Night is Young, Saturday Special and Keep Young.<br></p> <p>By the end of 1960, he was doing seven shows a week on Radio Luxembourg, with a singing series and another presenting job with the BBC.</p> <p>He was a DJ for Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, hired to present the morning show despite one senior executive\u2019s fears that he was too old and too square for a young audience. He was given a three-month contract. </p> <p>He proved popular with the listeners and he ended up staying at the station for six years. The show pulled in an audience of 7 million and Young received about 10,000 letters a week.</p> <p>His catchphrases, such as \u201cWhat\u2019s the recipe today, Jim?\u201d and \u201cOrft we jolly well go\u201d, became well known.</p> <p>He switched to Radio 2 in 1973 to present the lunchtime slot, popularly known as the JY Prog.</p> <p>Young was admired for the ease with which he blended political discussion with more lightweight topics.</p> <p>His relaxed interviewing style disguised the fact that he spent hours meticulously researching his interviewees.</p> <p>Among the honours he received during a six-decade career was an OBE in 1979 and a knighthood in 2002. </p> <p>Even as he entered his 80s, his show was still going strong with more than 5 million listeners regularly tuning in.</p> <p>After 28 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jan/16/broadcasting.bbc\">he announced that he would be leaving the lunchtime show</a> and moving to a weekend slot from 2003.</p> <p>However, he did not entirely disappear as a public figure.

I wanted to to go to [the old part of the warehouse which had been at the centre of the scandals] and it took us about three hours to get there\u201d.</p> <p>Wright, along with five colleagues, had arrived at the group\u2019s Shirebrook, Derbyshire headquarters at about midday on Monday, after notifying the company earlier that morning that the MPs were arriving for a surprise tour.</p> <p>The visit had come after Wright\u2019s committee had accused Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, of running the business like a Victorian workhouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">in a report published in July</a>.</p> <p>The MPs concluded that Ashley had built his success on a business model that treats workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d, after they launched an inquiry following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">an undercover Guardian investigation</a> last year that exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>It is understood Ashley was not present at Shirebrook for the inspection and the MPs were instead shown around by the group\u2019s global operations head, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/26/karen-byers-sports-direct-hard-hitting-head-retail\">Karen Byers</a>.</p> <p>In his excoriating appearance before the committee in June, Ashley pledged to look at areas where the company might improve conditions of its workers, including looking at the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">six strikes and you\u2019re out</a>\u201d policy which threatened workers with the sack after a series of perceived crimes such as long toilet breaks. He also pledged to review if the company needs to engage so many of its workers\u2019 temporary contracts.</p> <p>The committee has no real powers to punish the tycoon if he fails to deliver on his pledges, although Wright had promised to \u201ccontinue to hold Mr Ashley\u2019s feet to the fire, in as constructive a manner as possible, checking on the progress he makes on improving working conditions for workers at his premises\u201d.</p> <p>In September, the company announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/sports-direct-inquiry-key-points-working-practices\">suspension of the six strikes policy</a> and a trial to move some temporary staff on to permanent contracts.

He then extended an open invitation for MPs to visit the site.</p> <p>Sports Direct did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>",
  "<p>My neighbourhood is inundated with feral cats, scraggy wild things that cadge food from animal lovers in winter and cadge baby blackbirds and robins from their nests each spring. Typically, I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/26/neutered-cats-birds-birdwatch\" title=\"\">moaned about this</a> without taking any responsibility \u2013 until last week, when I became so exasperated, I set a humane trap.</p> <p>I bought a wire cage to see if I could catch a squirrel or rat to show my animal-mad daughter, Esme. Luckily she was at school when the door slammed on an adorable kitten. Clueless about what I should actually do, for the first time in my life I called the RSPCA. Rather like the first time I needed a hospital and was astounded by the brilliance of the doctors and nurses, <a href=\"http://www.rspcaeastnorfolk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the RSPCA</a> was amazing.</p> <p>The charity knew all about my street\u2019s cat problem and had caught 20 feral cats so far. I was asked to take \u201c21\u201d to meet an RSPCA officer at a nearby vet, where the kitten was checked (cats are assessed and adults scanned for microchips to ensure they are not pets) and pronounced a feral tomcat.</p> <p>Because 21 is only eight weeks old, he will be found a home as a pet. Adults are neutered and released wherever they came from, which my neighbourhood blackbirds won\u2019t welcome, but feral cats have hard lives and only survive for a couple of years.</p> <p>The RSPCA has now lent me a better trap so I can join other neighbours in helping feral cats and other wildlife, at no expense to the taxpayer. Bravo for the big (cat) society. One problem remains: Esme is tearfully begging to keep the next catch.</p> <h2><strong>Grouse negligence </strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/31/the-rspb-is-wrong-not-to-back-a-ban-on-driven-grouse-shooting\">The RSPB is wrong not to back a ban on driven grouse shooting | Nicholas Milton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was pleasantly surprised last week to receive an email telling me that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/buzzard-licence-kill-slaughter-wildlife-natural-world\" title=\"\">a petition I\u2019d signed</a> to ban driven grouse shooting had been debated in parliament.</p> <p>Trying to ban one method of shooting one bird species to protect another (the much-persecuted hen harrier) might sound pretty niche, but <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125003\" title=\"\">123,077 people</a> petitioned for what\u2019s actually a really important issue, encompassing the rural economy, the flooding of towns, and criminals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/13/-sp-mystery-of-the-missing-hen-harriers\" title=\"\">driving a rare bird towards extinction</a>.</p> <p>Many of us tremble with fear these days when the will of the people is invoked, but the <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-10-31/debates/06472E95-10EC-49A0-BF93-84CAD2BE4191/DrivenGrouseShooting\" title=\"\">grouse-shooting debate</a> revealed some MPs\u2019 enduring contempt for the masses.</p> <p>An orchestrated procession of tame Tories waxed lyrical about the joys of wild shooting. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/H3cNGr\" title=\"\">Gerald Howarth spoke</a> of his \u201ccousin, Will Garfit, who is not only one of the most exceptional shots in the country but a famous artist\u201d \u2013 thanks for that, Sir Gerald \u2013 before belittling petition signatories.

  "<p>Just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/17/london-new-concert-hall-simon-rattle-acoustics-design\">the momentum behind the plans for a new concert hall</a> in the City of London seemed irresistible.

  "<p>Climate taxes on meat and milk would lead to huge and vital cuts in carbon emissions as well as saving half a million lives a year via healthier diets, according to the first global analysis of the issue.</p> <p>Surcharges of 40% on beef and 20% on milk would account for the damage their production causes people via climate change, an Oxford University team has calculated. These taxes would then deter people from consuming as much of these foods, reducing both emissions and illness, the team said.</p> <p>Food production causes a quarter of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming, largely from the raising of cattle and other livestock. These emissions are increasing as people around the world become richer and eat more meat. </p> <p>Marco Springmann, from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food, who led the study, said: \u201cIt is clear that if we don\u2019t do something about the emissions from our food system, we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change\">no chance of limiting climate change below 2C</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you\u2019d have to pay 40% more for your steak, you might choose to have it once a week instead of twice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-07T11:51:24/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Meat and dairy tax\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-07T11:51:24/embed.html\">Meat and dairy tax</a> </figure>  <p>The research, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nclimate3155\">published in the journal Nature Climate Change</a>, evaluated the tax required for each food type to compensate for the climate damage its production causes. Beef has a heavy footprint, due to the deforestation and methane emissions associated with cattle and the grains they are fed, and needed a 40% tax on average across the world.</p> <p>The scientists then assessed how much less of each food type would be eaten as a result of the taxes. They examined different tax regimes and found the optimum arrangement in terms of both emissions and health was to combine the taxes with subsidies for healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, and payments to people to compensate for price increases. This ensured poorer people did not end up with worse diets as the result of taxation.</p> <p>This optimum tax plan would reduce climate emissions by 1 billion tonnes a year \u2013 the same as the entire global aviation industry. This huge potential cut in emissions surprised Springmann, as did the heavy impact of dairy products.</p> <p>Changes to how food is produced and consumed have largely been ignored in the battle against climate change, due to public sensitivity about their food choices, fears about increasing hunger in poorer parts of the world and the lack of straightforward measures to tackle the problem.</p> <p>\u201cIf people see any food price rise, they get angry, so you have to explain why you are doing it,\u201d said Springmann, adding that a successful food tax policy could spend all the money it raised on ensuring people could afford healthier diets. He said a t<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20280863\">ax in Denmark on unhealthy saturated fats</a>, where the government simply kept all the revenue, was aborted after a year. But in Mexico, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/mexican-soda-tax-cuts-sales-first-year\">sugar tax on soft drinks has been successful</a> after the funds were spent on free drinking water in schools.</p> <p>Most of the foods with big climate impacts also happen to be unhealthy when eaten in large quantities, such as beef and dairy. Therefore, if climate taxes cut consumption, fewer people would die from related diseases such as heart disease, strokes and cancers. In the US, for example, people eat three times the recommended level of meat. The researchers found climate taxes would save more than half a million early deaths every year, largely in Europe, the US, Australia and China.</p> <p>However, cutting the demand for meat and dairy would not be easy, said Rob Bailey, research director at UK thinktank Chatham House: \u201cThe challenge is political. As the new research demonstrates, in many countries there is a very strong public health and climate case for dietary change, but it isn\u2019t happening. Governments are reluctant to \u2018interfere\u2019 in people\u2019s lifestyle choices for fear of a public backlash and criticism for \u2018nanny statism\u2019, as well as the reaction from powerful interests in the food industry and agricultural lobby.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey said there was currently little pressure on governments to act, partly because the public understanding of the link between diet and climate change is low. But, when people are informed, they find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/meat-tax-far-less-unpalatable-than-government-thinks-research-finds\">meat taxes far less unpalatable</a> than is supposed, he said.</p> <p>Calls to cut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet\">meat-eating, by the UN</a> and high-profile figures including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink\">climate change experts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6442164/Lord-Stern-People-should-give-up-eating-meat-to-halt-climate-change.html\">the economist Lord Stern</a>, have so far been both rare and controversial. </p> <p>The new research found the taxes needed to compensate for climate damage were 15% on lamb, 8.5% on chicken, 7% on pork and 5% on eggs. Vegetable oil required a large tax of 25%, but this was due to the low initial price of the product, making a relatively modest surcharge look high.</p> <p>These tax levels were global averages but there was significant variation with, for example, the beef tax being higher in Latin America, where cattle-raising produces more emissions than in other regions. The optimum tax plan also had regional variations, including limiting climate taxes to beef in the lowest income countries, to ensure people there were still able to afford decent diets.</p> <p>Springmann said it was critical to find a way to cut the environmental impact of food production: \u201cEither we have climate change and more heart disease, diabetes and obesity, or we do something about the food system.\u201d</p>",

It is also widely anticipated that in the next few years, North Korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast.

He has said he would put more pressure on China to get tough with its neighbour, and he has said he is willing to meet Kim in the US, on the grounds \u201cthere\u2019s a 10% or a 20% chance that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-north-korea-nukes-224385\">I can talk him out of those damn nukes</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>Failing that, he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the US nuclear arsenal. If the weapons cannot be used, he asked: \u201cThen why are we making them? Why do we make them?\u201d </p> <h2>China </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/07/china-tantalized-mayhem-us-election-prospect-thug-donald-trump-president\">China tantalized by US election mayhem and prospect of 'thug' Trump as president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within his or her first year in office, a new US president would also face a direct challenge to US power in the western Pacific. The Chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the South China Sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives Beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world. US influence is under further threat by the rise of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/philippine-president-calls-for-removal-of-all-us-troops\">threatened to eject US troops</a>, casting doubt on his predecessor\u2019s agreement to allow new permanent American presence. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s likely policy will be to continue Obama\u2019s faltering \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d, and to prioritise restoring the faith of US allies in the region that Washington will help them resist Chinese attempts to dominate the South China Sea. It is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by Duterte\u2019s ultimate intentions, and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region. </p> <p>Trump has pointed to the Chinese reef-building programme as a reflection of US weakness but has not said what he would do about it. He has focused more on the threat posed to the US by its trade relations with China. In the transactional model of foreign relations Trump favours, he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-china-idUSKCN0ZR2MN\">could agree</a> to turn a blind eye to creeping Chinese takeover in the South China Sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with Beijing on better terms. </p> <h2>Syria </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">Why Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new US president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers. It is possible that the rebel stand in Aleppo will have fallen by then, giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political transition.</p> <p>In the presidential debates, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">talked of establishing</a> a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d or a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria. However, it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with Russia, with all the risks that entails. The generals at the Pentagon, who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a zone, would work hard to block such a scheme. A Clinton White House is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition groups.<br></p> <p>Trump has indicated that he would seek to work with Assad and Putin in a combined fight against Isis, and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of rebel-held areas such as eastern Aleppo. That policy would also have heavy costs. The Syrian opposition and the Gulf states would see it as a betrayal, and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor Russia has much immediate interest in fighting Isis. </p> <h2>Russia and Ukraine</h2> <p>A Clinton administration is expected to take a tougher line with Moscow than the Obama White House, all the more so because of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election\">substantial evidence of the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to try to intervene in the US presidential election</a> in her opponent\u2019s favour. Clinton could well seek to take a leadership role in negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine and the stalled Minsk peace process, which have hitherto been left to Germany and France. She could also opt to send lethal aid to Ukraine as a way of increasing US leverage.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/world-opinion-us-election-russia-china-mexico-europe\">How the world views the US elections, from Israel to North Korea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump is likely to take the opposite approach. He avoided criticism of Russia for its actions in Ukraine, hinted he might accept the annexation of Crimea, and ignored US intelligence findings that Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic party\u2019s email. A Trump administration is unlikely to contest Russian enforcement of its influence in eastern Ukraine.</p> <h2>Europe and Nato</h2> <p>Clinton aides have signalled consistently that one of her priorities would be to show US willingness to shore up EU and Nato cohesion, and will attend summits of both organisations in February.<br></p> <p>Trump has suggested, by contrast, that Nato is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in Europe are worth what the US is currently spending on them. He said he would check whether US allies \u201cfulfilled their obligation to us\u201d before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-america-automatically-nato-allies-under-attack\">coming to their defence</a>, calling into question the purpose of the defence pact. Later in the campaign, he changed tack, saying he would seek to strengthen the alliance, but a win for Trump on Tuesday would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern European countries, such as the Baltic states, that a US-led Nato would come to their defence in the face of Russian encroachment. </p> <h2>Trade</h2> <p>The two major free trade projects of the Obama administration, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with Europe (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with the countries on the Pacific rim, will probably still be under negotiation when the new president comes into office, giving him or her the option of killing or completing them.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trade-tpp-20160926-snap-story.html\">first supported</a> the TPP and then criticised it in the face of the primary challenge from Bernie Sanders. Her reservations may prolong the negotiations, but she is ultimately expected to pursue and seek completion of the ambitious multilateral trade deals.</p> <p>Trump built his campaign on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-election-free-trade-hillary-clinton-tpp-donald-trump-tariffs\">opposition to all such deals</a>, which he has characterised as inherently unfavourable to the US. He has promised to seek bilateral trade deals on better terms and to punish other countries deemed to be trading unfairly with sanctions, ignoring the threat of retaliation. </p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/27/donald-trump-i-would-end-paris-climate-deal-video\">promised</a> to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, which comes into force on Friday, and to \u201cstop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs\u201d. The Republican presidential nominee has said he\u2019s \u201cnot a believer in climate change\u201d, describing it as a Chinese-created hoax, and has castigated efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as a risk to American jobs.<br></p> <p>The prospect of Trump in the Oval Office poses a unique challenge to the Paris deal, which was struck last year and ratified in speedy fashion in October. A total of <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">94 nations have fully signed up</a> to a commitment to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase on pre-industrial times, in the hope of staving off catastrophic sea level rises, heatwaves and extreme weather.</p> <p>The emissions cuts pledged by countries currently aren\u2019t enough to avoid climate calamity, meaning that recalcitrance from the US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter and the \u201cglobal leader\u201d in fighting climate change, according to Barack Obama, would risk ossifying a process that needs a further hefty shove.</p> <p>American involvement in the Paris deal \u2013 which has the support of nearly 200 other countries \u2013 is based upon the presidential scrawl of Obama. The accord wasn\u2019t presented to Congress as a formal treaty, meaning that Trump could undo it himself.</p> <p>Extricating the US from the deal, along with its financial support of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, would take some time, however. Now the agreement is in force, any signatory nation faces a three-year delay before it could opt out, with a further one-year wait as the process plays out.</p> <p>\u201cThat means,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an expert at environmental law at Harvard University, \u201cit would be impossible for a President Trump to remove the United States during what would be his first term.\u201d</p> <p>But the uncertainty would undoubtably spook countries that rushed to embrace the Paris deal after the US and China, the world\u2019s two greenhouse gas superpowers, jointly announced they were committed to the process last year. Some countries, aware of the dangers of climate change, may redouble their efforts to slash emissions but others may use it as a convenient excuse to slack off.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to climate action is underscored by fierce support for fossil fuels, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/07/trumps_three_messages_for_pa_i.html\">telling coal miners</a> that he will \u201cput you back to work\u201d and that \u201cgas will be a beautiful thing\u201d in his administration.

  "<p>IUDs, implants, condoms and the ever-present pill: for years, contraceptive methods have remained run-of-the-mill while the search for a new alternative that could revolutionise the industry has come up short. Recent headlines have focused on the negative aspects of traditional hormonal birth control: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/women-taking-contraceptive-pill-more-likely-to-be-treated-for-depression-study-finds\">the pill causes depression</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/02/water-system-toxic-contraceptive-pill\">gender mutation in freshwater fish</a>, while a clinical trial for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/male-contraceptive-jab-as-effective-as-female-pill-trial-shows\">male contraceptive jab</a> was abandoned when the subjects began suffering side-effects already well-known to women.</p> <p>But 50 years since it first became available, the pill remains the default option, and women still shoulder the responsibility for preventing pregnancies. Could software be the solution? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elina-berglund-scherwitzl-43b68331\">Elina Berglund Scherwitzl</a>, founder and chief technical officer of <a href=\"https://www.naturalcycles.com/en/\">mobile fertility app Natural Cycles</a> thinks so.</p> <p>Using a sensitive thermometer and sophisticated mathematics, Natural Cycles is an old-fashioned period tracker, with extra features. The app, which launched in 2014, asks users to take their temperatures in the morning, preferably before getting out of bed, then input that into the app, which tells them where they are in their menstrual cycle. Days when a woman can get pregnant become red; \u201csafe\u201d days are green. So far, so low-tech. What makes Natural Cycles unique, though, is the algorithm developed by Berglund.</p> <p>The 32-year-old from Malm\u00f6 in Sweden holds a PhD in particle physics and was a member of the team that discovered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson\">Higgs boson at Cern</a>, before developing her life-changing formula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bb3822204295bf30654705386446105b713924a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bb3822204295bf30654705386446105b713924a/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Natural Cycles app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Natural Cycles app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danijela Froki/Natural Cycles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through daily use, the algorithm learns not just how to map an individual\u2019s ovulation but to predict it, too. That allows the five days prior to ovulation to be identified in real time, alerting women to the fact that male sperm can linger for that long in their bodies, ready to pounce on an egg when it is released.</p> <p>The app fills a gap in the market, spotted by Berglund when she felt fed up with the limited options on offer other than hormonal contraception. She devised the algorithm and started mapping her own cycle, as well as those of female colleagues at Cern. It proved so succesful that Berglund and her husband, fellow physicist and Natural Cycle\u2019s CEO Raoul Scherwitzl, decided to devote more time to the app.</p> <p>Berglund has hired a team of researchers that includes Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at <a href=\"http://ki.se/en/startpage\">Karolinska Institutet</a> in Stockholm. Their most recently published clinical study showed that Natural Cycles, when used correctly, is as efficient in preventing pregnancies as the pill. Unlike the pill, though, it doesn\u2019t offer any cover for fertile days, which means that comparing the app to medical contraception can be tricky.</p> <p>Asking women to put faith in their phones to protect them from getting pregnant is a complicated business. In Sweden, the app was criticised for targeting young lifestyle bloggers and their impressionable readers. One example was <a href=\"http://www.blondinbella.se/\">Blondinbella</a>, by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blondinbella/?hl=en\">Isabella L\u00f6wengrip</a>, who is now a Natural Cycles investor. (L\u00f6wengrip says that the average age of her 1.3 million weekly readers is just over 30 \u2013 two years older than the typical Natural Cycles subscriber.) In December last year, the Swedish Medical Products Agency also banned the app from calling itself a <em>preventivmedel</em> \u2013 the Swedish word for \u201ccontraception\u201d, which is associated with purely medical birth control. As a result, it\u2019s now marketed as a \u201cfertility monitoring device\u201d that \u201ccan be used to avoid pregnancies\u201d. Berglund doesn\u2019t seem too worried, though.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we do is track fertility, right? And then women can use it how they want \u2013 it\u2019s a tool for them to use this information either to prevent or plan a pregnancy.\u201d Plus, she says, the company\u2019s research shows that younger women are more disciplined in using contraception on red days; their pregnancy rates were much lower than those of users above the age of 35.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"618802328583eb0a0fd912449b6d1532130711e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/618802328583eb0a0fd912449b6d1532130711e4/0_26_2430_1457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Natural Cycles app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Natural Cycles app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natural Cycles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ideal app user, Berglund says, is a woman in a stable relationship who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception ahead of trying. Gemzell Danielsson points out that it\u2019s not a good option for women who absolutely want to avoid a pregnancy. Nor does she recommend it for anyone who has what she describes as \u201can irregular lifestyle\u201d, irregular menstrual cycles or lacks the motivation to stay on top of their cycles. The latter of these categories might account for the 45% drop-out rate that the app is currently experiencing; women who sign up but fail to keep to their thermometer schedule.</p> <p>The most important thing about Natural Cycles, Berglund and Gemzell Danielsson argue, is that it adds an alternative method to the mix. \u201cI\u2019m still surprised that there hasn\u2019t been such a product before,\u201d Berglund says. \u201cI have been thinking about this since I was a teenager, because I didn\u2019t feel well from taking the pill.\u201d</p> <p>Berglund is critical of the conveyor-belt style in which young women are prescribed it, and the fact that birth control is still very one-sided within relationships. \u201cSweden is supposed to be the most gender-equal country, but I think when it comes to contraception \u2026 the burden is very much on the woman.\u201d Natural Cycles, she insists, is \u201cmore of a couple\u2019s thing \u2013 the woman measures her temperature and the man sometimes has to wear a condom.\u201d \u201d</p> <p>The most important thing for the company, Berglund says, is to gain trust. \u201cThat\u2019s why we keep performing clinical studies and why we try to achieve a higher ISO class of medical device status.\u201d</p> <p>But before Natural Cycles can become as trustworthy a contraceptive option as hormonal methods, larger-scale, independent studies will need to prove its efficacy. So while the app hasn\u2019t killed the pill just yet, it is a welcome addition.</p>",

More than likely, he has changed little in character or demeanour since his mother, Judy, gave him and his brother tennis rackets in Dunblane when they were no higher than the net at the local club.</p> <p>One of the most touching images to reach public view after his triumph in Paris at the weekend \u2013 to seal not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/06/andy-murray-sets-sights-atp-world-tour-finals-paris-masters\" title=\"\">the Masters title</a> there (his eighth of the year) but take the crown of his longtime rival Novak Djokovic \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JudyMurray/status/795357364744556550\" title=\"\">was that of his mother sitting on his knee</a>, holding a glass of champagne as they flew home on a private jet.

Some have cavilled at her presence, weirdly. It bothers neither her nor her sons.</p> <p>So, how has he done it? Perhaps the key to his continued success in the toughest era of his sport has been his almost maddening attention to detail. He shares that obsession with Djokovic, whom he has known since they were 11 and against whom he has always judged himself. No minor detail is too small to master, for either of them.</p> <p>As the Scottish journalist Hugh MacDonald says in his concise and exquisite book, Murrayball: How He Gatecrashed the Golden Era, Murray rose from the most unpromising tennis environment imaginable in a small Scottish town to the heights of the game by \u201ctaking the small steps, by intuitively and then efficiently employing the theory of the aggregation of marginal gains\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/05/andy-murray-becomes-world-number-one-for-the-first-time-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5azm9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2872134\"            data-video-name=\"Andy Murray becomes world tennis No1 for the first time \u2013\u00a0video report\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com, SNTV, Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581df421e4b0d073c27d1c42\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161105murrayparis_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161105murrayparis_V6.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161105murrayparis.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/05/andy-murray-becomes-world-number-one-for-the-first-time-video-report\">Andy Murray becomes world tennis No1 for the first time \u2013 video report</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Murray has never lacked for friends in the game \u2013 as the vanquished John Isner testified after losing in three sets to him in the final on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that everyone is looking up to right now,\u201d the American said after his eighth straight defeat to him. One of the first messages of congratulations Murray received from outside his immediate family on the evening he reached the pinnacle of his sport came from Tim Henman, who was similarly misunderstood in the years he carried the weight of British expectations at Wimbledon and on less amenable surfaces to his particular talent.</p> <p>Henman has been a generous and supportive ally of Murray\u2019s since their careers briefly overlapped and said in one early biography: \u201cI remember when word first reached me about \u2018this kid with an unbelievable feel for the game \u2026 always seems to play the right shot at the right time \u2026 but he\u2019s a bit temperamental on court.\u2019 That should remind us of someone.

However, the point Henman makes is valid still. Murray had not changed at that point in his career and he remains as stubborn, committed and intuitive several years on.</p> <p>I first saw him play in New York in 2004, the year he beat the cerebral and quirky Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-4, 6-2 to win the boys\u2019 title at the US Open.

There will be twinges and grimaces, certainly \u2013 but the superstructure he has constructed is as strong as it could be. So is his mind. Murray is 29.

I\u2019m not going to bang on about who anyone should vote for because, frankly, if anyone out there has still not made up their mind after everything that has happened in the past year and a half, then I doubt anything you read in a <em>soi-disant </em>style column will push you over the edge.

Ready Britain? Seatbelts on.</p> <p>There is a certain demographic \u2013 surprisingly large! \u2013 who, for the past few months, has been fond of saying things like this to me: \u201cLook, I\u2019m a reasonable liberal person. I\u2019m a good guy! So obviously I hate Trump \u2013 OBVIOUSLY. But I also hate Clinton \u2013 OBVIOUSLY. They\u2019re as bad as each other. I guess you should vote for Clinton though, Christ, you\u2019ll have to walk through bleach afterwards. Damn you, corporate America!\u201d</p> <p>OK, so first of all, thank you so much for telling me how to vote. How on earth would I have known if it weren\u2019t for you? Oh, Trump is BAD, is he? Clinton talks to Goldman Sachs, does she? Thank you so much for Britsplaining the election to me, I really hadn\u2019t noticed! We ex-colonials have been too busy knocking back Supersize Big Gulps of blue soda to read a newspaper.</p> <p>Second, I get that a lot of people don\u2019t like Clinton. I think you\u2019ve mentioned it once or twice. But can we all please give the goddamn false equivalency a rest, please? Because you know where that gets you? It gets you into the same camp as Susan Sarandon who, only just last week, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LoGej6BqMc\">was on Newsnight</a> explaining why Trump and Clinton are as bad as each other, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s voting for Jill Stein, the Green party candidate who thinks Clinton is as dangerous as the man who claims climate change is a hoax. Isn\u2019t it sweet how Sarandon\u2019s belief that voting for third-party candidates gives her the moral upper hand has in no way been dimmed by her experience of voting for Ralph Nader in 2000? She won\u2019t vote for Clinton, Sarandon explained to Evan Davis, because \u201cI don\u2019t vote with my vagina, you know. This is bigger than that.\u201d Sometimes, even for me, the joke is just too obvious.</p> <p>So given that we settled the important matter of what to wear tonight in the first sentence, I\u2019d like to switch tack and look at a different issue, which is how to deal with any Americans who might be in your life tomorrow. Because they will be in a fragile place, wilted inside their hazmat suits and screaming at the television: \u201cNo no, wait! I didn\u2019t hear how North Carolina voted! Someone give me the final results from North Carolina!\u201d</p> <p>By and large, it\u2019s great to be American in Britain. Hell, we speak the language, and that\u2019s a huge boon, given that, for most of us, our knowledge of foreign languages is limited to, \u201cHasta la vista, baby.\u201d OK, you have to endure the occasional humiliation of seeing your nation represented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/17/huey-morgan-30-minutes-with-fun-lovin-criminals\">Huey Morgan</a> on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b081wrzp/question-time-03112016\">Question Time</a>, or Sarandon on Newsnight, but, generally, life is sweet. Yet it is hard to be away from home during an important election, which is why Americans, whatever the outcome, will need your kindness tomorrow. They\u2019ll be exhausted and emotionally spent. They may also need reminders of happier times in their homeland. So furnish them with food they ate as children \u2013 Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, Aunt Jemima\u2019s Pancakes, Hershey\u2019s Chocolate Milk, Fruit Roll-Ups. You can probably order them all by drone on Amazon these days.</p> <p>And above all, don\u2019t hector Americans about the result. Trust me, they know. Don\u2019t hector, just hug. Buckle up, guys.

  "<p>Presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years. They fit the great-man or -woman narrative of history, seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are. They erase our memory of grassroots power, direct democracy and civil society. Leaders beget followers; people pin their hopes on one person, and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office. Or, they wash their hands of any further involvement if it\u2019s not their one person. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we\u2019ve swayed outcome</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so it is this time around. With the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights, it sometimes seems as though we\u2019ve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them, and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power. The intensely personal nature of this campaign \u2013 and the particular danger of Donald Trump \u2013 has created a kind of tunnel vision.</p> <p>Which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant. Far from it. Many Clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win. I am less complacent. We\u2019ve had enough surprises this year \u2013 in Britain, in Colombia \u2013 to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them. A Trump presidency would be a terrible thing. But a Clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief, sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream. A Clinton victory, in fact, would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign. </p> <p>A politician is not a given. Each one is in part what we make them, by pushing, blocking, pressuring, encouraging, fighting, reframing, emphasizing, organizing. Every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who they\u2019ll be, for better or worse. We forget our own influence, the innumerable times we\u2019ve swayed outcomes, such as the decision to veto the Keystone XL pipeline. We forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as same-sex marriage rights.</p> <p>Election seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or decades, outside and around, below and above electoral politics. They drown out the histories that matter: how women got the vote, how the civil rights movement progressed, how the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade deal withered and died, how the World Trade Organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great 1999 shutdown in Seattle, how fracking got banned in New York State, how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse. In all these cases, the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people.</p> <p>To reiterate: it matters who is president, but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves, and what the House and Senate send them or sabotage. </p> <p>Mitt Romney promised to build the Keystone XL pipeline himself if elected; Republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil-fuel industry. Democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies, but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed. Obama wavered on that pipeline for several years. When he vetoed it, it was not because of who he is, but because of who we are, we the members of a climate movement that organized, educated, campaigned, blockaded and demonstrated for years, building a powerful movement. </p> <p>That the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did: it educated us on the science, made the case for the urgency and importance of action, built global coalitions, shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue, started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines, divest, implement efficiency and good design, and shift to renewable resources. A lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities, regions and states have done great work on climate, led by community organizers, small groups and minor politicians you\u2019ll never hear about. </p> <p>The Obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations, well-organized conservatives and big-money interests. Which is not to even raise the question of that administration\u2019s principles; it\u2019s more useful to ask what are our own, if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise. </p> <p>The same will be true of a Clinton administration, if that\u2019s the one voters choose on Tuesday. The extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it. You may feel exhausted right now; tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned (often to the detriment of policy scrutiny). But the truth is, we\u2019re at the beginning \u2013 either of a period of sustained resistance against a racist, misogynist, deranged climate-denier \u2013 or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely progressive, climate-conscious agenda. </p> <p>If we end up with a Democrat (and I regret that that\u2019s the best choice we get in this binary election), a lot is up to us.

It\u2019s a scenario that has a lot of investors worried.</p> <p> \u201cI think we\u2019d have to brace for tremendous volatility and an initial drop in the market,\u201d says Timothy Fisher, a New York-based tax attorney and an investor with retirement savings invested in stocks and bonds, and in whose eyes this election involves both high political principles and economic arguments. </p> <p>Like his peers, Fisher has been watching the last-minute shifts in the polls anxiously. Trump, he argues, simply wouldn\u2019t be a good president for financial markets or for investors \u2013 or for the economy as a whole, given that his adversarial approach to dealing with trading partners could dampen export earnings for US businesses and hurt the country\u2019s GDP.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/asian-shares-slide-again-after-markets-fear-index-spikes-for-eighth-day\">Asian shares slide again after market's 'fear index' spikes for eighth day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fisher and other investment strategists and economists have been burning the midnight oil of late, analyzing what a Trump victory would mean for the United States. Their response? Think <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/26/investing/markets-brexit-reaction-monday/\">Brexit</a> and multiply.</p> <p>Hundreds of US economists working in academic institutions (including several Nobel laureates) have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/11/01/prominent-economists-including-eight-nobel-laureates-do-not-vote-for-donald-trump/\">warned against electing Trump</a>, precisely because of what they referred to, in a public letter, as his propensity to misinform the electorate and promote \u201cwillful delusion over engagement with reality\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cIt would be the US version of Brexit,\u201d says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. The election of the Republican candidate for president would be, like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">British vote to leave the European Union</a>, an event that \u201cis not expected, but that is very consequential, while also being very uncertain in terms of precisely what it means for us all, now and into the future\u201d.</p> <p> Given that stock markets loathe uncertainty above all else, the initial reaction to a Trump victory \u2013 as with the Brexit vote \u2013 would be a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economics-blog/2016/jun/24/the-day-brexit-pushed-the-markets-into-freefall\">stock market selloff</a>. \u201cThis kind of wave of emotionally fuelled selling could lead to the market losing between 5% to 10% in a couple of weeks or a couple of months,\u201d says Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.</p> <p> Following that poll, we saw <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-idUKKCN11B0TQ\">a kind of Brexit bounce</a>, when investors realized that Britain\u2019s departure from the United Kingdom wouldn\u2019t happen overnight and that it would take years to negotiate a new relationship with its trading partners in Europe. </p> <p> But the United States is a different kind of animal. It\u2019s a much larger market, for one thing: about a quarter of global GDP and some half of the value of all the stocks traded in the world are US companies, changing hands on US stock exchanges. Add to that the fact that a lot of investors have <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-wall-street-effect-markets-230164#ixzz4PATlxIQy\">already placed big bets</a> that Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, will prevail in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, and you\u2019ve got all the makings of a nasty market shock. The starting point for a selloff in the stock market could be 10%, and it could get worse from there, some suggest \u2013 and that shock would almost certainly be a global one, rippling outward from the peso and the Canadian dollar to the yen and European markets. </p> <p> Simon Johnson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has argued that the kind of \u201cbig adverse surprise\u201d that Trump\u2019s election would pose to the system, causing the stock market to crash, <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-consequences-of-trump-victory-by-simon-johnson-2016-10\">could prove cataclysmic</a>. Trump, whose promises to boost economic growth immediately to between 4% and 5% are \u201cpure fantasy\u201d \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s opinion \u2013 has advocated anti-trade policies that would lead to anything but growth, the economist argues. And a Trump victory? Well, that might just be enough to cause a worldwide recession, Johnson says. </p> <p> Nonetheless, some investors are preparing for the heightened risk of a Trump presidency, stocking up on cash, gold and such hedges against the US market as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/11/02/donald-trump-investors-safe-havens-german-bonds/\">German bonds</a> in their portfolios. They have done so as the political situation has become more fraught and Trump has succeeded <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/trump-narrows-polling-gap-rigged-message-512682\">in narrowing the polling gap</a> between Clinton and himself and making a Trump presidency more likely. </p> <p> Should Trump actually triumph, the immediate market shock isn\u2019t the only factor that these investors will have to consider, however. </p> <p> \u201cIn the near term, I think a Trump administration would affect business investment and hiring decisions,\u201d says Zandi, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain. \u201cNo one is sure what kind of specific policy decisions president Trump would make and businesses would pause until they got more clarity. That would slow economic growth.\u201d </p> <p>Longer term, Zandi adds, the outlook depends on what choices a president Trump would make. What form would his anti-immigration stance take? If Trump chooses to follow through on all his policies \u2013 deporting undocumented immigrants, building a wall along the Mexican border \u2013 it could shrink the size of the US economy or trigger a trade war. </p> <p>\u201cThis is what markets will worry about most,\u201d says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services. \u201cIf we were to impose tariffs or quotas on imported goods, our trading partners would likely retaliate, and our exports to those countries, like China and Mexico, would suffer.\u201d There would be no winners; global growth would slow.</p> <p> Trump has promised that he would cut taxes if elected, which sounds appealing to voters. That has the potential to give the consumer sector at least a brief jolt, to the extent that those tax cuts are significant enough to register for individual taxpayers, and if those people choose to spend their windfall. </p> <p> But Hoffman notes that Trump\u2019s tax plan is set up to <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/09/26/Trump-s-Tax-Plan-Would-Benefit-Wealthy-Most-Study-Finds\">benefit wealthy Americans most</a>. Many economists believe that changes in tax policy have less effect on spending by affluent households. There\u2019s also the pesky question of how Trump would pay for those tax cuts. \u201cHe is not at all clear how he would do that,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cDo you just run higher deficits? That would be a longer-term negative.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/aug/21/stock-market-records-ordinary-investors\">Why a surging stock market isn't making ordinary investors happy</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Still, investors who confront a Trump-induced market selloff on Wednesday morning shouldn\u2019t imagine that there are no economic upsides to his election. Trump has promised to take a light approach to regulating businesses \u2013 that could be good for corporate profits, and for stock prices, when the shock is over. \u201cMany of his ideas are pro-market policies,\u201d Ablin says. </p> <p> And if you shudder at the idea of a President Trump, remember that some of what he is able to accomplish will be governed by the makeup of Congress. He can\u2019t abrogate existing trade treaties, like the Nafta trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico, single-handedly; he could find working with Congress to pass some of the more protectionist measures that investors find so terrifying to be far harder than he expects. </p> <p> The idea of President Hillary Clinton is one that investors have had plenty of time to accustom themselves to, and the Democratic candidate\u2019s policies are clearly articulated and by now offer few surprises to anyone who has been paying attention.

  "<p>Not long after he launched his rocket of a campaign last summer, Donald Trump walked into a gathering of hardcore conservative activists in Nashville, Tennessee. Meeting a Manhattan businessman with no clear ideological discipline, the crowd could have been skeptical at best and hostile at worst. </p> <p> The National Federation of Republican Assemblies casts itself as the keeper of the flame of modern conservatives, claiming a big role in the Goldwater and Reagan revolutions that defined the party for a generation. \u201cWe are the Republican wing of the Republican party,\u201d the group likes to say.</p> <p> The group would go on to endorse Ted Cruz, but at the time members happily ignored Trump\u2019s flip-flops on abortion and his lack of religious roots to cheer on his anti-establishment war cry.</p> <p> \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a Republican.

I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do. I\u2019m in Washington.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing. Isn\u2019t it amazing? Don\u2019t you agree?

Its leader, Donald Trump, dreaming big, building bigger.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the outlandish assertions to emerge from Trump\u2019s mouth, this one is by far the most credible.

Whether he built the movement or simply rode its wave, Trump has profoundly reshaped the politics of the Grand Old Party. From his opposition to trade to his admiration for Putin, from his authoritarian tendencies to his anti-Nato stance, Trump has trampled across several red lines of Republican politics. In many ways, the biggest unknown in American politics is not about the winner of Tuesday\u2019s election; it\u2019s about the future of the Republican party and the power it continues to wield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/my-year-with-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election\">My year with Trump: covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are several GOP establishment types who believe that Trump\u2019s hold on the GOP is weak.

That moment came at a high point of President George W Bush\u2019s power, soon after his re-election in 2004.</p> <p>At the time, the establishment consensus was clear about the rise of Latino voters. Republicans could not afford to concede them to Democrats, and instead could win them over with an agenda of family values, faith and support for small business.</p> <p>So when Bush pushed for immigration reform in 2005, he fully expected his political capital to pay dividends. Instead, he found himself outflanked and outgunned by House Republicans and nativist hosts on conservative talk radio. A comprehensive approach died that year and a more limited version was killed two years later, just as the financial crisis was beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The crash of 2008, and the Great Recession that followed, transformed a political landscape that was already shifting against the pro-business, pro-immigration culture that once represented mainstream Republican opinion.</p> <p>Steve Schmidt was a senior staffer on Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign and in effect campaign manager of McCain\u2019s 2008 effort as the economy collapsed. He sees the emergence of Trump and Bernie Sanders as part of a far bigger shift in global politics that threatens the security and economic order we have known since the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cThe absolute acquiescence of the Republican establishment, who discarded a generation of conservative ideology at the knees of an authoritarian wannabe, and the fact that someone so manifestly unprepared intellectually, emotionally and morally came this close to achieving real power in this country is a historic event that is truly unprecedented,\u201d says Schmidt. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/03/trump-supporters-us-elections\">What I learned after 100,000 miles on the road talking to Trump supporters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe notion that there\u2019s a snap-back to normal is naive in my view.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack\">Current account customers at Tesco Bank have had online payments frozen</a> after tens of thousands of accounts were attacked by fraudsters.</p> <h2><strong>How many people were affected?</strong></h2> <p>The bank said suspicious transactions had been spotted on around 40,000 accounts, and that money was taken from around 20,000 customers. Many account holders reported losing hundreds of pounds, with one customer telling the Guardian that more than \u00a32,400 had been taken. Tesco Bank will not say how much money is involved in total.</p> <h2><strong>So what happened?</strong></h2> <p>The bank says it fell victim to online criminal activity. Tesco spotted suspicious activity on accounts on Saturday evening and texted customers who had been affected. Several people have reported that their accounts show transactions made overseas, such as in Spain and Brazil. A criminal investigation has been launched.</p> <h2><strong>How was its security breached?</strong></h2> <p>Tesco has not given any details, but technology specialists have speculated on what might have happened. Cliff Moyce, global head of financial services at technology firm DataArt, said the chance of the problem being cause by a \u201cremote technical hack\u201d was less than 50%. \u201cFar more likely is the (in)action of a human actor, or weak process/management controls when information is shared between providers,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/21/safe-internet-banking-cyber-security-online\">So you think you\u2019re safe doing internet banking?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moyce said Tesco would need to investigate the possibility of an \u201ceconomic hack\u201d in which an offshore employee is offered a large sum of money in return for a tranche of customer data. \u201cBut incompetence rather than ill intent from an employee or subcontractor remains the more likely factor to be correlated with the malintent of the criminals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ed Macnair, chief executive of cloud security company CensorNet, agreed that a remote attack was unlikely. \u201cPeople are the weakest link for most organisations, and I would not be at all surprised if that\u2019s the case here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to remotely hack into a network without some sort of assistance \u2013 which is often provided accidentally. People tend to do stupid things, like reusing passwords or clicking on random links, giving hackers the access they need.\u201d </p> <p>Moyce suggests that the hack was timed for the weekend when banks have reduced staff and the response time will have been slower than during the week. \u201cAutomated fraud detection systems appear to have worked well, but a lack of people at desks will not have helped,\u201d he said. </p> <h2><strong>What happens now?</strong></h2> <p>An investigation by the National Crime Agency is under way. For customers, the bank says it plans to return to normal service as soon as possible. It has said that all direct debits and bill payments will go through as usual, and people can still withdraw cash and use their debit cards. Customers should also still be able to log in to online banking and check their accounts.</p> <p>But there will be some disruption \u2013 those affected can still use their debit cards, but will be sent new ones within seven to 10 days.</p> <h2><strong>Will customers be compensated?</strong></h2> <p>Tesco Bank has told customers that it will refund accounts as soon as possible, hopefully on Monday, and cover any financial loss that they have suffered as a result of the fraud. For some customers who have paid penalties to other organisations, perhaps because of missed payments, this may mean providing proof to Tesco of those losses.</p> <h2>What should customers do?</h2> <p>As well as keeping an eye on their account, the chief executive of Get Safe Online, Tony Neate, said they should change their passwords immediately.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d also strongly advise people to change the security question they get when forgetting their passwords, as these answers may have been compromised as a result of this breach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would also suggest that Tesco customers look at any other online accounts they currently have to make sure that no suspicious activity has been taking place \u2013 particularly if you have used the same login details, which is something you should never do.\u201d </p> <p>Although not directly linked to their Tesco Bank account, Neate said cyber criminals may have been able to gain access to personal information which could potentially help them unlock other online accounts.</p> <h2><strong>Will customers stick around?</strong></h2> <p>Tesco Bank offers a competitive current account: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/05/tesco-3-per-cent-current-account-santander-halved-rate-123-account-savers\">it is paying 3% interest on balances of up to \u00a33,000</a>.

  "<p>With the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/gchq-cyber-boss-offers-private-companies-protection-from-hackers\">National Cyber Security Centre</a>, backed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/01/philp-hammond-to-spend-extra-19bn-fighting-cyber-attacks\">\u00a31.9bn of funding</a> to battle online crime, the government has made a statement.</p> <p>Defence experts have long warned of the growing menace of cybercrime and now they have good reason to believe the threat is being given priority treatment.</p> <p>Recognising the danger is one thing though, dealing with it another. The world \u2013 and by extension the UK \u2013 is facing a shortage of people with the skills needed to mount an effective defence.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security\">global cyberdefence industry</a> is going to need another 1.5 million staff by 2020, according to non-profit security organisation (ISC)<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>At the Cyber Security Challenge in London \u2013 a three-day competition designed to identify raw cybersecurity talents \u2013 recruiters are doing their best to address the shortage.</p> <p>Stephanie Daman, the chief executive of <a href=\"https://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/\">Cyber Security Challenge UK</a>, believes that the UK is slowly recognising the value of ethical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/hacking\">hackers</a>, also known as \u201cwhite hats\u201d, the cybertroops required to protect our increasingly connected world.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to build a pipeline of people. But that, by its nature, is going to take a little while to come to fruition,\u201d says Daman, who spent 17 years working for the government on security matters.</p> <p>In the meantime, events such as the Cyber Security Challenge are trying to address the skills gap.</p> <p>The event is sponsored by corporations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), BT and BAE Systems, while camera-shy staff from GCHQ and the National Crime Agency look on, hoping to unearth a new generation of cyberspooks.</p> <p>Around half of the contestants in the challenge typically get a job out of it, while all are likely to be interviewed.</p> <p>Recruiters like the event because it allows people who may not shine academically to show that they can still thrive in a high-pressure, realistic scenario.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Cyber Security Challenge was fairly fanciful. It involved a bio-hazard attack and a threat against a minor royal. This year, the challenge is more grounded in reality. The contestants are asked to fight an assault on a fictional energy company, Bolt Power.<br></p> <p>They are tasked with assessing and battling an attack from \u201chacktivist\u201d cybercriminals, repairing a data breach and investigating the theft of \u00a3125m.</p> <p>There are good reasons to be concerned about cyber-attacks on infrastructure within energy, but also in areas such as transport and telecommunications, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1292d25c-a12a-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2\">or even hospitals</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">delayed a final decision on the Hinkley Point C</a> nuclear power plant</p> <p>, and anxiety about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans\">involvement of state-backed China General Nuclear</a> was thought to be among the reasons for the delay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33fa1c5196076d738dcd73782d9f0682453cad7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33fa1c5196076d738dcd73782d9f0682453cad7d/0_166_4965_2979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hand hovers over a keyboard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More manpower is needed in the fight against cybercrime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These concerns have been heightened by hacks perpetrated against, among others, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-21/u-s-companies-hacked-by-chinese-didn-t-tell-investors\">semiconductor firms in the US</a>, and suggestions that designs for narrow-body aircraft have also been targeted.</p> <p>Understandably, few people at the Cyber Security Challenge are willing to talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley</a> or point the finger at Beijing. But they are clear about the nature of the threat from state-backed groups.</p> <p>Kris McConkey, cybersecurity partner at PwC, is on the frontline of the war against cybercrime. His job is to make life intolerably difficult for hackers. When the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the UK must <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/uk-must-build-cyber-attack-capability-chancellor-says-cybersecurity\">\u201cstrike back\u201d against cyber-attacks</a>, it was people like Kris he surely had in mind as his infantry.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of cases we get called in to are where organisations find it difficult to deal with [it] themselves,\u201d says McConkey. \u201cA high proportion of those are attributed to state-sponsored groups.\u201d</p> <p>There may still be a threat, he says, even where the state in question is only involved financially in a sensitive infrastructure project.</p> <p>Companies may try to set up a firewall between sensitive systems and foreign powers, but it does not always work.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of organisations have tried to do it and a lot of organisations have had their fingers burned. It\u2019s a very difficult line to walk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the most part these things end up in some joint endeavour. There\u2019s almost always a people aspect and that\u2019s often where you get an insider placed there to gain information.\u201d</p> <p>He cites a recent example where a cyber-espionage group had hidden inside a company\u2019s network for two years, helped by a contractor the unnamed firm had hired.</p> <p>So how to stop this? Businesses can pass information to the security services, but they are not legally allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/09/cybercrime-should-we-hack-the-hackers\">\u201chack back\u201d by launching cyber-attacks</a> themselves.</p> <p>But they can at least lay booby-traps to confuse and deter \u2013 a concept known as \u201cactive defence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne way is to go and hack the bad guys, yes. The other way is to make your network a hostile place for an attacker to break into,\u201d says McConkey.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a burglar coming through your door, you want them to be standing in a house of mirrors, you want them to think there are many more systems than there are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f92cefc3700b5ca91e98082386d091a94a2bd49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f92cefc3700b5ca91e98082386d091a94a2bd49/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a team takes part in the 2014 Cyber Security Challenge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young team takes part in the 2014 Cyber Security Challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JR- John Robertson....07850 9312/John Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That may be easier said than done, but the Cyber Security Challenge is about finding out who has the requisite technical ability, as well as the decision-making and interpersonal skills needed to liaise with businesses facing a threat.</p> <p>Contestants are encouraged to think on their feet and a team of mischievous PwC staff sits on the sidelines, occasionally throwing cyber-attacks at the contestants themselves in a bid to trip them up.</p> <p>The atmosphere is tense and the contestants, many barely out of school, are feeling the heat.</p> <p>But despite the technical expertise on show, there is something that does not add up.</p> <p>Of the seven competing teams \u2013 all named after famous cryptographers \u2013 four honour brilliant women, while 24-year-old Holly Rostill oversees the day\u2019s events in the role of game master.</p> <p>Lisa, 21, is a fourth-year computer science student and one of only two women competing out of 42 contestants. \u201cThis challenge is hard and it\u2019s gradually getting harder.

And in Latin culture the mother archetype is very powerful. In the case of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, she embodied the widow following the death of her husband, the former president N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2013 a woman in pain that men are expected to defend and protect. While Laura Chinchilla, who suffered <a href=\"http://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/130512/prejuicios-machistas-castigan-buena-gestion-de-chinchilla\">the most gender-specific attacks</a>, being younger and attractive, was accepted as the chosen one because of the patronage of former president Oscar Arias.</p> <p>My theory might be questionable and I have no way of proving it \u2013 it is based on my powers of observation as a writer and my feminine intuition. But having said that, there are two other objective factors: the extraordinary participation of women in the struggles of the 70s and 80s when dictatorial regimes in the region were confronted by popular uprisings, conspiracies and guerrilla groups.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30530da5c8fe984d0cbb32c8f18f76e7700c5cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30530da5c8fe984d0cbb32c8f18f76e7700c5cb3/186_40_1201_1501/800.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Peron, the first woman to become president in Latin America.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabel Peron, the first woman to become president in Latin America.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Di Baia/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Nicaragua, for example, the first guerrilla force that managed to liberate a major city during the 1979 insurrection was composed entirely of women. We women joined revolts and became experienced in grassroots organising, political activism, diplomacy, and combat. When it came time to build democratic societies, we claimed a place in governments and power structures. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the trend was still to have women resume their traditional roles. And because many refused to be relegated to status quo and go back to the kitchen or the practice of home economics, they focused their energy on organising powerful social movements, NGOs and feminist organisations. These strengths account for the quotas that have been adopted by 16 Latin American countries and allowed them to have o<a href=\"http://www.worldpolicy.org/latin-women-take-helm\">ne woman for every four legislators</a>. Only the Nordic countries have higher ratios.</p> <p>It is a big step to have women as presidents, but in the patriarchal structure of power we have all inherited, very often women are still forced to prove that they are as \u201ctough\u201d as the toughest of men. A woman president who would defy the masculine model of power and infuse it with the feminine ethic of caring and real equality is still in the making. Although women as Latin American leaders have many challenges ahead, they have managed to get to the right place, and now they have to be daring enough to seize or declare that it is the right time.</p> <p><em>Gioconda Belli is a Nicaraguan poet, writer and political activist</em></p> <p></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Being English, I am ashamed of our collective behaviour over the past few months since the Brexit vote. I voted leave but I did not anticipate the wave of racism that followed, and I am deeply disturbed and embarrassed by what Britain now stands for and how the rest of the world views us.</p> <p><strong>Gareth Smith, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The 99% are getting stronger and more people are waking up\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0adc98c19c80792b25353a24fd9b5cc4d76bd2f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0adc98c19c80792b25353a24fd9b5cc4d76bd2f4/0_0_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters climb the base of Nelson\u2019s column chanting \u2018One solution: revolution\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters climb the base of Nelson\u2019s column chanting \u2018One solution: revolution\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness/Sergei Petrazhitski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People are beginning to stand up against the bullying, exploitation and oppression by the people at the top, the global elite, who are wealthy beyond anything we could imagine. I have been to most of the marches and do so because I support Anonymous and the Occupy movement. </p> <p>People have been bought by money for centuries, and ordinary people will go along with it because of the carrot being dangled. Money is a huge illusion: money is debt; we have been enslaved by money. Now they want to control us completely in this New World Order scenario. We, the people, say no. Enough is enough. We are turning back to caring for each other and for the planet. </p> <p>The 99% are getting stronger, more people are waking up, and it is really important at this point in human history that we stand up to the tyranny of the corrupt governments that back the corporations that are destroying the planet. </p> <p>I have always spoken to the police and had interesting discussions with them. Many protesters feel negative stories about violence are set-ups by the police, and I would tend to agree with that. The police are there to do their jobs, which pay their rent and mortgages. They are just like us, and many feel sympathy with the cause. Hopefully one day soon they will take off their helmets and join us. </p> <p>I have been to all but one of these protests. It is great to be with other people who feel as passionately about corruption and want to see big changes. It\u2019s always interesting \u2013 meeting lovely people, having fun \u2013 but also feeling that we need to be doing this. It\u2019s a drop in the ocean but this movement is not going to go away. If we can get more people to wake up to what is going on, then fantastic.</p> <p>I have always believed in standing up to oppression and tyranny. It is our duty to do so. We have been fed so many lies \u2013 and the media is mostly propaganda to maintain people as units of production and consumption. </p> <p>V for Vendetta provides the image of the Guy Fawkes mask, but it feels as though our future could be like that if they think they can get away with it. Orwell\u2019s 1984 warned us about it but with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World\">Brave New World</a> aspects of society.</p> <p><strong>Helen, Basingstoke, 60, therapist and mother</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"559f2cdab9ac20fca1bae292f14fe490a8280097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/559f2cdab9ac20fca1bae292f14fe490a8280097/0_327_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Several supporters argued they should be free to pass on public roads after police imposed restrictions on the march, including a three-hour protest limit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Several supporters argued they should be free to pass on public roads after police imposed restrictions on the march, including a three-hour protest limit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness/Sergei Petrazhitski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Every aspect of our society makes me feel ashamed of the human race\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <p>Watching the NHS crumble, and watching the older generation \u2013 even my parents \u2013 be tricked into voting for ridiculous rightwing parties, convinced that these people will improve the country. </p> <p>I\u2019m sick of racism towards people who are simply moving from one place to another, often to escape war, that our leaders have and will forever perpetuate, as long as there is money to be made from arms and oil. The ignorance of a large portion of a nation, because of a corrupt media and unelected bunch of leaders.</p> <p>Do you think the civil rights movements in the US in the 60s and 70s were allowed? No, they don\u2019t want us to protest, not just because of the potential violence but to block our freedoms and rights. The police try this every year, and with about 0.5% of the people there acting in a violent way, they feel it\u2019s justified. Last year, no one in the main march had any idea of this police car being blown up. The march went nowhere near Scotland Yard. Funny that there was a whole group of news reporters stood conveniently near the vehicle when it happened, yet I probably saw about one reporter near the march for the whole evening. Something fishy was going on there. </p> <p>It\u2019s exhilarating \u2013 until you see someone throw a firework at a police horse. But that was just one guy, clearly an idiot, and he deserved to be arrested. I\u2019ve spoken to a number of police each year and some have expressed sympathy as many have had their own pensions and benefits cut. However, the majority of them are arrogant and see themselves as better. They view us as a bunch of criminals, though we are also protesting for their sake. </p> <p>I\u2019ve offered officers Mini Cheddars because they looked hungry. Most have turned up their noses at them but the odd one or two were really grateful. I also witnessed many people being arrested for not moving behind a certain line the police had made up. The officers were trying to scare everyone off by pretending to arrest this guy but all they got was abuse from the crowds.</p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Bob, 22, Southampton </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b979f2d2dbeb718a2510ffcc4e0acead5014276e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b979f2d2dbeb718a2510ffcc4e0acead5014276e/0_0_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters wore Guy Fawkes masks in reference to the film V for Vendetta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters wore Guy Fawkes masks in reference to the film V for Vendetta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GuardianWitness/Sergei Petrazhitski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We are being manipulated into believing austerity is in our best interest\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m annoyed at the current status quo of our elected representatives riding roughshod over the needs of the people who pay their taxes and keep the wheels turning. Decisions are made by faceless individuals in Whitehall and elsewhere. We are being deceived and manipulated into believing austerity is in our best interest yet public services are being decimated. </p> <p>These protests represent a group of like-minded individuals coming together to demonstrate their frustration and unhappiness at a system that is rigged in favour of an elite of unelected cabals who have undue influence over the lives of working people. It\u2019s theatre, with an undercurrent of violence aimed at the property of big companies and police dressed in riot gear.</p> <p>I try to attend as much as I can. I protested outside parliament on the eve of the Syria bombing. It didn\u2019t change a thing. I went along to the anti-dolphins-slaughter demo last year. That was fun. Didn\u2019t change a thing either. I used to go to the May Day protests but now don\u2019t as they inevitably end up in a kettle. But they didn\u2019t change a thing. I went to the anti-Iraq war demo. I remember seeing \u201c1,000,000 people on the streets of London\u201d on the boards at Piccadilly Circus and thinking: \u201cWe\u2019ve cracked it! They have to listen to us!\u201d but, as we now know, they didn\u2019t. </p> <p>I don\u2019t believe protesting can change much in Britain. But the point is that that we still have to protest, we still have to demonstrate our displeasure at things we don\u2019t agree with or they \u2013 whoever they are \u2013 will continue unchecked. </p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Antony, 36, teacher</strong></p>",
  "<p>So, the decision has finally been made to extend Heathrow, destroying Gatwick\u2019s dreams of enlargement, and no one is even mentioning the option of going back and turning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/thames-estuary-airport\">Maplin Sands into a vast runway</a>. This was a plan decades ago \u2013 back in the 1970s \u2013 to have a new airport on the edge of the sea on the Thames estuary, which was a very exciting idea at the time. I remember it, because I was on the board of British Airports at the time, and recall gazing in awe at the marvellous statues and imaginative structures we were shown to demonstrate the effect that such a thing would have on the estuary and the tides and even possibly buildings.</p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/thames-estuary-airport\">Boris Johnson</a> tried to bring back this idea, just off the Isle of Grain. It was deemed too excessive. No doubt enlarging Heathrow is sensible, but it would have been interesting to see what a seagoing airport would be like.</p> <p>In the original Maplin Sands idea, there was going to be a big port as well. It might have led to whole new type of tourism \u2013 one in which you didn\u2019t know if you were going to fly or swim. It might have led to a place where the airport was actually a delightful part of your holiday, instead of the tiresome bit you have to endure at the beginning and end as things are now.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">Theresa May</a> said the decision to favour Heathrow was made for the sake of jobs and growth she was not thinking of the holidaymaker, with or without children. I only ever thought of them in my time at British Airports \u2013 and I was ticked off for it. I sometimes asked why the others were only thinking of single men with one briefcase.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/story/tech/science/watchdog-earth/2016/10/10/trump-looks-burn-coal-1000-years/91850954/\">he wants to burn coal indefinitely</a> because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">he denies the climate change consequences</a>.

Unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org/lewandowskyTrumpUK.html\">we seem to have entered a post-truth era</a> in which facts simply don\u2019t matter. <br></p> <p>The two American political parties have become so different that <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13496688/swing-voters-dying-cartoon\">swing voters have virtually gone extinct</a> and most conservatives would vote for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Ed\">Mister Ed</a>, were he the Republican Party nominee. Political ideology trumps facts, truth, and reality. And Trump\u2019s support comes heavily from a single demographic: white men, mostly older and without a college degree.<br></p> <h2><strong>Trump wants to regress to the white male-dominated 1950s<br></strong></h2> <p>The Trump campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era. Based on the candidate\u2019s words and his supporters\u2019 feelings about science, women, and minorities, that era resembles the 1950s.</p> <p>In the 1950s, only about <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2000/feb/wk3/art03.htm\">one-third of women participated in the American work force</a>, and African-Americans were still fighting for equality in <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement\">the Civil Rights Movement</a>. The tobacco industry created the playbook followed by the fossil fuel industry today:<a href=\"http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/21/2/87.full\"> spread misinformation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/\">sow doubt</a> to keep the public consuming its deadly products.<a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762370.html\"> Nearly half of Americans smoked cigarettes</a> in the 1950s (as compared to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking/\">under 17% today</a>). The tobacco industry <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf\">already knew that smoking caused cancer</a>, but used the denial playbook to keep Americans puffing.<br></p> <p>These characteristics fit the era that Trump and his supporters appear to yearn for \u2013 an era in which white men dominated American society. Older, white male Americans who comprise the core of Donald Trump\u2019s base are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/04/the-similarities-between-trump-support-and-climate-denial\">the predominant climate science-denying group in the country</a>. Social scientists theorize this is due to the group\u2019s historical societal advantages. They have benefited from the societal status quo, and hence are least concerned with risks, especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they benefited.</p> <h2><strong>Like it or not, the status quo is changing</strong></h2> <p>White, male Americans are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages. As minority populations grow, they\u2019re losing their grip on the American majority. The first racial minority president was elected and re-elected. Women are <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm\">approaching even footing with men in the labor force</a>. Even social norms are changing, for example with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">gay marriage becoming legal</a>.</p> <p>And of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/21/global-warming-continues-2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-ever-recorded\">the Earth\u2019s climate itself is changing rapidly</a> due to human-caused global warming, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/24/the-atmosphere-is-being-radicalized-by-climate-change\">causing all sorts of negative consequences</a>.

  "<p>The supporters of an open, democratic internet, funded mainly by advertising, are facing some big questions about how their vision will unfold. A freely accessible digital world, where websites and social networks are open to all, is the dream of many. But critics wonder if this is desirable or even possible.</p> <p>Brands have shifted a huge proportion of their marketing budgets into online advertising in recent years, fuelling the growth of the internet and becoming the main source of funding for most websites and social networks. But while many campaigns hit the spot, others can be irritating, intrusive and irrelevant.</p> <p>How can advertisers and web publishers make sure ad campaigns are effective and entertaining enough to pay the internet\u2019s bills, while ensuring online services don\u2019t disappear behind a series of privately accessed paywalls?</p> <p>To discuss the future of online advertising, the Guardian teamed up with advertising technology provider AppNexus to run a roundtable discussion. The discussion was conducted under the Chatham House Rule, where comments were made on condition that they were not attributed to the speakers, to encourage a free-flowing discussion.</p> <p>A key point of contention in the discussion was how the internet should be funded. One participant was passionate about the ad-funded model: \u201cLargely it should be free. It is a wonderful tool for accessing information, for consuming information and for the distribution of brands.\u201d But another thought that the quality of content on the internet inevitably suffers \u201cunless you have the resources to fund it.\u201d There are fears that ad revenue is insufficient to pay for all the content that is needed for the web. \u201cGenerally speaking, the ad-funded model puts a downward pressure on the quality of content. I have no problem with subscriptions,\u201d the speaker said, adding: \u201cThere is no reason why it should be free.\u201d</p> <p>Digital advertising faces some serious challenges if it is to keep the web free \u2013 one of which is concerns over the ethics of tracking people\u2019s online behaviour without their consent. The success of online ad campaigns is determined by the data that brands can access about internet users. How old are they? What are their interests? Are they male or female, single or with children? Much of this data will be collected from cookies downloaded on to users\u2019 computers. Cookie data allows web publishers to track users\u2019 online journeys and observe the actions they take on different websites. They can then use this data to helps them target campaigns to different groups.</p> <h2>The impact of data protection regulation</h2> <p>But the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/16/eu-agrees-draft-text-pan-european-data-privacy-rules\">European Union General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), to be implemented in 2018, will tighten up data privacy \u2013 and this, some speakers felt, could undermine the ad-funded model of the internet. The stringent new rules, which force companies to get \u201cunambiguous consent\u201d from online users to make use of their data, are expected to be adopted in the UK regardless of Brexit.</p> <p>Some participants worried that the Directive\u2019s clampdown on using data could make it difficult for certain companies to operate on the internet or to run advertising campaigns. \u201cSome businesses may not survive,\u201d warned one speaker.</p> <p>The participants also discussed whether website owners relying mainly on cookie data are at a disadvantage to websites and social networks where users log in and give their personal details. Facebook, for instance, has in-depth login information about users \u2013 their locations, names, likes, activities and friendship networks. The social network offers this data to brands, facilitating highly targeted advertising campaigns.</p> <p>One participant spoke of an ad campaign for the launch of a new product where a strong creative film was shown on Facebook. Depending on how users reacted to the film \u2013 whether they watched it the whole way through, or just with the sound off \u2013 more messages were served to them and these were refined in stages according to each user\u2019s reaction. The speaker said this was highly effective, as it allowed the campaign to filter out those who were not interested and to deliver relevant messages to potential customers.</p> <p>Another speaker said Facebook allows brands to constantly change their online advertising as they receive new data about people\u2019s likes and dislikes: \u201cI really feel it is only since Facebook has come along that we have had this opportunity to assess data very quickly and then tweak that data.\u201d</p> <p>But another pointed to a recent statement from household products manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the world\u2019s largest advertiser, that it had decided to stop using Facebook\u2019s targeting tools.</p> <p>\u201cThey had assumed it would be efficient to target (air freshener) Febreze to families with kids and dog owners, but it proved more efficient to go broad in the targeting.\u201d P&amp;G said it was better to promote some products to everybody rather than paying for targeted audiences, as everyone uses laundry detergents or washing-up liquid. Tightly targeted campaigns are more suitable for very specific, niche products.</p> <p>Some of the speakers were concerned that online advertising places too much emphasis on data and not enough on creativity and persuasion. The use of data was criticised as \u201cthe tail wagging the dog\u201d and there was a recognition that some advertising creatives believe data gets in the way of making good campaigns. \u201cThey feel the use of data depersonalises,\u201d said one speaker, who added the caveat that attitudes are changing. \u201cI think people have got used to the fact it is not a case of either having data or creative \u2013 it is about using both together.\u201d</p> <p>There was a consensus that cookie and login data works best for hard-sell campaigns, encouraging people to buy now, rather than for softer-focus, persuasive brand advertising.</p> <h2>Retargeting \u2013 a waste?</h2> <p>And speakers accepted that \u201cretargeting\u201d campaigns \u2013 whereby a user who has visited a website, perhaps to look at some shoes, then has ads for that website follow them around the internet for days, weeks or even months after \u2013 are unpopular with users. \u201cIt is so frustrating as an advertiser that I am spending on retargeting,\u201d said one speaker. \u201cI am very well aware that those advertising platforms aren\u2019t good enough and that we are overly retargeting.\u201d</p> <p>The problem of retargeting was seen as a failing of automated advertising \u2013 called \u201cprogrammatic advertising\u201d \u2013 where software dictates what ads people see based on the data. But some thought that as programmatic technology evolves to become more sophisticated, it will overcome these drawbacks and will deliver a better experience for users and brands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b3259a6e8a29159d391116bc496b84d09a34556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b3259a6e8a29159d391116bc496b84d09a34556/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People having debate at table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OgilvyOne\u2019s Jo Coombs gets her point across at the Guardian roundtable event, supported by App Nexus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Friedrich</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One problem with automated online advertising is that the ads may appear on any website and next to inappropriate content, for instance an ad for an airline could be placed next to an article about an air crash. But one speaker predicted that automated \u201cprogrammatic\u201d advertising will be able to answer this problem and help brands sift through data to find the most receptive audiences for their messages and identify the most appropriate places to run the ads.</p> <p>\u201cProgrammatic is very helpful for understanding who those people could be, what their behaviour looks like and how you could go about finding them.\u201d Another compared the situation of programmatic advertising to email. \u201cEmail is one of the best-performing channels. But it was tainted for a time because it was abused.\u201d</p> <p>The discussion turned to the use of machine learning, where software analyses data to make judgements about what products, ads and content people should be offered. One speaker said machine learning and robotics would revolutionise marketing. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in programmatic advertising is one of the earliest areas where it has made inroads, but I think it will be right across the shop.\u201d</p> <p>But another warned that widespread use of robotics and technology would lead to a depersonalised world: \u201cPeople are just turning into a kind of jelly between lots of robots.\u201d</p> <p>The discussion returned to the question of whether advertising will continue as the main source of funding for the web. One speaker thought younger users would be reluctant to ever pay for online content. But another disagreed: \u201cWe cannot assume that people between the ages of 12 and 21 are going to behave and operate like that for the rest of their lives. We all go through generational change.\u201d</p> <h2>At the table</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Jasper Jackson </strong><strong>(Chair) </strong>Assistant Media editor, the Guardian<br></li> <li><strong>Sanjeevan Bala </strong>Head of data planning and analytics, Channel 4<br></li> <li><strong>Romain Bertrand</strong> Managing director, eHarmony UK<br></li> <li><strong>Steve Chester</strong> Director of data and industry programmes, IAB UK<br></li> <li><strong>Chris Clarke</strong> Chief creative officer, international DigitasLBi<br></li> <li><strong>Jo Coombs</strong> CEO OgilvyOne<br></li> <li><strong>Nigel Gilbert</strong> Vice-president, strategic development, EMEA, AppNexus<br></li> <li><strong>Annabel Kilner</strong> Commercial director, Made.com<br></li> <li><strong>Sille Opstrup</strong> Head of digital, Pernod Ricard UK<br></li> <li><strong>Giles Pavey</strong> Chief data scientist, dunnhumby<br></li> <li><strong>Daniel Spears</strong> Programmatic director, the Guardian<br></li> <li><strong>Bradley Love </strong>Professor of cognitive and decision sciences, UCL<br></li> <li><strong>Sarah Todd</strong> CEO, Geometry Global<br></li> <li><strong>Jamie West </strong>Deputy managing director, group director of advanced advertising, Sky Media UK<br></li> </ul> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox,</em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>If Paul Lambert turns around Wolves\u2019 fortunes to the extent his employers expect then the club\u2019s supporters may come to laugh at the moment, after 32 minutes of torment at Derby County\u2019s hands, when Jo\u00e3o Teixeira made his way from the pitch. Moments, perhaps, as there were quite a few of them. Teixeira was chosen from 10 plausible candidates to make way as the interim manager, Rob Edwards, sought to find a route back from 2-0 down but instead of hurrying to let George Saville have a go at sparking their comeback he lumbered slowly towards the touchline, his discontent evident while the Molineux crowd, close to apoplexy, made theirs felt in another way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/wolverhampton-wanderers-derby-county-championship-match-report\">Ince double lifts Derby as Wolves look ragged for new manager Paul Lambert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regardless of intention it was not a good look and Lambert, whose appointment as head coach was confirmed late on Saturday, would doubtless have had some Glaswegian wisdom at hand for the Portuguese midfielder had he been available to impart it a few hours sooner. Teixeira\u2019s demeanour was, at this point, perfect shorthand for the wider mood: dejection and lethargy on the pitch, distrust and utter distaste off it.</p> <p>Edwards could not wait to talk some sense into his players at half-time and a spirited recovery, with goals from H\u00e9lder Costa and David Edwards, which might, on another day, have brought a draw rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/wolverhampton-wanderers-derby-county-championship-match-report\">a 3-2 defeat</a> said plenty for the ability of this bright 33-year-old coach to influence a dressing room.</p> <p>Those in Molineux\u2019s corridors of power might have sympathised with his wish to make good a situation that had quickly become messy. That Lambert is a decent manager who, given a stable environment, has a record of success at this level is beyond doubt; the question for Fosun International, the group of Chinese investors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/21/wolves-takeover-sale-chinese-group-fosun-international\">who took over Wolves in July</a>, is why they waited so long to listen to the right people. It has been a wasted three months for Wolves, who could have been told by any reasonably informed observer that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/30/wolves-appoint-walter-zenga-new-head-coach-kenny-jackett\">the recruitment of Walter Zenga</a> to lead their promotion bid looked ill-starred from the outset: at this level, resources tend to mean little without the correct leadership and the speed at which an expensively assembled squad\u2019s fortunes began to unravel after a promising start spoke of the Fosun era\u2019s fuzzy early thinking.</p> <p>It is, as the midfielder Conor Coady put it afterwards, a squad that \u201cneeds a bit of guidance\u201d. Lambert must find the right blend between Zenga\u2019s six foreign signings and the mostly British core of a squad that, by and large, performed admirably under Kenny Jackett. Twenty-five players have already made first-team appearances this season and clarity is required quickly to arrest a slump that has brought seven games without a win and 19th place in the division.</p> <p>There was encouragement to be found in a second half in which the best attacking player was Wolves\u2019 forward Ivan Cavaleiro. The former Benfica and Monaco winger, brought in for what was reportedly a club record \u00a37m fee, was a menace from his perch on the left and created Edwards\u2019s goal with an undefendable right-footed delivery. He might have won a penalty and was certainly unlucky to concede one, being adjudged to have fouled Tom Ince and seeing his counterpart score to effectively put the game beyond Wolves. The raw materials are here \u2013 only a few weeks have passed since the sullen Teixeira\u2019s performances were being lauded \u2013 and you sense Wolves simply need someone who can set and raise the tone.</p> <p>Derby County\u2019s improvement since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/12/steve-mcclaren-set-for-shock-derby-county-return-manager\">the return of Steve McClaren</a> might provide an example of how fortunes can reverse in the right hands. It has taken something for the Rams to appear the more stable club under Mel Morris\u2019s stewardship but it was they who performed with lucidity and strength at Molineux, drawing praise from a manager whose post-match words were accompanied by the beam that is never far away when the going gets good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07398fc47463214cb3c1757a4d9c7b4db379c7fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07398fc47463214cb3c1757a4d9c7b4db379c7fb/273_209_3223_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ince celebrates scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Ince celebrates scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Browne/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe first half, that\u2019s the kind of football we want to see \u2013 that\u2019s the level and now we\u2019ve got to maintain it,\u201d McClaren said, referring to a spell in which Ince scored a simple opener before Darren Bent volleyed a picture-book goal from Will Hughes\u2019s scooped pass. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are capable of doing and that\u2019s what we have to keep in our minds, nice and positive.\u201d</p> <p>They could have scored five or six in those 45 minutes, so inept had Wolves been from the start. Before proceedings began, the author Frederick Forsyth had been brought on to the pitch to recite a specially written poem for Remembrance Day. Lambert might not need his players to resemble dogs of war but surely the first thing he will demand from his players in his opening game at Preston on 19 November is that they give themselves a fighting chance from the off.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Norwich City know how good life can be under Lambert and those days take on an even rosier hue now. The knives were already out for the incumbent, Alex Neil, before Saturday\u2019s visit of Leeds but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/norwich-city-leeds-united-championship-match-report\">Ronaldo Vieira\u2019s injury-time winner</a> \u2013 which came just after the once-outcast Kyle Lafferty seemed to have salvaged things for the Canaries \u2013 made for a third successive defeat in the Championship and the cries for change are growing louder. If it seems premature to jump on Neil after the season\u2019s first poor run of form, the opposite view is that fifth-placed Norwich, who are now seven points behind second-placed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, should simply not be this far off the pace.</p> <p>They have spent, give or take, \u00a330m in the past 12 months and even though Nathan Redmond is sorely missed the figures do not stack up well. \u201cNow you have to raise your game, show some desire and bollocks, basically,\u201d said Neil of Norwich\u2019s predicament. Despite audible unrest at Carrow Road it is likely that he will be given time to instil those minerals into his team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b59a4badb86f501777cbbe153e338904660539b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59a4badb86f501777cbbe153e338904660539b1/717_246_2051_1586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pontus Jansson celebrates after scoring during Leeds\u2019 win at Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"773\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pontus Jansson celebrates after scoring during Leeds\u2019 win at Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Calver/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Then again, the benefits of change may seem more obvious if Norwich fall short in their next game. They visit Loftus Road and the QPR team they face will be the first since last December not to be selected by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. A 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday was respectable on its own but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink-sacked-qpr-after-draw\">not enough to save Hasselbaink</a>, who had wanted time to develop his team. A record of 14 wins from his 47 games suggests there was some way to go but then Shepherd\u2019s Bush is hardly the place to set long-term plans in motion. Whoever replaces Hasselbaink \u2013 and Tim Sherwood\u2019s name has been mentioned \u2013 will be QPR\u2019s sixth manager in the past five years.</p> <p>\u2022 The Championship\u2019s longest-serving manager has slightly less to worry about this week. Mick McCarthy celebrated his fourth anniversary at Ipswich Town on Tuesday and had to defend a tenure that, in the past 12 months, has threatened to turn sour. A 2-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday, another place where discontent is beginning to ferment in what is an unhappy division this year, was the perfect reminder of his gifts. Luke Chambers\u2019 late winner and a Tom Lawrence solo effort did the job; Ipswich remain outsiders but are five points off the play-offs and McCarthy hopes the return of some of his more creative players from injury will help change minds.</p> <p>\u2022 Such ambitions are currently little concern for Newcastle United and Brighton, who have begun to pull away at the top. Neil Warnock was never going to come away from St James\u2019 Park without a battle and Cardiff City made the leaders work for their 2-1 win. Brighton caught the eye more with their fourth win in a row, a 2-0 success at Bristol City, and in so doing provided the moment of the weekend. Steve Sidwell is now 33 but still shows the range of a top-flight player at times: his astonishing strike from five yards inside the home side\u2019s half set Brighton on their way and is required viewing if it had passed you by up until now.</p>",

Fracking is going against everything we are working towards as a society, it\u2019s a false hope given to people who are deliberately deceived by some parts of the media, energy companies, and the government themselves. They claim fracking is a replacement to the depleting gas fields in the North Sea, when the reality is they don\u2019t truly know how much shale gas is down there, nor do they know the destruction, devastation and livelihoods it will ruin along the way.</p> <p>Climate change is inevitable now, but we have the chance to reduce the impact. The UK is the windiest place in Europe, yet our government make it near impossible to build a wind turbine on land, due to its \u2018visual impact\u2019. Fracking will turn the Fylde Coast, an area of beautiful country side, small villages and towns into a baron waste last, full of toxic chemicals that will destroy every living organism it touches.</p> <p>My campaign is a little different; I\u2019m currently in Australia on holiday. So I\u2019m using social media and support groups to demonstrate the severity of the situation we currently find ourselves in. We stand together, against a giant corporation, who only care for profits, not for people, against the government who have betrayed a democratic vote and effectively spat in our faces. We stand for what is right, we stand for future generations and we stand to save the environment we call home. Together our voices can\u2019t be ignored. </p> <p><em>Leigh Edwards, 25-year-old geography graduate</em></p> <h2>\u2018Local communities should have a say in their own futures\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c616f7fa9bde1475a3b47d23b0c75ae82a06353\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c616f7fa9bde1475a3b47d23b0c75ae82a06353/127_0_1376_825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Richardson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our group<a href=\"http://www.ragfrack.co.uk/\"> Roseacre Awareness Group</a> (RAG) is part of the <a href=\"http://frackfreelancashire.org.uk/cms/\">Frack Free Lancashire</a> (FFL) alliance.

  "<p>I have worked as a GP over the past decade in about a third of the around 140 prisons in England and Wales \u2013 all categories, male and female \u2013 and in all there has been a gradual increase in the prison population, leading to overcrowding.</p> <p>This reflects the national situation. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics?departments%5B%5D=ministry-of-justice&amp;keywords=&amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;world_locations%5B%5D=all\">Ministry of Justice figures</a> show that between June 1993 and June 2012 the prison population in England and Wales increased by 41,800 prisoners, to more than 86,000. Without urgent steps aimed at cutting the prison population this could exceed 100,000 by 2020. However, this has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the number of prison officers. On the contrary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/aug/06/crisis-managing-violence-prison-service-cut-to-the-bone\">their numbers have been cut</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/liz-truss-prison-officers-prisons-staff-prisoner\">Liz Truss\u2019s \u00a39-per-hour prison officers won\u2019t produce safe, humane prisons | John Podmore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When our prisons are at crisis point, amid continuing controversy about incidents such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/pentonville-prison-knife-attack-second-inmate-arrested\">recent killing at Pentonville</a>, consider our direction of travel.

Instead of taking steps to radically reduce the UK prison population the government keeps building more prisons to house even more prisoners.</p> <p>I have come across numerous cases over the years where a noncustodial sentence would have been more appropriate than imprisonment. I recall a heavily pregnant lady suffering from a life-threatening condition who was jailed for breaching a restraining order. What was to be expected of a pregnant sufferer confined for a good deal of the time in a small, poorly ventilated prison cell? During her time behind bars she was rushed to hospital several times. Whenever she was there, for sometimes up to a week and longer, she was guarded round the clock by prison officers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/30/prison-food-economics-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5584p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2761585\"            data-video-name=\"\u2018Prison is punishment enough\u2019: are inmates paying price of industry politics? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ed5035e4b0c38a12e71242\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160928PRISONFOOD2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160928PRISONFOOD2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160928PRISONFOOD2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/30/prison-food-economics-video\">\u2018Prison is punishment enough\u2019: are inmates paying price of industry politics?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I recall another instance when the nurse, seeing the new arrivals on reception duty, sent me the following message, asking me to prescribe a short course of sleeping tablets for a recent arrival. She was in prison for failing to pay a bill. Her partner was supposed to be looking after their young children but, the message said: \u201cshe does not believe he is up to the task. She is in a very weepy state and unable to sleep. She has another four weeks to do \u2013 could you please help?\u201d</p> <p>These women represent a not insignificant proportion of the prison population who are not a \u201cdanger to the public\u201d. So why is the state spending large sums to keep them behind bars?</p> <p>Ministry of Justice figures from 2013 revealed that 55% of prisoners connected their offences to drug-taking, with the need for money to buy drugs the most commonly cited factor. Eliminating the addiction factor could lead to the closure of about half the prisons in the UK and free resources for other matters.</p> <p>Sending these people to jail in the hope of ridding society of the menace of drug abuse is a woefully inadequate approach to the complex problem of drugs. It is akin to a doctor treating the symptoms of a disease without concerning themselves with its cause or its future prevention. There should instead be a holistic approach to the problem of drug addiction, with treatment and rehabilitation forming the centrepiece.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/nov/07/bedford-prison-rioters-shouting-in-jail-gangways-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5bv3c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873811\"            data-video-name=\"Bedford prison rioters shouting in jail gangways\u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"5Pillars\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-582046b0e4b029b92ca46383\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/07/07112016bedford_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846498&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846498&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/nov/07/bedford-prison-rioters-shouting-in-jail-gangways-video\">Bedford prison rioters shouting in jail gangways</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And then there are the inmates with mental health issues. Surely these are best handled in psychiatric institutions rather than prison. Instead of spending millions on \u201csuper prisons\u201d, the state would be better employed building additional psychiatric hospitals and homes to accommodate the hundreds, if not thousands, of them languishing in jail. Instead of helping them to overcome their mental impairment, society is punishing them for a condition they cannot help having. Labelling them criminals on a par with those who commit armed robbery, rape and murder is antiquated at best and nonsensical at worst. Samuel Butler lampooned this stance in his classic satire, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon\">Erewhon</a>, describing a culture who imprisoned the sick for the crime of not being well. That was published in 1872, but what has changed since then?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/07/bedford-prison-riot-recent-inspection-found-unacceptable-conditions\">Bedford prison riot: recent inspection found 'unacceptable' conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2016/10/a-matter-of-conviction\">report</a> published last month by the RSA\u2019s Future Prison project says the prison and probation services in England and Wales are failing to protect the public because they do not rehabilitate offenders, and that they should be radically restructured. I welcome the rehabilitation aspect, but it still ignores the central issue of population.</p> <p>We need urgently to address sentencing, because too many offenders are being sent to prison for short terms. A record-breaking case was that of a lady who was jailed one evening only to be released the next day. I believe any sentence below three months should be suspended, turned into fines or whatever other punishment society deems appropriate short of an actual prison sentence.</p> <p>As for drug addicts, the power to sentence them to drug rehabilitation homes makes sense for everybody. Keeping the most dangerous criminals \u2013 sex offenders, murderers, terrorists, armed robbers, and so on \u2013 in jail, and finding alternative punishment for those committing petty crimes, would not only lead a radical reduction in the prison population, it would also allow for the proper supervision of extremely dangerous inmates.</p> <p>Whatever else is said this week, population reduction is where our focus is and it is quite achievable. What is really needed is the will.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dr Gordon Cameron is a pseudonym. Memoirs of Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Doctor by Dr Cameron is available now.

Day told an official of the finance department on January 25 2016 that, in the complicated financial arrangements surrounding the building, that he, Day, retained the loan from the National Australia Bank. </p> <p>He told the department that Fullarton Investments was to receive rent from the commonwealth to cover Day\u2019s occupancy in the building \u201cthen make vendor payments to me using those funds. No rent, no vendor finance payments,\u201d Day tells finance official <strong>Shane McGaughey </strong>on 25 January.<br></p> <p>Then there is correspondence between the special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, and Day in early August. </p> <p>In this correspondence Day characterises the arrangements with the building in the following terms:<strong> \u201cI have an agreement with someone else who has an agreement with the crown.\u201d</strong> This explanation is provided by Day to Ryan in the event \u201cthe department pulls the pecuniary interest card\u201d.</p> <p>In this email on 7 August, Day says he has spoken to finance about the pecuniary interest issue, and told them it isn\u2019t relevant.<br></p> <p>Ryan clearly disagrees with this and seeks further advice. Day also furnishes him with further particulars. </p> <p>In this email exchange on 29 August, Day says he has not been given clear advice by either the department, or by the special minister of state when he was elected in 2013 (which was <strong>Michael Ronaldson</strong>) on the problems associated with him having some kind of financial relationship with the building which houses his electoral office.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Day</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Their advice basically centred on the principle that it was \u201cnot a good look\u201d for a senator to own his or her own office.

Day gave a guarantee to the bank over the mortgage so that essentially if the commonwealth doesn\u2019t pay rent to the company that owned the building, Day or his trust has to pay.<br></p> <p>Ryan said that may lead to the conclusion that Day has an indirect pecuniary interest in the lease, which would make him ineligible to be in the Senate.

Under clause 5 of the bill, <strong>the question to be asked would be \u2018Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry</strong>?\u2019. The result of the plebiscite would be determined by whether more than 50% of the votes cast are in favour or not in favour of the plebiscite proposal under clause 6 of the bill. The bill would also provide that, should this bill become an act, the writ for the plebiscite must be issued within 120 days after the act commences.</li> <li>Clause 15 of the <strong>bill would require the establishment of two committees, each comprising five members of Parliament and five citizens. These committees will be known as the Committee for the Yes Case and the Committee for the No Case</strong> and will be appointed jointly by the attorney general and the special minister of state. Each committee will have two government members (one of whom will be the chair), two opposition members and one crossbench member. Each committee would receive $7.5m in public funding to conduct official yes and no campaigns and the ability to receive up to $1,500 in tax deductible gifts from donors. </li> <li>The Electoral Commission will be responsible for overseeing the vote under clause 7 to ensure Australian voters are informed about the procedural elements of the plebiscite, <strong>the Electoral Commission will prepare and distribute to households in Australia general information about how to vote in the plebiscite</strong>. This is appropriate given the role of the Electoral Commission as an independent impartial body responsible for overseeing parliamentary elections.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T23:35:39.454Z\">at 11.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581fb8d5e4b07ceadb3a30e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T23:13:42.406Z\">11.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, is now speaking to the marriage equality plebiscite bill.</p> <p>It is mostly mechanics but makes a quick political point that this is the first government to bring this (marriage equality) matter to the parliament.

As I fell in the Senate doors in a mess of earphones streaming <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> from ABC AM, I almost ran into the other Malcolm, smiling sweetly next to the security check. <strong>Malcolm Roberts</strong>\u2019 office has released an alert for a press conference for One Nation at 9am. This causes reporters to prick up their ears because One Nation senator<strong> Rod Culleton</strong> is expected to be referred to the high court this morning for a ruling on his eligibility. Former Family First senator <strong>Bob Day</strong> will also be referred. Will One Nation be talking about the future of Culleton, shearer of sheep and key collector? We shall await the hour of nine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, your prime minister has been on ABC AM. <br></p> <p>There are a couple of news points.</p> <p>Turnbull says if he accepted that the boats had stopped he would fall into the complacency that hit <strong>Kevin Rudd</strong>. It\u2019s a more challenging environment \u2013 with social media \u2013 than <strong>John Howard</strong> faced, says Turnbull.<br></p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> is pandering to the left of his party on speaking out against the lifetime ban on asylum seekers who have come by boat, says the <strong>prime minister</strong>. (Shorten has yet to commit to voting against the legislation).</p> <p>Turnbull moves on to 18C. His words are a bit mashed but I will relay as much as possible so you can see the nuance. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ... has been, and <strong>I have sympathy for this argument</strong>... there is a view ... the bar that is set is too low. In other words, in particular that prescribing conduct which insults and offends is too much a restriction on free speech.

  "<p>In the city of Herat in western Afghanistan, a small but determined contingent of young women are quietly learning to code. They grow more empowered, creative and confident every day, says Fereshteh Forough, who set up after-school programme Code to Inspire \u2013 the country\u2019s first coding school for women \u2013 in November 2015.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of coding and tech is that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you are \u2013 with one computer and the internet they can reach the world and work without even leaving the house,\u201d says the 29-year-old, an Iranian-born Afghan refugee who returned to Afghanistan with her family after the Taliban regime fell in 2001.</p> <p>Code to Inspire would have been unthinkable before then, when under Taliban rule, girls\u2019 education was illegal and the internet was banned. Code to Inspire is looking to the future. So far it has taken on 50 students between the ages of 15 and 25 in Herat and aims to expand into Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif. Students are learning the language to develop websites, creating their own mobile apps and exploring gaming technology.</p> <p>In a highly conservative country where <a href=\"http://codetoinspire.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to 85%</a> of women have had no formal education, and <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 16%</a> of the workforce are women, in many ways these students are the lucky ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa09a46b4e976bab78ca555c2bd6e5dc07d68d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa09a46b4e976bab78ca555c2bd6e5dc07d68d9c/0_11_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Girls in Afghanistan working on laptops\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The beauty of coding is that they can reach the world and work without even leaving the house.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Code to Inspire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEducation for women is still a very sensitive topic, it is a very male-dominated culture,\u201d says Forough. Even in strict families, where young women might still have limitations on their independence, coding offers the chance to work from home, she points out.</p> <p>When studying computer science at Herat University, Forough encountered lots of problems as one of the only female students. \u201cI was a very vocal student; the majority of my classmates were male and a lot of the time they didn\u2019t like to see a girl being so vocal in the classroom,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Forough became one of the first female mentors to teach Java. More than 200 students were taking the class \u2013 but only 10 turned up for the first few weeks. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to learn from a girl \u2013 they didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be capable.\u201d</p> <p>With her own experiences in mind, the first priority was to find a safe and secure location to hold the coding classes \u2013 \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to create any unnecessary trouble for the women or their families\u201d. The Code to Inspire team has worked hard to foster good relations with the local community and has won the approval of the students\u2019 fathers and brothers. </p> <p>Among the students is 20-year-old Heydeh, who aspires to become a professional web developer. \u201cI have big dreams, I want to make websites to support local people with their work so they are no longer forced to turn to other countries for help,\u201d she explains. </p> <p>\u201cI was excited to come to Code to Inspire because coding is not too familiar [in Afghanistan] and women cannot normally raise their voices \u2013 but we are proving women have that power and we can talk with the world via coding.\u201d She says her family were skeptical at first, but now they want to help her realise a future beyond just \u201chousework and marriage\u201d.</p> <p>One student has already created a delivery app for a local restaurant, while others are working on how they can build platforms to promote their country to potential tourists.</p> <h2>Girls can code</h2> <p>Other organisations are recognising the potency of nurturing female coders in Afghanistan, too. In April 2016 non-profit <a href=\"https://womanity.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Womanity Foundation</a> launched Girls can Code in two of Kabul\u2019s biggest girls\u2019 schools. Forty students between the ages of 16-18 are enrolled in the classes, which take place before and after school.</p> <p>\u201cCoding empowers girls by teaching them how to use their creativity, imagination and problem-solving skills to develop solutions,\u201d says Elizabeth Rector, programme leader. \u201cThrough this process they build confidence and learn to rely on their own abilities to find solutions, and these skills are forever with them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/2015/apr/14/coding-isnt-just-for-the-next-zuckerberg-it-can-help-dentists-too\">Will learning to code help you get a job?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is global shortage of skilled tech workers expected in the coming years, Rector adds. In Afghanistan the population\u2019s access to the internet <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users-by-country/\" rel=\"nofollow\">is currently only 7%</a> and businesses need to prepare for the coming growth in internet access.</p> <p>\u201cInvesting in educating girls in subjects like coding, where we expect there to be abundant, good-paying jobs is key to the future of Afghanistan. With a full range of talent to tap into, Afghanistan\u2019s economy can grow and become less reliant on foreign aid and retain ambitious young women,\u201d says Rector.</p> <p>Female app developers are already emerging in Kabul and Herat \u2013 in May, 45 young women submitted mobile app ideas at Girls Make Apps workshops, organised by Herat Technovation. Universities and other technical schools are working to increase female enrolment and organisations such as USAid are investing in matching young women to ICT employment opportunities, according to Rector.</p> <h2>Travel the world and reach for the stars</h2> <p>For Afghan women aspiring to get into tech, Forough is testament that it can be done. So is her former classmate, Roya Mahboob, who founded IT consulting firm Afghan Citadel Software Co in 2010, making her one of the country\u2019s first female tech chief executives. She also launched <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://digitalcitizenfund.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Citizen Fund</a>, a nonprofit which helps girls and women in developing countries gain access to technology.</p> <p>Mahboob says setting up her business wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cIt was very hard to establish a client base at first \u2013 many men didn\u2019t want to do business with women, even though we could bring them clients,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When pitching for business, the fact she is the chief executive of her own company is regularly met with outright disbelief, and it hasn\u2019t been uncommon for clients to refuse to pay for work carried out. Mahboob and her team have even been followed, spied on and threatened. Undeterred, she has made it her priority to hire female programmers and bloggers from the beginning. Today more than half of her staff are women \u2013 and business is thriving in Afghanistan and beyond its borders.</p> <p>\u201cWhile cultural barriers threaten the dreams and aspirations of young women and girls, the opportunities they can find through the internet and technologies show them a larger world than the one that they have always known,\u201d says the entrepreneur. \u201cThey can travel the world and reach for the stars, without even having a passport.\u201d</p> <p>The story in Afghanistan feeds into a wider struggle going on throughout the world to get more women into tech. In an increasingly digital world, it will be at the heart of unlocking greater equality, empowerment and economic stability in every country.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>The work of famous artists is recreated in many forms: postcards, placemats, scarves, tea towels \u2013 and now, in a more contemporary twist, stretch leggings. If you\u2019re a fan of Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers or A Wheatfield, with Cypresses, or even Bosschaert the Elder\u2019s A Still Life of Flowers in a Wan-Li Vase<em>, </em>you can now stride out, colourfully adorned in one of the world\u2019s greatest paintings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wildbangarang.com/collections/the-national-gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">The leggings</a> are the result of a collaboration between the National Gallery, where all three canvases hang, and specialist designer-manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.wildbangarang.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wild Bangarang</a>. The company also makes a range of much sought-after World of Warcraft clothing, in partnership with the game\u2019s original artists.</p> <p>\u201cThe National Gallery came to us,\u201d says David Pearson, co-founder of Wild Bangarang. An agency specialising in licensing had been taken on by the gallery, he explains, which wanted to explore ways innovative products could be used to bring the National Gallery\u2019s collection to new audiences. </p> <p>It has been a lengthy process that has cost time and money. Wild Bangarang cannot simply copy a picture on to fabric, it will specifically commission illustrators to redraw the art so that the image works perfectly in its new incarnation as clothing. They\u2019ve also spent significant time with the National Gallery\u2019s buyer \u2013 a whole day was spent at their printing works \u201cprinting and printing again until we got the colours absolutely right,\u201d Pearson says. The leggings will be in the gallery shop from December. </p> <h2>Standing out</h2> <p>So how can other small business owners attract the notice of the UK\u2019s galleries?</p> <p>\u201cProducts happen in a lot of different ways\u201d says Rosey Blackmore, merchandise director for Tate Enterprises, which oversees the Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. She explains that the gallery won\u2019t always make use of art they already have hanging on the walls, but will often commission artists to create something bespoke. \u201cSometimes we have a specific idea of what we think we need, so then I\u2019ll give a very prescriptive brief, but that\u2019s not always the case. </p> <p>\u201cLater today I\u2019m going to the Royal College of Art to give students a broad brief asking them what would delight them if it was in our shops. And a product will materialise from that. Personally I really love the projects where we give emerging creatives the opportunity and we together create something that\u2019s wonderful for us to have in the shop and very precious to them to have in their portfolio.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ffcd3fd99ab490756b0c921cc6fc8ca73f809ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ffcd3fd99ab490756b0c921cc6fc8ca73f809ba/0_158_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cassell's Christmas baubles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Cassell was approached by a Royal Academy buyer who was interested in stocking her handpainted Christmas baubles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: null</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michelle Cassell, the artist behind the label <a href=\"http://www.eatpraypedal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eat, Pray, Pedal</a> was approached out of the blue by the Royal Academy (RA) earlier this year. A buyer from the gallery\u2019s RAted Range (the RA\u2019s showcase for emerging British design talent) contacted her via Etsy, where she had a listing to sell her work.

And while she is thrilled at the opportunity, selling wholesale to a gallery has been a steep learning curve. \u201cThere were months of conversations,\u201d she says . \u201cI\u2019d go six weeks and hear nothing \u2013 of course she had to go to meetings her end and pitch to the senior buyers.\u201d</p> <h2>Making it commercially viable</h2> <p>It\u2019s undoubtedly an exciting proposition for an emerging artist, but does it represent a worthwhile business opportunity? </p> <p>Cassell\u2019s deal was finally signed in August and she is now combining a part-job with painting hundreds of baubles. \u201cIt has taken a lot of perseverance to get to this point,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d love to just sit and paint, but I had to learn about wholesale and really think about it from a business perspective.\u201d Galleries, she adds, take a higher margin than other stockists so you have to be prepared to negotiate. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jul/09/creating-wealth-how-artists-can-become-entrepreneurs\">Creating wealth: how artists can become inventive entrepreneurs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each relationship is different, says Ella Riley, senior buyer at the Royal Academy. \u201cSome artists will ask for royalty for a product. It is typically quite minimal, but those products that do well can be in the shop for a number of years.\u201d Or the gallery might offer them product in kind (depending on what the artist has designed). </p> <p>Different artists will also bring their own individual approach to a piece of merchandise, Riley explains. \u201cAi Wei Wei wanted products that were really affordable and accessible\u201d \u2013 (his <a href=\"https://shop.royalacademy.org.uk/ai-weiwei-exhibition\" rel=\"nofollow\">pieces in the RA shop</a> range from a \u00a315 iPhone cover to a \u00a314,000 ceramic chrysanthemum) \u2013 \u201cwhereas others might want to create something very high-end, and limited edition or numbered\u201d.<br></p> <p>At the Tate, Blackmore says that when the gallery itself creates a product based on a commissioned design, a standard royalty is offered to all artists, no matter how high their profile. Alternatively, she says, artists with strong links to manufacturers and who want to oversee the entire production process may prefer to supply a finished product to the gallery themselves, and make their cut on that basis.</p> <p>Even in the midst of the excitement of being approached by a world famous gallery, however, Pearson warns that if this type of collaboration is to be a fruitful business prospect, it is vital \u201cto slow everything down and make sure you understand every clause in the contract\u201d.

  "<p>A gentle, mysterious, monosyllabic presence, Alan Dickinson was, to my childhood imagination, less a man and more a wildling from some semi-mythical moorland tribe. He looked as rugged as <a href=\"http://www.kabrna.com/cpgs/devensian/almscliff_info.htm\">Almscliff Crag</a> and smelled of woodchip and weather. I viewed him with quiet awe.</p> <p>The husband of Andrea, my childminder, Alan was of farming stock, and his occupation was building dry stone walls. He has shaped my image of this trade ever since: inscrutable men stacking stones in windswept, lonely places where walls define the landscape.</p> <p>Today, in the fields topping The Chevin, the Yorkshire Dales branch of the <a href=\"http://dswa.org.uk/\">Dry Stone Walling Association</a> is hosting two events at once \u2013 a course and a competition. Stretches of wall belonging to Keith Willis, a supportive local farmer, have been disassembled and turned into an outdoor workshop. Roughly shaping the stones, the craftsmen chip off chunks of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/the-northerner/2014/jul/25/ramshaw-rocks-peak-district-dark-satanic-millstone-grit\">millstone grit</a>\u2019s soot-stained patina to reveal the carboniferous rock\u2019s bright buff interior, creating a camouflage pattern of polluted and pristine.</p> <p>Dry stone walls intrigue because there is a hint of the impossible about them. They stand as if by sleight of hand, artificial but organic; uniform but imprinted with individual handiwork; formidable but fragile. DSWA members aim to keep the art of making them alive.

The sound of a limestone block dropping into the right place is wonderful.\u201d You might even call it rock music.</p> <p>The passion in evidence today is inspiring, but wider changes are at work in the landscape. Long lengths of well-built dry stone wall can long outlive their maker, but a post and wire fence is a cheaper, if short-lived, option for cash-strapped farmers; many wallers now find more work in suburbia than the uplands. </p> <p>Perhaps my mental image of a dry stone waller may need modifying.

  "<p>Sharks are circling as the US prepares to vote, on the lookout for signs of American weakness and indecision around the world during the months-long transition period until the next president is firmly established in the White House. Call it a window of vulnerability.</p> <p>No matter whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, Barack Obama bequeaths a world fraught with danger. From Asia to the Middle East and eastern Europe, governments and forces hostile to US and the west <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/01/no-time-to-lose-why-the-next-president-must-move-quickly-to-reassert-u-s-power/\">may try to exploit America\u2019s power vacuum</a>. </p> <p>The problem is not new. Unlike in Britain, the US constitution does not allow a quick handover. Clinton or Trump will be sworn in at noon on 20 January 2017. Until then Obama remains in office, but as a \u201clame duck\u201d president his wishes are increasingly irrelevant.</p> <p>Once installed, it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments. The most important, such as national security adviser and the secretaries of defence and state, must be confirmed by Congress. This can be a contentious, lengthy process.</p> <p>The most disastrous transition was probably in 1860-61 between James Buchanan and his successor, Abraham Lincoln. During the interregnum, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths-about-why-the-south-seceded/2011/01/03/ABHr6jD_story.html\">seven states seceded from the Union</a>. When Lincoln came to office, he found the civil war already under way. </p> <p>Modern-day threats are mostly external (although some Trump supporters warn of domestic insurrection if he loses). North Korea is one of the most pressing. The dictatorship in Pyongyang has recklessly escalated its nuclear weapons programme in recent months.</p> <p> North Korea\u2019s latest provocations include the testing of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/north-korea-tests-submarine-launched-ballistic-missile\">submarine-launched ballistic missile</a> capable, in theory, of attacking the western US. The isolated regime has ignored stepped-up UN sanctions and is hardening its stance, determined to prove it is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37869993\"> Political upheavals in South Korea</a>, where the president faces pressure to resign, a tougher military posture adopted by Shinzo Abe\u2019s rightwing government in Japan, and the reluctance of China to crack down on its renegade ally add to a sense of growing instability. </p> <p> If Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s unpredictable leader, senses uncertainty in Washington, he may be tempted to fire a shot, literally or metaphorically, across the greenhorn president\u2019s bows \u2013 with incalculable consequences.</p> <p> China faces similar temptations. It has been sparring with the US navy in the South China Sea, where its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">expansionist maritime claims</a> and island-building have been ruled illegal by a UN court. Beijing is also squeezing Taiwan, whose new government its dislikes and whose de facto independence is underwritten by the US. </p> <p> Does Xi Jinping, China\u2019s all-powerful president, calculate he can use American distraction to his advantage? Some analysts suggest Xi would welcome a Trump presidency, because he and Trump think alike about national interest. Or maybe, scarily, he takes Trump for a fool he can bamboozle.</p> <p> Such considerations also loom large in the Middle East, where Russia seems intent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/aleppo-braces-russian-assault-rebels-vow-defy-putin-ultimatum\">helping the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad win the civil war</a> before the next American president has a chance to change Obama\u2019s hands-off policy or impose peace terms. </p> <p> In lawless Libya, where UN efforts to foster a unity government are failing, more nasty surprises may be in store. If Islamic State is evicted from Raqqah and Mosul, Libya may become its new centre of operations. The Yemen conflict, involving Iran and Saudi Arabia, is another powder keg.</p> <p> Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s leader, could also use the US power vacuum to consolidate or advance Moscow\u2019s interests, as defined by the Kremlin, in Ukraine and the Baltic region, where tensions are already high. </p> <p> How would Nato respond, for example, to increased Russian military activity and cyber warfare along the border with Estonia or Latvia? The alliance would, as usual, look to Washington for a lead. But one might not be forthcoming.</p> <p> Trump regularly disparages Nato, suggesting he may cut US support, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37858513\">like other macho men such as actor Steven Seagal</a>, appears to admire Putin. For her part, Clinton would be loth to begin her new presidency with an old-style superpower confrontation. </p> <p> On top of all that, as the US transition looms, there are, as Donald Rumsfeld said, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns\">\u201cunknown unknowns\u201d</a>.

Although the referendum was actually about marriage rather than children, the debate was dominated by the issue of the suitability of gay couples as parents, and the impact on children being raised by gay couples. Red herrings regarding surrogacy, adoption and consummation abounded.</p> <p>Because of constitutional and legal requirements of balance in broadcast media, those in favour and those against the referendum had a right to equal airtime. Many no proponents were thoughtful, respectful and careful not to offend, though there were certainly others who used the opportunity to propound extreme anti-LGBTI views. </p> <p>For LGBTI people in Ireland, it was difficult to concentrate on anything else in the run-up to the referendum. There was the constant worry of events intervening to scupper the yes side\u2019s prospects, and of a \u201csilent majority\u201d waiting in the long grass to reject the amendment.</p> <p>A survey conducted by Dr Sharon Dane, Dr Liz Short and Dr Gr\u00e1inne Healy (Swimming with Sharks<em>,</em> 2016) bears ample testimony to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/08/same-sex-marriage-irish-campaign-had-negative-effect-on-most-lgbti-people\">the considerable stress and anxiety that the referendum debate visited upon LGBTI people in Ireland and their close family members</a>. The survey of just over 1,650 people reveals that, notwithstanding the positive result, the experience of the preceding national debate was overwhelmingly negative and often profoundly distressing for LGBTI people, particularly younger people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/lessons-from-ireland-is-it-possible-to-have-respectful-disagreement-on-marriage-equality\">Lessons from Ireland: is it possible to have respectful disagreement on marriage equality? | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was also difficult, I sensed, for some older LGBTI people, who remember all too well the oppressive qualities of the church-dominated Ireland of the past, and may have wondered whether things had really changed enough to get the referendum over the line.</p> <p>For those who had not yet come to terms with or were not open about their sexuality, the debate must have been especially painful. It is no coincidence that calls to the national LGBT helpline increased during the course of the referendum.</p> <p>In the afterglow of victory, it is easy to say it was all worth it. Yet the potential impact of a majority no vote is sobering to contemplate. Imagine the people of your homeland, the country you love, telling you that you were not in fact equal, that you were something lesser? However reasonable the populace, the outcome of such a referendum is never a given. Bear in mind that for every Ireland there is a Slovenia, where a referendum last December saw a significant defeat for proposals to introduce marriage equality.</p> <p>Putting the matter to a national vote meant that a minority had to mount an extensive, expensive, and daunting national campaign, with no guarantee of success. Indeed, there is a compelling case to the effect that it is inappropriate to decide matters of minority rights by popular vote. As Omar Encarnaci\u00f3n has argued in the Irish Times<em> </em>\u201cthere is something inherently unseemly about putting the civil rights of any group, especially a historically oppressed one, to a popular vote.\u201d </p> <p>Part of the majority\u2019s reasoning in the US supreme court\u2019s Obergefell decision (the case that opened up marriage to same-sex couples across the US) was that fundamental rights should not be contingent on public opinion or the will of the majority. As the same court stated in West Virginia Board of Education v Barnette: \u201cFundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\u201d</p> <p>The marriage referendum, moreover, diverted energy from other pressing issues for the LGBTI community. This is not to criticise the fantastic Yes Equality campaign, the members of which have been instrumental over several decades in making Ireland a much better place. The referendum result has greatly improved the environment for LGBTI people, but it is far from a universal panacea for all ills.</p> <p>The case for a plebiscite becomes weaker still when one considers that the outcome will not affect the average heterosexual person in any appreciable manner. In Ireland, we have had marriage equality for almost a year. No heterosexual has been harmed in the process.</p> <p>Given that a plebiscite is neither necessary nor binding, and given the likely impact it will have on the LGBTI community in Australia, the case for a plebiscite simply does not stack up. Surely the better, more humane, more effective option is to put the matter to parliament.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><em>Dr Fergus Ryan is a lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth</em></p>",

  "<p>Smart technology that could shave \u00a390 off household energy bills and curb carbon emissions is being stymied by government policy, a leading thinktank has said.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging report, <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> also claimed that current energy policy offered too many incentives to build polluting diesel generator farms at the expense of cleaner technology. The thinktank pointed to an estimate by the government\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission that a smarter, more flexible power grid \u2013 which would allow businesses to store power and shift usage to less busy times of day \u2013 could <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-smart-power-revolution-could-save-consumers-8-billion-a-year-adonis\">reduce energy costs by \u00a38bn</a> by 2030.</p> <p>\u201cMaking the power system smarter will mean it can provide cheaper and cleaner electricity,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Richard Howard. \u201cThe current set of policies is encouraging a growth in dirty diesel generators \u2013 exacerbating air pollution in UK cities and towns. The government needs to level the playing field to encourage the use of cleaner technologies such as demand response and storage.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/demand-response-europe-policy\">Demand response</a> involves large energy users, such as factories, using power at times when there is less strain on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationalgrid\">National Grid</a>.</p> <p>This reduces the need for the Grid to ask fossil fuel energy firms to turn up the power at times when the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/14/winter-electricity-blackouts-risk-recedes-says-national-grid\">risk of blackouts</a> is increasing.

It said these measures, among others, could hand households a boost by cutting up to \u00a390 from energy bills by 2030, while also making renewable technology more viable.</p> <p>Technologies such as solar and wind power do not produce energy when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. But greater use of battery storage would allow renewable power firms to store their electricity to be released when conditions aren\u2019t right for them to produce. Experts say this would reduce the need to build large fossil-fuel-burning power plants, which are still needed to provide a more reliable source of power.</p> <p>Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: \u201cThis report is the latest in a long series of calls for the government to enable flexible technology to compete on equal footing with existing power stations. This will reduce the number of power stations that need to be built only to operate for a few hours per year, and increase the opportunity for UK businesses to take control of their energy bills, using electricity when it is at its cheapest and opening new streams of income, as well as helping Britain meet its climate change targets at the lowest possible cost.\u201d</p> <p>While industrial energy usage offers the biggest scope for reducing electricity demand, Policy Exchange also pointed to the potential benefits from fitting homes with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/smart-meter-energy-saving-revolution-cut-bills-gas-electricity\">smart meters</a>. The government has set a target of 2020 to fit every home in the UK with a smart meter, a box installed in the home that can monitor energy usage in real time. </p> <p>Howard said these could help ease the burden on the Grid and cut energy bills because suppliers could offer \u201ctime-in-use\u201d tariffs that charge customers based partly on when they use their energy.</p> <p>Power suppliers buy some of their electricity at short notice in the wholesale markets, where prices change depending on how much demand there is. If customers use energy at low-demand times, it limits the amount that suppliers need to buy when prices are high.</p> <p>\u201cAppliances are coming to the market that could be connected to the internet to run when energy is cheaper,\u201d said Howard. \u201cIt\u2019s all technically possible.\u201d</p> <p>Ofgem said it would be publishing a call for evidence on smart power networks that would look at electricity storage and demand response.</p> <p>\u201cProgress towards smarter grids is already being made,\u201d the regulator said, adding that it was looking into subsidies for diesel generators. \u201cSome diesel plants receive additional payments for generating during times of peak demand, in addition to the wholesale price of power. We have set out our concerns on this as we believe it is distorting the market. We are now considering the responses.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturers have fanned fears that the economy is heading for a slowdown in 2017 after a survey showed a rise in factory bosses putting off plans to increase investment.</p> <p>Since the EU referendum there has been a sharp rise in the proportion of executives saying political uncertainty is putting them off raising spending, according to a poll by the manufacturers\u2019 organisation the EEF.

Since then, the Conservative party signalled at its October conference that the government would go for a hard Brexit deal that leaves the UK shut out of Europe\u2019s single market.</p> <p>The EEF report, carried out with the bank group Santander, also echoed other surveys that have pointed to an export boost for some firms as the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum has made their goods more competitive in overseas markets. </p> <p>Manufacturers\u2019 views of export prospects improved between March and August on the back of better demand in Europe and the United States, the EEF said. But that was offset by firms becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for the domestic outlook. </p> <p>The EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said fears of an immediate collapse in business investment appeared to be unfounded for now and that UK manufacturers had been investing at a \u201chealthy pace\u201d in recent years.</p> <p>She added: \u201cBut the spike in political risk should not go unnoticed. There is caution amongst businesses, which will inevitably make it more difficult to get big decisions across the line.\u201d</p> <p>The threat to business investment and companies\u2019 hiring intentions increases the onus on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to use his autumn statement later this month, when he will set out the government\u2019s tax and spending plans, to shore up confidence. </p> <p>Hopley added: \u201cIt\u2019s over to the autumn statement now to press ahead with policies that further enhance the UK business environment for spending on modern machinery and increasingly important intangible investment.\u201d</p> <p>Economic indicators since the referendum have largely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-defies-brexit-slowdown-fears\">defied early predicions of a post-vote slowdown</a> as consumers have continued to spend, unemployment has remained low and the housing market has held steady, for now. The Bank of England followed City economists last week in revising away its forecasts for the economy to grind to a halt in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>But many experts warn that this is merely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/the-lull-before-the-tsunami-economists-on-the-brexit-watch-data\">the calm before the storm</a> and the real effects of the landmark vote to leave the EU will be felt after Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. The Bank is more optimistic on the near-term than it was in August and expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year but <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/nov.pdf#page=42\">still expects a stretch of relatively subdued growth of around 1.5% each year between 2017 and 2019</a> (pdf). </p> <p>A separate report on Monday underscores the scale of unease among businesses over the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects. Businesses are preparing for a slowdown in profit growth and domestic sales in the next 12 months, according to a regular check on corporate confidence from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).</p> <p>Confidence remained fragile in most sectors and business services and financial firms had seen the largest drop in sentiment on the back of growing fears of a hard Brexit, according the report, which used responses from 1,000 chartered accountants given from 26 July to 21 October.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">With the weak pound pushing up inflation</a>, thanks to higher import costs in the UK, companies are wary about raising pay and taking on new staff, the poll found. The average total salary growth expected in the next 12 months was just 1.6%. That compares with the Bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation at a much higher 2.7% next year. If both forecasts prove correct, it would mean earnings fall in real terms.</p> <p>Michael Izza, the ICAEW chief executive, said that a likely squeeze on households put companies in a difficult position.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor should be under no illusion at the pressure UK businesses are experiencing. Inflationary burdens are pushing up costs but companies know that customers will not accept higher prices,\u201d he said.</p>"
