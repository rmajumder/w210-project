  "<p>House prices will fall next year as the economy weakens following the vote to leave the EU, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent has predicted.</p> <p>Prices will fall by 1% in 2017 after weakening in the second half of this year with all regions affected except Scotland, where prices will remain unchanged, according to Countrywide.</p> <p>The company, which has more than 1,500 branches, said prices would fall because of economic weakness caused by uncertainty following the referendum decision on 23 June. Prices will rise 2% this year, a slowdown from last year\u2019s rate of 6.5% and 8.5% in 2014.</p> <p>The housing market will be affected by declining consumer confidence, reduced household spending power and rising unemployment. Prices will start rising again towards the end of next year and into 2018, but at a modest rate of 2%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/19/estate-agents-house-hunters-brexit-properties-sold\">Estate agents report fall in number of house hunters after Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/14/london-set-to-bear-brunt-of-post-brexit-vote-downturn-say-experts\">The most expensive parts of London will bear the brunt</a> of the slowdown with most of the impact happening this year. Prices in prime central London, which includes Westminster and Kensington, will drop 6% in 2016 and stagnate next year, Countrywide said. Greater London prices will fall 1.25% next year before rising 2% in 2017, the company said.</p> <p>Fionnuala Earley, Countrywide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cForecasts in the current environment are trickier than ever as the vote to leave the EU has thrown up many risks. Our central view is that the economy will avoid a hard landing. However, the weaker prospects for confidence, household incomes and the labour market mean that we do expect some modest falls in house prices.\u201d<br></p> <p>She said Brexit was not the only reason prices would fall. Higher stamp duty has affected demand for expensive homes and after several years of rocketing prices people no longer expect values to keep rising at the same pace, reducing demand. </p> <p>Earley said her forecasts were more likely to be too optimistic than overly gloomy. But a continuing lack of property for sale and very low borrowing costs should prevent a big fall in prices and house prices have a habit of doing better than expected, she said.</p> <p>Signals from the housing market have been mixed since the vote to leave the UK. Countrywide and other estate agents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/britains-largest-estate-agent-countrywide-announces-profits-down-25\">have issued profit warnings</a> as transactions have declined and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/19/estate-agents-house-hunters-brexit-properties-sold\">the number of house hunters fall</a>, the National Association of Estate Agents said last week. </p> <p>However, housebuilders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/bovis-homes-brexit-blip-new-home-sales\">have reported demand among potential buyers reviving</a> after a sharp fall immediately after the referendum. Persimmon, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, reports half-year results on Monday.</p> <p>The Bank of England cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% this month with many economists predicting a further reduction to 0.1%. The Bank\u2019s action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/13/interest-rate-cut-savings-rates-mortgages-borrowers\">prompted lenders to cut mortgage rates</a> yet further from fixed rate deals already close to record lows.</p> <p>Countrywide\u2019s prediction of a relatively modest fall in prices \u2013 back to the level in early 2016 \u2013 contrasts with gloomier analysts who argue the vote for Brexit will burst a bubble that has been building for years. Economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/18/brexit-could-cut-london-house-prices-by-more-than-30-says-bank\">said last month London property prices could plunge by more than 30%</a> and be slashed in half in the capital\u2019s priciest boroughs.</p>",

Uzbekistan\u2019s Ikhtiyor Navruzov appeared to have lost to Mandakhnaran Ganzorig 7-6 at 65 kilograms on Sunday. Uzbekistan challenged the scoring, likely because the Mongolian began running around in celebration with less than 10 seconds left rather than engaging with Navruzov. </p> <p>Navruzov won his challenge and the match on criteria as the last wrestler to score. Ganzorig, who had already started celebrating, fell to his knees in disappointment. The Mongolian coaches went much further than that. Byambarenchin Bayoraa took his shoes and shirt off and threw them to the mat in disgust in front of the officials. Tsenrenbataar Tsostbayar stripped all the way down to his blue briefs.

France have been coached by Claude Onesta since 2001, and have been utterly dominant in a way that is rare to see in a team sport. Both coaches are among the best that handball has ever seen.

This is because the USA uses a \u201cmedal count\u201d table and not, as is the case for the majority of the rest of the world a \u201cmedal table\u201d. The difference? In the \u201ccount\u201d table all medals are treated equally with a gold valued exactly the same as a bronze. Tell that to Usain Bolt and many others please! In contrast, the medals table counts golds first followed by silver and then bronze. This is fine for GB and China \u2013 as clearly GB has many more medals of a higher color than China but does a disservice to countries with many silvers and bronzes who are placed behind countries \u2013 such as Singapore and Fiji \u2013 with exactly one gold. My suggestion is to use a simple points system with gold = 5, silver = 3 and bronze = 1. USA would be on top with 364 points, GB narrowly pips China 218 to 210 but Mexico, with 3 silvers and 2 bronzes gets placed above the \u201cone gold\u201d countries with 11 points to 5.

The Eritrea-born athlete has rarely stopped running since. He claimed asylum in Scotland in 2008 after authorities ruled he was likely to face persecution back home. And in his first marathon, he summoned a performance of immense willpower to run 2:12:23 \u2013 a time good enough to qualify for the British Olympic team this summer.</p> <p>When asked what it meant to be representing his new country, the 25-year-old began to gently sob. \u201cI had a bomb accident when I was eight years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a serious injury, five places on my body, scar on my head.

One thing that occasionally steers me back to football is when you see someone genuinely joyful at scoring a goal for instance, rather than striking a pose and expecting everyone to come praise them. Just before Bolt\u2019s triple for instance the pole vault saw at least 2 of the 3 medalists shrieking uncontrollably at what could be the high point of their careers. For all the training and hype, Farah doesn\u2019t cross the line with the demeanor of someone who believes the gold is his by right.

  "<p>My birding friend Rob may have got married only the day before, but nothing stops him from looking regularly at his pager to check out the latest sightings of rare birds. Fortunately, he then took the trouble to text me the news: that a <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=055012\">collared pratincole</a> had turned up at the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/h/hamwall/about.aspx\">RSPB\u2019s Ham Wall reserve</a>, just down the road from my home.</p> <p>It would have been rude not to pay this bird a visit, especially as it should have been sunning itself on some Mediterranean marsh, not flying around the Somerset Levels. I had never actually seen this species before in Britain, so I walked along the disused railway line that bisects the marshes with more than the usual spring in my step.</p> <p>It was impossible to miss it \u2013 or at least hard to avoid where it had last been sighted. The usual crowd of locals and visitors clustered around their telescopes like a Masonic meeting, swapping stories and occasionally taking a look at where the bird had last been seen.</p> <p>For a few moments, I thought this would be another case of \u201cyou should have been here earlier\u201d, as vagrant birds have a nasty habit of heading off after a few hours. But then an excited cry went up, as this exotic visitor flew straight past our appreciative gathering. </p> <p>The name pratincole means \u201cmeadow-dweller\u201d, though it usually lives in marshes. Technically it is classified as a wader, but it looked far more like a tern, as it bounded to and fro across the sky, hawking for insects on long, slender, curiously kinked wings. From time to time, it took a rest, usually out of sight behind clumps of reeds, before appearing once again to delight its audience. </p> <p>At one point the bird came close enough for me to see its main distinguishing features: mid-brown above and white below, with a forked tail and white rump, making it look rather like a giant house martin. As it twisted in mid-air I caught a glimpse of the reddish-brown underwings. </p> <p>There were other exotic birds here too. A pair of <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=024022\">glossy ibis</a> was feeding on the marsh, while several <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=020013\">great white egrets</a> flapped lazily across the reed beds, as if in slow motion. A few years ago these would have attracted just as much attention as the bird we had all come to see, but now they are such a regular sight that most birders barely give them a second glance. Maybe in a few years time the same will be true of the collared pratincole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/20/birdwatch-jack-snipe-somerset-reedbeds\">A jack snipe plays hide and seek in the Somerset reedbeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eight pairs of great white egrets have nested here this year, a new record, which, considering the species had not even bred in Britain before 2012, is quite astonishing. Along with the <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=020059\">bitterns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=030088\">marsh harriers</a> that have also colonised in recent years, these exotic waterbirds simply confirm the fact that this is now one of the very best places to watch birds in the whole of the country. I\u2019m certainly glad this amazing site is right on my doorstep.</p> <p>I let the pratincole do one more fly-past on those spring-loaded wings, before heading back home to the usual work and domestic duties. In the meantime I can look forward to the next rare and unexpected bird to turn up here on the <a href=\"http://www.avalonmarshes.org/Ham_Wall\">Avalon Marshes</a>. I suspect I won\u2019t have too long to wait.<strong></strong></p>",

I\u2019m a two-time Olympic gold medalist. Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe I just said that!</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember getting hit throughout the fight. Did I get hit? This is crazy.\u201d</p> <p>The victory, in a rematch of the middleweight final at May\u2019s world championships in Astana, lifted Shields\u2019 amateur record to 77-1 and sealed a fourth consecutive global title for the 21-year-old from Flint, Michigan.</p> <p>Shields, who wore socks branded with the Superman shield, charged out of the red corner toward her longer, taller opponent from the opening bell. Fontijn flicked the left jab from the outside and used lateral movement to stay away from Shields\u2019 devastating power as fans chanted \u201cNouch-ka! Nouch-ka!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe got going shortly after the first round,\u201d said USA boxing head coach Billy Walsh, who lamented that visits from friends had cut into her warm-up time. \u201cThere was a bit of nerves starting off because there was a lot of pressure on her. She\u2019s red-hot favorite to win and to perform under those circumstances sometimes is difficult.\u201d</p> <p>The American started to find her range in the second round, connecting with a stinging left hook to the jaw early followed by a one-two combination upstairs. When Fontijn found herself inside, she went to the clinch. Better head movement from Shields made her a more elusive target during the middle rounds. Near the end of the third, a heat-seeking overhand right near clearly wobbled Fontijn.</p> <p>\u201cCoach Billy yelled out, \u2018Fake with the right, hit her with the right!\u2019 As soon as he said it, not even a second later, I threw it and I knocked her across the ring,\u201d Shields recalled. </p> <p>\u201cI caught a big shot and that can cost you a round, but the first round went well and the last went well and it was close,\u201d said the 28-year-old Fontijn, whose silver is the first boxing medal for the Netherlands since Orhan Delibas won silver and Arnold Vanderlijde took bronze in 1992. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the scores but I knew she was the world and Olympic champion so I knew I had to actually deliver twice as many punches to get the decision and I didn\u2019t do it enough.</p> <p>\u201cShe has a style that no one else has, but I think it\u2019s a style that\u2019s beatable and I think I was close today.\u201d</p> <p>In the final round as Fontijn\u2019s work rate waned, Shields goaded her opponent into throwing more punches, drawing jeers from the majority Dutch contingent in the stands. That was the lone round any of the three judges could find to give Fontijn.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s tall but she couldn\u2019t hit Claressa,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cClaressa\u2019s head movement, her timing and her management of the distance meant that she wasn\u2019t able to touch her so that was the key.\u201d</p> <p>Later on Sunday, Shields was awarded the Val Barker trophy as the best overall boxer in the women\u2019s tournament, becoming the sixth ever American winner and first since Roy Jones Jr at Seoul 1988. Uzbekistan\u2019s Hasanboy Dusmatov, who captured gold in the light flyweight division last week, was named the men\u2019s winner.</p> <p>\u201cI had decided this morning: She can\u2019t out-box me, she can\u2019t out-fight me, she can\u2019t out-think me, so how\u2019s she going to win?\u201d Shields said. \u201cShe got to knock me out but I knew she couldn\u2019t do that because I\u2019ve got a great chin. So I thought, this fight is in the bag, just got to go out there and do it.\u201d</p> <p>Shields\u2019 lone career defeat came at 2012 worlds against Great Britain\u2019s Savannah Marshall, who went on to win the title. Since then, the American captured gold as a 17-year-old at London 2012 \u2013 the first Games to include women\u2019s boxing \u2013 followed by back-to-back world championships and, now, a second Olympic gold.</p> <p>The victory lifted the United States\u2019 total medal count to three after Nico Hernandez\u2019s bronze at light flyweight and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/rio-olympics-mens-boxing-shakur-stevenson-robeisy-ramirez\">Shakur Stevenson\u2019s silver at bantamweight</a>, representing the Americans\u2019 best overall haul since winning four at the Sydney Games \u2013 a testament to the program\u2019s steady revival under Walsh.</p> <p>Shields, who remains the lone American of either gender to win gold in boxing since Andre Ward in 2004, pulled her London gold from her pocket and gleefully wore them both on the podium. Afterward she remained non-committal about the future and whether she will turn pro or make a run at Tokyo 2020. \u201cI didn\u2019t let myself think past this day,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to go home and see my mom.\u201d</p>",

But around 150,000 <a href=\"http://civiliansinconflict.org/resources/pub/within-and-beyond-the-gates-the-protection-of-civilians-by-the-un-mission-i\" title=\"\">are still sheltering in such areas</a> for fear of what would happen to them without the UN\u2019s shield, however flawed it may be.</p> <p>The development of peacekeeping operations has brought concerns of its own. There is anxiety that forces are stretched too thin, with 100,000 soldiers and police stationed in 16 countries, and disagreements about the remit of missions. The bulk of troops come from developing countries and often lack the experience and training for difficult assignments. At critical points, peacekeeping forces have chosen to take orders from their home governments rather than UN officials. When problems occur it is harder to remove unsuitable personnel if there is a shortage of people to replace them, especially when their governments threaten to pull others back too. South Sudan highlights the conundrum peacekeepers face when their job is to protect civilians <a href=\"http://peaceoperationsreview.org/thematic-essays/when-should-blue-helmets-walk-away-from-a-conflict/\" title=\"\">from the forces of the government hosting them</a>. No one wants to abandon civilians when political avenues have failed. Yet there is a danger that deploying peacekeepers can come to be seen as an easy fix, reducing the pressure <a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/08/south-sudan-and-the-perils-of-americas-peacekeeping-policy/\" title=\"\">to find real and lasting solutions</a>.</p> <p>Some of the problems with the system are those built into the UN itself. It is a vast, unwieldy bureaucracy which was structured 70 years ago, has grown ever since, and must constantly navigate its members\u2019 politics. Security council status trumps logic.</p> <p>The organisation\u2019s response to its mistakes can be as damaging as the errors. News of the attacks in South Sudan coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/un-public-admission-haiti-cholera-outbreak\" title=\"\">the UN\u2019s admission</a> - after six years of external and, increasingly, internal pressure - that its peacekeepers caused a devastating cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010. It flew in troops from an area where the disease was widespread, did not bother screening them, and failed to put in adequate toilet arrangements, so that faeces were dumped into water widely used for drinking and bathing. When inhabitants warned that an outbreak had resulted, the UN denied it for years. It has refused to pay any compensation. Ten thousand died, on a very conservative estimate, and cholera is now endemic. Experts want <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/as-the-un-finally-admits-role-in-haiti-cholera-outbreak-here-is-how-victims-must-be-compensated-64140\" title=\"\">an apology, financial payments to victims and families and proper backing</a> for the well designed but desperately underfunded plan to eliminate cholera in the country.</p> <p>The mishandling of the case echoes the organisation\u2019s initial response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/un-gross-failure-sexual-abuse-french-troops-central-african-republic\" title=\"\">allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation</a> by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic \u2013 suspending the whistleblower and failing to support child victims \u2013 though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/united-nations-widens-sex-abuse-inquiry-peacekeepers-central-african-republic-car\" title=\"\">it is now investigating</a>. In both cases, a culture of denial undermined faith in an institution that is badly needed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ijdh.org/2016/07/topics/health/un-secretary-general-candidates-divided-on-cholera-justice/\" title=\"\">The choice of a new secretary-general</a> this year is an opportunity to push for change; many complain that peacekeeping has slipped down the agenda on Ban Ki-moon\u2019s watch. The London conference also offers the chance to make progress on practical measures such as better training and planning. The world needs blue helmets for some of its toughest tasks. It is only fair to them and those they protect to ensure they are ready to meet the challenges, and to respond quickly, effectively and transparently when they do not.</p>",
  "<p>Each person sleeping rough is a sign that our society has fallen short, and successive governments have pledged to tackle homelessness. Labour has always been committed to ending homelessness, indeed under the last Labour government it fell by 62%. Yet under this Tory government rough sleeping has doubled and homelessness is up by a third. Behind each figure lies the story of individual suffering, whether it is rough sleepers huddled together in doorways, or those placed in emergency accommodation with their children by their local council, unsure of where else to turn or what is next. This is the harsh end of the housing crisis and we must fight it.</p> <p>It is Labour that is tackling rising homelessness, in government in Wales and in Labour-led local authorities up and down the country. And in parliament, it is Labour that is exposing the Tories\u2019 failure on homelessness. The Labour Campaign to End Homelessness appeal (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/17/we-call-on-labour-to-pledge-to-end-homelessness\" title=\"\">Letter</a>, 17 August) is a welcome intervention. It is right that Labour recommits itself to ending homelessness and explores proposals to provide greater support to those facing homelessness.</p> <p>Figures from the charity Crisis show that two-thirds of councils attribute the rise in homelessness directly to government policy on welfare reform \u2013 from the bedroom tax to the cap on housing benefit. The communities and local government select committee has just released a report on homelessness with wide-ranging recommendations (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/new-homelessness-strategy-is-a-must-say-mps\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 18 August). The government urgently needs a clear plan to help those currently homeless and to address the root causes of homelessness. Failure to do so would be a betrayal of some of our society\u2019s most vulnerable.<br><strong>Teresa Pearce MP</strong><br><em>Labour spokeswoman on housing and planning</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a simple problem at the heart of homelessness \u2013 and a corresponding remedy, not addressed by the latest Labour proposals. It is to be found in the original passage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act in 1977. Previously, whenever parliament brought forward legislation giving local authorities duties to house people, governments produced bills containing measures to provide powers and financial resources (subsidies and borrowing powers) to enable councils to provide new housing according to the local numbers affected.</p> <p>But in 1977 the then Labour government ducked this issue, and in doing so they facilitated the passage of the measure as a private member\u2019s bill sponsored by the Liberal MP Stephen Ross, without any financial backing from Whitehall.</p> <p>The results have always been unsatisfactory, because the act gives authorities duties to house people without any guaranteed resources to do so. This is why there is repeated litigation in which councils seek to avoid housing individual test cases. Councils still have other long-established statutory duties to house defined categories of household in priority need, but the government subsidies that used to underpin those duties have long since been withdrawn by central government. The right to buy has long been the biggest privatisation cash cow of income flowing from councils to HM Treasury.</p> <p>The answer is simple: both major parties need to support legislation to restore to local councils the powers and subsidies/borrowing approvals to provide new (or acquired) affordable homes to discharge their housing duties. Unless that happens I\u2019d guess that we will still be discussing the homelessness problem 40 years from now.<br><strong>Steve Smart</strong><br><em>Malvern, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The letter from Labour MPs and others on the need to address homelessness misses one crucial policy: we cannot build new homes without access to land. Before the government and others begin to build more homes they will need to acquire land, and in the face of this increase in demand, landowners will naturally increase the price of land, meaning the cost of these new homes will escalate. The answer is to remember that land is not a manufactured good but a free gift of nature. Housing policy needs to acknowledge that land speculation (the hoarding of land out of use) is the underlying cause of the high cost of homes. An annual land value tax would kill land speculation in its tracks and provide government with the funds to build more homes.<br><strong>Dave Wetzel</strong><br><em>Brentford, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Many readers will welcome the letter calling on the Labour party to pledge to end homelessness. But there are two causes of concern. First is the letter\u2019s focus on the most visible aspect of homelessness, rough sleeping. It claims that \u201cunder the last Labour government, homelessness fell substantially\u201d. Although true for rough sleepers, it is not true for the numbers in temporary accommodation, which more than doubled in England from 47,000 in 1998 to 100,000 in 2005 before eventually coming down to 50,000 in 2010. A policy focus on the much smaller numbers of rough sleepers will not address the problem of temporary accommodation.</p> <p>Second, in order for a sustainable reduction in temporary accommodation numbers to occur, there will need to be two policy changes, one of which gets no mention and the second bottom billing. The unmentioned policy change is an improvement in private tenants\u2019 security in order to make them less vulnerable to landlords\u2019 rent increases and evictions \u2013 which is now a major cause of homelessness. The second policy change is concerted investment in new social housing, especially public housing \u2013 number five in the letter\u2019s list of priorities. Unless a future Labour government gives top priority to new genuinely affordable social rental housing, the danger is that it will simply repeat the lamentable record on this issue of the 1997-2010 New Labour governments.<br><strong>Dr Paul Watt</strong><br><em>Department of Geography, Environment and Development Studies, Birkbeck, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is scandalous that the loopholes allowing the heirs of multi-billionaires to escape inheritance tax have persisted for so long (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/duke-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inheritance-tax-reform\" title=\"\">Duke\u2019s death prompts calls for tax reform</a>, 12 August). But just as scandalous is the method by which most of the Duke of Westminster\u2019s wealth was accumulated. His massive fortune arose largely from the unfairness of the leasehold system of property tenure, which allows freeholders of large estates to sell long leases on their land at a profit, whilst continuing to accrue sizeable revenues at the expense of the leaseholders as their leases shorten. The leaseholders also bear the full burden of repairs and maintenance of their homes, even though these are actually owned by landowners who contribute virtually nothing to preserve the fabric of the buildings on their estates.</p> <p>The residential leasehold system hardly exists outside of England and Wales. Our immediate neighbours, Scotland and Ireland, are doing their best to eradicate this exploitative form of tenure. Both countries allow existing leaseholders to acquire their freeholds on terms that reflect the fact that the relative contribution of leaseholders to the value of their homes is considerably greater than that of parasitic landowners.<br><strong>Nigel Wilkins</strong><br><em>Campaign for the Abolition of Residential Leasehold, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 An all-party committee of MPs has just published a strongly worded report on the issue of rising homelessness. Yet it was a majority of MPs that have just voted through the Housing and Planning Act, which will phase out security of tenure in the social sector and will force councils to sell off housing stock to subsidise the sale of housing association properties. The Chartered Institute of Housing has warned that, as a consequence of this law, 350,000 social rented homes could be sold, pushing more families into the private sector.</p> <p>And it was a majority of MPs that in 2010 approved the government\u2019s decision to drastically cut housing benefit for private tenants and freeze it, making it now impossible for many families to afford rents in cities such as London or Brighton and forcing families to have recourse to food banks. It was also a majority of MPs that voted in March 2012 to impose benefit caps and the bedroom tax, reducing housing benefit for social tenants as well.</p> <p>During all these years both CASE Central and Brighton Benefits Campaign have spoken to an increasing number of vulnerable tenants whose housing benefit has failed to cover their rents, who have been threatened with eviction at a landlord\u2019s whim, and who have been labelled as \u201cintentionally homeless\u201d by the homeless service. It is difficult for us to understand the consistency of the actions of an all-party committee formed, at least in part, by the same MPs that have deliberately voted for legislation that would clearly increase poverty, desperation and insecurity of tenure.<br><strong>Giuseppina Salamone </strong><em>Community, Advice, Support and Education</em><br><strong>Pip Tindall</strong> <em>Brighton Benefits Campaign</em><br><em>Brighton </em></p> <p>\u2022 Any new strategy on homelessness must have building more homes that people can afford at its core if it is going to succeed. Recent research by the Resolution Foundation demonstrated home ownership is at a 30-year low. Meanwhile, the ending of a private tenancy remains by far the single biggest cause of homelessness.</p> <p>Our own analysis reveals that of the \u00a345bn invested in housing by the government up to 2020-21, only \u00a32bn is dedicated to below-market rented housing \u2013 just 4%. This has to change if we are to reverse a trend which has seen homelessness rise steadily since 2010.</p> <p>We are delighted to see that the communities and local government select committee has endorsed what could become a crucial piece of legislation to tackle homelessness.</p> <p>But our housing crisis and our homelessness crisis are inextricably linked. It is crucial that a new legislative framework on homelessness is matched by a commitment to increase the supply of homes.<br><strong>Gavin Smart</strong><br><em>Deputy chief executive, Chartered Institute of Housing</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>In his letter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/10/fracking-bribes-raise-problematic-questions\">11 August</a>) Dr David Lowry raised the issue of radon and shale gas quoting studies in Pennsylvania and sought to reinforce his own views by quoting from a study undertaken by Public Health England in 2014. Let me quote the same study, which states, \u201ccaution is required when extrapolating experiences in other countries to the UK since the mode of operation, underlying geology and regulatory environment are likely to be different\u201d and \u201cthe PHE position remains, therefore, that the shale gas extraction process poses a low risk to human health if properly run and regulated\u201d.</p> <p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas present throughout the UK at very low levels. PHE recognised that radon may be released to the environment from shale\u2013gas activities, as is the case with existing natural gas supplies, but at concentrations that are not expected to result in significant additional radon exposure. PHE will be undertaking baseline outdoor and household radon monitoring in the Vale of Pickering in North Yorkshire in areas around Third Energy\u2019s KM8 well near Kirby Misperton at three-monthly intervals. The first monitoring \u201cmeasurements indicated that the radon concentration in the outdoor air around KM8 is close to the UK average\u201d. There is no indication of elevated radon concentrations in Pickering, a radon affected area in close proximity of KM8. The analysis for the control site in Oxfordshire showed that the radon concentrations were similar to those for the Vale of Pickering.</p> <p>Study after study undertaken in the UK by renowned universities, professional associations and regulators state that risks to the public\u2019s health are low as long as the shale gas industry is properly regulated. As a population we are fortunate to have a world-class system of regulation in this country. Our need for secure energy supplies from the UK is reinforced by our commitment to those standards.<br><strong>Professor Averil MacDonald </strong><br><em>Chair, UK Onshore Oil and Gas</em></p>",

For every City of Manchester Stadium, there\u2019s a Ricoh Arena, and the King Power Stadium, perhaps the noisiest new ground in the land, began life as the unloved Walkers Bowl.

  "<p>The creation of the 1.3 million hectare <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2015/11/a-critical-gift-peru-rejoices-as-a-new-national-park-is-born/\">Sierra del Divisor National Park</a> in the western Amazon in November 2015 generated considerable elation and Peruvian and international media coverage. Logging, gold-mining, coca cultivation and narco-trafficking were highlighted by some media as ongoing threats to the new park, but why such failure to acknowledge what is possibly, in the long-term, the most serious threat of all? </p> <p>The sorry, alarming fact is that approximately 40% of the park is superimposed by an oil and gas concession run by a Canadian-headquartered company, Pacific Exploration and Production. This is despite Peru\u2019s 1997 Law of Protected Natural Areas stating \u201cthe extraction of natural resources is not permitted\u201d in parks, while 2001 regulations on Protected Natural Areas state \u201cthe exploitation of natural resources is prohibited.\u201d In addition, Peru\u2019s 1993 Constitution \u201cobliges\u201d the government \u201cto promote the conservation of biological diversity and protected natural areas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3cacbdf0785ee245bbaa50bc84ee93116fae4a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3cacbdf0785ee245bbaa50bc84ee93116fae4a9/7_208_465_279/465.png\" alt=\"Map showing how Pacific's concession, Lot 135, with its boundaries in black and purple, overlaps the Sierra del Divisor National Park, with boundaries in red and sky blue.\" width=\"465\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map showing how Pacific\u2019s concession, Lot 135, with its boundaries in black and purple, overlaps the Sierra del Divisor National Park, with boundaries in red and sky blue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screenshot from July 2016 Perupetro map.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peru\u2019s government is currently preparing a \u201cPlan Maestro\u201d - \u201cMaster Plan\u201d - for the park and deciding how different areas within it will be used. Proposals seen by the Guardian, in Environment Ministry (MINAM) and Culture Ministry (MINCU) documents, are deeply concerning. While it is encouraging that almost the entire south-east part of the park is being proposed as a \u201cstrictly protected zone\u201d because it overlaps the <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/11271\">Isconahua Reserve</a> established in 1998 to protect indigenous peoples living in \u201cisolation\u201d, the whole north-east part of the park, which overlaps the <em>proposed</em> Yavari-Tapiche Reserve for other indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d, is not due to receive the same level of protection and instead is slated to be a \u201cspecial use zone.\u201d<br></p> <p>Why? Compare a MINCU map of the proposed zonification with maps from Peru\u2019s oil and gas sector and the reason is obvious: the proposed \u201cspecial use zone\u201d in the north-east corresponds to that part of the park overlapped by the oil and gas concession, Lot 135, where Pacific explored in late 2012 and 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b8a859d8810ab8bcf49736868994b0e27e58989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8a859d8810ab8bcf49736868994b0e27e58989/0_0_474_380/474.png\" alt=\"2009 Pacific map showing the company\u2019s interest in operating in part of what is now the Sierra del Divisor National Park, marked in dark green.

According to MINCU\u2019s map, the very southern tip of the park - and therefore the very southern tip of the Isconahua Reserve - will also be a \u201cspecial use zone\u201d, rather than a \u201cstrictly protected zone.\u201d Why? Again, the reason is obvious: that part of the park and reserve corresponds to an oil and gas concession, Lot 138, which was held by Pacific up until December 2014. </p> <p>It is a similar story in the far west of the park where one - admittedly tiny - area is also proposed as a \u201cspecial use zone.\u201d Yet again, the reason is obvious: that part of the park corresponds to an oil and gas concession too, Lot 31-B, ultimately controlled by the US-based Maple Resources Corporation. </p> <p>Indeed, the west and north-west of the park fall within what would be the Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserve, effectively proposed in 2007 as another off-limits area for indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d but which, like Yavari-Tapiche, has never been established. Only a small part of that proposed reserve now inside the park is due to be a \u201cstrictly protected zone.\u201d </p> <p>This zonification is being proposed by SERNANP despite Peru\u2019s 2001 regulations clearly stating that a newly-created \u201cprotected natural area\u201d must respect the \u201cproperty rights and other acquired rights\u201d of indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation.\u201d In addition, the regulations state that it must \u201cpromote mechanisms to make the objectives and aims of Protected Natural Areas compatible with their ancestral uses.\u201d</p> <p>Responses to the proposed zonification by indigenous organisations in Peru have included accusing SERNANP, which sits within MINAM and runs Peru\u2019s \u201cprotected natural areas\u201d, of backtracking on promises made during the administrative process to establish the park and \u201cmisinforming\u201d indigenous communities in the region. According to a declaration made in April this year by ORPIO, an indigenous federation representing more than 20 indigenous organisations in Peru\u2019s northern Amazon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Along with [indigenous organisations] AIDESEP and ORAU we supported the creation of the Sierra del Divisor National Park on the condition that the rights and protection of the indigenous peoples living there would be guaranteed by SERNANP, as much as in the law establishing the park and regulations for its management as in practice. . . Contrary to its commitments to acknowledge the proposed Yavari Tapiche and Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserves for indigenous peoples in isolation and give them the highest level of protection by classifying them as strictly protected zones, SERNANP has omitted all references to such peoples and reserves in the law creating the park as well as in the proposed zonification, and has even failed to acknowledge the proposed reserves in its maps.</p> </blockquote> <p>AIDESEP, an indigenous federation representing indigenous organisations across all Peru\u2019s Amazon, has been extremely critical too. \u201cSERNANP ignores existence of indigenous peoples in isolation in order to prioritise \u201ceconomic rights\u201d,\u201d ran the title of an AIDESEP statement summarising ORPIO\u2019s April declaration. </p> <p>The very north of the park also overlaps an area considered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2014/nov/28/brazil-javari-valley-threatened-peruvian-oil-tribes\">Mats\u00e9s indigenous people</a> to be part of their territory. A statement released in April by Mats\u00e9s from both Peru and Brazil said they reject any kind of oil and gas operations and demand Lot 135 is annulled. It also said the Mats\u00e9s confirm the presence of indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Yavari-Tapiche Reserve and claim the Brazilian government\u2019s National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) has evidence of them - and that as a result the two governments, Peru\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s, should coordinate.</p> <p>\u201cConsidering that part of the Sierra del Divisor National Park is the ancestral territory of the Mats\u00e9s and peoples in isolation, we urge that the park\u2019s Plan Maestro and zonification respects the presence of such peoples in the area proposed for the Yavari-Tapiche Reserve, as well as respecting the right of the Mats\u00e9s\u2019s traditional use of this zone and prohibiting activities by third parties,\u201d the Mats\u00e9s statement read. \u201cWe urge that the future control posts in the park in the River Yaquerana basin are run exclusively by the Mats\u00e9s.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, in July, ORPIO took legal action against MINCU, filing a case with the Superior Court of Justice in Lima. According to ORPIO, MINCU is violating 2007 regulations by moving too slowly to create the proposed Yavari-Tapiche Reserve and four others, and, in the meantime, failing to \u201cimplement the necessary mechanisms and measures\u201d to protect the indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d living there. </p> <p>Asked to respond to the indigenous organisations\u2019 accusations, SERNANP\u2019s Mariela Huachillo told the Guardian that they plan \u201cto implement the necessary mechanisms and measures to guarantee the protection of indigenous peoples in isolation and initial contact.\u201d She says that national parks are intended to protect \u201ccultural characteristics\u201d \u201cassociated\u201d with \u201cintangible\u201d eco-systems, that no \u201cnew rights\u201d can be granted to exploit natural resources, and that the park will be monitored and protected from outsiders. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, SERNANP cannot impose restrictions, through the zonification, on other sectors for which it is not responsible,\u201d Huachillo says.</p> <p>According to Huachillo, SERNANP is developing the Plan Maestro \u201cwith the financial support\u201d of CEDIA, a Peruvian NGO. CEDIA\u2019s Lelis Rivera told the Guardian the funds have been provided by the US-based Rainforest Trust, and that, while his NGO has provided \u201ctechnical and financial support\u201d, the Plan Maestro is ultimately \u201cthe responsibility of SERNANP.\u201d He says that the proposed zonification emerged from the administrative process establishing the park and can be traced back to 2012, that local indigenous communities agreed to the zonification, and that both AIDESEP and MINCU have been, from the start, part of the Ad Hoc Commission to develop the Plan Maestro and as a result the existence of the proposed reserves and the protection of the indigenous peoples in \u201cisolation\u201d \u201cis being taken into account.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe zonification comes with conditions, rules and laws which justify each type of zone, what you can and can\u2019t do where, and what are the special considerations for each space,\u201d Rivera told the Guardian. </p> <p>Just a few days after the park was created the US-based Andes Amazon Fund (AAF) announced it would provide $1 million, over five years, to help SERNANP to protect the park. AAF\u2019s Enrique Ortiz told the Guardian the money, none of which has been disbursed yet, will not be spent \u201con the development of the Master Plan or zoning\u201d, but that it will be spent on \u201cprotection activities\u201d although they \u201care still working out exactly what those will be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe zoning is a responsibility of SERNANP and we are not involved in it,\u201d Ortiz says. \u201cWe would certainly believe that SERNANP should address those concerns of the indigenous organizations.\u201d </p> <p>But will SERNANP do so? Can the proposed zonification be improved? Can the Rainforest Trust, given that it is providing funds, wield any influence?</p> <p>SERNANP\u2019s Huachillo effectively dodged those first two questions, saying instead that the establishment of the park didn\u2019t prohibit the Yavari-Tapiche and Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserves from being created. CEDIA\u2019s Rivera\u2019s answer was more encouraging: \u201cThe law states that SERNANP can change the zonification at any moment, if reality requires it, for example, if an acquired right is annulled or a reserve for the indigenous people in isolation is established.\u201d</p> <p>Pacific told the Guardian it disagrees that the north-east of the park is not being proposed as a \u201cstrictly protected zone\u201d because it is overlapped by its concession. </p> <p>\u201cPacific does not accept that part of the park could eventually not be considered a protected zone simply because part of it is assigned to [our company] under block 135,\u201d says Pacific\u2019s Melissa Mackie. \u201cWe have sculpted our operations based on the existence of these environmental restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>Pacific signed the contract for Lot 135 in 2007 - for 30 years for oil or 40 years for gas.

Newspapers El Comercio and Gestion reported that the government, under new president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, will \u201crevise\u201d the 1997 Law on Protected Natural Areas in order to promote oil and gas operations, while the president of Perupetro said in an interview with Gestion on 10 August that laws must be changed to permit operations in part of the Bahuaja Sonene National Park in particular and in \u201creserved areas\u201d in general. Following that came a statement by the Peruvian Hydrocarbons Society calling for legal changes and claiming oil and gas operations are \u201ccompatible\u201d with \u201cprotected natural areas\u201d, and then an interview on Peru\u2019s most popular radio station, RPP, with the new Environment Minister, Elsa Galarza, also talking up the compatibility of hydrocarbon operations with \u201cprotected natural areas.\u201d</p> <p>The Sierra del Divisor National Park is considered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2015/jul/29/peru-stalling-new-national-park-unique-amazon-mountain-range\">unique part of the Amazon basin</a> and home to a tremendous range of flora and fauna, including jaguars and pumas.</p> <p>Rainforest Trust did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the proposed zonification, but said instead that its work helps to protect \u201cthreatened tropical forests and endangered wildlife by partnering with local and community organizations in and around vulnerable areas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur unique, cost-effective conservation model for protecting endangered species has been implemented successfully for over 25 years,\u201d says Rainforest Trust\u2019s Marc Ford. \u201cOur partners work closely with their national governments and local communities to formally establish reserves protecting the land.\u201d</p> <p><em><br></em><br></p>",

  "<p>Brian Rix, Lord Rix, who has died aged 92, devoted his life almost equally to stage farce \u2013 as one of the most brilliant comic actors in the postwar years \u2013 and to campaigning for people with learning disabilities. He was successful at both. In the theatre, both in management and on stage, his name became synonymous with the \u201cWhitehall farces\u201d, named after the London venue and with plotlines usually involving a lie, a comic deception and someone being caught with his trousers around his ankles. Rix also ran repertory companies and presented more than 90 farces on television in the 1960s \u2013 to huge audiences \u2013 starring the big names of the day, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/23/dora-bryan\">Dora Bryan</a>, Sid James, Sheila Hancock and John Le Mesurier.</p> <p>Then, as the father of a child with Down\u2019s syndrome, he changed the direction of his life and became a campaigner and fundraiser for people with learning disability, in particular for the charity <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/\">Mencap</a>. He was its secretary general for seven years from 1980, and by the time he left the role, Mencap \u2013 and learning disability in general \u2013 had a much higher profile in the UK. He served as Mencap\u2019s chairman, 1988-98, then its president until his death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/26/letters-lord-rix-obituary\">Letters: Lord Rix obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born in Cottingham, east Yorkshire, Rix was the son of Herbert, a Hull shipowner keen on cricket, and his wife, Fanny, who loved amateur theatre. He maintained that being the youngest of four children meant he always had to fight for attention. His sister, Sheila, later Sheila Mercier, became an actor before him and is well known for her part as Annie Sugden in Emmerdale Farm.</p> <p>When Brian was four, the family moved to Hornsea, on the coast. Rix was sent as a boarder to Bootham school, in York, but hated it, admitting later to being a \u201cprecocious brat\u201d. He had an instinctive flair for self-projection that did not help with his academic studies. His father wanted him to go to Oxford to distinguish himself as a cricketer, but the second world war broke out and Rix became a pilot, navigator and bomb-aimer with the RAF. Then, faced with a 10-month wait before he was called up for duty, he wangled himself a tour with Donald Wolfit in King Lear and worked for Ensa (the Entertainments National Service Association). Further deferred, he took to rep in Harrogate.</p> <p>By the time he was demobbed in 1947, remembering Wolfit as an actor-manager he decided that this was the role for him. His father and two uncles shelled out \u00a3900, and Rix put in \u00a3100 of his own, to hire the King\u2019s Hall, Ilkley. Appearing in his first production there, the American farce Nothing But the Truth, he found the door through which he was supposed to enter the stage blocked and had to come in through the window of what was supposed to be a New York 28th-floor apartment. The \u00a31,000 investment produced a \u00a33,000 loss, but luckily a season of Babes in the Wood at Bridlington kept him afloat.</p> <p>It was at Bridlington that he laid the foundation of his future success as a shrewd picker of farces. He alone saw the commercial potential of the forces play Reluctant Heroes, which had been turned down by all the leading managements. By the time it reached London at the Whitehall theatre in September 1950, taking over from the long-running Worm\u2019s Eye View, Rix had made himself a force to be reckoned with in theatre management. He was to be associated with the Whitehall theatre for 25 years.</p> <p>In 1952 Reluctant Heroes became one of the first West End plays to be partly televised. As a result, there were huge queues outside the Whitehall. Rix negotiated a contract with the BBC that lasted 17 years. The TV work included a number of Sunday Night Theatre productions under the Brian Rix Presents banner in the late 50s and early 60s.</p> <p>Management was the art that mattered to him. For years he put on and appeared in the most noted farces of the West End, including Dry Rot by John Chapman, who had understudied him in Reluctant Heroes. Rix also appeared in the film of Dry Rot (1956), one of 11 film credits.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTqdS-b1zW8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mTqdS-b1zW8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The 1956 film Dry Rot, starring Brian Rix, Peggy Mount and Sid James</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For three years, 1977-80, he became controller to the ragbag of theatres run by the new masters of farces and musicals, the cinema owner Laurie Marsh and the playwright Ray Cooney. He vowed never to work as a subordinate again.</p> <p>Around this time, an activity that had been secondary to his stage work started to take over. In 1949 he had married the actor Elspet Gray; the first of their four children, Shelley, was born with Down\u2019s syndrome. Rix had already done some work with the Stars Organisation for Spastics (now the Stars Foundation for Cerebral Palsy) and in the late 70s, after 30 years of almost non-stop farce production and acting, he felt \u201cthe audience was going to get bored because I was getting bored,\u201d he said in an interview with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/22/brian-rix-actor-learning-disabilities-mencap\">Guardian</a> in 2014. He threw himself instead into fundraising for learning disability charities, and in 1978 he began the Let\u2019s Go! TV programmes for people with learning disabilities \u2013 he made 40 of them.</p> <p>In 1979 a job advert in the Guardian caught Rix\u2019s eye, for the position of Mencap\u2019s secretary general. He applied and was initially turned down, but was later accepted and started work in 1980. Those who thought Rix might be a humorous figurehead misjudged his passion and his management skills. His first act was to get the heads of the many departments together for one of the usual conferences \u2013 to tell them that such unwieldy meetings would be redundant in future, as he proposed to create four group heads. He visited regions, local societies, schools and adult training centres.</p> <p>He was not in the slightest bit afraid of controversy. In 1987 he clashed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/15/guardianobituaries.conservatives\">Lord Hailsham</a>, the lord chancellor, over the involuntary sterilisation of a 17-year-old girl with learning disabilities; even years later, Rix could not bring himself to say anything good about the man. Ministers who were late in living up to promises received blunt, if polite, letters or deputations.</p> <p>Once he moved on from the secretary general role to became chairman of Mencap, he was able to resume his theatrical career with a revival of Dry Rot at the Lyric theatre in 1989. But he tore a muscle on the opening night and received mixed notices. From 1986, Rix served as chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain Drama Panel, resigning in 1993 over cuts being made to drama.</p> <p>He was appointed CBE in 1977, was knighted in 1986 and in 1992 was made a life peer. In 2006 he voted against a bill on assisted dying because of concerns that it might be misused in relation to people with learning disabilities, but in recent weeks had written to the speaker of the House of Lords urging a change to the law \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to allow \u201cthe many people who find themselves in the same situation as me to slip away peacefully\u201d.</p> <p>Shelley died in 2005, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/19/elspet-gray\">Elspet in 2013</a>. Rix is survived by three children, Louisa, Jamie and Jonathan.<br><strong>Dennis Barker</strong></p> <p><strong>David Brindle writes:</strong> What drove Brian Rix to campaign so tirelessly, and so effectively, for people with learning disabilities was a burning anger at their marginalisation by society. Never did he forget how he and Elspet had to fight pressure from the establishment \u2013 and family \u2013 to place their young daughter Shelley in a spartan institution and walk away.</p> <p>Some present-day disability-rights activists have mistakenly seen Rix as an apologist for residential care. It is true that he was concerned at the isolation of some disabled people living in the community, following the rundown of the long-stay hospitals, but it was under his chairmanship that Mencap laid plans for <a href=\"http://www.glh.org.uk/\">Golden Lane Housing</a>, which today provides homes for more than 1,700 people with support needs. He believed that learning disabled people should live in family-sized groups, rather than alone.</p> <p>As its secretary general for seven years, he modernised Mencap and raised its turnover sixfold. As chairman for 10 years thereafter, his proudest achievement was to drive through the constitutional changes that created a national assembly, made up of people with learning disabilities, their families and carers, and that gave majority control of the charity to elected trustees, of whom at least one must be a person with a learning disability.</p> <p>In the Lords, as a crossbencher, Rix spoke and lobbied on learning disability and autism at every opportunity. He was shocked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/01/panorama-care-home-abuse-investigation-government-review\">Winterbourne View scandal</a> in 2011 and deplored the \u201cmonstrous\u201d treatment of 1,300 people subsequently found living in similar \u201cassessment and treatment\u201d units in a reinvention of long-stay care.</p> <p>\u2022 Brian Norman Roger Rix, Lord Rix, actor-manager and learning disability campaigner, born 27 January 1924; died 20 August 2016</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/03/dennis-barker\">Dennis Barker</a> died in 2015</p>",

A professional investor isn\u2019t worrying about needing to retire in four or five years with a much, much smaller 401k plan. He can afford a long-term view.</p> <p> The average woman in the street, however, is in a much different position. Not only are her savings smaller, but the collapse in interest rates \u2013 part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s repeated attempts to jump-start the economy \u2013 has left her fixed income investments yielding almost nothing. </p> <p>Her house, which represents a larger share of her net worth than that of a more affluent investor, may have lost value. Or at least she probably can\u2019t count on its value at the same rates as before 2008, when the housing market cratered and left only San Francisco and New York City as real estate exceptions. </p> <p>Her job may be less secure, as companies cut costs. Her salary, which also is more important to her financial wellbeing than her investment income, is almost certainly flat, and she pays a higher proportion of the cost of the benefits she receives. </p> <p> To profit from the market\u2019s record highs, she would have to be willing to take on more risk in her investment portfolio \u2013 if she has one at all \u2013 and load up on stocks. And for many Americans, that feels like it\u2019s asking too much. They probably aren\u2019t wrong.</p> <p> The last bull market in stocks ended brutally when the dotcom bubble burst in the spring of 2000, but it wasn\u2019t followed by a chasm opening in wealth inequality, as in the crisis of 2008. If that late-1990s boom gave birth to \u201cequity culture\u201d \u2013 the idea that stock investing can go mainstream \u2013 then the 2008 crisis may have handicapped the idea. </p> <p>Too few Americans have profited too little from the stock market rally, while a handful of the country\u2019s wealthiest have taken the lion\u2019s share of the profits, simply because they have the spare capital to invest.</p> <p>Rises in the stock market have persistently accompanied increases in income inequality <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/may/does-stock-market-impact-income-inequality\">from 1979 to 2011</a>, according to a report by the St Louis Federal Reserve. Even middle-income families are less likely to expose their savings to the higher risks of the equity markets, the report concluded.</p> <p> And the reason those stocks have climbed? Well, it\u2019s as much due to interest rates as corporate profits. As long as bond yields are at their current basement levels, even anemic profits look attractive to investors,relative to bonds. It\u2019s growth! And bonds aren\u2019t going to be delivering that any time soon. So what else is an investor to do? As the old saying goes, in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. And that one-eyed man, right now, would be US stocks.</p> <p> The truth is that the stock market\u2019s records may be fragile. Corporate earnings have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-31/global-earnings-tumble-as-companies-dig-deeper-for-cost-savings\">declined for the fifth straight quarter</a>, and those companies that have managed to post higher profits have done so by cutting costs rather than generating higher sales. That <em tabindex=\"-1\">should </em>be bad news for stock prices, which typically trade as a multiple of a company\u2019s earnings. </p> <p> The only thing that\u2019s keeping the party going for now is super-cheap money, AKA low interest rates. As long as that\u2019s happening, well, the only place to park your spare cash \u2013 if you\u2019re an investor \u2013 is in stocks. </p> <p> But it\u2019s interesting to look at just where those investors are choosing to put their money. By far the strongest performers of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 10 sectors are the telecommunications and the utilities sectors, both crammed full of stocks that pay out big dividends to their investors every quarter. In other words, investors are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-it-still-makes-sense-to-buy-stocks-and-bonds-at-record-prices-2016-07-22\">flocking to the safest companies out there</a>, and the ones that will behave the most like bonds, paying them dividends instead of interest . There just aren\u2019t very many cheap stocks left \u2013 another reason to feel gloomy as the market has hit highs. </p> <p> Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t matter as much if more of us had managed to capture more of the gains. But we haven\u2019t. But when this geriatric bull market eventually gives up the ghost, all of us who have any kind of investment portfolio, however small, will share the pain. The smaller our portfolios, the more significant those losses will be.</p> <p> Ultimately, the only thing average Americans seem able to count on is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/aug/30/stock-market-ditch-crystal-ball-volatile-priorities-predictions\">financial insecurity</a>. Their increased productivity has gone to higher profits for corporations, and companies have paid those profits to shareholders in the form of higher stock prices, rather than to employees in the form of higher compensation. Only if that is reversed will we all be able to truly celebrate a bull market that profits everyone.</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>Athletes know all about productivity. Their lives are spent eking out improvements in performance through new training methods, better diets and learning from their rivals. A personal best is productivity writ large: doing better this year than you did last.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is dramatic. The Olympic record in the long jump set by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDTNFhiQ8ig\">Jesse Owens </a>in Berlin in 1936 lasted for 24 years. Eight years later there was another big advance. Nobody has managed to beat the Olympic-best of 8.90 metres managed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEt_Xgg8dzc\">Bob Beamon </a>in Mexico City. This year\u2019s victor in Rio, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWX2LdlxsQ\">Jeff Henderson</a>, won with a jump more than a half a metre off Beamon\u2019s record.</p> <p>More often, gains are slow and incremental. Athletes run a few hundredths of a second faster, throw the hammer, the shot or the javelin a few centimetres further. New technology often plays a part: it has only been possible to break the six-metre barrier in the pole vault because carbon-fibre poles are more flexible and less likely to break.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the murkier side of sport. Productivity improvements are not always just the result of pumping more iron and pounding round the track: they can be achieved by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It is notable that progress in many events has stalled since testing regimes have been tightened up.</p> <p>The limitations of the human body may mean that it will prove impossible to run 100 metres in less than nine seconds or long jump more than 10 metres. Productivity gains will become slower and slower until they stop altogether. Ultimately, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Henderson was unable to beat Beamon\u2019s (altitude-assisted) record. All he needed to do was beat the rest of the field in Rio. Seeing the medals decided in the sixth and final round was still gripping viewing.</p> <p>It matters a lot more that the US, Henderson\u2019s country, saw productivity not just slow but actually fall over the past year. What this means is that output per worker in 2016 is lower than it was in 2015: the world\u2019s biggest economy became less effective at producing goods and services. Falling productivity means Americans are seeing their living standards decline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/uk-productivity-gap-widens-to-worst-level-since-records-began\">The UK\u2019s recent productivity performance has been almost as dismal</a>: output per worker grew by 0.2% in the latest 12-month period, well down on its pre-financial crisis trend of 2.3%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/aug/16/why-are-uk-workers-so-unproductive\">Why are UK workers so unproductive?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically, just as with Owens and Beamon in the long jump, there are sometimes big leaps forward. Technological advances such as the printing press, the steam engine and the internal combustion engine change societies radically and can act as the catalyst for faster productivity growth. Yet, in the decades between these paradigm shifts, progress is more incremental.</p> <p>Michael Pearce, global economist at Capital Economics says the rate of productivity growth has been slowing in advanced countries almost continuously since the 1960s. \u201cThere are plenty of possible reasons for this, including the fading boost to productivity from previous waves of innovation, the diminishing gains from further economic integration, and the shift of global activity away from manufacturing and towards services.\u201d</p> <p>The postwar period experienced a rapid spurt in productivity. In part, that was because it took time to fully exploit the technological advances of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was particularly true of Europe and Japan, where slow growth during the 1930s and the devastating impact of the second world war meant there was scope for a prolonged period of catch-up with the world leader, the US.<br></p> <p>But they couldn\u2019t keep up the blistering rate of progress. Rather like someone who is totally unfit joining a running club, they initially make rapid improvements as the pounds are shed and the legs get stronger, closing the gap with the faster athletes. But progress eventually slows.</p> <p>Similarly, it is still possible to squeeze productivity gains out of mature technologies but they are harder to achieve. It is more than a century since the first cars appeared on the streets, yet the auto industry is still looking for ways to make better cars more efficiently. <br></p> <p>Economies can grow even when productivity is exceptionally weak, as it has been in the years since the global recession. That\u2019s possible if the labour force expands or if people work longer hours. The problem seems to be the weakness of investment. Companies are tending to employ more labour to work with ageing capital equipment, leading to weaker productivity.<br></p> <p>Central banks have become like the dodgy coaches administering drugs to their athletes. They have found ways of making performance look better than it would otherwise be. Instead of artificial stimulants they have used ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing.</p> <p>In theory, individual countries are not supposed to use these unconventional measures to the detriment of their rivals. Loose monetary policy is deemed to be fine if it is for domestic purposes \u2013 raising the growth rate or steering clear of deflation \u2013 but not if it is to secure a competitive advantage by driving down the currency.</p> <p>But everybody suspects everybody else of cheating. The Americans are convinced that the Chinese are deliberately holding down the level of the yuan in order to boost exports. The reluctance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">US Federal Reserve </a>to raise interest rates is deemed, in part, to be the result of concerns about an over-strong dollar. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/bank-of-japan-blames-brexit-as-it-unleashes-more-monetary-stimulus\">Japanese have openly admitted that they would like to see the yen lower.</a> Concerns about the strength of the euro help explain why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank </a>is mulling the possibility of fresh stimulus measures this autumn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England </a>is in a different position. A cheaper pound would have been necessary at some point if the UK was ever to start closing its colossal balance of payments deficit. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>has delivered that depreciation without it looking like an act of beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Threadneedle Street is taking full advantage of the situation: dropping strong hints of further interest rate cuts to come is designed to ensure that the unlooked for competitive boost provided by the referendum is not dissipated.</p> <p>If this were the Olympics, the closest comparison would be the Devil Take the Hindmost race in the cycling omnium. There, the rider at the back of the field drops out every couple of laps, and each contestant pedals furiously to ensure it is not them.</p> <p>Eventually, central banks hope to create the conditions for an acceleration in productivity growth. The idea is that boosting demand will lead to better supply-side performance. That, though, is taking some time. The past few years have been a slow-bicycle race led by China, with the US the best of the developed countries. </p> <p>Eventually, innovation and more skilled workforces will result in higher productivity. For now, though, central banks are expending a lot of effort for less growth than in previous decades. None is close to a PB.<br></p>",
  "<p>Anna Longthorp likes looking at her pigs. She stands, hands on hips, with the relaxed gait of a woman used to the challenges of keeping upright in a cracked and furrowed field, and watches her animals. \u201cIf your pigs are happy they\u2019ll be more productive,\u201d she says, bluntly. The sturdy porkers in front of us, part Landrace for the long loin, part Duroc for the intra-muscular fat, certainly look the part. Outdoor bred, free range reared, they snuffle in the sandy earth, breaking off to chase each other from one end of their low-density plot to another. Away in the distance are the heavy industry of the Drax and Eggborough power stations, but here, on this reclaimed airfield, is pig heaven.</p> <p>\u201cA story sells,\u201d Longthorp says, wryly. She knows that the manner in which she raises many of her animals is exactly what a lot of Britain\u2019s food-aware customers want. Attach words such as \u201coutdoor reared\u201d and \u201cfree range\u201d to the crackled Sunday roast and the price goes up. If the story is right it will attract a premium.</p> <p>But the bigger story of the British pig business is nowhere near as straightforward or cheery. It is an example of the way agriculture has become a globalised business; one in which even the produce raised closest to our kitchens is at the mercies of economic imperatives shaped far away. Shoppers may say they want a certain type of product: cared for in Britain by someone like Anna Longthorp; working for a family farm rather than some huge corporation; supplying their meat through as few hands as possible. But the reality can be rather different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/05/what-rural-issues-are-important-to-you\">What rural issues are important to you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the reasons Longthorp likes looking at these pigs, spending their last few weeks on her unit near Snaith on Yorkshire\u2019s East Riding, is that these are the ones she could afford to fatten up herself. The British pig industry goes through cycles of boom and bust and right now it is recovering from a major bust. In response to EU sanctions on Russia for its invasion of the Crimea in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/16/cheap-imports-hit-pig-farmers\">Russia introduced a tit-for-tat embargo on various food stuffs</a>, including pig meat, from western Europe. Germany had ramped up production to meet Russia\u2019s growing appetite. Suddenly that market was gone. That meant oversupply which in turn meant the European-wide price of pig meat plummeted. Britain has not generally exported to Russia. Still Britain\u2019s pig farmers, locked into the European market price, suffered.</p> <p>It costs about 130p a kilo to produce pork. Earlier this year the price farmers were receiving dropped to just 112p. Many British farmers were losing between \u00a310 and \u00a320 a pig for every one they sold. Longthorp was partly protected from the worst of this. Eight years ago, in her mid-20s, she took over the pig business that had been established by her mother 25 years ago and set up a brand called Anna\u2019s Happy Trotters. It sells her outdoor bred and free range animals and products such as bacon and sausages produced from them. Through hard marketing work, she established a premium price of 220p a kilo for meat sold under that brand, to take account of her much higher costs, and has been able to stick to it. There\u2019s money in a good story.</p> <p>The business has two units, each with 700 breeding sows, and produces 650 pigs a week for slaughter, at a rate of around 23 piglets a year from each sow, across just over two litters annually. Only a quarter of that is free range due to lack of land. Her more standard production has been subject to lower prices. She also breeds too many pigs for the amount of space she has. She used to send some out for what\u2019s called \u201cbed and breakfasting\u201d: getting another farmer to fatten them up before returning them to her for slaughter. But with prices plummeting she could no longer afford to do this. \u201cI now sell a lot of weaners,\u201d she says, referring to the piglets. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of reducing risk and locking in some profit.\u201d She\u2019s not happy about it.</p> <p>The result of the past few rocky months has, unsurprisingly, been a contraction in the British industry. \u201cWe think we can identify about 20,000 breeding sows that have gone out of the national herd,\u201d says Peter Crichton, a pig market expert who writes a trade magazine column on the industry. \u201cThat\u2019s about 5% of the breeding herd. In the long term we will be shorter on domestic pork.\u201d In the 1980s the UK breeding herd was more than 800,000. Now it\u2019s fallen below 400,000. At one point we were about 80% self-sufficient in pork. Now it\u2019s 55%. However, because of exports, only 40% of the pork we consume in Britain is actually produced here.</p> <p>That matters because Britain is unique in the way it raises its animals. In this country while only 2\u20133% is entirely free range, 40% is outdoor reared and another 30% is raised on straw in open sheds. Accreditation systems such as the Red Tractor mark, which require four visits a year from vets, enforce higher welfare regimes. In the rest of Europe \u2013 including the likes of Denmark and the Netherlands \u2013 pig farmers have historically followed lower welfare regimes. Almost all of it is intensively reared indoors on a slatted system without straw. This has cost efficiencies. In the straw-based system there\u2019s the obvious cost of the straw and the labour to remove it when it\u2019s soiled. In slatted systems, used for just 30% of UK pig production, faeces simply fall through the floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12b1c5941f36e875fff44dc28fd9c761d8c446ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12b1c5941f36e875fff44dc28fd9c761d8c446ce/0_129_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pigs on Anna Longthorp\u2019s Yorkshire farm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pigs on Anna Longthorp\u2019s Yorkshire farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/Observer Food Monthly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Longthorp\u2019s pigs are raised in circumstances that could be described as bucolic; the slatted system really isn\u2019t pretty. Those who are appalled by the very notion of farming pigs, who regard the realities of the industry described here as repellent, will make little distinction between methods. It will all be atrocious. But to many consumers these things matter, not that retailers always respond. The big supermarkets are still buying lots of this lower welfare pork, much of it imported, for their standard ranges.</p> <p>That pressure on price has partly come about through the rise of the discounters, Aldi and Lidl. Because they buy small ranges in large volume and spend little on frills, the discounters generally pay a good price and are regarded as good customers. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the big four supermarkets try to take them on that\u2019s the problem,\u201d says Crichton. \u201cWhen foreign pig meat is cheaper than ours they\u2019ll simply bring it in.\u201d</p> <p>Historically one of the reasons so much of Britain\u2019s pig industry is less intensive is the difficulty of getting planning permission for the facilities. But there is also simply a greater interest in animal welfare in the UK compared to much of continental Europe. There is an understanding that pigs are not dumb; that they need stimulation. As Anna Longthorp says: \u201cThe consumer is willing to pay enough if the story is right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a2225b6796e19c9e14067d9db7ab1ec8882af06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a2225b6796e19c9e14067d9db7ab1ec8882af06/0_1180_3840_3839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pig Farmer David Owers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Owers in Lincolnshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>David Owers, a pig farmer from Lincolnshire</strong> these past 45 years, uses an indoor straw-based system. He says he thinks it\u2019s best for welfare, though the supermarkets aren\u2019t prepared to pay enough for it. We stand looking into one of his open-sided sheds, at sprightly pigs, now at around 35kg each, bouncing around bales of hay. \u201cA slatted system would be cheaper but this is the most viable if you care about welfare,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I suggest the best welfare system actually involves having them free range and outdoors. He disagrees; having sows indoors in crates for weaning stops them rolling over on to piglets. \u201cOur mortality rate is about 5.5%. Outdoor reared systems have a mortality rate of 10% to 13%.\u201d I put this to Longthorp, who surprises me by agreeing. \u201cOur mortality figures aren\u2019t as good as indoors,\u201d she says, as she leads me around the fields housing the breeding unit. Here the sows come and go from the sheds in which they wean. And yes, they lose piglets. \u201cBut it\u2019s about quality of life. Truth is, the label doesn\u2019t mean much. You can have good free range and bad free range, good indoor and bad indoor.\u201d So what can the consumer do? \u201cLook for things like the <a href=\"http://www.redtractor.org.uk/\">Red Tractor mark</a>,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One of the big problems for British pig producers is the volatility of the market. After that low of 112p a kilo, producers in Germany slaughtered breeding sows to reduce supply. That lifted prices. Then Brexit happened and the pound began to slide, a nightmare for importers but for exporters paid in euros it was a godsend. Not only was the base price on the up, but so was the value of that currency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/27/brexit-disastrous-britains-farm-animals-eu-laws-cruel\">Brexit would be disastrous for Britain\u2019s farm animals | Sam Barker</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>But the greatest international influence on </strong>prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/20/chinas-meat-consumption-climate-change\">has been the Chinese market</a>. The country now produces half of all the pork on the planet. A surprisingly large amount of that production has been on what would be recognised in Britain as a 19th-century model: peasant farmers keeping two or three pigs in their backyard. In the past year the Chinese introduced a new five-year plan to phase out backyard pig rearing and expand modern production. They also want to spread production more evenly around the country, rather than have it concentrated in small pockets. In response to the uncertainty, production in China has plummeted and prices have risen. Pork producers in China are now getting around 220p a kilo, ahead of most premium producers in the UK.</p> <p>They\u2019ve also been importing more. It used to be just the so-called \u201cfifth quarter\u201d \u2013 offal that the British didn\u2019t want. Now they are taking whole animals. Shipments to China from Britain in the year to May were up 72%. China now accounts for half of all British exports. This suggests opportunities for the future. However when prices settle, as they invariably will, it\u2019s likely that the Chinese will come after the intensively reared European production, leaving the British once more out in the cold.</p> <p>As a result there are expectations that the industry will continue gently to contract and the family-owned model will become increasingly difficult to maintain. You may like the idea of your roast coming from an army of Anna Longthorps. The reality may well be rather different. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen for the past few years,\u201d says Mick Sloyan, pork director of the industry body AHDB, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, \u201cis individual farms staying the same size but being taken over by farming corporations. Already just 16 farm businesses produce 50% of all the pigs in this country.\u201d Currently, he says, there is a market in the UK for the 40% that are outdoor reared and then finished inside on straw. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The rest will just have to hope the supermarkets are prepared to pay enough, or go intensive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"423783056f0d33d92842f75588c857f66677d205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/423783056f0d33d92842f75588c857f66677d205/255_1028_3489_4361/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pigs at David Owers\u2019 farm\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pigs at David Owers\u2019 farm</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or farmers will simply quit. Tim Chapman, from North Yorkshire, is one of these. He\u2019s been at it for 36 years. He\u2019s been through spikes in feed price and the foot and mouth crisis. Finally he\u2019s had enough. He\u2019s winding down his 550-strong breeding unit. \u201cIn the end it wasn\u2019t just the money we were losing,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed further investment which was going to be tricky and there were staffing issues. It was just everything.\u201d Then he had a conversation with a local butcher and discovered that however little he was paid as the farmer, the processor always made the same profit. \u201cIn this industry all the risk goes on the farmer.\u201d</p> <p>And so another part of Britain\u2019s pig-rearing tradition goes. What does all this mean for the future? In the long term, the pig industry will probably become more like the wine business. At one end will be a high-welfare, low-intensity premium product, flogged to those whose interest in the way the animals they eat are cared for is matched only by the depths of their pockets. The rest of the industry will be buffeted by the cold winds of the international markets. Mainstream consumers may claim an interest in welfare. They may say they want the best. But all too often it comes down to simple pounds and pence. At which point it\u2019s the pigs that suffer.</p>",

  "<p>As we celebrate the ambition, calibre, and achievements of champions competing at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, there is also the stark reality that malnutrition is compromising the survival, health and potential of billions of individuals globally.</p> <p>Malnutrition is often confused with hunger, but they are quite different. Hunger, which affects around 800 million people, is the physical experience of a lack of food. Malnutrition on the other hand, results from the consumption and absorption of either too little of the right kinds of food or too much of the wrong kind. </p> <p>Globally, one in three people suffer from malnutrition and according to the World Health Organisation over 3 million children die from it every year. Malnutrition is also a crucial factor determining whether a woman will survive her pregnancy, whether her child will reach his or her fifth birthday, whether they go to school and learn, get a job and contribute to society. </p> <p>For decades malnutrition has been undermining the growth, development and economic potential of billions. Leading <a href=\"http://glopan.org/sites/default/files/Costs-of-malnutrition-brief.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">experts</a> (pdf) have estimated the annual economic losses on account of global malnutrition at $3.5tn (\u00a32.7tn) and there is ample evidence that tackling malnutrition offers some of the highest economic returns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/20/we-must-focus-on-the-un-goals-that-are-the-best-value-for-money\">We must focus on the UN goals that are the best value for money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite this, the level of political commitment to this issue is shocking.

The landmark <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-host-high-level-meeting-on-global-nutrition-and-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\">2013 Nutrition for Growth summit</a>, co-hosted by the UK government and the government of Brazil, following the London Olympics in 2012, was a much needed catalyst to get world leaders, businesses, philanthropies, and civil society to talk about malnutrition. At the end of the event, the baton was passed to Brazil to host a follow up summit ahead of the Olympics in Rio to check in on progress and commit new resources to accelerate success.</p> <p>The much-awaited Brazilian Nutrition for Growth event took place in Rio on 4 August, a day before the opening ceremony. However, what materialised fell short of all expectations. Despite powerful addresses from Brazilian and Kenyan Olympians Robson Caetano da Silva and Tegla Loroupe, who spoke passionately about the need to improve nutrition globally, the most critical part of the summit was missing \u2013 political and financial commitments. Unlike the London summit, which was David Cameron\u2019s brainchild, heads of state from donor and developing countries were conspicuous by their absence in Rio, including high-level representation from the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/jul/07/a-girls-view-of-the-17-sustainable-development-goals-in-pictures\">A girl's view of the 17 sustainable development goals - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not surprising given the recent political turmoil in Brazil, as well as the change in leadership in the UK, but disappointing nonetheless.

Efforts to reduce malnutrition cannot be scaled up without political leaders stepping up and putting their money where their mouths are.</p> <p>At the end of last year, we as a global community adopted the sustainable development goals, which enshrines a target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030.

  "<p>To most of the world, the place where James Foley spent his childhood must look about as good as it gets: a clapboard house with a large garden in a small town next to a beautiful lake. Visualise the American dream and this is it, pretty much. Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where Foley grew up in a close-knit family of five siblings, is an affluent corner of a well-off state in the world\u2019s most advanced industrial economy. The worst thing you can say about the place is that it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/for-wolfeboro-nh-its-not-just-another-romney-summer.html\" title=\"\">where Mitt Romney goes on&#xa0;holiday</a>.</p> <p>This was where James Foley started his life. And on 19 August 2014, the world found out where and how it ended via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/james-wright-foley-beheaded-isis-video\" title=\"\">a video posted on YouTube</a> entitled \u201cA Message to America\u201d. Foley, a 40-year-old freelance photojournalist who had been kidnapped in Syria two years earlier, was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and kneeling on the ground. With his hands tied behind his back, he&#xa0;recited what was obviously a prepared script that listed America\u2019s crimes. And then, we all know what happened next: a masked man with a distinctive British accent put a knife to his throat and decapitated him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw his image being used as propaganda, for political agendas, and for me as a friend, that was uncomfortable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At home in New Hampshire, Diane Foley, his mother, found out when she got a call from a journalist she didn\u2019t know who asked her for her \u201creaction\u201d.</p> <p>If you wanted to eviscerate the American dream, to disembowel it, and string it up from a lamp-post for all the world to see how vulnerable it really is, how easily vanquished, then murdering James Wright Foley on the internet in front of a global audience is not a bad place to start.</p> <p>Foley could have been the poster boy for the all-American way of life: a handsome, square-jawed idealist from a well-off family \u2013 his father, John, a doctor, his mother a pillar of the local Catholic church \u2013 who\u2019d had all the advantages that western life can confer: a loving environment, a good education, a childhood unmarked by war or famine or disaster. That he had elected to leave all that and go and cover the ongoing insurgency in Syria for a few hundred dollars a pop from whichever outlet he could get to take his footage was neither here nor there to his captors.</p> <p>His murder was the first of a series of videos of western hostages being executed and it presaged an new form of terror. It was the video that introduced the world to \u201cJihadi John\u201d, or Mohammed Emwazi as we now know he was called. We know quite a lot about him now \u2013 how he grew up in upmarket parts of London \u2013 Maida Vale and St John\u2019s Wood, how Foley\u2019s fellow prisoners named him and two fellow British jihadis \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, and how, in November 2015, he was killed by a US drone strike. But his victims have remained pale and shadowy in comparison. They\u2019ve been stranded, for ever, in orange jumpsuits, destined to end their days reading someone else\u2019s words.</p> <p>And this is what <em> Jim: The James Foley Story</em>, a new documentary about the life and last days of James Foley, seeks to rectify. It\u2019s an intimate, moving portrait \u2013 nominated this month for an Emmy \u2013 made through interviews with his family, friends and fellow hostages, though it\u2019s not until the very end of the film, when his brother, Michael, addresses the nameless person behind the camera, that you realise just how intimate it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d6b176a22e3df60b29fbb2d45777030b7ac76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d6b176a22e3df60b29fbb2d45777030b7ac76a/0_0_4000_2722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foley (left) in 1982 with his childhood friend Brian Oakes, director of Jim: The James Foley Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foley (left) in 1982 with his childhood friend Brian Oakes, director of Jim: The James Foley Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Brian Oakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou know him as well as I do,\u201d Michael Foley says to the camera, talking about the video of his brother\u2019s death. \u201cHe would never have done those things if there wasn\u2019t someone else who would be harmed. He never cared for himself.\u201d Because the film-maker, Brian Oakes, did know him well, had known him, in fact, since he was seven years old, and grew up with him in the same small town of Wolfeboro. And the impetus for the film, he tells me from his home in New York, came from the desire to rescue his friend Jim, the boy he\u2019d grown up with, from the media creation and propaganda tool that he\u2019d become.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the original catalyst for me wanting to make this film \u2013 that image of Jim, of his death, his execution, which was seen throughout the world. I saw this image being used for a lot of different purposes. It was used as propaganda. It was used in politics, for political agendas and for me\u2026 as a friend and someone who knew him, that was really\u2026 made me uncomfortable. I just wanted to take on the responsibility to tell Jim\u2019s story.\u201d</p> <p>And he does. People have a habit of saying nice things about the dead but it\u2019s clear that Foley was a particularly special case. When I speak to Diane Foley on the phone at her home in New Hampshire, she calls the film \u201ca gift\u201d. She\u2019s known Oakes pretty much all his life, but hadn\u2019t wanted the family to take part initially. \u201cIt was very soon after Jim\u2019s death that he came and asked us and I was truly not ready for it. I loved Brian. He was a childhood best friend but I was reluctant, initially. It was his siblings who wanted to do it. They knew Brian best and they wanted people to know who Jim really was and why he put his life on the line.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all there, his life from childhood on, warts and all. His idealism and easy manner comes across but also a certain waywardness, a lack of desire to be pinned down by convention or loan repayment plans. But it\u2019s the interviews with his fellow hostages that are at the heart of the film. For two years, when his family didn\u2019t know whether he was alive or dead, he was sharing a tiny cell with a changing roster of other western hostages, not all of whom were murdered by Isis.</p> <p>\u201cThose interviews were the most intense of the entire film-making process,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cHere were men who were with Jim over the course of months, sometimes years, when we didn\u2019t know where he was. We didn\u2019t know if Jim was alive or dead or where he was, who had him. This was a huge black hole and for me to be able to sit down and talk to those who were with him and to unravel that mystery was very cathartic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7UTdyP2fmk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O7UTdyP2fmk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jim: The James Foley Story trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cMichael and Katie, James\u2019s siblings came too and it was very emotional and difficult but also quite amazing.\u201d</p> <p>One of the former hostages he talked to was Nicolas H\u00e9nin, a French freelance journalist who had spent a long time in the Middle East and who recounts how much he disliked, initially, James\u2019s habit of calling everyone \u201cbro\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI just do not use this kind of working-class colloquial language,\u201d H\u00e9nin tells me over the phone from France. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my style. I\u2019m like, \u2018I am not your brother!\u2019\u201d But Foley did become like a brother to him. \u201cWe invented a life during these months in captivity,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cAnd when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone, at some stage, fell out with everyone else, he tells me. \u201cThere were sometimes a few dozen people in a tiny room. In such circumstances, it\u2019s normal that every single one of us struggled with every single other. Apart from Jim. He had these incredible social skills. It really stands out. He was the only one who didn\u2019t have any big dispute with anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>H\u00e9nin and Foley became close, not least because for one 10-day period, they were handcuffed to each another. And it was shattering to H\u00e9nin when he, like everyone else, learned via the internet of his friend\u2019s death. \u201cMy first reaction when I watched this film [the Islamic State video] was horror, but my second reaction was pride. I was just proud of my friend. I was truly impressed by his behaviour where so many others would just scream like babies. Even though I had been through a lot of things in common with him, I\u2019m not at all sure I would have found the courage to behave like that. His comportment, his language\u2026 he speaks strongly, he looks straight, he stands straight. He just acts like a man. His condition was like an animal but Jim was a man. And somehow, he just behaved as a free man.</p> <p>\u201cI shared his fate for months. We were comrades, for 10 months we shared everything except our passports. And that\u2019s what saved my life. And took his.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We invented a life during those months in captivity.

The French and other Europeans negotiated to get their hostages free. The British and Americans did not. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/british-photographer-john-cantlie-appears-in-new-isis-video\" title=\"\">John Cantlie</a>, a British journalist who was captured with Foley, is still being held. And Foley and his fellow Americans and Brits are all dead. It\u2019s still a bitter pill for the Foleys to swallow.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201d says Diane Foley. \u201cI was appalled at the way we were treated. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. We just felt so alone. For nearly two years, we didn\u2019t know if Jim was alive, and we had very few people who were with us on it.\u201d As a family, they were told by the government that the best chance of securing their son\u2019s release was to maintain a news blackout, a stipulation they eventually broke, and that they now feel didn\u2019t help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f2c5e3a4943df18dceb6d365b6e461099bf757\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f2c5e3a4943df18dceb6d365b6e461099bf757/0_0_900_666/500.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley (standing at back) with his four younger siblings.\" width=\"500\" height=\"370\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley (standing at back) with his four younger siblings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Foley family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had no idea how to find James and how to get him home once he was found. We just went to everyone we could, begging for help. But at that time, there was nothing in place. I was appalled to find that there was nobody in our own government whose mission it was to help us. It\u2019s not like in Britain or France, which have a structure in place. People were sympathetic. They listened. I think individually they cared but it was just at the bottom of their list.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just appalling to us. It was really up to private individuals who were the most helpful to me \u2013 like David Bradley, the publisher of the <em>Atlantic</em> and Phil Balboni, [for whom Foley was working] of the GlobalPost<em> </em>in Boston.\u201d</p> <p>It was also, Nicolas H\u00e9nin, believes, a terrible miscalculation. He has gone on to write a book about the causes of the insurgency in Syria and Iraq \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/350500/\" title=\"\"><em>Jihad Academy: the rise of the Islamic State</em> </a>\u2013 and believes that the Americans underestimated the crisis from the beginning. \u201cThey thought we had been taken by dangerous amateurs. They didn\u2019t realise what was at stake. I don\u2019t actually know what was exchanged for myself, if it was money or something else. But even if a ransom had been paid for Jim, it would have been worth it, beyond any moral consideration. It would have been worth it from a security perspective because the propaganda impact was so very high.\u201d</p> <p>It was. The film does not contain footage from the video and states that fact, explicitly, at the start. \u201cI didn\u2019t include it for a number of reasons but one was because I believe that people have a choice whether to watch it or not,\u201d Brian Oakes tells me. He himself hadn\u2019t watched it until he came to make the film. \u201cAnd in fact, I still haven\u2019t to this day, not the unedited version. It was not something I choose to do. I don\u2019t want to see that kind of war pornography. To me, that video is just a piece of propaganda, a recruitment tool.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ffddad82c63e4e0223e68efa5dd6f2138ceb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ffddad82c63e4e0223e68efa5dd6f2138ceb68/0_451_3000_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolas H\u00e9nin (left), former French hostage and journalist, is greeted by his family following his release in April 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicolas H\u00e9nin (left), former French hostage and journalist, is greeted by his family following his release in April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That image \u2013 of Foley in an orange jumpsuit on his knees in the Syrian desert \u2013 marked a new chapter in the use of terror; it became a symbol of the strength and ingenuity of Isis and evidence of the weakness of the west in confronting a whole new type of enemy. Clare Morgana Gillis, fellow freelance journalist and friend of Foley\u2019s, states in the film that 94% of Americans are aware of Foley\u2019s death, making it the news event with the second highest recognition after 9/11. Nobody would have hated that more than him, she says. He went to Syria to try and tell the world about the atrocities that were going on there. \u201cAnd that was the takeaway?\u201d she asks. The death of a single American reaped more publicity than any other report on the country,&#xa0;ever.</p> <p>It was another freelance, Nicole Tung, who rang Diane Foley at home in New Hampshire when, in November 2012, Foley and John Cantlie failed to show up at an arranged meeting place at the Turkish border. Later, the family discovered that the two men had been spotted when they broke their journey to file their copy from an internet cafe; shortly afterwards, armed gunmen forced their car to stop just a few miles from the border.</p> <p>\u201cI was just incredulous that it had happened, to be honest,\u201d says Diane Foley. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it.

He\u2019d hopped around in his 20s and early 30s, studying creative writing, becoming a teacher in an inner-city school in Arizona, and then he seemed to find the thing he\u2019d been looking for: journalism. \u201cSomething seemed to click,\u201d says Diane. It gave him a purpose, a mission. And when the revolution kicked off in Libya, he went.</p> <p>Libya was where Morgana Gillis met Foley for the first time, and the main attraction for them both was that it was exciting and it was cheap. \u201cIt was a Mad Max type war,\u201d said Foley when he returned in 2011. Photojournalist Nicole Tung, another friend of Foley\u2019s interviewed in the film, says, \u201cMany of us aren\u2019t old enough to remember journalism in its heyday. What we do is journalism on a shoestring budget.\u201d And with it came a blurring of boundaries. The easiest and cheapest way of getting to the frontline was to hitch a lift with the&#xa0;insurgents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'I made it too easy for him. I wanted to be supportive. I didn\u2019t say, \"Jim, you put us through hell\"</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Foley was with Morgana Gillis and a South African freelance, Anton Hammerl, when they got caught up in crossfire. Hammerl was shot and killed. Morgana Gillis and Foley were captured. For Diane Foley, it was the darkest time of her life: her son missing, the family not knowing if he was alive or dead. \u201cIt was absolutely horrific at the time,\u201d she says. And it\u2019s a measure of everything that the family has been through subsequently that she now adds: \u201cIn retrospect, it was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>After six terrible weeks, they had the Hollywood denouement. He was released, unharmed, and when he returned to his old school of journalism to tell them about his experience, he revealed how much he had learned. \u201cWe did a lot of mistakes that day. Conflict zones can be covered safely. But you have to be very experienced. You have to be very, very careful. We didn\u2019t follow a lot of those practices so it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>The Q&amp;A session was videoed and Oakes includes a lot of it in his film and, in the light of what happened next, there\u2019s a terrible poignancy to the words that Foley spoke, and yet didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2916576c958f8078c9b47f4eab2c962b0dd68493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2916576c958f8078c9b47f4eab2c962b0dd68493/0_0_3000_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, at home in New Hampshire shortly after the execution was posted on YouTube, August 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, at home in New Hampshire shortly after the execution was posted on YouTube, August 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pure luck that you didn\u2019t get killed there,\u201d he tells the audience. \u201cPure luck. And you need to either change your behaviour right there or you shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Because it\u2019s not worth your life. It\u2019s not worth seeing your mother, father, brother, and sister bawling. You\u2019re worrying about your grandmother dying because you\u2019re in prison. It\u2019s not worth these things. It\u2019s not worth your life, no matter what romantic ideal you have, no matter what ethic you think you have. It\u2019s never worth that. I\u2019m 37 years old, I should have known that a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>Oakes delves into the very human reactions that Foley\u2019s family had when he was kidnapped a second time. His younger brother, John Jr, who has served in the military, is at times bewildered and angry and ultimately, grudgingly respectful of James\u2019s decision to return to a conflict zone. But mostly, angry. \u201cYou just wanted to punch him in the face in a loving, brotherly way,\u201d he tells Oakes in the film. His father, John, still shakes his head in disbelief at the memory of it. And Diane tells me that she thinks she \u201cmade it too easy for him\u201d.</p> <p>What do you mean? \u201cI wanted to be supportive. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, Jim, you put us through hell.\u2019 I was saying, \u2018I respect your decision to do this. And people need to know what is going on in Syria.\u2019 But, to be honest, I put it behind me much too easily. I felt, what are the chances of it happening again? I was really very clueless. Journalists who do this dangerous work need to have those difficult conversations with their families. They need to be prepared and we were not. I was in denial about it. We didn\u2019t have Jim\u2019s will or passwords or bank accounts or emails or things we really needed as a family.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do now since James\u2019s death. The family set up the <a href=\"https://www.jamesfoleyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">James Foley Foundation </a>and one of their missions has been to try to better prepare freelance journalists for the potential dangers out there. Shortly after James\u2019s death, President Obama called her to offer his condolences. \u201cHe thought you were coming to get him,\u201d she told him. A rescue attempt had been made, she found out, but it was too late. The hostages had already been moved to another location. Since then, though, she has worked with the government to get them to create a cross-department \u201cfusion cell\u201d, equipped to deal with another family during another hostage crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09c0d9db38d98ebfb2a3a44531cec412f6b01e1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c0d9db38d98ebfb2a3a44531cec412f6b01e1d/0_76_2000_1234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley with students at the Christa McAuliffe Regional Charter Public School in Framingham, Mass, who had worked for his release, June 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley with students at the Christa McAuliffe Regional Charter Public School in Framingham, Mass, who had worked for his release, June 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McGagh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foundation is also lobbying news organisations to take responsibility for the freelances they employ. \u201cWe have a responsibility for the people willing to do this work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must protect them. Otherwise, it becomes, as it was at the time Jim was there, very abusive. News organisations are just using these young independent journalists for whatever and giving them nothing back. They did not have their back.\u201d</p> <p>One of Oakes\u2019s explicit intentions for the film, he says, was to explore the issues around the use of freelance journalists in conflict zones. And what draws them back. Foley, according to Oakes, was \u201calways a kid who loved adventure. He would always take that extra step. When we were teenagers, he was always the one to do something just a little bit more crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Oakes speculates that Foley was suffering from some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder after his experience in Libya. He took a job in Boston but couldn\u2019t settle. He was lured back by what he calls in the film \u201cthe siren song\u201d of the frontline. Though it\u2019s not as straightforward as hero-journalists-tell-world-what-it-needs-to-hear, not least because most of the time the world wasn\u2019t listening. And they were taking huge personal risks to file news stories into a void.</p> <p>But what Foley wanted \u2013 for the world to pay attention to what was happening in Syria \u2013 did happen because of his death, I point out to Diane. \u201cYes. Thanks be to God. But whether Jim knew that, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought interviewing the former hostages would be so bad.

He doesn\u2019t talk about the torture he endured, that Foley endured. They were, variously, beaten, starved, suspended upside down from the ceiling, waterboarded. But that wasn\u2019t what they talked about.</p> <p>\u201cWe were all optimists. It was a decision we all made. Some of us were more realistic but it was harder. You had no control whatsoever over your fate. You are not the one who decides anything. The only thing you can have control of is your morale.\u201d He tells me how during the time he was chained to Foley, he talked late into the night with one of their captors, who was later identified as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/brussels-bomber-najim-laachraoui-identified-isis-jailer-foreign-hostages\" title=\"\">one of the Brussels bombers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe was obsessed with the movie <em>The Matrix.</em> He was telling us: \u2018You have left the matrix now. You are living in another matrix. You have left that world. We are creating another world.\u201d It was, he says, a \u201cpostmodern&#xa0;experience\u201d.</p> <p>What do you mean?</p> <p>\u201cI learned that Syria was just a background. It had nothing to do with Syria. We were western hostages held by western captors.\u201d And it\u2019s not over. John Cantlie is still a prisoner. \u201cI am still careful what I say because they are still holding a friend of mine. The story is not yet over. And normally, when you are a hostage in Nigeria, Afghanistan, you leave the country and you leave it behind. But my captors came back to my home town and they committed crimes here. In November at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan</a>, they were less than a kilometre from my home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a5d47f35e0ecd901e06b7d1e0e13da7abb50e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a5d47f35e0ecd901e06b7d1e0e13da7abb50e9/0_0_3200_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign seen in James Foley\u2019s hometown in Rochester, New Hampshire the day after his killing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign seen in James Foley\u2019s hometown in Rochester, New Hampshire the day after his killing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His captors, he believes, follow him on Twitter. And the media reporting of every terrorist atrocity further inflames the situation. \u201cYou British taught us resilience during the second world war and that is what we need now. That motto \u2013 Keep Calm and Carry On \u2013 is the one we should adopt here now. The media panic, and the politicians panic and overreact. We should think about what our attackers would love us to do. And then do the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Diane Foley and the Foley family have decided to find meaning and purpose in James Foley\u2019s death. For them, it wasn\u2019t a senseless bloodthirsty revenge killing. It has become a mission for them to help others. It proves, Diane tells me, that people aren\u2019t fundamentally bad. They\u2019re the opposite. \u201cPeople have been so good to us. So many people from all around the world have sent us buckets of mail, donations, prayers. To have good overcome, we need to stand together. That\u2019s why we set up the foundation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/feb/15/sign-up-to-the-media-briefing\">Sign up to the new-look Media Briefing: bigger, better, brighter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And Brian Oakes makes the same point. \u201cI went into those interviews with the former hostages thinking this is going to be horrible, it\u2019s going to be so bad. Every day was probably torture and beatings. And then to find out that this group of men had created this family and all worked together to survive and had made these games and given each other lectures, it was fascinating.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Jim was always like that. He was always this beacon of positivity. And to hear that he was like that even in those super-dark times was amazing. It helps to give him meaning, I hope.\u201d</p> <p>The film is certainly much less bleak than you\u2019d ever think possible. Oakes says that he deliberately set up the juxtaposition of the idyllic nature of the small town American childhood they shared with the horror that was to follow. \u201cI think those of us who live in a world where everything is peaceful end up taking that for granted. And, that\u2019s why Jim went to Syria, after all.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfeboro, New Hampshire is not Raqqa, Syria. It is the opposite of Raqqa. But still, even there, it seemed there was some small corner of the Islamic State that was forever Wolfeboro. Daniel Rye Ottosen, a Danish hostage who had also grown close to Foley, tells in the film how for Christmas, sitting in the dark, they gave each other compliments in place of gifts. And his present to Jim? \u201cI told him, \u2018You are the most honest person. You are pure good.\u2019 That was our Christmas night.

As I write, the top news stories report that: \u201cEven older kids can drown with adults around\u201d (don\u2019t think of dozing while your children cavort on the beach); \u201cYou may be surprised how much you should actually feed your toddler\u201d (only 40 calories per inch of height \u2013 no easy beach-snack-buying for you); and \u201cTeen loses part of his leg after his sparkler bomb explodes too soon\u201d (don\u2019t let your teenagers out alone in case they decide to duct-tape 200 sparklers together).</p> <p>This website gets 5 million visitors a month. I\u2019m stating the obvious when I observe that, collectively, parenting advice has created a culture where most parents feel either self-satisfied or guilty. But what is the alternative? In her new elegantly readable and thoughtful book, the US clinical psychologist Alison Gopnik has set out to explode the myth of good parenting and offer more enticing models of care.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are not all meant to produce the same kind of manual-designed children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Gopnik, the term \u201cparenting\u201d is itself pernicious. Parent is a noun that shouldn\u2019t have been turned into a verb in the 1950s. Gopnik\u2019s distinction between parenting and being a parent is encapsulated through the carpenter and the gardener of her title. Like the parents who begin with a manual, carpenters have a definite aim: they shape their material into a pre-designed product. Gardeners, on the other hand, are freer. They create a nurturing environment in which their plants can flourish. The crucial difference here is between work and love. For Gopnik, the \u201cparenting\u201d parent works at educating and developing their child, while the freer parent simply loves their child, allowing their offspring to do much of the educating and developing for themselves.</p> <p>Gopnik suggests, helpfully, that we should relate parenting to other forms of love. We don\u2019t measure our success as wives by how much our husbands have developed as a result of our relationship, so perhaps we needn\u2019t do this with our children. The purpose of love is \u201cnot to change the people we love, but to give them what they need to thrive\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/bad-moms-behave-badly\">Mums behaving badly: films take aim at the myth of the perfect parent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parent-child love is nonetheless a trickier kind of love because of its tensions and contradictions. Gopnik lists three paradoxes of parental love that she thinks are ignored by most parenting manuals. There\u2019s the tension between dependence and independence (we begin with complete responsibility for a dependent baby but end with weekly phone calls from an independent adult). There\u2019s the specificity of our love for our children (we only really love the children we care for, yet we look after our children in a wider social context). And there\u2019s the contradiction between our desire for tradition (we need to pass on our own culture) and our children\u2019s need to innovate (each generation needs to push into technological and creative change). Parents need to nurture freely enough for their children to have space to gain independence, while also feeling secure in their dependency; to feel free to innovate, while also imbibing our traditions.</p> <p>Gopnik\u2019s model for how to do this draws on the tests performed in her own child psychology lab, her experiences as a grandmother and on evolutionary biology. She uses evolution to insist on the desirability of mess. We are not all meant to produce the same kind of manual-designed children. Society as a whole works better if some children are brave and some cautious, some academic and some sporty. In any family, there will be a mixture of personalities, so our role as parents is to nurture the different natures that have come our way. This doesn\u2019t necessarily require much from us, because children are so good at getting what they need. They are programmed (Gopnik uses the word \u201cdesigned\u201d throughout the book) to learn through imitation and through play. They don\u2019t imitate blindly: they see our faults and learn from our mistakes. This means that we don\u2019t need to get things right, simply to live alongside them and let them observe us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So does this leave us free to enjoy our summer holidays? Yes and no. Gopnik is down on teaching our children didactically, so as the mother of a child who is reluctant to learn to read, I initially thought that this meant I could simply leave him to build walls instead. But even in Gopnik\u2019s account, we live in a world where reading is more necessary than building walls, so he\u2019s going to have to learn somehow. The answer seems to be even more demanding than teaching. She cites an experiment where children learned best from people who dressed up as detectives and invented games where children could believe that they were deducing maths problems for themselves. Is this parenting? Certainly it sounds like work to me.</p> <p>Yet the emphasis on play is important, and has wider social implications. Gopnik\u2019s central point is that children learn best by accident, when they are exploring for themselves, and that different kinds of children should be given the space to thrive. This, certainly, is a reason to ignore many of the parenting manuals. But it\u2019s also a reason to be doubly worried about the way that schooling is increasingly directed to imparting measurable skills in measurable ways. Tired parents may feel free to leave Gopnik\u2019s book out of their suitcase, but it should be required reading for anyone involved in educational reform.</p> <p><em>Lara Feigel is the author of The Bitter Taste of Victory: Life, Love and Art in the Ruins of the Reich.

  "<p>The central theme of this excellent book by Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator for the <em>Financial Times</em>, is what he terms \u201ceasternisation\u201d: the remorseless shift in the global centre of gravity from the west to the east. His theme is not new; indeed, the book is something of a latecomer in this argument. But he pursues this fundamental truth with an impressive single-mindedness and explores its ramifications from south-east Asia and Russia to Europe and the Middle East in an insightful manner, often providing little nuggets of revealing and unexpected information. Since the financial crisis, the west\u2019s decline and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\" title=\"\">China</a>\u2019s rise have&#xa0;accelerated, though many could be forgiven for thinking the opposite was the case given the constant refrains&#xa0;about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/china-economy-grows-at-slowest-pace-in-25-years-latest-gdp-figures-show\" title=\"\">China\u2019s economic \u201cdifficulties\u201d</a>. Rachman, rightly, will have none of it. And he demonstrates how, by the year, the world is being redrawn in the most profound ways by this shift in power.</p> <p>The major redoubt of resistance to the idea is the US. For the most part, it is in denial of the blatantly obvious. But Rachman shows how, beneath the radar, Obama tacitly accepts the fact but cannot admit it because no major US politician can, it being too dangerous for their reputation. Europe, on the other hand, has, especially since the financial crisis, come to acquiesce in the new reality, which is hardly surprising given, as Rachman puts it, \u201cthe European powers are in precipitous decline as global political players\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/rising-power-of-china-new-political-fissures-in-west\">The rising power of China will create new political fissures in the west | Gideon Rachman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Predictably, perhaps, Rachman is better on the US than China. At root the problem is that, while on the surface he acknowledges China\u2019s distinctive history and culture, he nonetheless tends to treat it as if it is a western country. You can\u2019t: that is the great challenge posed by China. International&#xa0;relations, for example, is a discipline that has been shaped almost entirely by western experience. Its relevance for understanding China, therefore, is strictly limited. Rachman bandies around the term \u201cnationalism\u201d as if we know what it means in the Chinese context. But for a country that is primarily a civilisation state and only secondarily a nation state, it is little more than an inappropriate cliche. Nor is this splitting hairs: it is about making or not making sense of China.</p> <p>Rachman\u2019s theme takes him on a most interesting and stimulating <em>tour du monde</em>. His discussion of the impact of China\u2019s rise on south-east Asia, contrary to the great majority of accounts, is subtle and nuanced, avoiding the normal platitude that somehow virtually all the Asian countries are opposed to China. Likewise, his discussion of India is excellent, avoiding the triumphalism about its prospects with regard to China&#xa0;that too many in the west are guilty of. He is under no illusions about&#xa0;the dangers posed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/china-japanese-tensions-dangerous-drum-of-nationalism\" title=\"\">nationalistic turn in Japan</a>; but he is perhaps most interesting of all on Russia, displaying a real feel for a country that too often is the subject of demonisation rather than understanding. In particular, I enjoyed his discussion of the way in which Russia has historically shifted between a European and an Asiatic orientation, with the latter now once more beginning to supersede the former.</p> <p>Rachman believes that China will in time \u2013 and probably not much time \u2013 usurp the US as the dominant power in the world and that every country will be obliged to adapt to this very new situation. Relations between China and the US have deteriorated since 2010 as America has come to see China as a threat to its global primacy and China has begun to seek an enhanced role in east Asia.</p> <p>Rachman is rightly concerned that this conflict could result in a catastrophic war. For the greater part of the book, Rachman suggests, or implies that the shift in power is inevitable and that everyone, including the US, must get used to it. But in the conclusion he seemingly contradicts himself by arguing that the US should resist China\u2019s rise for as long as it can, or at least until China has a different kind of governance system, which, frankly, is unlikely. It feels as if it belongs in a different book. But this is not to detract from a most informative, readable and interesting piece of work that deserves a wide readership.</p> <p><em>Martin Jacques is author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/when-china-rules-the-world.html\" title=\"\"><em>When China Rules the World</em></a><em>.

  "<p>There is an extraordinary moment about a third of the way through Zhao Liang\u2019s masterly documentary, <em>Behemoth</em>. The screen goes scarlet. It\u2019s not immediately clear what we are looking at. Then, as we watch, the hellish red begins to take on a form \u2013 first, we see the flames of a furnace and then, shockingly, the figures of the men who work there, engulfed in the searing heat and noise. This is closely followed by a shot of a man, staring impassively at the camera, his roasted skin studded with flecks of metal. I sometimes complain about having to watch mediocre movies, but this rather puts that into perspective. At least I don\u2019t have to chisel chunks of molten pig iron from my flesh at the end of my working day.</p> <p>Making reference to both the Old Testament \u2013 the beast of the title comes from the Book of Job \u2013 and to Dante\u2019s <em>Divine Comedy</em>, Zhao takes a fiercely lyrical approach to the subject of industrialisation in China and the rapacious appetites that drive it. Travelling around the vast, verdant steppes of Mongolia, the film-maker discovers a paradise soon to be lost to the open cast coal mining that devours the land. Zhao juxtaposes the two worlds in arresting single shots: the frame is divided between the lush grassland that still \u2013 just \u2013 supports a nomadic community with the ugly grey scars that used to be mountains.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The extraordinary photography is all the more remarkable given that Zhao shot much of it guerrilla style</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Zhao, who shot the film as well as directed it, has an incredible eye, which was honed by his training and early career as a photographer. It\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the immediate references the film brings to mind are photographic rather than cinematic. Panoramic shots of the mines, and the termite trail of trucks that crawl down the side of these gouged-out wounds in the land, evoke <a href=\"http://www.beetlesandhuxley.com/exhibitions/sebastiao-salgado-serra-pelada.html\">iconic photographs by Sebastiao Salgado</a> of the Serra Pelada gold mine in Brazil. There are also parallels with the work of <a href=\"http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/\">Edward Burtynsky</a>, whose large-format shots of factories and industrial blight were the subject of Jennifer Baichwal\u2019s documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/11/culture.documentary1\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes</em></a>, and with <a href=\"http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/lange/\">Dorothea Lange\u2019s seminal portraits of Americans</a> displaced by the Great Depression.</p> <p>Zhao\u2019s fly-on-the-wall technique lets the image, rather than the people, do the talking. The characters in his film do not speak, emphasising the film\u2019s recurring theme of the dehumanising effects of the development we take for granted. Humanity takes a dual role here, both as the voracious behemoth and the animals that do its bidding. This is brilliantly captured by a profile shot of a miner, slouched, still wearing the breathing mask that makes him look like some semi-monstrous animal from a Hieronymous Bosch hellscape. And it\u2019s reinforced by Zhao\u2019s choice of words in the sparse, poetic narration that guides us through his journey: he refers to \u201cthe creatures who sort coal from rock\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxmgCakyGH4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kxmgCakyGH4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxmgCakyGH4\">Watch the trailer for Behemoth.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The photography is all the more remarkable given that Zhao shot much of it guerrilla style, without the permission of the mine owners whose abuses of their workers are all too clearly on show. There is shocking disregard for workers\u2019 living conditions \u2013 coal pickers grimly scrape off the coating of inky dust in a filthy room, which looks like the inside of a diseased lung. But the bleakness is punctuated by dreamlike images of a naked human form curled in a foetal position in the blighted landscape. These images give us much-needed breathing space before we plunge into the next circle of hell.</p> <p>Zhao\u2019s use of music is economical but well judged. The eerie tones of Tuvan throat singers sound like ghosts from a past that is about to be obliterated. And there is a build-up of industrial percussion and reverb-heavy guitar, which bridges the transition from the mines to the iron foundry to riveting effect. For the most part, however, the ever-present noise of heavy industry \u2013 the rumble of trucks, the tortured squeals of conveyor belts \u2013 forms the soundtrack to the film.</p> <p>But for all the striking imagery, it\u2019s the final scenes that floor us. Zhao follows the steel smelted from sweat and suffering at the foundry to vast, empty developments: ghost cities, the result of greed and over-eager speculation on the part of developers. The miners, battling to breathe after the onset of pneumoconiosis, the nomads whose land is devoured and the iron-workers who pass each day in an inferno are all just collateral damage in a colossal global folly.</p>",
  "<p>A mother and her seven-year-old son were among three people who died on Saturday as strong winds and rain battered parts of Britain\u2019s coast.</p> <p>The 37-year-old woman and the boy were among five people pulled from the sea after they got into difficulty while playing at Aberdeen beach. They later died in hospital. Another boy, aged 13, was still being treated in hospital along with a 25-year-old woman and a man aged 28. They had yet to be named.</p> <p>Chf Insp Stewart Mackie, of Police Scotland, said: \u201cThis is a very tragic incident which has resulted in a woman and young boy sadly losing their lives. It will undoubtedly bring shock and sadness to the entire city of Aberdeen and farther afield. Given the recent weather we\u2019d urge members of the public to take care, especially when near coastal or beach areas.\u201d</p> <p>The third victim was a windsurfer, in his 60s, who died in hospital in Colchester shortly after being rescued by the crew of a lifeboat from the sea off West Mersea, in Essex. A police spokesman said they were trying to establish the events leading up to his death. Mersea Island, which is situated where the Blackwater estuary widens out into the North Sea, has become a hub for wind and kitesurfers in recent years.</p> <p>The Met Office issued a yellow \u201chigh winds\u201d alert for East Anglia\u2019s coast on Sunday, warning that winds could gust at more than 50mph.</p> <p>Earlier, on Friday, tragedy struck a family of five from Surrey who were on a trip to Fistral Beach in north-west Cornwall. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said a man was swept out to sea with his wife and two-year-old daughter, and he later died in hospital.</p> <p>Lifeguards reached the man and his wife, said to be in their 30s, and the girl, amid treacherous conditions with 13ft waves. Two other children in the family managed to scramble back on to the rocks.</p> <p>James Instance, of Falmouth coastguard, told the BBC: \u201cWe went through a 24-hour period where the waves went from half a metre to three to four metres. You are probably looking at 10ft breaking waves in this area.\u201d</p> <p>Gales hit Wales and southern and central England, bringing a very unsettled and blustery end to the recent sunny spell. The unseasonal weather caused summer events to be cancelled at short notice and the Environment Agency called for walkers who were planning a coastal stroll this weekend to avoid taking photographs in dangerous spots.</p> <p>Craig Woolhouse, Environment Agency flood risk manager, said: \u201cWe urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave-watchers against the unnecessary dangers of taking \u2018storm selfies\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Temperatures are expected to drop from a high of 28C earlier this week to as low as 20C or even the high teens in many parts over the weekend. Warmer weather should return from the middle of next week, just in time for the August bank holiday.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s rather strange, swapping the craziness of the Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Mile at festival time for the preternatural quiet of the Scottish parliament in early August: like being thrown out of a party. But never mind. One star performer, at least, is in the vicinity, in the form of Ruth Davidson, the redoubtable leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party. Davidson has already had her break \u2013 in Spain, where she \u201cread a book a day, and drank lots of funny coloured drinks\u201d, but nevertheless checked her emails every two hours \u2013 and now she is back, bridling slightly at the very idea she might do anything other than work through the dog days of summer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a workaholic,\u201d she says, flashing me one of her startling megawatt smiles (bright as they are, they do not always connect to her eyes). \u201cPolitics is funny.

The other two lasted between six and six and a half years each; I\u2019m already four and a half in. You do it at 100 miles an hour, but you don\u2019t do it for ever.

Fair enough, she's a lifelong nationalist\u2026 but that was pretty cynical'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How far ahead can she see? \u201cWell, there are plenty of measurables: electoral cycles rather than years. We\u2019ve got lots of staging posts in Scotland. New powers in terms of taxation came in April, there\u2019ll be more next April, and more in 2018. Then there\u2019s Article 50 to be moved on Brexit, so we\u2019ve got a two-year clock on that.\u201d</p> <p>How does she feel, now, about Brexit? In particular, how does she view the current position of Scotland\u2019s first minister on it? (Nicola Sturgeon seems to be rowing back on her suggestion that Brexit increased the likelihood of another independence referendum, Scotland having voted to remain in the EU.) On the subject of the vote to leave itself, Davidson, for all that she made such a good case for Remain, is predictably bullish; 17 million people can\u2019t be ignored, and everyone must work to make best of the \u201copportunity\u201d that lies ahead. But naturally, she thinks it\u2019s wrong to suggest, as Sturgeon appeared to, that one referendum was just what she calls a \u201ccipher\u201d for the other, not least because \u2013 to take just one example \u2013 some 400,000 SNP supporters voted for Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of people, tens of thousands of them, who are actually a bit annoyed at the way in which Nicola Sturgeon has tried to use this,\u201d she says. \u201cWithin three and a half hours of the last vote being announced [after the EU referendum], <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/alex-salmond-second-scottish-independence-referendum-is-certain\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon stood up at Bute House</a> and said that she\u2019d already instructed Scottish government officials to draw up the legislation for a second independence referendum.\u201d She sniffs. \u201cI think people saw it for what it was. Fair enough, she is a lifelong nationalist. But this was the first minister of a country acting, not as a first minister, but as [first and foremost] the leader of her political party.

You\u2019re not about to leave another union, which is worth four times more in terms of trade. The economic case for independence is worse now than it was a few years ago, and the case that the SNP tried to run \u2013 that you can have a big constitutional change without it having any large economic impact \u2013 has been blown out of the water. We\u2019ve just seen it with Brexit. That doesn\u2019t mean that the SNP isn\u2019t wanting to whip up nationalist fervour. But they know as well as anybody that if another referendum is held, and they lose it, then it\u2019s done. The only template we have is Quebec, where a second referendum was lost by only about a point, after which support for independence went off a cliff.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in London, there is a new prime minister to deal with \u2013 though for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t make the mistake of celebrating aloud the fact that another female politician is running things. (\u201cSome of us have been in charge for a while, and no one noticed,\u201d she says tartly, when I do this.) Davidson was a supporter of Theresa May, and knows her much better than she did David Cameron \u2013 \u201cDC\u201d, as she sometimes calls him \u2013 when she first became Scottish leader.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got, I think, a good relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI really like her. I know her media persona is quite reserved, but she\u2019s got quite a quiet wit about her. I think she\u2019ll be a good prime minister. She takes everything very seriously, and will always do the right thing. To serve through Brexit is going to be a bloody tough shift, and I take my hat off to her that she wanted to take it on.\u201d Davidson was at No 10 the day before May became PM. \u201cI met with both the outgoing prime minister and the incoming one for some time. In between, he was giving Theresa a tour of her new flat. Yes, it felt quite historic. One of the interesting things was, knowing Theresa relatively well, I had expected that the weight of the office would make her quite tense about what was coming, as it would for any human being. But actually, this almost the most relaxed I\u2019ve seen her. There was a sense of serenity and calm about her, the idea that she knew exactly what she was going to do.\u201d</p> <p>Did she, though? What about (Leadsom! Johnson!) some of her wilder cabinet appointments? Or was that just a case of keeping your friends close, and your enemies even closer? Davidson thinks this is a mischaracterisation, one all too common in those outside the Tory party. \u201cEven using words like \u2018friends\u2019 and \u2018enemies\u2019\u2026 We all want what\u2019s best for the country. There is a sense of service and duty. We need to put in a proper shift.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dae53a2ee4c3fe5852a642806d7114b75aa18a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae53a2ee4c3fe5852a642806d7114b75aa18a20/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davidson: \u2018I\u2019m not a shouter.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hmm. While this might well be true of May and, say, David Davis, most people would be wary of crediting Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary, with a sense of service at this point. \u201cHe\u2019s an interesting study. I think he knows that if he\u2019s judged to be found wanting in this role, his political career is probably over. So there is a large personal as well as profession incentive for him to get his finger out.\u201d</p> <p>Will there be an early election? If I were May, in possession of a miniature majority and contemplating the omnishambles that is a Corbyn-led Labour party, I would be sorely tempted (and sod the law pertaining to fixed parliaments; that can be fixed). Davidson is \u2013 genuinely, I\u2019d say \u2013 conflicted. \u201cJohn Major came up to help during the referendum, and we had dinner, and he was talking about how draining it is to have a small majority in the Commons, how it gets you down dealing with your own side. He had a larger majority than Theresa, so I can see the temptation. She knows if people want to cause problems, they can do that quite quickly. I would like to think that the usual suspects might behave [now] in a different manner, but we shall see\u2026 However, it might be seen as opportunistic to hold a snap election less than two years after the last one. There is an aspect of her needing to get on with the job.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut I\u2019m torn. Why <em>not</em> get a mandate? Labour called for an election after she became prime minister, so they can\u2019t criticise her if that\u2019s what she does.\u201d Is she ready for an election? \u201cIf one is required, I will make sure the party\u2019s ready.\u201d Her voice is steely, completely without doubt. \u201cWe\u2019re organised. We will do well. We will increase our number of seats.\u201d</p> <p>I remember the precise moment I decided I wanted to interview Davidson. In a newspaper, I saw a photograph of her and George Osborne. They were visiting a Scottish farm, and each of them had a shovel, or perhaps a fork, in their hands, on the end of which there was balanced a mound of something brown and stinky-looking. The then chancellor was a little closer to the camera than her, and giving the world his regular wan I\u2019m-working-hard-to-keep-Britain-moving smile (an expression he usually wore with a high-vis jacket, though not on this occasion). Meanwhile, behind him, Davidson was pulling a much funnier face, her eyes wide, her grin on the edge of manic. It was like something out of a <em>Carry On</em> movie: if she wasn\u2019t sending up Osborne, then at the very least she seemed to be sending up the photo opportunity, in both the abstract and the particular. \u201cWe\u2019ve shovelled a lot worse, eh, George?\u201d someone captioned it, later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have \u2018punch the air\u2019 moments, and you have \u2018crying silently at night' moments\u2026 but you do it in your own time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was feed!\u201d she says now, in the small, sterile meeting room in which we talk. \u201cEveryone says it was shit, but it wasn\u2019t, I promise you.\u201d She laughs, wildly. When she stops, I ask if she knew she would be so good a party leader, by which I mean, mostly though not exclusively, that she somehow makes the vast majority of other politicians look even more weird and phoney than usual. \u201cWell, I\u2019m trying my hardest to be good at my job. But we\u2019re Presbyterian here. We don\u2019t talk about this sort of thing the way private schoolboys would.\u201d Until she decided to seek elected office, she worked as a journalist at the BBC. Much as she loved journalism, she was tired of being an onlooker; she wanted to be what she calls an agent of change. \u201c[I suppose] that is a type of arrogance or pride or self-regard. Whether that\u2019s an unattractive quality or not\u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> <p>OK, let\u2019s turn this around. Did she ever worry \u2013 she\u2019d only been an MSP for five seconds when she decided to throw her hat into the ring as party leader in 2011 \u2013 that she\u2019d be bad at the job?</p> <p>\u201cThere are times when you feel, oh shit, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that, and you beat yourself up about it; and there are times when you feel desperately, desperately alone because it doesn\u2019t feel like anyone\u2019s helping you with the task. You have \u2018punch the air\u2019 moments, and you have \u2018crying silently at night so as not to wake up the person next to you\u2019 moments. But I guess leadership is about doing that in your own time. It\u2019s about strength and tenacity and moral courage.\u201d</p> <p>Is she what she seems, though? How much of her jollity and relative straightforwardness is an act? \u201cI don\u2019t wear any masks. If I had, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have been able to keep them on for five years. I\u2019m in the media every day. I\u2019ve never been caught out. That tells you something. Folk aren\u2019t daft. They can tell you\u2019re not answering the question, or if you don\u2019t mean something.\u201d She says that she likes people; she enjoys talking to them. But she isn\u2019t sure about charming (my word) them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people I\u2019ve rubbed up the wrong end, who\u2019ve felt the rough of my tongue.\u201d Has she got a temper? \u201cI\u2019m not a shouter or a thrower. I\u2019m not tossing mobile phones around as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/may/06/gordon-brown-printers\" title=\"\">previous prime ministers </a>are alleged to have done. I do quiet, steely, gimlet-eyed chat. But you know if I\u2019m fucked off with you.\u201d She looks at her aide, who is recording our encounter; he smiles, but he doesn\u2019t quite look back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a366dc1976b72103ebd348d04ba2a93a2f0f684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a366dc1976b72103ebd348d04ba2a93a2f0f684/49_108_1493_2077/719.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson with George Osborne on the Remain campaign trail in June 2016 at a farm near Galashiels.\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Davidson with George Osborne on the Remain campaign trail in June 2016 at a farm near Galashiels: \u2018Everyone says it was shit but it wasn\u2019t, I promise!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The national press still marvels at her near unicorn-like status as a working-class, lesbian woman at the head of a bunch of Tories. (It used to go on about her passion for kickboxing, too, though she\u2019s long since given that up.) Is this irksome? It used to be. During the leadership race in 2011, she wanted very much not to be known only as the lesbian kickboxer (the other candidates were all defined by their jobs): \u201cIt seemed it was done to diminish me, and it was the only thing anyone knew about me.\u201d But when she was elected, everything changed. \u201cI got lots and lots of emails, mostly from young gay men, but from girls, too. They were really personal letters: \u2018I\u2019m not out to my parents or my school\u2019, or \u2018I am out but I found it really hard.\u2019 Some said: \u2018I always fancied politics, but I never thought I could, and it really matters to me that you got elected.\u2019\u201d This was a revelation. \u201cI\u2019d never signed up to the role model argument. If someone says I can\u2019t do something, it just makes me want to do it twice as much. I\u2019m cussed and dogged like that.\u201d</p> <p>She was touched. \u201cI made sure to reply personally, and I told them about my background, and I was really pleased that none of them ever went to the papers afterwards. After that, I promised myself that if I was ever asked [about her sexuality], I would never walk away from it. That wasn\u2019t for me. It was for other people.\u201d Does she feel good about that decision now? \u201cI do feel things have changed, though not because of me. I\u2019m 37. When I was born, homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland. Now the same couples who could have been prosecuted can get married, and we\u2019re a better country for that.\u201d (She and her partner, Jen Wilson, announced their engagement last May.) She got vile letters too, of course, and sometimes still does get abuse on Twitter, of which she is a big user: \u201cI have rules. I tend not to engage with people calling me all the bad names under the sun for party or policy or appearance or weight. But every month or so I do push back on homophobia. I do not have to take that, and nor does anyone.\u201d</p> <p>These days, then, she is more likely to be irritated by questions about her class than her sexuality (though I have to say, too, that she later pointedly refers to my voice as \u201cposh\u201d, so this cuts both ways). \u201cPeople outside Scotland think that if you come from an estate, it\u2019s either a council estate or a shooting estate,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m actually from neither of these. My parents are working-class Glaswegians, but my dad moved to the Borders [to work in a textile mill] before he had me, and when they [the mills] shut, he moved to Fife, where I lived in a normal kind of house, in a normal kind of village.\u201d Her school was in a socially disadvantaged area, and a high proportion of its students had free school meals, but her parents were keen on education: \u201cBooks were your friends. You didn\u2019t break their spines or rip their pages.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c9082e0dcb387c62af5228902c7edb980cfe606\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c9082e0dcb387c62af5228902c7edb980cfe606/0_0_3000_2009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson and partner Jen Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davidson with her partner, Jen Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had a serious accident as a small child \u2013 aged five, she was run over by a truck outside her house \u2013 and for a time, it was thought she might not survive; later, she had to learn to walk again.</p> <p>\u201cProbably, that [accounts for] part of my determination: being the only kid in primary school with a Zimmer frame.\u201d Looking back, she\u2019s amazed that she was allowed to climb trees, or play football with the boys. Given what they\u2019d been through, her parents must have longed to wrap her in cotton wool. \u201cBut what was always drummed into us [she has an older sister, who is a doctor] was that effort was more important than results. I remember one school report. I got a two for science for effort, and a one for my results, which was the best you could get, and I got a mini bollocking for that. My mum would have been much happier if it had been the other way round.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents were thrilled when she got a place to read English at Edinburgh university, and equally delighted when, having begun her career on local newspapers, she ended up at the BBC. But they were perhaps rather less pleased when she announced she was jacking in her job and the pension that went with it to try to get elected as a Tory, and in Glasgow of all places (she now represents Edinburgh Central).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She is a capable, competent, principled woman and I believe that respect is reciprocated. But we don\u2019t go out for pizza</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fault their logic,\u201d she says. It wasn\u2019t easy for her mother to see the word \u201clesbian\u201d in the headlines, though she\u2019d come out in her 20s (she won\u2019t say how her parents\u2019 received this news). \u201cI\u2019ve had to say on the phone to them: \u2018Please don\u2019t write to the <em>Herald</em>, Dad. I can fight my own battles.\u2019\u201d Davidson, however, knew that politics was her future, at least in the sense that she knew a referendum on independence was coming, and that she would have found it unendurable to stay silent as the future of her country was debated. I suppose this is another way in which she is a role model: she wasn\u2019t old when she went into politics, but nor had she devoted her 20s to it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how people like Charles Kennedy did it,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing elected at 21. How do you talk to someone about their housing benefit or school places when you\u2019re 21?\u201d For anybody reading this, she would like it to be known that \u201cthere is no law that says you have to be a bag carrier or special adviser [to go into politics], and people will think a lot more of you if you\u2019re not\u201d. Ambition didn\u2019t come into it. \u201cIf it had been about personal ambition, there was a really strong argument that said: don\u2019t try and lead a party that doesn\u2019t want you as leader; spend some time on the back benches.\u201d</p> <p>What about now? Is she ambitious \u2013 or, at any rate, woman enough to admit she is? (Men, as I tell her, seem to have no problem at all with the A-word.) \u201cThere are things I want to do.\u201d What things? Does she want to be prime minister, a job for which she was once tipped by the great sh\u2014, sorry, feed shoveller himself, George Osborne?</p> <p>\u201c<em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> is on the list,\u201d she says, confessing her deep envy of Ed Balls, one of this year\u2019s contestants. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to stop following me on Twitter once <em>Strictly</em> starts.\u201d But that\u2019s for the distant future, when \u2013 if \u2013 she\u2019s defenestrated. \u201cPeople keep asking me: do I want to go to Westminster? As if to say: why on earth would you want to stay in your <em>home</em>?\u201d So what, then, if not Westminster? At which point, it dawns on me. Does she want to be Scotland\u2019s first minister?</p> <p>\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t that outlandish?\u201d Actually, it is. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it will happen in five years. But I have more MSPs sitting behind me now [she has 31 to the SNP\u2019s 63, and Scottish Labour\u2019s 23] than the SNP had in 2003 [they then had 27] \u2013 and they became the government in 2007.\u201d She meets my eye, and holds it, as if daring me to laugh.</p> <p>How does she get on with the current first minister? Invited to so many of the same events, they see each other often. \u201cThere\u2019s always that opportunity to have a quiet word away from the cameras. I think she is a capable, competent woman who acts on the principles she holds, and who is a better leader than Alex Salmond, and I believe that respect is reciprocated. But we don\u2019t go out for pizza and beer; I\u2019m not round Bute House for tea, and nor do I want to be.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-not-your-typical-tory-video-profile\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4mfdj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2570095\"            data-video-name=\"Ruth Davidson: why she's 'not your typical Tory' \u2013 video profile\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576aaa92e4b030d83eb49657\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317593&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/22/ruth-davidson-not-your-typical-tory-video-profile\">Ruth Davidson: why she\u2019s \u2018not your typical Tory\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Does she think women do things differently, or is that a sexist assumption? \u201cI think it would be nice if we got to the point where people stopped noticing and remarking on [the fact that] a woman has got a job.

We self-censure because it would put us all back, it would diminish who we are.\u201d Of course she\u2019s a feminist: \u201cThat just means believing that women can do everything men can but backwards in heels with a cherry on top.

  "<p>Every ballet company in the world currently wants a work by the exciting Canadian choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/22/crystal-pite-interview-sadlers-wells\">Crystal Pite</a>. Commissions for Paris Opera Ballet and the Royal are waiting in the wings, so it\u2019s clever of Scottish Ballet to nip in with the European premiere of the first piece she made for a big company.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88mnjR9ejxs\">Emergence</a></em>, created in 2009 for the National Ballet of Canada, plays with ideas of swarm intelligence, linking the natural environment to the regimented world of a ballet company \u2013 and it does so in thrillingly original ways. It opens with a duet in half-light, where a girl is swung around the stage by her partner, her arms scrabbling, hands fluttering. Her movement is simultaneously soft yet sculpted.</p> <p>Then a tunnel at the centre of Jay Gower Taylor\u2019s simple, painted backdrop (abstract lines in the shape of a nest) lights up and dancers emerge, fast and fierce, folding their arms at the elbows and crossing them at the wrists like wings, moving in tight synchrony. With confidence and breathtaking invention, Pite marshals them into ever-changing, always-evolving patterns. At one astonishing moment, a long rank of girls in pointe shoes moves across the stage like a menacing Tiller troupe; as they advance their fiercely extended feet slip sideways, like rubber. It is as if their legs had melted.</p> <p>The soundscape by Owen Belton recalls the insect world, and sometimes the dancers hiss or make a sound like predatory mantises. But more often they count, the dancers subduing their individuality to the perfection of form that is a ballet company in full, disciplined display.

  "<p>The future is always a mystery, but the childhood plans of brothers and sisters have a special, poignant power as they retract into the fixed facts of adulthood. \u201cSo this is where the road was leading\u2026\u201d Unexpected talents may emerge, but so do unanticipated wounds.</p> <p>Colin Grant\u2019s brilliant, tender book is really two books: a history of our incomplete understanding of the puzzling brain phenomenon that is epilepsy, and the story of his beloved brother Christopher, the special one in the family, \u201cthe youngest, the most exuberant and happy\u201d. This golden child disarms even \u201cour tyrannical father Bageye\u201d, subject of Grant\u2019s earlier memoir of his Jamaican British family, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/bageye-at-the-wheel-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bageye at the Wheel</em></a>. After Bageye leaves, Grant becomes a surrogate father to Christopher, sometimes watching over the younger boy as he falls asleep.</p> <p>When Christopher\u2019s episode of fainting as a choirboy is followed by a longer faint in the bathroom as an adolescent, it seems unimportant. But slowly, realisation settles on the family. Grant, then a medical student, has the painful task of naming what has hitherto only been a fear. His mother reacts with biblical grief: \u201cAnybody see my cross? Anybody see my cross? \u2026 Yes, Lord!\u201d</p> <p>Today the possibility of gene therapy has come closer, surgeons are more conservative and more knowledgeable, and there are drugs like Epilim that effectively suppress seizures. One per cent of the world\u2019s population has epilepsy, and Grant says there is likely to be at least one person with the condition in every carriage of a morning commuter train.</p> <p>For some, however, the drugs come at a cost: a feeling that the self has been changed, a loss of acuteness to the sensations that make life worth living. This explains why so many people with epilepsy remain \u201cnon-compliant\u201d. M, a writer in his 60s free from seizures for 20 years thanks to drugs, \u201cstill occasionally mourns his brighter self\u201d. Musician Neil Young has eschewed them for 20 years, and Christopher \u201cwas on the drugs: off the drugs; on; off\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d96ddc990337677ae950c0d5079a2f13debd5bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d96ddc990337677ae950c0d5079a2f13debd5bc/1538_544_2396_2768/866.jpg\" alt=\"Brain scan for children with epilepsy.\" width=\"866\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brain scan for children with epilepsy, launched by Great Ormond Street hospital, London, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his thoughtful, global tour of epilepsy through the ages, it\u2019s the blunt instrument of human attempts to cure the disease that Grant illuminates. The Spartans who tested infants for epilepsy by washing them in wine were no more deluded than the zealots of the middle ages who thought that those with the disorder were possessed by demons, or the 19th-century doctors who institutionalised or over-sedated them.</p> <p>The part of the brain most active in a seizure is thought to be the insula, where higher sensations such as empathy are also located. But theories about the causes of epilepsy have veered wildly. Once marriage was deemed a good prophylactic, and \u201cearly sexual intercourse\u201d was prescribed; later it was argued that sexual excitement led to seizures, so abstinence was counselled.</p> <p>When the Catholic writer Graham Greene, as a young man, was believed to have epilepsy, he was told he should not marry, and came close to suicide. Astonishingly, right up to 1970, at the point in the Church of England marriage service when the congregation is asked whether they know of any impediment, the answer \u201cEpilepsy\u201d was enough to stop the wedding; worse, in India a partner\u2019s \u201cepileptic insanity\u201d is still a reason for&#xa0;divorce.</p> <p>Among the historical confusions that have clouded research on epilepsy are, first, its incorrect association with mental illness, and, second, its obfuscatory entanglement in moral meanings, even when they are good. Grant questions the \u201cticket to heaven\u201d school of thought, in which epilepsy and its preceding aura, not always the smell of burning of the title, lead the sufferer to a higher plane of consciousness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/18/brainstorm-epilepsy-creativity-neuroscience-comedy\">Brainstorm in a teacup: can epilepsy fuel creativity? | Dan Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet sometimes Christopher knows bliss, and the author confesses how tempted he is to dignify epilepsy with transcendent meaning, as Dostoevsky, in <em>The Idiot</em>, does in his character, Prince Myshkin. Though he looks honestly at the destructive effects the condition can have on ordinary lives, Grant also describes a number of high-achieving individuals who have either definitely or plausibly suffered from epilepsy \u2013 Julius Caesar, Saul of Tarsus, Joan of Arc, Dostoevsky, Lenin (who died after a long convulsion), Vincent van Gogh, the abolitionist Harriet Tubman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a>, George Gershwin, Ian&#xa0;Curtis.</p> <p>But it\u2019s always the enigma of Christopher that Grant returns to, with puzzlement, sorrow and, often, humour. As a teenager, Christopher\u2019s passion was buying and renovating old cars. His high point, aged 18, is the acquisition of a shiny Alfa Romeo.</p> <p>Alas, as Grant laconically remarks, \u201closs of consciousness is not compatible with driving\u201d. When Christopher passes his driving test (\u201cGod failed my mother\u201d), it is Grant who reluctantly obeys her wordless entreaty and \u2013 after failing to reason with his brother \u2013 accompanies him on a road trip. As they drive along the motorway, Grant\u2019s pleas grow \u201cincreasingly desperate, like a jilted lover\u201d. It is almost a relief to the reader when Christopher\u2019s eyes start to go blank, the seizure unfolds and the car \u201cslides across the motorway as if on&#xa0;ice\u201d.</p> <p>Neither of the brothers dies in the crash. When, as an adult, Christopher comes to live with Colin, the phone calls in the early hours, producing dread, or the knocks on the door from the police, always mean that Christopher has had a seizure.</p> <p>Christopher\u2019s attitude to his condition and to the medical profession is oblique and creative, the initial anger and frustration masking itself increasingly in deadpan humour, mystification or turning inward. He says he is making a film about epilepsy, but shows Colin a blank, blinking screen: \u201cThis is not a joke, joke t\u2019ing.\u201d</p> <p>The author tries to mirror this obliqueness. \u201cYou had a visitor,\u201d he tells Christopher as he lies in the&#xa0;liminal, dreamy state that follows an attack.</p> <p>\u201cAny message?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d come again.\u201d</p> <p>And he does come again, until the terrible night with which this book ends, when Grant has to ask the despairing paramedics to let him try to massage his brother\u2019s heart back to life. His subsequent sense of having failed Christopher will not be shared by the reader.</p> <p>This book is an extraordinary work of love and art, which left me choked with tears. It manages that most difficult task for a memoirist, to bring a real human being unforgettably to life while leaving his essential mystery and individuality intact. It\u2019s as if somewhere, outside the unforgiving single line of time where statements about what happened must be made, Colin Grant allows an aura of all the unlived possibilities of Christopher\u2019s radiant childhood to linger.</p> <p><em>A Smell of Burning is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/smell-of-burning.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a313.93</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Stefanie Posavec had quite a week. She said \u201cfuck\u201d 66 times, \u201casshole\u201d 12 times and let rip with \u201cshit\u201d on no fewer than 13 occasions. Not that I was counting. She was. And what\u2019s more, she plotted it on a postcard for all the world to see.</p> <p>Part of a project called <a href=\"http://www.dear-data.com/\">Dear Data</a>, the postcard is one of 104 sent between Posavec and fellow designer Giorgia Lupi over the course of a year, each mailing one a week. The aim, they tell me, was to explore whether it was possible to get to know someone through data alone.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know each other; before starting Dear Data we only met twice,\u201d says Lupi. While the pair were aware of each other\u2019s professional work, it was a chance meeting at a data and media art festival in Minneapolis in 2013 that threw them together. And it turned out that Lupi, an Italian living in New York, and Posavec, an American living in London, had plenty in common, besides their love of hand-crafted, information-based design. \u201cWe both switched continents, we are the same age [35] and we are both only children who have travelled far away from our families,\u201d says Lupi.</p> <p>The upshot, after a second meeting the following year, was an experiment: could they get to know each other by number-crunching their lives, one topic per week, with only a handful of coloured pens to bring their data to life?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"469a9355446817492c6d2be653bd7ea07b0ce464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/469a9355446817492c6d2be653bd7ea07b0ce464/109_262_2080_2754/755.jpg\" alt=\"Week 47, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of smells\u2026\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 47, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of smells\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giorgia Lupi/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBoth the data collection and the way we decided to display<strong> </strong>the data reveal something about our personalities,\u201d says Lupi, adding that the data collection was largely made by quick jottings on paper or smartphone, with the exception of one week, in which the pair used an app to track their movements. \u201c[Using the app], it felt like we weren\u2019t really in control of our data, and that we weren\u2019t really engaging with it, so after that point we said, \u2018Let\u2019s focus on data that an app can\u2019t gather yet,\u2019\u201d says Posavec.</p> <p>Their obsession with collecting information seems almost de rigueur. The boom of big data, and the technology that makes its collection and analysis possible, has brought with it a global fascination with tracking every step, snooze and calorie. More broadly, every newspaper, advertising agency and campaign group appears to have embraced the trend for sleek graphics and ingenious visuals, while no app would be complete without a thumbnail chart to scrutinise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2014/sep/10/best-infographic-graphic-design\">The best of infographics: designers pick their favourites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it seems surprising that Lupi and Posavec have thumbed their noses at such digital sophistication. The data collection, they admit, was sometimes imperfect. It\u2019s depiction \u2013 using a ruler, pens and pencils \u2013 is amusing, even innocent.</p> <p>But, says Posavec, it has a point. It takes hours to make each postcard, hours that invite reflection. \u201cIt helps us better understand and be closer to the subject matter that we are dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>A look at the postcards, now collected in a book, also named <em>Dear Data</em>, and there\u2019s no mistaking Lupi and Posavec\u2019s different styles. While each week the pair agreed on a topic, ranging from the wildlife they had spotted to the scents they had noticed, the data they gathered and their colourful depictions of it are vastly different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07a729777b5a22e1e626f112c4ac98d81330dee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a729777b5a22e1e626f112c4ac98d81330dee0/103_278_2100_2734/768.jpg\" alt=\"Week 38, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of negative feelings\u2026\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 38, Lupi to Posavec on the theme of negative feelings\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giorgia Lupi/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lupi\u2019s postcards are almost forensic: swaths of data encoded in painstakingly hand-drawn devices. In week 32 of the project, she charted the different noises she heard, each sound represented by a note bearing a different symbol, drawn on a colour-coded stave corresponding to where it was heard, with the length of each note relating to the prevalence of the sound. Posavec, by contrast, favours a looser, more intuitive approach \u2013 her postcard for week 32 boasts brightly coloured rectangles stacked up to chart the sounds she heard against the time of day in which she heard them.</p> <p>Both are mind-boggling intricate. The keys to each chart are minute, cypher-like instructions, peppered with anecdotes and asides. \u201cSorry mom and dad! Your daughter swears like a sailor,\u201d Posavec scribbled on the back of week 37, the week of the bad-language count, next to a colour-coded chart indicating whether each curse was in jest or not and exactly what had provoked it.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes time, both to crack a postcard like that and also to read a postcard like that, but I like to say that it was our way of spending time together,\u201d says Lupi. The postcards themselves, she adds, not only reveal something about the other person, but also foster a more conventional approach to friendship. \u201cWe would look at each other\u2019s postcards and then message the other person with questions about the data,\u201d adds Posavec \u201cThe entire year functions like a self-portrait of each of us, but it is a starting point to know more about each other.\u201d</p> <p>Not that the project was without its challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt really forced both of us to invent new visual models and to extend ourselves as designers,\u201d says Lupi, confessing that on one occasion she spent seven hours creating her postcard for the week, drawing more than 700 tiny rectangles depicting the doors she\u2019d opened that week.</p> <p>Posavec agrees. \u201cA lot of information is meant to be crammed in there, it\u2019s meant to be really rich,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Dedicate the time and the information encoded in Lupi and Posavec\u2019s postcards is not only revealing, but poignant. As well as choosing topics around items, such as the contents of their wardrobes or the number of drinks they\u2019d had that week, the pair also scrutinised their behaviour. Week 38 threw the spotlight on negative thoughts.</p> <p>\u201c[That] was really challenging for me, because a lot of time I would feel a negative thought, something that wasn\u2019t quite OK, coming through my mind, but I wasn\u2019t really able to grasp it and to categorise it right away. Was it fear? Was it anxiety? Was it sadness?\u201d asks Lupi. \u201cIt really helped me spending a little time with these negative thoughts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0aaee9e5e07425b41633f7a11e497f457ea9ac8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aaee9e5e07425b41633f7a11e497f457ea9ac8b/245_182_2037_2906/701.jpg\" alt=\"Week 26, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of workspaces\u2026\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 26, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of workspaces\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Posavec/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a week that also hit home for Posavec. \u201cI realised I had more negative thoughts about myself than about anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause, gathering data, you need to be as honest as possible \u2013 it forces you to look at the data and confront that as part of yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Other weeks were rather more experimental. \u201cWe started to gather data on something in order to force us to change our behaviour,\u201d says Posavec. The challenge? See how many times you can smile at strangers. \u201cI really hated that week \u2013 I hate smiling at people in London,\u201d she admits.</p> <p>She\u2019s not kidding. Looking up her postcard, I discover the last day of the week is shaded out. The key tells all. \u201cStopped smiling in protest to assholes!\u201d it says. \u201cI kind of went on strike,\u201d Posavec admits. But, she says, the experience was formative, too. \u201c[Following the experiment] I do actually try to smile more at people that I interact with.\u201d</p> <p>But is there not a hitch? Gathering, displaying and exchanging all this data may be fascinating, but releasing it in exhibitions and, now, a book seems a breach of everyday privacy. Did the pair have any qualms?</p> <p>Posavec says not. \u201cI thought as long as I am OK and I give permission for people to look at my data, then that is fine.\u201d</p> <p>Lupi, too, is relaxed about the idea. \u201cWe have never been scared of sharing with the other person \u2013 or with the world \u2013 our flaws, our obsessions, our bad habits in the form of data,\u201d she says, adding that revealing such matters not only helps when it comes to tackling those habits, but also helps others to relate to the work. \u201cThere is nothing shameful in admitting that I\u2019m envious of native English speakers, or of people who are more charming than I am, or that I have negative thoughts about the fact that I feel I\u2019m not enough \u2013 that is something that is part of me and it is good to put it out in the world,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While the year of Dear Data is over, its impact, says Lupi, is lasting. \u201cI feel so much more aware of what\u2019s happening around me,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to say that data collection can be a form of meditation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"871b4702023a6df919b67c03eda6fa2fe910660f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/871b4702023a6df919b67c03eda6fa2fe910660f/265_189_2020_2890/699.jpg\" alt=\"Week 43, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of breaking routine\u2026\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Week 43, Posavec to Lupi on the theme of breaking routine\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Posavec/Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Posavec hopes the project will also have a wider impact on the way we all view data. \u201cData doesn\u2019t need to be intimidating \u2013 there can be a human side to it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a fancy programme to work with it \u2013 you just need a pencil.\u201d</p> <p>But the question remains, did the two become closer from sharing data?</p> <p>\u201cI would say we are really close friends,\u201d says Posavec. \u201cI talk about things with her that I don\u2019t talk about with a lot of friends.\u201d</p> <p>She says the project has not only brought them closer but enabled them to examine each other\u2019s lives in new ways.</p> <p>\u201cI feel really lucky.

Back for its eighth and biggest year, the makeshift shanty town hosted countless stages, seedy dives and pop-up sound systems playing everything from jungle and bassline to folk and funeral marches. Arts and crafts workshops, flash-mobbing actors in costume and spoken-word performances were also to be found in the BoomTown\u2019s nooks and crannies.

That\u2019s the triple treble \u2013 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three successive Games \u2013 and, he says, the end of his Olympic career.</p> <p>A special note for pedantic readers (you\u2019re my favourites) \u2013 you\u2019ll see a lot of \u201ctriple triple\u201ds flying about, but I\u2019m sticking with \u201ctriple treble\u201d and the man himself confirms it:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/usainbolt/status/766815915291717633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Triple Treble&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/u2aOqaQC8y\">https://t.co/u2aOqaQC8y</a></p>&mdash; Usain St. Leo Bolt (@usainbolt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/usainbolt/status/766815915291717633\">August 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Japan\u2019s men zoomed into a surprising second place in that men\u2019s 4x100m, but the relays were dotted with disqualifications.

  "<p>Brazil\u2019s tempestuous World Cup-Olympics doubleheader draws to a close at the Maracan\u00e3 stadium on Sunday night, but the debate on whether it was all worthwhile looks set to run on long beyond the official finish.</p> <p>For politicians and administrators who have staked their careers on these Games, there were no shortage of reasons to declare them a success: tourist numbers were reasonably high (in excess of the 500,000 target, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-rio-tourism-idUSKCN10U23F\" title=\"\">according to the government</a>), sales goals were reached, the infrastructure remained standing, Zika fears proved unfounded and Brazil won more medals than at any previous Games.</p> <p>But there was also plenty of evidence for critics who say the bloated mega-event causes more harm than good: massive spending on stadiums at a time when the government can barely afford wages for doctors and teachers, a huge security presence that protected rich foreigners at the expense of poor residents, dismal crowds that suggested most locals were uninterested in most sports, and massive inequality between the \u00a3700 a day payments to International Olympic Committee executives and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/cleaners-at-rios-athletes-village-paid-just-140-an-hour\" title=\"\">\u00a310 a day earnings of cleaners </a>in the Olympic village.</p> <p>For residents of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 which has spent more than 10 years bidding, building and hosting amid economic decline and political upheaval \u2013 the passing of the Olympic torch to Tokyo in Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony is likely to be both an anti-climax and a relief.</p> <p>There is only so long a host can tolerate requisitioned public spaces, commandeered motorway lanes and frequent military patrols. But many Cariocas are also already looking back at the past two weeks as a welcome distraction from the economic recession and political battles caused by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\" title=\"\">ongoing impeachment of the president, Dilma Rousseff</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The volunteer</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing. The Olympics brought people together despite the crisis and the divisions over impeachment. Rio emerged from this with pride,\u201d enthused Julia Guimar\u00e3es, one of an army of volunteers.</p> <p>However, political turmoil was never far from the sport. From a disrupted torch relay in which the Olympic flame was extinguished on multiple occasions to spectators booing interim president Michel Temer at the opening ceremony and holding \u201cFora Temer\u201d (Temer Out!) banners inside the stadiums or trying to impede women marathon runners, there was no shortage of incidents.</p> <p>Economic problems have also been evident in the volunteer system, which was hit by funding shortfalls and a lack of commitment by some of those who signed up. Guimaraes estimates that about 5% to 10% of volunteers failed to show up, which sometimes left those that did show up feeling stressed.</p> <p>But, like many residents, she felt media criticism of the host was exaggerated. \u201cThere was zero problem with Zika and I would say barely 10% of the other prophecies of doom proved to be accurate,\u201d she said. The widely held feeling that Brazil is unfairly denigrated by foreigners was reinforced by US swimmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/ryan-lochte-apologises-twitter-rio-2016-olympics\" title=\"\">Ryan Lochte, whose fabrication of a story</a> about an armed robbery has dominated front pages for much of the Games. In other cases, crime fears have proven well justified. There have been numerous attempted muggings of dignitaries, though Rio\u2019s thieves often came off worst. Two were shot dead: the first after rashly attempting to rob the head of security at the opening ceremony; the second after struggling with a 60-year-old jiu-jitsu expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio-2016-russian-diplomat-shoots-dead-robber-who-tried-to-mug-him\" title=\"\">who told police he was part of the Russian diplomatic delegation (subsequently denied by Russian authorities)</a>. Another mugger ended up in a tussle with Belgian judo bronze medallist Dirk Van Tichelt. A Portuguese minister was robbed at knifepoint in Ipanema, though locals helped police catch the thief.</p> <h2><strong>The favela resident</strong></h2> <p>With Rio flooded with 85,000 police and military personnel, foreign athletes and visitors in the wealthy parts of the city were relatively well protected. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/rio-police-killings-favela-residents-olympic-security-segregation\" title=\"\">The negative impact was \u2013 as usual \u2013 on poor favela communities</a> which saw dozens of shootouts between police and drug trafficking gangs. One national guard trooper, Helio Andrade, was killed when his vehicle mistakenly entered gang territory in the Complexo do Mar\u00e9. In the hunt for those responsible, police killed five residents. Altogether at least 14 people have been killed in confrontations between gangs and police in Rio during the Olympics \u2013 an average of a death each day.</p> <p>\u201cThings have become worse because of the Olympics,\u201d said Barbara Assis, a resident of Mar\u00e9, who believes investment has been skewed towards the wealthier south and west sides of the city. Although the organisers promised to give free tickets to poor communities, she said none had been offered to anyone that she knew. \u201cIt\u2019s a great shame that the stadiums were so empty. They didn\u2019t give any to us. Instead, they gave them to the families of the volunteers \u2013 and there weren\u2019t many of them from the favelas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"661427fa15d528bb67011c5c62bceec3ef744b0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/661427fa15d528bb67011c5c62bceec3ef744b0c/0_33_3159_1895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafaela Silva celebrates after winning the gold medal of the women\u2019s 57-kg judo competition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil\u2019s Rafaela Silva, who won the gold medal in the women\u2019s 57-kg judo competition, grew up in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) favela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The competitor</strong></h2> <p>In other ways, however, the Olympics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/10/rio-2016-could-be-the-moment-brazil-sheds-its-sporting-stereotypes\" title=\"\">challenged some of the prejudices common in Brazilian society</a>, notably when the host\u2019s first gold medal was won by judoka <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/the-city-of-god-home-of-brazils-first-gold-of-the-games\" title=\"\">Rafaela Silva \u2014 a black lesbian who was born in the Cidade de Deus (City of God)</a> favela. Four years earlier, she was the subject of racist abuse when she was disqualified from the London Games. This time, her victory brought adulation and rare positive coverage of the community where she grew up. Silva told the<em> Observer</em> that she would return there as soon as her Olympic obligations are over: \u201cI\u2019ve received so many messages, people are happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the Olympics are helping the kids a lot.\u201d She believes the Games helped Brazilians to become aware of a greater diversity of sport beyond the usual staple of football. The last two weeks have brought far more attention to women athletes.</p> <h2><strong>The mayor</strong></h2> <p>The armed forces have also been big winners in these Olympics by playing a prominent role inside and outside the Games. As a result of a scheme to support elite athletes with military training and medical facilities, eight of the host\u2019s nine medals have been won by competitors from the army, navy or air force. Their salutes on the podium reinforce a propaganda campaign of metro station posters lauding the armed services for protecting the Games and the nation. For those with memories of the country\u2019s long military dictatorship, this stirs up mixed feelings.</p> <p>But most people are simply delighted that the host nation has enjoyed a reasonable degree of success in competitions and avoided a complete catastrophe in organisation. The medal haul is already the best in the nation\u2019s history though it looks likely to fall somewhat short of the Brazilian Olympic Committee\u2019s target of a top-10 finish. The running of the Games, on the other hand, had problems \u2013 particularly the largely empty stadiums, swimming pool discolouration and shortages of food stalls for visitors \u2013 but none were calamitous.</p> <p>Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, said he felt a sense of accomplishment in staging an event that will leave a long-term legacy of transport infrastructure. \u201cIt was a wonderful event. Of course we had some problems, as all Games have issues, but we reacted quickly and strived to solve them. I think we were very successful in these first Olympics in South America.\u201d</p> <p>His proudest boast was the Olympic Boulevard near Pra\u00e7a Maua \u2013 the revamped port area, which thronged with visitors, food trucks and street artists. It was a remarkable transformation from the ugly overhead expressway that once dominated a district known for crime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d9c1baaeacbdf46204ef5782eba45cc46f58f09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d9c1baaeacbdf46204ef5782eba45cc46f58f09/20_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Moscatelli, conservationist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservationist Mario Moscatelli who worked to save mango swamps near the main Olympic venues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The environmentalist</strong></h2> <p>But the boulevard also flanks the biggest failed promise of this Olympics, Guanabara Bay, which was supposed to have been cleared up ahead of the Games. The pollution did not appear to have influenced many results. There were a few reports of competitors falling sick, but not so many to suggest anything out of the ordinary. Nonetheless, the poor quality of the water was an embarrassment to the hosts that was raised even by the Brazilian sailing gold medalist Kahena Kunze. \u201cRio de Janeiro is wonderful and we are all enjoying it, but imagine if the water were clean,\u201d she said after her victory.</p> <p>Conservationist Mario Moscatelli spent the Olympics trying to rebuild mangrove swamps that can naturally clean the bay and the lagoons near the Olympic Park. The money spent on one stadium, he calculated, would have been enough to recuperate these damaged habitats and build wastewater treatment plants to ensure local populations do not contaminate them again. Instead, however, it went on a stage for a two-week event that is now almost over.</p> <p>\u201cFor the Bay, there is little left other than unkept promises,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, where \u2013 according to the Brazilian authorities \u2013 everything was supposed to be much better thanks to the legacy of the Olympics. But for the environment, it just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Global attention on this and other problems will move on along with the Olympic torch, Rio and Brazil will be left far more to their own devices, and life should return to something approaching normality. After mega-events, recession and impeachment, however, you have to wonder if anyone remembers what \u201cnormal\u201d is.</p> <h2><strong>The organiser</strong></h2> <p>For Agberto Guimar\u00e3es, a three-time Olympian and executive director of sport on the Rio 2016 organising committee, that will mean finally getting some sleep and being able to spend more time with his family after long nights dealing with the green diving pool and making sure tracks, courts, pitches, lagoons and training groups were ready for competitors.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been very, very tough, I can\u2019t deny that, but it was rewarding when we see what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t feel relief when the Games have gone. I will feel emptiness. For seven years, life has been busy. In the last two months, it has been very busy and in the last few weeks I have been lucky to get four hours sleep a night. But after all this over, I will be left with a sense of \u2018now what?\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury</em></p>",
  "<p>Almost two months after the Brexit vote, Britain\u2019s economy remains in rude health. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\" title=\"\">Unemployment is at its lowest for 10 years</a>, inflation remains low and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\" title=\"\">consumer spending in July was strong</a>.</p> <p>The doom-mongers who predicted a panic in the aftermath of the referendum were wrong. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/uk-house-price-average-rose-17000-year-june-ons-figures-show\" title=\"\">house prices have continued to rise</a>, unaffected by the prospect of the UK being outside the EU in a couple of years\u2019 time.</p> <p>This is one way of looking at the recent economic data. Another is to point out that had Mark Carney and the Bank of England not recognised the danger signs, Britain would have been in dire trouble.</p> <p>Bank officials read the economic tea leaves and agreed that a shot of adrenaline was needed. Without extra monetary stimulus, redundancies were inevitable, the pound would tumble to parity with the dollar, sending inflation spiralling upwards, and investment was likely to plunge. House prices might have dropped by 20%, as the Treasury famously predicted, with wages slumping instead of rising sightly.</p> <p>Carney, a safe pair of hands as goalkeeper in his student ice hockey days, has become the ultimate economic backstop.</p> <p>Brexiters brush aside the counter-factual arguments, saying that the Bank\u2019s stimulus plan, which included a cut in interest rates and pumping and extra \u00a370bn into the economy, played second fiddle to the wisdom of the UK household, which has turned out to be more self-confident and far-sighted than City economists had assumed. Consumer confidence surveys were another plank of support for this view, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\" title=\"\">recording a rise this month</a> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">plummeting earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>But what is more likely is that consumers were in a genuine panic until they heard that their central bank was priming its big guns. Soon after, though, they noticed the letter from their mortgage company highlighting the effect of the Carney interest rate cut on their monthly bills and felt much better about the world. Almost all economic activity these days seems to be predicated on zero interest rates, easy access to cheap credit and the Bank\u2019s promise that it will do anything to maintain growth.</p> <p>But next year could bring further trouble. Once Article 50 is triggered and the debate about our relationship with the EU begins in earnest, concerns about trading outside the free market will resurface.</p> <p>City economists have predicted a 350,000 increase in unemployment over the next four years and a growth rate consistently below 2% over the same period. We know this because the Treasury published its review of economic forecasts by the City\u2019s major banks. Investment, the lifeblood for improvements to productivity and higher wages, is expected to leach away, and not just to the EU.</p> <p>Why, finance companies will ask themselves, should they stay in a post-Brexit London when they could be in Singapore or Hong Kong? Likewise, Ford and other manufacturers will accelerate the process \u2013 under way for years now \u2013 of taking their factories to the more compliant, low-cost destinations such as Turkey.</p> <p>Unable to attract investment on the basis of being connected umbilically to the EU in key areas such as carmaking, pharmaceuticals and creative digital industries, the government will turn to tax cuts and other incentives that will undermine its ability to fund welfare, healthcare and education.</p> <p>Donald Trump is considered by many to be the biggest threat to the global economy. This threat remains theoretical and, if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-campaign-terrible-week-paul-ryan-khan\" title=\"\">latest polls</a> are to be believed, unlikely. Brexit is just around the corner and involves the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy leaving the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. Such a seismic event cannot avoid creating a shock and some painful after-effects.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope Theresa May is as good as her word and provides a clear plan of industrial support to mitigate the worst effects of leaving the EU. Without that, Carney may be called upon to give an ailing economy another stimulus shot.</p> <h2>At last, a real tax evasion crackdown</h2> <p>\u2018\u2018We need to talk about tax,\u201d said Theresa May when making her pitch for Conservative leader. She promised a crackdown on both avoidance and evasion. Empty words? It seems not. Last week the Treasury published an eye-catching proposal to fine the enablers of tax avoidance. Accountants, solicitors, banks and financial advisers whose tax schemes are successfully challenged by HMRC could find themselves paying the equivalent of 100% of the tax owed.</p> <p>Pressure groups have been arguing for such a measure for years, as a deterrent to those who dream up schemes and collect the fees, while their clients pick up the tab from the tax office.</p> <p>The big four accountancy firms will have little incentive to remain in the game of advising on avoidance. Smaller outfits may move offshore. Which brings us to another key piece of legislation, proposed but not yet passed.</p> <p>Last March, following revelations of HSBC helping clients hide money in Switzerland, George Osborne suggested a corporate offence of failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion \u2013 designed to tackle the difficulty in holding companies liable for the acts of their employees.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t really aimed at banks, though. After crackdowns by US and German regulators, attention has shifted to a lesser-known but growing sector \u2013 trust companies. They help set up the structures,and provide nominees who act as directors, shareholders or trustees, so the real owners can remain out of sight. As we learned from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, these services are popular \u2013 and lucrative. In 2012, private equity group Blackstone bought one such operator, Intertrust, for \u20ac675m. It floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange for \u20ac1.3bn last year.</p> <p>The mere threat of corporate liability is already having the desired effect. Reports suggest trust companies, many of which have UK offices, are combing their books for likely evaders. The government should pass both pieces of enabler legislation without delay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40/0_10_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On the up and up: rail fares<br></h2> <p>Last week saw the annual rail fares revolt, as news that season ticket prices will rise by 1.9% was met with outrage from commuters, green campaigners and trade unions. Passengers, in particular, have a point. They provide the bulk of the industry\u2019s income now \u2013 \u00a38.8bn, compared with \u00a33.5bn from the state \u2013 but the railways cannot afford a fairer deal.</p> <p>Last year, the industry\u2019s costs rose 7% to \u00a3900m, outstripping the latest fare increase. The government, which sets the caps on fares, is thus unlikely to come to passengers\u2019 aid. The answer is not nationalisation of rail franchises, because the most expensive bit, tracks and stations, is already state-owned through Network Rail. The answer is lower costs. And that means building better relations with trade unions and reducing profligacy at Network Rail. In the meantime, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for commuters.</p> <h2>Sugar tax policy leaves a bad taste</h2> <p>The government\u2019s sugar tax and childhood obesity strategy has received a mixed reaction. Health experts believe it does not go far enough, while soft-drink makers believe the tax will simply hurt consumers and businesses rather than lower obesity levels.</p> <p>Targeting soft drinks when fruit juice, smoothies and coffees are all loaded with sugar is a mistake, they say.</p> <p>The most important reaction, however, was from supermarkets. They criticised the government\u2019s watered-down obesity strategy, saying that mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food were needed to ensure a level playing field and ensure genuine change.</p> <p>The supermarkets are often criticised for two-for-one promotions and selling snacks at the till, but they are correct here.</p> <p>The only way to make change happen quickly and effectively is for the government to step in. When it has done so previously, such as by pushing brands, shops and restaurants to publish nutritional information on their packaging, companies have stepped up to the mark.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the government has left its childhood obesity strategy vulnerable to the vagaries of capitalism and the free market. Even if responsible companies do take action, others may not, and so responsible companies will pay the price.</p>",
  "<p>Becoming a world authority on sea ice has taken Peter Wadhams to the polar zones more than 50 times, travelling on foot and by plane, ship, snowmobile and several nuclear-powered submarines of the Royal Navy.</p> <p>Nonscientists who read his astonishing and hair-raising <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> will agree that the interludes of autobiography it contains are engrossing, entertaining and, when one submarine suffers an onboard explosion and fire while under the ice, harrowing.</p> <p>Any reader should find the science of sea-ice creation and the implications for us all of its loss \u2013 explored and explained here with clarity and style \u2013 beautiful, compelling and terrifying.</p> <p>Wadhams thanks Ernest Hemingway for his title. Climate change, a cause and an effect of ice loss, brings conflict that would have interested the great author. Persecuted by trolls and climate-change deniers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/arctic-sea-ice-expert-complains-to-press-watchdog-over-times-story\">Wadhams made news last year</a> when three of his peers met premature deaths. One fell down stairs. One died in wilderness, possibly struck by lightning. A third, out cycling, was crushed by a lorry. Claiming that he had been targeted by a lorry while cycling, Wadhams speculated that oil companies or governments had it in for him and his ilk because of the conclusions to which their work has led them. But his book is more extraordinary than any conspiracy.</p> <p><em>A Farewell to Ice </em>proceeds methodically. Ice cores, tubes of compacted polar snow, record the last million years of atmospheric change, during which the Earth has oscillated between ice ages and warm periods. Now the pattern is breaking.</p> <p>\u201cOur planet has changed colour. Today, from space, the top of the world in the northern summer looks blue instead of white. We have created an ocean where there was once an ice sheet. It is Man\u2019s first major achievement in reshaping the face of his planet,\u201d Wadhams writes.</p> <p>Polar ice is thinning and retreating with unprecedented speed. All our ingenuity cannot, at present, change that. Because ice only grows in winter but can melt year-round, its growth rate is limited, while melt rate is unlimited.</p> <p>Ice is extraordinary stuff. A \u201cpuckered honeycomb\u201d of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, it is highly mutable in different states because the length of the hydrogen bonds in its molecules varies. Ice exists near absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically possible. Recent research suggests it may have entirely covered the Earth three times, making \u201csnowball Earths\u201d. Ice coats space dust, giving stars their twinkle. Life may have originated in that shining dust, according to the astronomer Fred Hoyle. Polar ice functions as Earth\u2019s air- and water-conditioning system, and our thermostat.</p> <p>Wadhams outlines how CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are smashing the system, spinning the thermostat to hot. Without the albedo effect of ice \u2013 by which it reflects solar radiation up to 10 times more effectively than open water \u2013 we have entered a <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/abrupt/story2.html\">positive feedback loop</a>.</p> <p>Wadhams puts this plainly. \u201cThere is no period in Earth\u2019s history where the rate of rise of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is as great as it is today.\u201d The asteroid that finished the dinosaurs blasted 4.5 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, \u201cyet the CO<sub>2</sub> rate rise [in the aftermath] was still an order of magnitude lower than the current rate\u201d.</p> <p>The ice he worries about most covers Arctic seabeds \u2013 permafrost from the last ice age. Losing this will release huge methane plumes. Methane is 23 times more effective in raising global temperature than is CO<sub>2</sub>. Wadhams and colleagues have modelled the consequences using different dates for methane release.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We act, decisively and immediately, or our grandchildren pay full price, with our children impotent to help them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A business-as-usual approach by humanity makes 2035 a plausible moment for the permafrost to melt and methane to escape. The worst floods, fires, droughts and storms we have seen will be as nothing to what Africa, Asia and the Americas experience in this scenario. Millions die. Low-lying areas are inundated. Survivors live in a patchy post-apocalypse. Europe\u2019s current refugee crisis would be dwarfed.</p> <p>We still have time, <em>A Farewell to Ice </em>concludes, for drastic action, despite long procrastination. The fall of Margaret Thatcher was bad for the ice: she was a fan of Wadhams\u2019s work, quoting him extensively in her efforts to set up a body to understand and mitigate the loss of sea ice. Subsequent prime ministers did little or worse than nothing, suppressing facts that lobbyists in business and industry (some of them former Thatcherite ministers like Lord Lawson and Peter Lilley) did not like.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris agreement</a>, when global leaders resolved to prevent a temperature rise of 2C (with an aspiration of 1.5C), gives Wadhams hope. He believes there is now a common will across the world to confront and avert the nightmare. Solutions include wind, wave, solar, tidal and nuclear energy (not the perilous water-cooled reactor type David Cameron wanted for Hinkley Point, which have a terrible record, but the \u201cpebble bed\u201d type, apparently) and, above all, direct air capture (DAC), which has yet to be invented.</p> <p>You pump air through a system that removes the CO<sub>2</sub> and \u201ceither liquefies it or turns it chemically into something useful\u201d, Wadhams says.

  "<p>Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic, making more than 50 trips there, some in submarines under the polar ice. He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink. He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001. His book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/farewell-to-ice.html\" title=\"\"><em>A Farewell to Ice</em></a>, tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current&#xa0;rate.</p> <p><strong>You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade. It hasn\u2019t. Are you being alarmist?</strong><br>No. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter\" title=\"\">a clear trend down to zero</a> for summer cover. However, each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away. The overall trend is a very strong downward one, however. Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic\u2019s summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline. Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.</p> <p><strong>Why should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer?</strong><br>People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change. Things happen, they say. In fact, the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population. One key effect will be albedo feedback. Sea ice reflects about 50% of the solar radiation it receives back into space. By contrast, water reflects less than 10%. So if you replace ice with water, which is darker, much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present.</p> <p>Sea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system. Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further. These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures?</strong><br>The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt. It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year. Antarctica is adding to the melt as well. Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result. The most recent prediction of the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely. Indeed, it is probably the best we can hope for.</p> <p>That may not sound a lot but it is really very serious. It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world. We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh, it just means more and more people will be drowned.</p> <p><strong>Global warming is generally associated with increased fossil-fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But is that the only climate problem we face?</strong><br>No it is not. We also have the issue of methane. Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed. The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic&#xa0;icecaps.</p> <p>Until around 2005, even in summer, you still had sea ice near the coast. Then it started to disappear, so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age. It has started to melt with dangerous consequences. Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution.</p> <p><strong>Can we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide?</strong><br>Yes, we can measure methane over large areas using satellites. These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating, often with little outliers on the graph. There is a scientist called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jun/12/greenland-darkening-ice-climate-science\" title=\"\">Jason Box</a> who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon\u2019s breath. They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments. They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9df49ffc3458b65c76347f968f4bb315813745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9df49ffc3458b65c76347f968f4bb315813745/78_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi NPP satellite taken on May 30, 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the north-west coast of Alaska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi NPP satellite taken on May 30, 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the north-west coast of Alaska.

However, methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide. It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years. By contrast, carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100&#xa0;years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed. At least that is what scientists thought. Today, there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere.</p> <p>So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away. But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect. All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere. We are having to live with last century\u2019s carbon dioxide. What that says is simple: there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide. That is why I am despondent about us ever being able to cut carbon emissions.</p> <p><strong>If we cannot halt the emissions of carbon dioxide, what can we do?</strong><br>In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. Even the IPCC has admitted that we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air. The trouble is that they don\u2019t just how we can do that. The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS: bio-energy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\" title=\"\">carbon capture and storage</a>. Essentially, you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground. These grow, absorbing carbon dioxide in the process. Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping, liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/20/june-2016-14th-consecutive-month-of-record-breaking-heat-says-us-agencies\">Hottest ever June marks 14th month of record-breaking temperatures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>It sounds straightforward. Will it work?</strong><br>I am a bit suspicious of this technology. BECCS will need so much land to be effective. Calculations suggest it would need 40% to 50% of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants. Other techniques, such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, on beaches, will simply not scale up. They won\u2019t work, so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly.</p> <p>As far as I can see, it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end. It can be done, I am sure, but at the moment we do not have such a device. However, without something like that I cannot see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere. We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed. That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us. I think humanity can do it, but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology.</p> <p><em>Farewell to Ice is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320) on 1&#xa0;September.</em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/farewell-to-ice.html\" title=\"\"><em> Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>",

  "<p>The western financial crisis of 2007-8 was the worst since 1931, yet its immediate repercussions were surprisingly modest. The crisis challenged the foundation stones of the long-dominant neoliberal ideology but it seemed to emerge largely unscathed. The banks were bailed out; hardly any bankers on either side of the Atlantic were prosecuted for their crimes; and the price of their behaviour was duly paid by the taxpayer. Subsequent economic policy, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, has relied overwhelmingly on monetary policy, especially quantitative easing. It has failed. The western economy has stagnated and is now approaching its lost decade, with no end in sight.</p> <p>After almost nine years, we are finally beginning to reap the political whirlwind of the financial crisis. But how did neoliberalism manage to survive virtually unscathed for so long? Although it failed the test of the real world, bequeathing the worst economic disaster for seven decades, politically and intellectually it remained the only show in town. Parties of the right, centre and left had all bought into its philosophy, New Labour a classic in point. They knew no other way of thinking or doing: it had become the common sense. It was, as Antonio Gramsci put it, hegemonic. But that hegemony cannot and will not survive the test of the real world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/political-third-parties-spoilers-abolitionists-movement\">Third parties aren't 'spoilers'. They're at the cutting edge of democracy | Kevin Zeese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first inkling of the wider political consequences was evident in the turn in public opinion against the banks, bankers and business leaders. For decades, they could do no wrong: they were feted as the role models of our age, the default troubleshooters of choice in education, health and seemingly everything else. Now, though, their star was in steep descent, along with that of the political class. The effect of the financial crisis was to undermine faith and trust in the competence of the governing elites. It marked the beginnings of a wider political crisis.</p> <p>But the causes of this political crisis, glaringly evident on both sides of the Atlantic, are much deeper than simply the financial crisis and the virtually stillborn recovery of the last decade. They go to the heart of the neoliberal project that dates from the late 70s and the political rise of Reagan and Thatcher, and embraced at its core the idea of a global free market in goods, services and capital. The depression-era system of bank regulation was dismantled, in the US in the 1990s and in Britain in 1986, thereby creating the conditions for the 2008 crisis. Equality was scorned, the idea of trickle-down economics lauded, government condemned as a fetter on the market and duly downsized, immigration encouraged, regulation cut to a minimum, taxes reduced and a blind eye turned to corporate evasion.</p> <p>It should be noted that, by historical standards, the neoliberal era has not had a particularly good track record. The most dynamic period of postwar western growth was that between the end of the war and the early 70s, the era of welfare capitalism and Keynesianism, when the growth rate was double that of the neoliberal period from 1980 to the present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3/0_38_3546_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by far the most disastrous feature of the neoliberal period has been the huge growth in inequality. Until very recently, this had been virtually ignored. With extraordinary speed, however, it has emerged as one of, if not the most important political issue on both sides of the Atlantic, most dramatically in the US. It is, bar none, the issue that is driving the political discontent that is now engulfing the west. Given the statistical evidence, it is puzzling, shocking even, that it has been disregarded for so long; the explanation can only lie in the sheer extent of the hegemony of neoliberalism and its values.</p> <p>But now reality has upset the doctrinal apple cart. In the period 1948-1972, every section of the American population experienced very similar and sizable increases in their standard of living; between 1972-2013, the bottom 10% experienced falling real income while the top 10% did far better than everyone else. In the US, the median real income for full-time male workers is now lower than it was four decades ago: the income of the bottom 90% of the population has <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/globalization-new-discontents-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-08\">stagnated for over 30 years</a>.</p> <p>A not so dissimilar picture is true of the UK. And the problem has grown more serious since the financial crisis. On average, between <a href=\"http://\">65-70% of households in 25 high-income economies</a> experienced stagnant or falling real incomes between 2005 and 2014.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reasons are not difficult to explain. The hyper-globalisation era has been systematically stacked in favour of capital against labour: international trading agreements, drawn up in great secrecy, with business on the inside and the unions and citizens excluded, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32498715\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) being but the latest examples; the politico-legal attack on the unions; <a href=\"http://\">the encouragement of large-scale immigration in both the US and Europe</a> that helped to undermine the bargaining power of the domestic workforce; and the failure to retrain displaced workers in any meaningful way.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a> has shown, in the absence of countervailing pressures, capitalism naturally gravitates towards increasing inequality. In the period between 1945 and the late 70s, Cold War competition was arguably the biggest such constraint. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been none. As the popular backlash grows increasingly irresistible, however, such a winner-takes-all regime becomes politically unsustainable.</p> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot, as graphically illustrated by the support for Trump and Sanders in the US and the Brexit vote in the UK. This popular revolt is often described, in a somewhat denigratory and dismissive fashion, as populism. Or, as Francis Fukuyama writes in a recent excellent <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/american-political-decay-or-renewal\">essay in <em>Foreign Affairs</em></a>: \u201c\u2018Populism\u2019 is the label that political elites attach to policies supported by ordinary citizens that they don\u2019t like.\u201d Populism is a movement against the status quo. It represents the beginnings of something new, though it is generally much clearer about what it is against than what it is for. It can be progressive or reactionary, but more usually both.</p> <p>Brexit is a classic example of such populism. It has overturned a fundamental cornerstone of UK policy since the early 1970s. Though ostensibly about Europe, it was in fact about much more: a cri de coeur from those who feel they have lost out and been left behind, whose living standards have stagnated or worse since the 1980s, who feel dislocated by large-scale immigration over which they have no control and who face an increasingly insecure and casualised labour market. Their revolt has paralysed the governing elite, already claimed one prime minister, and left the latest one fumbling around in the dark looking for divine inspiration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1/0_149_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wave of populism marks the return of class as a central agency in politics, both in the UK and the US. This is particularly remarkable in the US. For many decades, the idea of the \u201cworking class\u201d was marginal to American political discourse. Most Americans described themselves as middle class, a reflection of the aspirational pulse at the heart of American society. According to a Gallup poll, in 2000 only 33% of Americans called themselves working class; by 2015 the figure was 48%, almost half the population.</p> <p>Brexit, too, was primarily a working-class revolt. Hitherto, on both sides of the Atlantic, the agency of class has been in retreat in the face of the emergence of a new range of identities and issues from gender and race to sexual orientation and the environment. The return of class, because of its sheer reach, has the potential, like no other issue, to redefine the political landscape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, is a function of politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The re-emergence of class should not be confused with the labour movement. They are not synonymous: this is obvious in the US and increasingly the case in the UK. Indeed, over the last half-century, there has been a growing separation between the two in Britain. The re-emergence of the working class as a political voice in Britain, most notably in the Brexit vote, can best be described as an inchoate expression of resentment and protest, with only a very weak sense of belonging to the labour movement.</p> <p>Indeed, Ukip has been as important \u2013 in the form of immigration and Europe \u2013 in shaping its current attitudes as the Labour party. In the United States, both Trump and Sanders have given expression to the working-class revolt, the latter almost as much as the former. The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, as the left liked to think, is a function of politics.</p> <p>The neoliberal era is being undermined from two directions. First, if its record of economic growth has never been particularly strong, it is now dismal. Europe is barely larger than it was on the eve of the financial crisis in 2007; the United States has done better but even its growth has been anaemic. Economists such as Larry Summers believe that the prospect for the future is most likely one of <a href=\"http://larrysummers.com/category/secular-stagnation/\">secular stagnation</a>.</p> <p>Worse, because the recovery has been so weak and fragile, there is a widespread belief that another financial crisis may well beckon. In other words, the neoliberal era has delivered the west back into the kind of crisis-ridden world that we last experienced in the 1930s. With this background, it is hardly surprising that a majority in the west now believe their children will be worse off than they were. Second, those who have lost out in the neoliberal era are no longer prepared to acquiesce in their fate \u2013 they are increasingly in open revolt. We are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era. It is not dead, but it is in its early death throes, just as the social-democratic era was during the 1970s.</p> <p>A sure sign of the declining influence of neoliberalism is the rising chorus of intellectual voices raised against it. From the mid-70s through the 80s, the economic debate was increasingly dominated by monetarists and free marketeers. But since the western financial crisis, the centre of gravity of the intellectual debate has shifted profoundly. This is most obvious in the United States, with economists such as Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, Dani Rodrik and Jeffrey Sachs becoming increasingly influential. Thomas Piketty\u2019s <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> has been a massive seller. His work and that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/nobel-prize-for-economics-runners-riders\">Tony Atkinson and Angus Deaton</a> have pushed the question of the inequality to the top of the political agenda. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hajoonchang\">Ha-Joon Chang</a>, for long isolated within the economics profession, has gained a following far greater than those who think economics is a branch of mathematics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7/0_4_4267_2561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at a rally in north London last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at rally in north London last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, some of those who were previously strong advocates of a neoliberal approach, such as Larry Summers and the <em>Financial Times</em>\u2019s Martin Wolf, have become extremely critical. The wind is in the sails of the critics of neoliberalism; the neoliberals and monetarists are in retreat. In the UK, the media and political worlds are well behind the curve. Few recognise that we are at the end of an era. Old attitudes and assumptions still predominate, whether on the BBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, in the rightwing press or the parliamentary Labour party.</p> <p>Following Ed Miliband\u2019s resignation as Labour leader, virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn in the subsequent leadership election. The assumption had been more of the same, a Blairite or a halfway house like Miliband, certainly not anyone like Corbyn. But the zeitgeist had changed. The membership, especially the young who had joined the party on an unprecedented scale, wanted a complete break with New Labour. One of the reasons why the left has failed to emerge as the leader of the new mood of working-class disillusionment is that most social democratic parties became, in varying degrees, disciples of neoliberalism and uber-globalisation. The most extreme forms of this phenomenon were New Labour and the Democrats, who in the late 90s and 00s became its advance guard, personified by Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, triangulation and the third way.</p> <p>But as David Marquand observed in a review for the <em>New Statesman</em>, what is the point of a social democratic party if it doesn\u2019t represent the less fortunate, the underprivileged and the losers? New Labour deserted those who needed them, who historically they were supposed to represent. Is it surprising that large sections have now deserted the party who deserted them? Blair, in his reincarnation as a money-obsessed consultant to a shady bunch of presidents and dictators, is a fitting testament to the demise of New Labour.</p> <p>The rival contenders \u2013 Burnham, Cooper and Kendall \u2013 represented continuity. They were swept away by Corbyn, who won nearly 60% of the votes. New Labour was over, as dead as Monty Python\u2019s parrot. Few grasped the meaning of what had happened. A <em>Guardian</em> leader welcomed the surge in membership and then, lo and behold, urged support for Yvette Cooper, the very antithesis of the reason for the enthusiasm. The PLP refused to accept the result and ever since has tried with might and main to remove Corbyn.</p> <p>Just as the Labour party took far too long to come to terms with the rise of Thatcherism and the birth of a new era at the end of the 70s, now it could not grasp that the Thatcherite paradigm, which they eventually came to embrace in the form of New Labour, had finally run its course. Labour, like everyone else, is obliged to think anew. The membership in their antipathy to New Labour turned to someone who had never accepted the latter, who was the polar opposite in almost every respect of Blair, and embodying an authenticity and decency which Blair patently did not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corbyn is not a product of the new times, he is a throwback to the late 70s and early 80s. That is both his strength and also his weakness. He is uncontaminated by the New Labour legacy because he has never accepted it. But nor, it would seem, does he understand the nature of the new era. The danger is that he is possessed of feet of clay in what is a highly fluid and unpredictable political environment, devoid of any certainties of almost any kind, in which Labour finds itself dangerously divided and weakened.</p> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better. David Cameron was guilty of a huge and irresponsible miscalculation over Brexit. He was forced to resign in the most ignominious of circumstances. The party is hopelessly divided. It has no idea in which direction to move after Brexit. The Brexiters painted an optimistic picture of turning away from the declining European market and embracing the expanding markets of the world, albeit barely mentioning by name which countries it had in mind. It looks as if the new prime minister may have an anachronistic hostility towards China and a willingness to undo the good work of George Osborne. If the government turns its back on China, by far the fastest growing market in the world, where are they going to turn?</p> <p>Brexit has left the country fragmented and deeply divided, with the very real prospect that Scotland might choose independence. Meanwhile, the Conservatives seem to have little understanding that the neoliberal era is in its death throes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3/0_140_4658_2796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dramatic as events have been in the UK, they cannot compare with those in the United States. Almost from nowhere, Donald Trump rose to capture the Republican nomination and confound virtually all the pundits and not least his own party. His message was straightforwardly anti-globalisation. He believes that the interests of the working class have been sacrificed in favour of the big corporations that have been encouraged to invest around the world and thereby deprive American workers of their jobs. Further, he argues that large-scale immigration has weakened the bargaining power of American workers and served to lower their wages.</p> <p>He proposes that US corporations should be required to invest their cash reserves in the US. He believes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) has had the effect of exporting American jobs to Mexico. On similar grounds, he is opposed to the TPP and the TTIP. And he also accuses China of stealing American jobs, threatening to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese imports.</p> <p>To globalisation Trump counterposes economic nationalism: \u201cPut America first\u201d. His appeal, above all, is to the white working class who, until Trump\u2019s (and Bernie Sander\u2019s) arrival on the political scene, had been ignored and largely unrepresented since the 1980s. Given that their wages have been falling for most of the last 40 years, it is extraordinary how their interests have been neglected by the political class. Increasingly, they have voted Republican, but the Republicans have long been captured by the super-rich and Wall Street, whose interests, as hyper-globalisers, have run directly counter to those of the white working class. With the arrival of Trump they finally found a representative: they won Trump the Republican nomination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The economic nationalist argument has also been vigorously pursued by Bernie Sanders, who ran Hillary Clinton extremely close for the Democratic nomination and would probably have won but for more than 700 so-called super-delegates, who were effectively chosen by the Democratic machine and overwhelmingly supported Clinton. As in the case of the Republicans, the Democrats have long supported a neoliberal, pro-globalisation strategy, notwithstanding the concerns of its trade union base. Both the Republicans and the Democrats now find themselves deeply polarised between the pro- and anti-globalisers, an entirely new development not witnessed since the shift towards neoliberalism under Reagan almost 40 years ago.</p> <p>Another plank of Trump\u2019s nationalist appeal \u2013 \u201cMake America great again\u201d \u2013 is his position on foreign policy. He believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources. He argues that the country\u2019s alliance system is unfair, with America bearing most of the cost and its allies contributing far too little. He points to Japan and South Korea, and Nato\u2019s European members as prime examples.He seeks to rebalance these relationships and, failing that, to exit from them.</p> <p>As a country in decline, he argues that America can no longer afford to carry this kind of financial burden. Rather than putting the world to rights, he believes the money should be invested at home, pointing to the dilapidated state of America\u2019s infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">Trump\u2019s position</a> represents a major critique of America as the world\u2019s hegemon. His arguments mark a radical break with the neoliberal, hyper-globalisation ideology that has reigned since the early 1980s and with the foreign policy orthodoxy of most of the postwar period. These arguments must be taken seriously. They should not be lightly dismissed just because of their authorship. But Trump is no man of the left. He is a populist of the right. He has launched a racist and xenophobic attack on Muslims and on Mexicans. Trump\u2019s appeal is to a white working class that feels it has been cheated by the big corporations, undermined by Hispanic immigration, and often resentful towards African-Americans who for long too many have viewed as their inferior.</p> <p>A Trump America would mark a descent into authoritarianism characterised by abuse, scapegoating, discrimination, racism, arbitrariness and violence; America would become a deeply polarised and divided society. His threat to impose <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html\">45% tariffs on China</a>, if implemented, would certainly provoke retaliation by the Chinese and herald the beginnings of a new era of protectionism.</p> <p>Trump may well lose the presidential election just as Sanders failed in his bid for the Democrat nomination. But this does not mean that the forces opposed to hyper-globalisation \u2013 unrestricted immigration, TPP and TTIP, the free movement of capital and much else \u2013 will have lost the argument and are set to decline. In little more than 12 months, Trump and Sanders have transformed the nature and terms of the argument. Far from being on the wane, the arguments of the critics of hyper-globalisation are steadily gaining ground. Roughly two-thirds of Americans agree that \u201cwe should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems\u201d. And, above all else, what will continue to drive opposition to the hyper-globalisers is inequality.</p>",
