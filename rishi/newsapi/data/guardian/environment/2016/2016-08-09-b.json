  "<p>The impetus for Maxine Beneba Clarke\u2019s memoir came from a torrent of racial abuse. At the time, she was pushing a stroller and walking to pick her son up from school. A young man in a passing ute unleashed a torrent of expletives, telling her to drown her five-month-old daughter and \u201cgo the fuck back to where you came from.\u201d</p> <p> Clarke, a poet and author of Afro-Caribbean descent, had initially planned on writing a memoir tracing her family history back to West Africa, from where her ancestors were forced to leave as part of the slave trade. The ute driver\u2019s hateful invective prompted further reflection on race relations in Australia, and the insidious attitudes and injustices that culminate in overtly racist attacks. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand casual racism,\u201d says Clarke.</p> <p> Instead of tracing her ancestry, she began working on what could become The Hate Race. The memoir chronicles her childhood in Australia as well as the indelible effects of schoolyard bullying. The cumulative effect of racist remarks is \u201clike a poison,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt eats away the very essence of your being.\u201d</p> <p> Born in Sydney to a mathematician father and actress mother, Clarke grew up in predominantly white suburbia in the 80s and 90s. She was first made aware of her race in preschool, when a girl singled out her skin colour. In the years that followed, there came relentless taunts, spitballs, malicious letters and cartoons, and teachers and counsellors ill-equipped to confront racist behaviour or who dismissed it as just \u201ca little bit of teasing\u201d. The horrific name-calling infected Clarke\u2019s self-perception. \u201cI knew exactly what I was,\u201d she writes. Coon. Blackie. Golliwog. Monkey Girl. The persistent bullying was crushing:</p> <p> <em>Somewhere along the line, we just give in.</em></p> <p> <em>Somewhere along the line, we stop reporting.</em></p> <p> <em>Somewhere along the line, we die a little.</em></p> <p> Clarke\u2019s longing for acceptance, to be one of the popular girls with \u201csun-kissed skin and wavy blonde hair\u201d, was physically manifested. At nights she unconsciously scratched at her face, trying \u201cto claw my way out of my skin\u201d. Earlier, as a seven-year-old, she rejoiced when a light patch appeared on her cheek, because she had fantasised about her skin turning white. </p> <p>\u201cThe metamorphosis was starting; the ugly duckling becoming a swan,\u201d she writes. It turned out to be vitiligo, a pigmentation disorder, which later resolved.</p> <p> For Clarke, whose short-story collection Foreign Soil won an Australian Book Industry Award last year, the bullying fuelled a desire to succeed. She was academically gifted and excelled at debating and public speaking \u2013 presaging her later success as a spoken word poet. The bullying has shaped her adult self, Clarke admits, but she is wary of her story being held up as an example of triumph over adversity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/if-i-could-peel-back-my-brown-skin-youd-see-the-aussie-bogan-on-the-inside\">If I could peel back my brown skin, you'd see the Aussie bogan on the inside | Rana Hussain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor every one of me there\u2019s probably a thousand other kids who have anxiety issues or whose experiences have snowballed into a negative adulthood or depression,\u201d she says. Bullying by no means \u201cmakes kids tougher and more wanting to succeed. I think often it just crushes people.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of xenophobia in Australia troubles Clarke. She sees an \u201cawful synchronicity\u201d between past and present. Her parents left England in the 70s, soon after Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech, which decried black immigrants and predicted that foreign children would overcrowd hospitals and schools. Two decades later, Clarke watched Pauline Hanson\u2019s entr\u00e9e into politics with a shockingly similar maiden speech, accompanied by a shift in public sentiment around race and immigration. Unsurprisingly, she is not optimistic about Hanson\u2019s return, the rise of One Nation and Islamophobic rhetoric.</p> <p> \u201cI feel as if there is really a global post-colonial situation at the moment,\u201d which especially victimises children, Clarke says. \u201cThere are children\u2019s bodies being brutalised or being washed up on beaches. We see brown children being locked up on Nauru and in Villawood Detention Centre. We see things like Don Dale and Indigenous communities having their funding cut.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0b1febda7b9afde2ed28bcf45b3b63022cd8f15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b1febda7b9afde2ed28bcf45b3b63022cd8f15/0_0_2145_3279/654.jpg\" alt=\"the hate race book cover\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> But Clarke does see hope in Australia\u2019s young people. \u201cI look at my kids\u2019 generation, and their outlook and the way they behave towards each other is different from anything I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime,\u201d she says. The cultural makeup of Australia has changed since Clarke\u2019s childhood, and diversity in books, television, and online media have played a major role. Sharing stories breeds tolerance through understanding, Clarke believes. \u201cIt\u2019s a wide big world and that there are lots of different kinds of people in it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best thing [a child] could possibly do is to learn to get along with everybody, because that\u2019s just part of life.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Hate Race is published by Hachette.

  "<p>Higher levels of physical activity can achieve bigger reductions in the risk of five common chronic diseases, but only if people engage in levels far above the recommended minimum exertion, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i3857\">a study has suggested</a>.</p> <p>An analysis of 174 studies found that gardening, household chores and more strenuous activities, when done in sufficient quantities, were strongly associated with a lower risk of stroke and of contracting breast and bowel cancer, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/diabetes\">diabetes</a> and heart disease.</p> <p>But researchers from the US and Australia concluded that for the biggest risk reductions, total physical activity per week should be five to seven times the minimum level recommended by the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>At present, the WHO recommends that people conduct at least 600 metabolic equivalent minutes (Met minutes) of physical activity \u2013 the equivalent of 150 minutes a week of brisk walking or 75 minutes of running.

Their ancestors are buried in the land; there are hundreds of unique sites of cultural importance; there is cultural knowledge of how to live on land that is associated with this specific spot.\u201d </p> <p>Many continue to rely on the land to hunt, fish, plant medicines, gather berries and conduct ceremonies. \u201cThere are really few other places where they can go to practice their culture and to exercise their rights because this is a region that has been so heavily impacted by large-scale resource development.\u201d </p> <p>Amid protests by several First Nations groups, the project was approved by provincial and federal authorities in 2014, allowing preparatory work to begin last summer. Earlier this year, as clear-cutting began in the area, part of the construction was held up by a protest camp set up by indigenous activists. </p> <p>\u201cThis is home,\u201d said Helen Knott, one of the half a dozen protesters who occupied the site. \u201cThe rivers are the arteries of the Earth. When we block them up, the earth becomes unhealthy.

The project is also expected to generate some 10,000 construction jobs and another 33,000 direct and indirect jobs. </p> <p>Late last month, the federal government, led by Justin Trudeau, quietly issued the necessary approvals to move forward with the project, granting BC Hydro permission to block the river and flood the valley.

  "<p>David Florence became the latest in an increasingly long line of genuine British medal hopefuls to endure a dreadful day at the office, finishing dead last in the final of the canoe slalom and missing out on victory by a titanic margin of more than 14 seconds.</p> <p>A series of consecutive downstream blunders just before the halfway point ruined any chance the 33-year-old Scotsman had of making the podium and adding to the consecutive silvers he won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\" title=\"\">at Beijing 2008</a> and \u2013 in the C2 with Richard Hounslow \u2013 London 2012. The French paddler Denis Gargaud Chanut took gold, conquering the white waters of the course in a time of 94.17sec, beating the early clubhouse leader, Matej Benus, from Slovakia by less than a second.</p> <p>A race against the clock through a combination of 24 up- and downstream gates suspended over a choppy course, canoe slalom challenges competitors to work with the flow of water while maintaining their trajectory, balance and speed on assorted eddies, stoppers and waves. Time penalties of two seconds are incurred for touching a gate, while missing one altogether results in a 50-second race-ender. The combined score of time and penalties determines the finishing order of the contest and Florence\u2019s four ricks meant he stopped the clock at exactly 109sec, scant reward for the six reconnaissance missions he made to Rio since finishing first in the test event in November.</p> <p>With his hands clasped in repose on the waterproof spraydeck stretched across the cockpit of his vessel and his paddle balanced in front of him as he floated on the water and calmly surveyed the big screen broadcasting footage of one rival after another finishing far more quickly than he had, Florence certainly did not have the air about of him of a man who had completely blown his latest chance of winning Olympic gold. It is the one glaring omission on a jam-packed CV, but there were no tears or tantrums; at least not from him.</p> <p>As soon as Gargaud Chanut was confirmed the winner, Florence was first to paddle across the holding area where he and his rivals were convened to congratulate his weeping Japanese rival Takuya Haneda, who was overcome with emotion having taken bronze.</p> <p>Florence\u2019s quiet calm appeared to belie an inner turmoil to rival the choppy waters that had got the better of him. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to go to the Olympics very often. London was very disappointing and today was very disappointing. Hopefully, in a couple of days it won\u2019t be as disappointing, but who knows?\u201d</p> <p>Having qualified with such ease from his heat for the semi-final that he decided to forego the option of a second run in order to conserve energy for Monday\u2019s C2 team qualifier with Hounslow, Florence had finished a lowly seventh of 14 competitors duking it out to make the 10-man final. A mistake soon after he left the starting gate cost him three or four seconds, but thereafter his split times were as good as any of his rivals. The hope was he had kept his powder dry for when it really mattered, but a mid-table finish in qualifying proved as good as his day was going to get.</p> <p>\u201cYou get pretty used to disappointment in sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the three guys on the podium that had the potential to be there. Unfortunately, you generally don\u2019t win them all. Even the guys, the leaders of our sport have had huge disappointments. That is an accepted part of it. I was a bit tight on the first gate of a difficult three-gate sequence and it was unrecoverable from there. It left me so low. Unfortunately, I cannot afford to make a mistake like that.\u201d</p> <p>Florence, the current world champion, is a tremendously interesting character. Born in Aberdeen, he first began paddling canoes as a 14-year-old on the Union Canal in Leith where, rather than steering a wide berth of dangling poles, his early schooling in the discipline of slalom involved avoiding the fishing lines of irate anglers and assorted random canal detritus including, on one occasion, a submerged car. Having obtained a degree in mathematical physics from Nottingham University, he set about winning World Cup events and world championships before qualifying for the Beijing Olympics. Around the same time he applied for a job that would almost certainly have curtailed his burgeoning career as a canoeist, given the extreme paucity of water in the working environment where astronauts ply their trade.

Raiola and his lawyer, Rafaela Pimenta, have been formidable opponents like no others United have encountered in recent years.</p> <p>In comparison the negotiations between United and Juventus have been relatively straightforward. The structure of the deal was argued out in the course of two meetings between Woodward and Andrea Agnelli, the Juventus president, both of which were strategically held away from Turin and Manchester to avoid more publicity. The two clubs get on well and United were led to believe from an early stage that Juventus were willing to do business as long as the price was right.</p> <p>David de Gea\u2019s decision to remain in Manchester, heavily influenced by Louis van Gaal\u2019s departure and the arrival of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, has further strengthened United\u2019s position bearing in mind Madrid\u2019s long-standing desire to recruit the Spain international goalkeeper. The defender Eric Bailly\u2019s arrival from Villarreal means United have signed all four of their transfer targets before the season starts, in stark contrast to some of their more disappointing summers since Ferguson\u2019s retirement, and the fact that has happened when the club cannot offer prospective new signings Champions League football is being seen within Old Trafford as a significant victory. That does not lessen any embarrassment about the fact they let Pogba leave as a free agent four years ago \u2013 his grievances at the time relating to his lack of first-team opportunities and the relatively low pay on offer \u2013 and some awkward questions clearly remain now new information has emerged about United\u2019s scouts encouraging the club to re-sign him within 12 months of his move to Juventus.</p> <p>However, the decision not to offer Pogba better pay in 2012 was taken by a different regime, with David Gill as chief executive and Ferguson the manager, and the player clearly does not hold a grudge. On the contrary it is said not to have featured at all in any of the discussions. United have seen it as an advantage that Pogba still has friends at the club as well as in the city.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/stormzy-and-laundry-ladies-the-new-face-of-transfer-announcements\">Stormzy and laundry ladies: the new face of transfer announcements</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What United have been able to offer is a stable environment, a serial trophy-getter as their manager and a newly assembled side that will begin the season as genuine candidates for the Premier League title.</p> <p>While Madrid have a formidable pull of their own, as the 11-time European Cup winners, the feeling at Old Trafford is that several factors made this a rare defeat for the Spaniards. First there is the fact that Pogba would have been joining a club who are facing the probability of a one-year transfer ban. The presidential elections tend to create more instability at the Bernab\u00e9u and Pogba, as Mourinho has alluded to, would inevitably have been in Ronaldo\u2019s shadow. It also helped United\u2019s cause that the player is fond of Manchester, knowing better than to be put off by the traditional lines about damp weather and the lack of a beach.</p> <p>For United that means a happy ending to a chase that might never have been necessary had Pogba\u2019s first spell with the club not unravelled so acrimoniously.</p> <p>Ferguson once claimed the Frenchman had left Old Trafford \u201cnot showing us any respect at all\u201d and the lingering bad feeling certainly counted against Pogba when David Moyes was in charge.</p> <p>Pogba was available for \u00a365m at the time but Ferguson\u2019s successor was led to believe the player might always have a restless streak. What did it say for his personality, Moyes wondered, that he wanted to leave Old Trafford at the age of 19 and had spent much of his time at Juventus apparently contemplating another transfer?</p> <p>Van Gaal was another admirer but decided the money would be better spent elsewhere whereas the difference is that Mourinho, having tried unsuccessfully to sign Pogba for Chelsea last summer, was absolutely adamant that this was the player he wanted more than anybody else.</p> <p>\u201cHe looks like a kid who is back to his old school finding people he cares about and who love him a lot,\u201d Mourinho said of his new player. \u201cAfter a couple of days he will feel like he never left the club.\u201d</p>",

He said UN aid could be supplied within 24 to 48 hours of a ceasefire being agreed.</p> <p>On Monday, the UN security council was told by two American doctors, recently returned from treating children in Aleppo\u2019s bombarded hospitals, that the city had become a \u201chell\u201d, with children dying under a bombardment that left them without the most basic medical supplies. Graphic pictures and testimony of the children maimed by the Syrian air force were shown to the diplomats, in a bid to persuade them to find a solution to the five-year war. In July there were at least 10 confirmed attacks on health facilities in Aleppo city.</p> <p>In a sign of how far apart the US and Russia remain, Russia\u2019s deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov condemned the \u201claments and wails about the deplorable humanitarian situation\u201d as a tactic, adding it was getting in the way of the real political priorities: \u201cThe propaganda and the emotional rhetoric, the unfounded accusations, the information campaign, means that we cannot move toward a political settlement in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>He said the main cause of humanitarian problems in Syria was not the \u201ccounterterrorist\u201d actions by the legitimate government of Syria but the short sighted democratisation policy of the US, supported by other western governments, which has led to destabilisation of a whole region.</p> <p>He claimed the US had failed to make good on a February promise to draw a clear distinction between \u201cterrorists\u201d and moderate rebels. \u201cWe still do not know where the moderate opposition and where the terrorists are located. The reason is there is a major temptation to use terrorists to achieve the west\u2019s geopolitical plans for Syria.\u201d</p> <p>In a bid to restart the talks US secretary of state John Kerry met Vladimir Putin in mid-July to propose a deal whereby the Syrian air force ended its lethal bombing campaign in return for American agreement that one of the leading rebel forces \u2013 the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front \u2013 be designated a terrorist group, and so no longer party to a new ceasefire. American sponsored rebel forces have long been entangled with al-Nusra, and many Washington-backed forces would regard an attack on al-Nusra as an attack on the Syrian revolution itself.</p> <p>The US proposal has been made more complex by the announcement last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">al-Nursra had \u201cbroken\u201d with al-Qaida</a>, and was now forming a new group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Western diplomats doubt the sincerity of this change in ideology. </p> <p>But Washington seems reluctant to denounce this new group as a bogus rebranding, partly because it knows so many of the already weak rebel groups it does support are willing, or even eager, to work with the effective and disciplined al-Nusra forces. Many of these moderate forces feel abandoned by the west. </p> <p>At the UN session on Monday, Clarissa Ward, a celebrated CNN war correspondent, also warned Russia was playing into the hands of jihadists.

Slowly it was established that, overwhelmingly, those who had come by boat were not \u201cqueue jumpers\u201d or criminals or terrorists (a claim regularly made by ministers, despite being refuted by the government\u2019s own national security chief) but rather people fleeing genuine persecution and who were owed protection. Most were resettled, and mostly in Australia.

They can do it, it\u2019s allowed.</p> <p>\u201cBut we take great enjoyment from beating this team, especially in the Olympic Games where you come to represent your country in that spirit,\u201d said Valentin Porte, a 25-year-old right-back who plays his club handball for Montpellier.</p> <p>\u201cThe handball fans are happy when Qatar are beaten because they have that spirit. We play for the love of the game; they play for the money. Everyone has their own view of it.\u201d</p> <p>Others are a bit more reticent, preferring to let their hands do the talking. France\u2019s captain and goalkeeper Vincent Gerard said afterwards: \u201cWe concentrate on the players we\u2019re playing against. That\u2019s how the rules are.\u201d</p> <p>There is a multitude of wider issues at play here that would take a whole book to unpack.</p> <p>But in purely sporting terms the gut-feel test is often a surprisingly effective one. Along the continuum of nationality laws, football sits at one end and sports such as volleyball and handball at the other.</p> <p>Qatar would not be able to do what they have done in handball for the 2022 football World Cup, hence their much longer-term plan involving the Aspire Academy to, they claim, develop their own talent.</p> <p>It is never going to be a black and white debate, as the so-called \u201cPlastic Brits\u201d row before the last Olympics proved. The table tennis competition here is stacked full of Chinese players who have taken up citizenship elsewhere, while the track and field competition next week will throw up more troubling examples.</p> <p>But when almost an entire team is made up of naturalised players, questions are bound to be asked about why a federation is effectively encouraging the practice of switching nations for cash.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s bizarre handball world championships in Doha might provide part of the answer.</p> <p>There Qatar stormed to the final amid a string of controversial refereeing decisions. From the stands they were cheered on by a contingent of Spanish handball fans who had enjoyed an all-expenses paid jaunt to Doha on condition that they backed the home team.</p> <p>It was just one event in a jaw-dropping run of international sporting events across almost every Olympic sport that has characterised Qatar\u2019s dash for success.</p> <p>Yann Hildwein, a journalist for L\u2019Equipe who specialises in handball and volleyball, feels uncomfortable about Qatar\u2019s brazen shopping spree but says the situation is more complex than it might first appear. \u201cThere is respect for the players on the court and the coaches. But this is not the national team. I don\u2019t think the international federation care about that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Roine, though, he points out that when he moved to Qatar in 2013 he could not get a contract in the French first division. \u201cFor him, it has worked out. I can see why he did it. Of course it will be strange during the anthems,\u201d Hildwein says.</p> <p>The squad, all of whom play their club handball in Qatar, hail variously from Bosnia, Montenegro, Croatia and Cuba. Many have previously played for other nations. All make a far better living in the Gulf than they might at home.</p> <p>Some, such as the Egypt-born pivot Hassen Mabrouk, have even played in the Olympics before for other countries.</p> <p>Some of the other players on the Qatar side are from countries perhaps unlikely to ever qualify a handball team for the Olympics. Ameen Zakkar, for example, is from Syria.</p> <p>\u201cNobody thinks about naturalisation. This is a question for journalists. But we want to play handball, nothing else,\u201d said Saric, the former Barcelona goalkeeper who now faces a crucial match against Tunisia on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can you get in Europe that you can\u2019t get in Qatar? It\u2019s sunny all the time,\u201d he added, perhaps a touch defensively. Roine told French journalists afterwards that it was a \u201cdream\u201d to play in the Olympics and that he was very happy to be there. But pulling away afterwards on the team bus, he looked a little sad.</p>",
  "<p>The world can cope with 7 or even 10 billion people. But only if we stop eating meat. Livestock farming is the most potent means by which we amplify our presence on the planet. It is the amount of land an animal-based diet needs that makes it so destructive.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/can-britain-feed-itself\">analysis by the farmer and scholar Simon Fairlie </a>suggests that Britain could easily feed itself within its own borders. But while a diet containing a moderate amount of meat, dairy and eggs would require the use of 11m hectares of land (4m of which would be arable), a vegan diet would demand a total of just 3m. Not only do humans need no pasture, but we use grains and pulses more efficiently when we eat them ourselves, rather than feed them to cows and chickens.</p> <p>This would enable 15m hectares of the land now used for farming in Britain to be set aside for nature. Alternatively, on a vegan planet, Britain could feed 200 million people. Extending this thought experiment to the rest of the world, it\u2019s not hard to see how gently we could tread if we stopped keeping animals. Rainforests, savannahs, wetlands, magnificent wildlife can live alongside us, but not alongside our current diet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We believe we can solve the ethical problems by switching to free-range meat and eggs.

But extensive farming, almost by definition, does greater harm to the planet: more land is needed to rear the same amount of food.

Last September I arranged to spend a day beside the River Culm in Devon, renowned for its wildlife and beauty. However, the stretch I intended to explore had been reduced to a stinking ditch, almost lifeless except for some sewage fungus. I traced the pollution back to a dairy farm.

They told me they had been instructed to disregard all incidents of this kind. The cause, they believed, was political pressure from the government.</p> <p>That did it. Why, I reasoned, should I support an industry the government refuses to regulate? Since then, I have cut almost all animal products from my diet. I\u2019m not religious about it. If I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house I might revert to vegetarianism. If I\u2019m away from home, I will take a drop of milk in my tea. About once a fortnight I have an egg for my breakfast, perhaps once a month a fish I catch, or a herring or some anchovies (if you eat fish, take them from the bottom of the food chain). Perhaps three or four times a year, on special occasions, I will eat farmed meat: partly out of greed, partly because I don\u2019t want to be even more of a spectre at the feast than I am already. This slight adaptation, I feel, also reduces the chances of a relapse.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/27/why-i-ate-a-roadkill-squirrel\">I still eat roadkill </a>when I can find it, and animals killed as agricultural pests whose bodies might otherwise be dumped. At the moment, while pigeons, deer, rabbits and squirrels are so abundant in this country and are being killed for purposes other than meat production, eating the carcasses seems to be without ecological consequence. Perhaps you could call me a pestitarian.</p> <p>Even so, such meals are rare. My rough calculation suggests that 97% of my diet now consists of plants. I eat plenty of pulses, seeds and nuts and heaps of vegetables. That almost allows me to join the<a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/news/find-out-how-many-vegans-are-great-britain\"> 500,000 people in Britain who are full vegans</a> \u2013 but not quite. Of course, these choices also have impacts, but they are generally far lower than those of meat, dairy and eggs. Paradoxically, if you want to eat less soya, eat soya directly: eating animal products tends to mean consuming far more of this crop, albeit indirectly. Almost all the soya grown where rainforests once stood is used to feed animals. Replacing meat with soya reduces the clearance of natural vegetation, per kilogram of protein, by 96%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/parents-raising-vegan-babies\">Meet the parents raising vegan babies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After almost a year on this diet, I have dropped from 12 stone to 11.

Yields fall when the prices of bonds rise and push down the rate at which the government pays to borrow from major City investors. </p> <p>Yields on 20-year gilts slumped to 1.2%, while those on 30-year bonds fell to 1.36%, in the anticipation that the Bank will hike the price it is prepared to pay investors to buy back the gilts.</p> <p>Daniela Russell, a bond strategist at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said: \u201cIt is going to be interesting to see how the Bank of England responds.\u201d</p> <p>While Threadneedle Street could increase the price, it could also decide to increase the amount of gilts it attempts to buy at next week\u2019s buying window. </p> <p>The fact the buyback has begun during the traditionally quiet month of August may explain the low result, bond experts said, adding that it was too early to conclude that pension funds \u2013 the traditional buyers of such long-dated gilts \u2013 were reluctant to sell.</p> <p>Stuart Edwards, a global bond fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, said he was not overly concerned by the shortfall. He pointed out that a buyback of shorter-dated bonds the previous day had been \u201cwell covered\u201d \u2013 the Bank received offers of more than three times the amount it wanted to buy.</p> <p>There are two ideas behind the Bank buying the bonds: to stimulate economic demand by encouraging the banks and financial institutions selling the gilts to use the proceeds to boost lending to households and businesses or invest in other assets; and to force down the cost of borrowing for the government by increasing demand for bonds, thus increasing their price.</p> <p>The latest QE plan is part of a four-pronged strategy to tackle an expected slowdown in the economy caused by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">the vote to leave the EU</a>. </p> <p>Along with the cut to interest rates, the Bank is also creating another \u00a310bn in electronic cash to buy corporate bonds. It is also trying to encourage banks to pass on the interest rate cut by offering as much as \u00a3100bn of new funding to banks. Under this \u201cterm funding scheme\u201d, the Bank will create new money to provide loans to banks at interest rates close to the base rate of 0.25%. </p> <p>The Bank has admitted that rates could fall to as low as 0.1% \u2013 but not zero or negative \u2013 if the economy falters. There could also be further QE. </p> <p>The Bank launched QE, announcing \u00a375bn of newly created money to buy bonds, when it also cut interest rates to a then record low of 0.5% in 2009. Over the following three years it expanded QE five times, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/05/bank-of-england-50bn-more-quantitative-easing\">hitting \u00a3375bn in July 2012</a> when the UK faced a prolonged double-dip recession.</p>",
  "<p>Some Republicans fear Donald Trump is reaching the point of no return as party stalwarts turn against him and his national poll numbers continue to plunge.<br></p> <p>Susan Collins of Maine, the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, on Monday announced her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/susan-collins-donald-trump-washington-post-op-ed-republican\">intention not to vote for her party\u2019s nominee</a>, while 50 of the GOP\u2019s former national security officials signed an open letter calling Trump the most reckless candidate in history.</p> <p>Opinion polls show Hillary Clinton consolidating a significant lead. A Fox News survey shows her up by 10 percentage points; <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clintons-lead-over-donald-trump-widens-to-9-points-poll-shows-1470347810?mod=wsj_streaming_latest-headlines\">an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> puts her nine points ahead; and a Washington Post/ABC News survey gives her a margin of eight points.

There\u2019s still a week to go until we reach that point, but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s going to move 10 points.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Three weeks after the conventions, the candidate leading the polls usually wins</p> <footer> <cite>Rick Tyler, former spokesman for Ted Cruz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are growing signs that Republicans who sense Trump cannot win might move to ostracise him, whether out of principle or self-preservation or both. Tyler added: \u201cThe peeling off is remarkable. You have a conservative, Ted Cruz, and now the most moderate Republican in the Senate, Susan Collins, not endorsing Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very problematic. You have Republicans on both ends of the spectrum distancing themselves from Trump. It represents an ideological schism; the party is substantially divided.\u201d</p> <p>A generation after the so-called \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d ensured a landslide victory for Ronald Reagan, some commentators now speculate that \u201cClinton Republicans\u201d could produce a similarly one-sided result, putting once safe states such as Arizona and Georgia into play.</p> <p>Collins, who is not seeking re-election this year, is the sixth out of 54 Senate Republicans to say they will not vote for Trump. She explained that the tipping point in her decision was his recent attacks on the family of fallen US army captain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Humayun Khan</a>. \u201cHe does not have the restraint and the consideration and the judgment and the knowledge to handle those dangerous events with which presidents are inevitably confronted,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/politics/sen-susan-collins-explains-opposition-to-donald-trump-says-he-will-make-the-world-more-dangerous/index.html\">Collins told CNN</a>.</p> <p>The senator, a close ally of Senate colleague John McCain, added that she would not vote for Clinton but had yet to decide whether to vote for the Libertarian party or write in a name on the ballot paper. \u201cI have always supported my party\u2019s nominee. That\u2019s what made this decision so difficult, but in the end I just cannot support Donald Trump. I do not believe that he is the president that we need at this time in our country\u2019s history and I believe that in many ways he is antithetical to the values of the Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>Following hard upon the joint letter from former national security officials, it was the last thing Trump needed as he tried to get his campaign back on track with a speech in Detroit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">setting out his economic platform</a>. This followed a wretched run of gaffes following a Republican national convention last month that had been billed as a moment of party unity.</p> <p>Instead, the trickle of defections threatens to turn into a stampede. Meg Whitman, the technology executive and former Republican candidate for governor in California, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/meg-whitman-endorses-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">is backing Clinton</a>. On Tuesday, William Ruckelshaus and William Reilly, former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency under Republican presidents, also endorsed the Democrat.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans have a long history of support for the environment dating back to Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cDonald Trump threatens to destroy that legacy of respect for the environment and protection of public health ... That is why as Republicans, we support Hillary Clinton for president.\u201d</p> <p>Four Republican former secretaries of state \u2013 James Baker, Henry Kissinger, Condoleezza Rice and George Shultz \u2013 have yet to announce their intentions. None responded to requests for comment from the Guardian on Tuesday.</p> <p>And Republicans facing tight congressional races in November are weighing whether to back or sack Trump. <a href=\"http://coffman.house.gov/\">Colorado congressman Mike Coffman</a> has launched a TV advert in which he promises to \u201cstand up\u201d to the nominee. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018What do you think about Trump?\u2019\u201d the Iraq war veteran says. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t care for him much.\u201d</p> <p>But some in the party argue that the divisions cannot be blamed on Trump alone. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the Guardian via email: \u201cThe cracks have been there a long time. If Trump were not the nominee you would still have tensions, they would just manifest differently (as we saw in 2012).</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s strongest argument is, \u2018the ones who are not supporting me are the very ones who created the mess I\u2019m trying to fix\u2019. There will be more defections \u2013 likely by people who didn\u2019t support Trump in the first place. For Trump he now has to figure out how to navigate around those headlines \u2013 not be creating negative ones of his own \u2013 and resecure his base support and grow it with independent voters he may have lost in the past week.\u201d</p> <p>George Ajjan, a Republican strategist, said: \u201cAs bad as the Republican convention was for Trump, he still managed to get a bounce. This suggests that there is a broad constituency for Trump\u2019s anti-establishment brand of politics, which should not be underestimated. </p> <p>\u201cBut the infighting is a major distraction. Normally a candidate seeks endorsements from neutral figures outside of his party. Clinton is doing this successfully but Trump\u2019s energy is wasted on internal rebellion. To be fair, some of these defections on the part of senators in close races reflect their own self-preservation instincts and not necessarily a systemic breakdown of party unity.</p> <p>\u201cA worst-case scenario would be a third party plucking away a prominent former Republican senator or governor as its [presidential] nominee in a bid to steal away disgruntled establishment voters. That would mean open war and a total collapse of party unity.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, a former CIA agent, Evan McMullin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">launched an independent run</a> for president in the hope of offering conservatives an alternative to Trump. He has already missed the deadline to get on the ballot in numerous states, but, as a Mormon from Utah, could hurt Trump among Republicans there.</p> <p>Even three months out, some pundits believe it is all over bar the shouting. Stuart Rothenberg, an analyst and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/09/donald-trump-needs-a-miracle-to-win/\">wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cThree months from now, with the 2016 presidential election in the rear-view mirror, we will look back and agree that the presidential election was over on Aug. 9th.</p> <p>\u201cA dispassionate examination of the data, combined with a cold-blooded look at the candidates, the campaigns and presidential elections, produces only one possible conclusion: Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump in November, and the margin isn\u2019t likely to be as close as Barack Obama\u2019s victory over Mitt Romney.\u201d</p> <p>But one recent ray of light for Trump came when he was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/07/politics/george-p-bush-donald-trump-jeb-bush\">endorsed by George P Bush</a>, the Texas land commissioner and son of former candidate Jeb Bush, who clashed bitterly with Trump during the Republican primaries. </p> <p>And Trump\u2019s campaign can still hope that he will be viewed as the lesser of two evils by those who have long been hostile to Clinton. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief strategist, issued an email headed \u201cWe Can\u2019t Afford The Consequences Of A Clinton Presidency\u201d, which spent 10 paragraphs attacking her record and only mentioned Trump in the final sentence.</p> <p>The nominee himself suggested on Tuesday there would be no major shift of strategy. \u201cI think it\u2019s just, you know, steadiness,\u201d Trump told Fox Business. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain\u2019s leading economic thinktanks has said the UK economy shrank last month as the impact of the Brexit vote led to a pronounced weakening in activity.</p> <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% in July.</p> <p>Niesr published the findings after official government figures showed that the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uktradejune2016\">UK trade deficit widened</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/ukindexofproductionjune2016\">factory production eased back</a> in the weeks immediately before and after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-referendum-the-vote-is-in-now-we-must-face-the-consequences\">EU referendum on 23 June</a>. </p> <p>James Warren, a research fellow at Niesr, said: \u201cWe estimate that in the three months to July, the UK economy grew by 0.3%, a marked economic slowdown. The month-on-month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The thinktank came to a gloomy conclusion after data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that a spurt in manufacturing came to an end in June, with output dropping by 0.3%. Meanwhile, UK exports failed to match imports, with the trade deficit rising by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a35.1bn.</p> <p>The poor trade and manufacturing figures led to a fall in the pound on the foreign exchanges. At one stage, sterling dipped below $1.30 and threatened to reach a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">post-Brexit vote low</a>, before later rallying.</p> <p>However the ONS said there was little evidence of industry adopting a cautious approach because of uncertainty caused by the closely fought referendum campaign. The organisation\u2019s chief economist, Joe Grice, said: \u201cAs we previously highlighted in our preliminary estimate of GDP, production and the wider economy grew strongly in April, and then remained at roughly the same level throughout May and June. </p> <p>\u201cAny uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had little impact on production, with very few respondents to our surveys reporting it as an issue.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ONS said total production, which includes mining, output from the North Sea, energy supply and manufacturing, increased by 0.1% from May to June. Manufacturing, the biggest component of production, fell by 0.3%.</p> <p>During the three months to June \u2013 which is considered a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s figures \u2013 production was up by 2.1% on the previous quarter, while manufacturing rose by 1.8%.</p> <p>Despite the strong quarterly increases, manufacturing and overall production remain well below the peak reached in early 2008, when the UK was on the cusp of a recession. A steady decline in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/17/north-sea-oil-industry-treasury-subsidies\">North Sea oil and gas output</a> means that production is 7.5% below the early 2008 level, while manufacturing is 4.5% lower.</p> <p>The struggles of manufacturing during and after the recession of 2008-09 have made it harder for Britain to close its trade gap with the rest of the world.</p> <p>According to the ONS, there was an increase of \u00a30.9bn to \u00a312.4bn in the UK\u2019s deficit in goods in June, offset by the continued strong performance of the service sector, which ran a surplus of \u00a37.3bn.</p> <p>Between the first and second quarters of 2016, the UK\u2019s deficit in goods and services combined widened by \u00a30.4bn to \u00a312.5bn.<br></p> <p>Lee Hopley, the chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 association EEF, said: \u201cThe latest data suggests manufacturing posted some significant gains in the second quarter. Growth was supported by record levels of exports of cars to the EU and aircraft to non-EU markets.</p> <p> \u201cClearly, indicators of sentiment post referendum suggest that we\u2019ve hit the high point for manufacturing this year. Amid the wavering levels of confidence, however, we should take away some positive news, firstly that manufacturing entered this period of uncertainty from a relatively strong stance, and the weaker exchange rate could yet bring benefits on the export side. </p> <p>\u201cStill, we\u2019ll need a concerted effort from government to maintain investment across the sector and ensure growth like that seen in the second quarter gets back on track.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The UK is home to more online drug dealers than any country in Europe, according to a <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1607.html\">new report</a> that estimates the value of the monthly trade in drugs through darknet markets to be as much as \u00a316m a month globally. </p> <p>British dealers generate more than 16% of the monthly global revenues \u2013 about \u00a31.8m \u2013 across the eight largest marketplaces, taking home an average of \u00a35,200 each, according to research commissioned by the Dutch government. </p> <p>It found that three years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/06/dark-net-drugs\">police in the US seized the Silk Road</a> \u2013 the original online drugs marketplace \u2013 and arrested its founder, the numbers of drug deals taking place in successors to the site had tripled, revenues had doubled and six times as many product listings were available to buyers. </p> <p>Researchers from Rand Europe, working in conjunction with academics from the UK and Canada, in January collected data on drug deals from the eight largest darknet markets, which are Amazon-type online marketplaces that can only be accessed with an encrypted connection. </p> <p>They found that by far the most vendors operated from the US, which hosted 890 drug dealers, with the UK hosting 338. However, British dealers proved to be far busier, averaging almost double the number of transactions each over the month.</p> <p>Germany and the Netherlands were joint third in the numbers of dealers, with 225 each, although Dutch vendors made fewer but, on average, larger transactions and operated in a far smaller jurisdiction. </p> <p>The report says: \u201cThe Netherlands appears to have a substantial concentration of cryptomarket vendor activity (13.4 vendors per million population) in comparison to the United States (2.8 vendors per million population) and the United Kingdom (5.3 vendors per million population).\u201d</p> <p>The study found that cryptomarkets had grown substantially \u201cbut not explosively\u201d since Silk Road\u2019s takedown. </p> <p>Despite the massive publicity that the darknet has received, its online markets still only attract a niche among drugs consumers. Its \u00a316m upper estimate of global drug revenues compares to an estimated monthly offline market for drugs of about \u00a31.7bn for Europe alone. </p> <p>Stijn Hoorens, project leader for the team behind the report, said: \u201cIt could be explained by some of the challenges that these markets have faced over the years with \u2018exit scams\u2019, [which is] administrators who take their sites offline, saying for maintenance or something \u2026 in some cases they have just left with all bitcoins that were held in escrow. That has affected trust between the users of the cryptomarkets and the operators.\u201d </p> <p>However, the research also found evidence that darknet drugs sales may have a role in supplying offline drug markets, with dealers buying stock wholesale for distribution. A quarter of the drug sales were for listings worth more than $1,000 (\u00a3768), the team found, suggesting that these shipments may have been bought for resale. </p> <p>A further important finding of the study was that most sales and revenues were generated within continents, rather than from sales between far flung jurisdictions, Hoorens said. </p> <p>\u201cThat was somewhat surprising to us, because it\u2019s sometimes claimed that the internet facilitates global trade and I think we\u2019ve shown that, at least thus far, that doesn\u2019t seem to have been the case,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIt seems that the within North America revenues, within Oceania, and within Europe, revenues are much bigger than those between those continents. We can only speculate about why that is the case but I think if you look at the importance of cannabis still on cryptomarkets \u2026 that is often produced locally.\u201d </p> <p>Cannabis dominated the listings that the Rand team found online, making up 37% of listings across marketplaces, followed by stimulants at 29% of listings and ecstasy-type drugs at 19%. Those figures contrasted with European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction estimates for offline drugs sales, which put heroin at 28% of total sales and ecstasy at 3%.</p> <p>The report says: \u201cA possible explanation for these differences between \u2018online\u2019 and \u2018offline\u2019 markets may be that cryptomarket purchases typically require an element of planning, which may not suit the daily use of dependent users of, for instance, heroin.\u201d</p>",

Summer in Sunderland, the totemic leave town, might help clear some things up.</p> <p>The city provided the moment that announced Brexit to the world \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c120CRw_tdw\">the declaration at Sunderland</a> showing 61% of this Labour heartland voting out. Sterling immediately dropped through the floor. One Irish paper christened the city \u201cthe town that broke the pound\u201d. Sunderland had long been politically notable for just one thing \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/apr/27/sunderland-sets-its-sights-on-first-place-in-the-uks-other-election-race\">the rapidity of the council\u2019s ability to count</a> a completely predictable general election result for Labour. In swing terms, the only thing that changed was the margin of the Labour victory. Nothing had altered, in terms of political representation, for a half a century. Within the confines of our electoral system, large swaths of the UK \u2013 cities such as Sunderland \u2013 did not matter politically. That changed on 23 June, and spectacularly so.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c120CRw_tdw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c120CRw_tdw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c120CRw_tdw\">Sunderland votes in favour of leaving the EU \u2013 on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Three themes come up repeatedly among leave voters. The promise to save the NHS, migration and trust in Boris Johnson. I meet a former social worker, Shirley Bain, who says that her family\u2019s personal reliance on the NHS meant she was very influenced by the promises to divert EU funding. \u201cIt hit home with me because I\u2019m using the NHS quite a lot at the minute. My son is really, really poorly in hospital and has been in and out since May.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a liver transplant and it went wrong, stuff like that \u2013 and where would I have been if I\u2019d had to pay upfront for that? I know I\u2019ve paid with my taxes because I\u2019ve worked all my life. I just think that some of the money we are putting into the EU for other things could be put back into our own NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley invites me to a community centre where she volunteers, which recently had its funding for youth services cut. The \u00a3350m a week could also help reopen them, she says.</p> <p>Fellow volunteer Peta McDowall, a remain voter, suggests to her the figure was a lie. Peta considers herself a product of Europe \u2013 her parents arrived during the Spanish civil war and she attended university in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was about politics. I think the people who are in Brexit are idiots. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean you, Shirley, I mean the head people. When I found out who was our minister for world affairs [Boris Johnson], it\u2019s a joke.\u201d Shirley seems genuinely worried that the \u00a3350m number might not be true. She resolves to charter a bus with Peta from the north-east to meet the new foreign secretary. \u201cI would go mad if this money doesn\u2019t go into the NHS, I will go mad. I want to be assured that this money \u2013 because that\u2019s why I voted to come out,\u201d says Shirley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"236fc3ad8163996f8cea45ff62817582df5574ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236fc3ad8163996f8cea45ff62817582df5574ab/0_117_2048_1419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sunderland voters: Shirley (right), who voted Leave, and Peta (left), who voted Remain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If that \u00a3350m doesn\u2019t go to the NHS, I will go mad.

They thought this is a chance for them to hear our voice,\u201d he says. His wife, Theresa, says that council cutbacks played a big part. John is a rare thing in this city \u2013 a Conservative. But on this occasion, his vote mattered.</p> <p>On the night, when the presumption had been that remain would win, Conservative cabinet ministers started to report a similar phenomenon. \u201cLabour\u201d wards in Tory safe seats, where no party would bother to visit during a general election, were seeing massive turnout. Overall, 2.8m more votes were cast on 23 June than at the general election last year. Turnout spiked particularly in strongly leave areas. In the north-east, Hartlepool (70% leave) saw turnout up by 9%, as did Sunderland. Middlesborough (66% leave) saw turnout up by 12%.</p> <p>Just under 20,000 of those new voters were in Sunderland. One of them, Melanie Jordison, a travel agent, was in the Colliery. \u201cIt was something very real. A choice to stay or leave \u2013 and both had impacts, whereas in general elections there is no impact, so I thought it a good opportunity to make Britain great again,\u201d she says. She is expecting cheaper food, gas and oil, and wants to close down the borders \u201ca little bit\u201d because \u201cfar too many immigrants [are] coming in taking our resources. We can\u2019t afford to feed our own.\u201d</p> <p>The main story on the leave side has been of a left-behind Britain of ignored white middle-class voters who wanted control over borders back and were inured to David Cameron\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d economic scaremongering. On the remain side, Sunderland became the symbol of a Labour heartland encouraged to shoot itself in the foot, with a gun handed to them by Conservative cabinet ministers and loaded with lies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jul/06/sunderland-echo-wrong-to-demand-an-apology-from-the-new-york-times\">Sunderland Echo wrong to demand an apology from the New York Times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Politics defies simple narratives most of the time, and spectacularly so right now. I meet leavers completely relaxed about immigration. Car workers who voted out. Fishing industry workers who voted remain.</p> <p>If politics was done solely by numbers, there should have been no contest in the north-east. The region is the most dependent on EU funding of any English region \u2013 from the new aquatics centre on the old colliery site, to the university near the old shipyards, and the very fish quay building from where the fisherman lament the EU. The leave campaign promised the funding will be maintained, saying it is merely rerouted UK taxpayer funds, but the dependence will move to Westminster to continue this funding.</p> <p>On the signature issue of the Leave campaign \u2013 immigration \u2013 the north-east is the region with the smallest proportion of non-British residents: 3%. Figures from 2014 estimated there to be 40,000 European Union migrants and 42,000 non-EU migrants in the region, out of a total population of 2.5 million.</p> <p>If you concentrate on a place such as Sunderland, the migration crisis is rather stark. At the last census, Sunderland had the fastest rate of depopulation of any UK city. Since the 1980s, 8% of its population has gone. The success of the university in attracting international students has helped stabilise the decline in recent years, but its business model is built on increasing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/uk-population-grew-half-million-net-migration-ons\">net migration numbers</a> that the government found so difficult to defend.</p> <p>At the very least, it is difficult to see how places such as Sunderland will be greatly affected by less EU migration, when the numbers are very small by the standards of a British city. On the other hand, any risk to the terms of trade between the UK and the remaining EU will hit the north-east first: in per-capita terms, it does more trade with the EU than any other English region. The north-east appears to be shouldering a disproportionate amount of the economic risk of a badly negotiated Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5f9ad59614c6a05ead3c60aabef28b6fdd9605\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5f9ad59614c6a05ead3c60aabef28b6fdd9605/0_154_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the production line at the Nissan plant in Sunderland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland,\u2019 says one Leave voter \u2013 but Nissan have said its future depends on how Brexit plays out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But politics is not done by numbers these days, still less by experts. For starters, there was little perception of any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/nissan-warns-sunderland-uk-car-plant-hinges-brexit-talks\">risk to the Nissan plant</a>. Back at the fishing quay, the trader buying all the crabs and lobsters, Alan McLaughlan, asserts: \u201cThat Nissan plant is never, ever going to leave Sunderland. They\u2019ll never, ever get a workforce like they\u2019ve got in Sunderland, never ever.\u201d But perhaps the best example of this are the workers in local supply chains for the industry who voted to leave. James Thoroughgood, a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, voted out despite job concerns, because the EU \u201cneeds to be transparent\u201d. Before the vote, David Cameron had told me directly that Brexit could cause job losses at Nissan and that it would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d. Thoroughgood says such warnings were ignored: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing at all, and you are offered to stay where we are because we don\u2019t know what is around the corner, people with nothing will go around the corner every time. What have they got to lose? I think there are lot of people in this area like that.\u201d</p> <p>Vote Leave felt sufficiently confident that it even put Nissan\u2019s logo on its leaflets, despite the threat of court action. But the risk is apparent. The history of the plant is difficult to escape. It only exists because <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8253169.stm\">Margaret Thatcher went to Japan in 1982</a> and visited the Nissan chiefs, personally assuring them of access for their cars to an embryonic British invention \u2013 Europe\u2019s single market. She then went into battle for Nissan against French and Italian attempts to block tariff-free exports of the Sunderland-produced Nissan Bluebird. She helped establish the Nissan as a European car, designed for export into Europe and getting around strict quotas for Japanese imports in the face of French opposition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/05/nissan-warns-sunderland-uk-car-plant-hinges-brexit-talks\">Nissan warns future of UK car plant hinges on Brexit talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most influential businessmen in the city\u2019s history will only talk to me off the record. He is flabbergasted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\">the government\u2019s Brexit team</a> is even contemplating leaving the single market. They have to if they want full immigration controls. And yet the impact of that extra border control will probably be mainly felt in London and the bigger cities \u2013 and, mainly, those places did not vote for it.</p> <p>He points me to a song about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/the-northerner/2015/nov/06/jarrow-march-unemployed-1936\">Jarrow Crusade march</a> for jobs, down the road. \u201cIf they don\u2019t give you a decent job, then with my blessing, burn them down.\u201d That was a song from the Geordie side of the Newcastle/Sunderland divide. \u201cThe \u2018them\u2019 here is \u2018London Town\u2019, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done with the leave vote,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>The common thread among everyone I spoke to was that this was a revolt against London, or perhaps, more specifically, the rest of the country becoming like London. Apart from that, the reasons and rationales were many and varied, and not always consistent \u2013 from hospital funding to cutting migration and reopening the pits and the yards. The Mackem mandate is mixed, whatever claims individual politicians will make for leave. Theresa May has more flexibility in defining Brexit than many, including she, might realise.

  "<p>The Depression was a formative experience for my mother, Jean Wye, who has died aged 94. She turned towards socialism, joining the <a href=\"https://yclbritain.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Young Communist League</a> at 15 where she met her future husband, Bill.<strong> </strong>They bonded during the battle of Cable Street in October 1936, finally marrying in 1955.</p> <p>Jean, who had shivered in bed as a child when her father took away his warming greatcoat to go to work, was determined to change society, and her own prospects. She did both, educating herself with the help of the Manchester Guardian at the library, and joining the Young Communist League and the socialist Clarion Cycling Club.</p> <p>She always remembered her birthday ride on 3 September 1939, when the cyclists stopped at a cafe and the bun she was eating \u201cturned to straw in my mouth\u201d as the prime minister concluded: \u201cThis country is now at war with Germany.\u201d</p> <p>Jean was born in Battersea, south-west London, to Jack Gregory and his wife, Daisy (nee Walsh). Jack served in the Royal Navy before becoming a post office engineer. Educated at Wandsworth Borough Polytechnic, Jean became a secretary, gaining the shorthand and typing qualifications needed to join the Treasury. There she became personal assistant to the economist JM Keynes, with whom she attended the Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944. Keynes and his wife, the Russian dancer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/obituaries/lydia-lopokova-88-ballerina-is-dead.html\" title=\"\">Lydia Lopokova</a>, introduced her to the opera and ballet, and she often went to see the newly formed English National Ballet at Sadler\u2019s Wells.</p> <p>Jean stayed at the Treasury, working for Sir Douglas Wass, with whom she travelled to Berlin during the air lift in 1949. But like so many women of her generation, she stopped work after she married. Bill, an engineer, took up a post advising the RAF in Cyprus in 1956 and, typically adventurous, they drove through postwar Europe, arriving at the height of the Cypriot independence crisis. Jean was temporarily airlifted back to Britain having succumbed to one of several episodes of mental ill health that periodically incapacitated her.</p> <p>She gave birth to her first son, Ben, in Cyprus, at the military hospital in Dhekelia in 1961. The following year she became part of the postwar \u201cnew towns\u201d movement by settling in Hemel Hempstead, where in May 1966 she had a second son, Tim.</p> <p>After Bill\u2019s death in 2007, Jean\u2019s health declined, but she had wonderful memories of the productions she had seen at the Royal Opera House after a day\u2019s work at the Treasury. Her favourite opera was La Boh\u00e8me.</p> <p>She is survived by Tim and me, and by four grandchildren, Jacob, Joseph, Eastre and Hallam.</p>",

Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union. Of course, the politics of extending a favourable deal to non-members does, in some way, defeat the purposes of having a club, so the outcome of such negotiations remain highly uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cAs for trade figures going forward the drop in sterling will have significantly improved the competiveness of our goods and services globally.

  "<p>The Labour party has selected the shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, as its candidate to fight the Greater Manchester mayoral election in May 2017.</p> <p>Burnham won 51% of a vote from party members in the region, beating the area\u2019s police and crime commissioner and interim mayor, Tony Lloyd (29%), and the MP for Bury South, Ivan Lewis, who was a government minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (19.8%). </p> <p>The MP for Leigh won the contest with 3,792 votes to Lloyd\u2019s 2,163 and Lewis\u2019s 1,472, on a turnout of 65.3%. </p> <p>\u201cTo be selected as Labour\u2019s candidate for the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester is a great honour and I thank our members for the faith they have shown in me,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI will repay it by devoting all my energy to uniting the Labour family here, working to win back the voters we have lost and building a policy programme with broad appeal. I will bring forward real answers to our housing crisis and give new hope to our young people. </p> <p>\u201cToday I have a clear message for the prime minister \u2013 you and your party were elected on a series of promises to the north of England and I will not let you walk away from them.

He beat Steve Bedser, a former Birmingham city councillor and local businesman, who won 29%. A total of 3,817 ballots were cast.</p> <p>Simon, another former minister in Brown\u2019s government, campaigned for the city to have an elected mayor before an unsuccessful referendum on the proposal in 2012. He said Labour could do \u201ca better job of running our own region ourselves than the Tories ever have of running it from London\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a West Midlands voice in the Brexit discussions. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the City of London can\u2019t be the only \u2018special interests\u2019 at the table,\u201d said Simon. \u201cThe West Midlands is a \u00a3110bn economy, and it\u2019s one that Whitehall doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Greater Manchester and the West Midlands are Labour strongholds, meaning that Burnham and Simon will be odds-on favourites to win the elections next year. The party will announce its candidate for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/luciana-berger-liverpool-mayor-should-be-global-ambassador-for-city-says-labour-hopeful\">mayor of the Liverpool city region</a>, another Labour-dominated area, on Wednesday.</p> <p>The creation of elected mayors is a condition of devolution arrangements agreed by the former chancellor George Osborne and a series of \u201cmetro\u201d regions, including the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool and Sheffield city regions, the Tees Valley, the north-east, and Greater Lincolnshire.</p> <p>The West Midlands combined authority includes Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton and has a population of about 4 million. The new mayor will have responsibility for transport, adult skills and planning, and will oversee a \u00a31.1bn, 30-year investment fund.</p> <p>The mayor of Greater Manchester, a city region with a population of 3.5 million, which covers Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, will have control over a portfolio of public services, a \u00a3900m, 30-year investment fund and will sit on a board that oversees a devolved \u00a36bn health and social care budget.</p> <p>Voting to select the candidates closed at 12pm on Friday. To be eligible to vote, Labour members were required to live in the relevant city region and have been a member of the party before 19 July 2015, a rule that has excluded a high proportion of the party\u2019s new membership. The poll was conducted using the alternative vote system, and votes were cast by post and online.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 9 August 2016. It originally stated that \u201cAndy Burnham\u2019s win means he will stand down as MP for Leigh\u201d. To clarify, Burnham said he would stand down from his role as an MP if he wins the mayoral election next May. <br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Well, it\u2019s finally here. After two years of beautiful trailers, ambiguous claims and lofty expectations, No Man\u2019s Sky has touched down and opened its blast doors. Judging by its opening hours at least, it is a big, bold and bewildering experience.</p> <p>In my first few minutes, I headed out across my starting planet to find the necessary materials to fix my crashed spaceship, saw my first animal and promptly scared it away when I destroyed the rock it was prancing around, fell down a big hole, was discovered by a sentinel drone, and died.</p> <p>I\u2019m really enjoying No Man\u2019s Sky, so much so that it was very difficult to drag myself away to write this, but my first few hours were a learning process. So here are some things you may want to know before you start your intergalactic journey. Note: I\u2019m playing the PS4 version, so any reference to controls will involve a PS4 controller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4b0997dc7cecc76aad501f216094f447fead085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4b0997dc7cecc76aad501f216094f447fead085/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Space is a dangerous place\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Space is a dangerous place</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1) Keep moving</h2> <p>Space is a dangerous place, and most planets in No Man\u2019s Sky are eventually lethal. Even if the world you\u2019re on has no wildlife, or at least none that\u2019s hostile, it probably has laser-equipped drones flying around it, and it almost definitely has a poisonous or radioactive atmosphere that\u2019s chipping away at your Exosuit defences. While you\u2019re actively playing, it\u2019s hard to forget the atmospheric dangers because of the computer voice that tells you every time the Hazard Protection on your suit loses a chunk of its charge. But it\u2019s all too easy to forget that it\u2019s often not safe just to put your controller down for a few minutes, or that the minerals you must collect to power-up your suit might be many minutes away. If you do want to sit back and admire the scenery, it\u2019s best to find a building or sit in your spaceship.<br></p> <h2>2) The environment is your supermarket</h2> <p>When you first start no Man\u2019s Sky, you need to gather the materials needed to repair and fuel your ship. Everything you see in the environment has some sort of redeemable mineral value \u2013 piles of rocks, plants, chunks of metal \u2013 the HUD will tell you what you\u2019ll get from any article. To collect the goods, just point your MultiTool and shoot \u2013 this will gradually mine the contents. Be careful not to let the mining laser overheat, as this slows you down. Also, be careful not to run out of isotopes \u2013 these are the fuel you need for the laser. If this happens you can actually use the melee button to physical batter ingredients out of rocks or vegetation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c798f013e65d27d57922c96ed6ca15f6ef931077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c798f013e65d27d57922c96ed6ca15f6ef931077/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Upgrade your Multi-Tool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Upgrade your Multi-Tool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Run and gun</h2> <p>Sprint is mapped to R3 (click in the right stick), which isn\u2019t obvious when you begin \u2013 and it feels very unintuitive. Stamina depletes fast, so install the Stamina Enhancement technology as soon as you find it. Master the jet pack too \u2013 large drops will hit your health gauge so get a feel for how long you can stay airborne and make sure you hit the thrusters just before landing.<br></p> <p>Also in \u201ccontrols it took me far too long to figure out\u201d, once you\u2019ve upgraded your Multi-Tool to include a projectile-based Boltcaster (useful for destroying reinforced steel doors, and those bloody sentinel drones) you need to press triangle to switch back to the mining beam. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488118c8f18c4e1b8e5f54c2e4356ff3d385bb74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488118c8f18c4e1b8e5f54c2e4356ff3d385bb74/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trust your ship and ignore the red haze\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trust your ship and ignore the red haze.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Trust your ship</h2> <p>The first time I entered the atmosphere of a new planet I panicked, convinced that the red haze that appeared around the edges of the screen meant my ship was going to blow up \u2013 it\u2019s won\u2019t. In fact, your ship is intelligent enough to correct itself when it gets close to the surface, so you don\u2019t even have to pull up to avoid hitting the ground. Just press square when you get close enough and your ship will land itself.<br></p> <p>One thing you can\u2019t rely on your ship to do is avoid asteroids. Your shield will protect you from too much damage, and you\u2019ll even collect some Thamium, useful for charging your Pulse Engine, but it\u2019s best to fly around them or shoot them for the raw materials. Of course, you don\u2019t have to worry about obstacles when you\u2019re in a Pulse Jump. You don\u2019t even have to steer; just point your cursor at your target, press and hold L1 and R1, and your ship will do the rest, pulling you out of the jump once you get too close to a planet or space station. And if you want to exit Pulse Jump before that point you can: just press L2.<br></p> <h2>5) Upgrade your ship, suit, and tool</h2> <p>I\u2019m pretty attached to the little ship I started with, especially given all the trouble I went through to repair it. But one thing that will easily tempt me to switch is a bigger inventory. Your ship, suit, and Multi-Tool all have a limited number of slots, and each upgrade or item takes one up \u2013 so the more weapons you equip to protect you from pirates the less room you have for cargo.</p> <p>Sometimes you\u2019ll come across crashed ships on the planet surface that have a bigger inventory than yours, and if you\u2019re willing to fix them up they\u2019re an economical way of upgrading. Alternatively, you can sidle up to one of the much bigger ships parked in a space station and ask its owner if they\u2019ll sell, but bigger inventories cost a lot of units.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d6d612df04ad8699ac3f917e96c4800f2757691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d6d612df04ad8699ac3f917e96c4800f2757691/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Exosuit upgrade pod\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Exosuit upgrade pod.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only way I\u2019ve found to get a bigger Exosuit or Multi-Tool involves rummaging around in buildings on the planets themselves. You can find Exosuit upgrades in relatively small pointy pods that contain terminals where you exchange units for a single extra inventory slot. And if an alien asks to see your Multi-Tool, hand it over and they\u2019ll offer a better one (or at least, one with more room for upgrades) in return.</p> <h2>6) Don\u2019t enter a conversation empty-handed</h2> <p>While you have to keep your inventory relatively clear, it\u2019s important to hold on to a few raw materials a) to refuel your ship, and b) in case you need to feed a dying alien. I struck up a conversation with a Korvax only to discover it needed sustenance and I had nothing to offer, at which I was told that the creature had died and a new consciousness been downloaded into its body, and that I had gone down in the estimations of the entire Korvax race.</p> <p>Oh, and interact with every knowledge stone you come across, since they teach you words in alien tongues. Knowing the language helps you to guess what kind of item an alien might be looking for, as well as proving useful when you\u2019re rooting around in an abandoned manufacturing facility and the instructions for how to switch off the alarm are written in Gek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c761923f617efa4cbc85211ffea0f27b1ab50b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c761923f617efa4cbc85211ffea0f27b1ab50b6/62_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Knowing the language helps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Knowing the Gek language helps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Make a quick buck</h2> <p>First things first, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no actual use to the objects with green backgrounds (known as trade items), so just sell those. Inventories are too small for hoarders.</p> <p>Probably the best way to make money, however, especially at first when you\u2019re bound to spend a lot of time looking at all the weird and wonderful animals you come across, is to upload your discoveries. You discover star systems and planets simply by virtue of entering them, but for flora and fauna you have to tag them with the Analysis Visor on your Multi-Tool. Press L2 to bring up the visor, click in the right stick to zoom, and hold it over an object of interest to tag it. Once you\u2019ve discovered a new species, press Options to load up the Discoveries menu, and press square over each one to upload it, or triangle to give it a funny name first.</p> <p>Individual discoveries net you a few hundred or thousand units each, but our intrepid editor Keith Stuart has been working all day to demonstrate that filling in 100% of the empty records for a planet nets you a nice bonus in the hundreds of thousands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09c1b9ce459cf38457655c0aaf41c9272e7c5369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c1b9ce459cf38457655c0aaf41c9272e7c5369/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Did you know you can feed the animals?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Did you know you can feed the animals?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8) Speaking of the weird and wonderful animals\u2026</strong></h2> <p>Did you know you can feed the animals?

  "<p>A vocal critic of the UK\u2019s aid spending target has been appointed as Priti Patel\u2019s new adviser at the Department for International Development (DfID), raising further questions about the continued commitment of the new secretary of state to meeting the objective.</p> <p>Robert Oxley, former head of media at Vote Leave, is now special adviser to Patel, who was also a prominent Brexit campaigner. In his previous role at the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, Oxley has criticised the spending target of 0.7% of national income on foreign aid, which Theresa May has said her government is committed to upholding. </p> <p>In 2014, David Cameron said it was his proudest achievement in government to have met the UN-backed target. Oxley, then campaign director for the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2596469/11bn-foreign-aid-budget-proudest-achievement-says-PM-given-poorer-nations-rockets-30.html\">said at the time</a> that \u201chitting an arbitrary spending target is not something to celebrate, quite the opposite\u201d.</p> <p>The pressure group has called for the target to be scrapped, with Oxley <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/339023/It-s-right-UK-gives-billions-in-foreign-aid-says-David-Cameron\">saying </a>the DfID \u201cshould focus on using the billions already handed to it to genuinely help the world\u2019s poorest rather than chase this arbitrary target\u201d.</p> <p>The Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance has regularly criticised aid programmes to countries such as India and Brazil, which have burgeoning economies but still severe poverty. </p> <p>In 2012, when it was announced the aid programme for India would end by 2015, Oxley <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9666938/UK-will-still-send-30m-of-expertise-to-India-after-aid-cuts.html\">said</a> aid spending should cease sooner. \u201cIt\u2019s got space programmes, it\u2019s got quite a significant defence force and it is the largest democracy in the world, and so this isn\u2019t about Britain abandoning its commitments but saying there is a limited pot of money, where\u2019s it going to go?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/18/letter-priti-patel-international-development-secretary-dfid-trade\">A letter to Priti Patel, the new international development secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oxley has also criticised the \u201cunaccountable, bureaucratic and wasteful industry that has grown up around spending taxpayers\u2019 money on international aid\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/905321/taxpayers-money-still-going-overseas/\">in a Sun newspaper article in 2013.</a></p> <p>Kate Osamor, shadow international development secretary, said the appointment was \u201canother grim reminder that knives are being sharpened on the aid budget under this Tory government\u201d. She added: \u201cLabour will not hesitate to defend our aid budget and prevent it from becoming a bargaining chip for human lives.\u201d</p> <p>Oxley declined to comment directly but DfID sources said he had acted as a spokesman for the TPA and comments from his previous job did not necessarily reflect his current personal view. A DfID source said the 0.7% aid spending target was \u201ca legal commitment, a manifesto commitment and something the secretary of state made clear would continue when she took office\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will make sure we invest UK aid firmly in our national interest, while keeping the promises we\u2019ve made to the world\u2019s poorest people,\u201d a DfID spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Patel herself was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10122842/Some-countries-do-not-need-our-money-any-more-says-Andrew-Mitchell.html\">quoted by the </a>Telegraph in 2013 suggesting the DfID be scrapped.<em> </em>\u201cA long-term strategic assessment is required, including the consideration to replace DfID with a department for international trade and development in order to enable the UK to focus on enhancing trade with the developing world and seek out new investment opportunities in the global race,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The former employment minister has hinted she intends to use Britain\u2019s \u00a311bn aid budget as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/30/britain-to-leverage-11bn-of-foreign-aid-to-build-new-trade-deals/\">leverage for advantageous post-Brexit trade deals</a>, saying UK aid was \u201chelping to create millions of jobs in countries across the developing world \u2013 our trading partners of the future\u201d.</p> <p>Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a member of the international development select committee, said Oxley\u2019s new role would \u201csend a chill down the back of those who depend on our support to tackle disease, promote women\u2019s rights and provide schooling for those who have none\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a deeply worrying appointment and yet more evidence of Priti Patel\u2019s malign rightwing agenda to scrap and undermine our support for the world\u2019s poorest people.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Twenty four hours after the Guardian and some other newspapers, including the money class\u2019s own Financial Times, put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/uks-top-bosses-earned-10-pay-rise-2015-average-salary-hit-55m\">10% pay rise for FTSE 100 chief executives</a> on Monday\u2019s front page, I went back to the pink \u2019un to check the fallout. Not much yet, except one encouraging straw in the wind. I\u2019ll come back to that.</p> <p>On this occasion the Daily Mail didn\u2019t have much room for the High Pay Centre\u2019s <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/pubs/10-pay-rise-thatll-do-nicely\">latest update</a>. It devoted more space (yet again) to the excessive scale of gongs and goodbye handshakes being paid to David Cameron\u2019s outgoing staff at No 10, but also to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3728547/Police-chief-s-64-days-year-officers-paid-PM-use-loophole-choose-holiday-moan-cuts-budgets.html\">its own expos\u00e9</a> of excessive pay, perks and long holidays of taxpayer-funded chief constables and their top teams. Roy Greenslade, tabloid editor turned professor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/aug/08/why-newspaper-editors-like-fat-cats-they-help-to-sell-newspapers\">explains why readers love it</a>.</p> <p>The Mail can be admirably tough on bankers\u2019 greed and firms that cheat their customers. But it reserves special venom for public sector excess, as it did only last winter <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3309596/The-shocking-scale-fat-cat-pay-public-sector-exposed-today-major-Daily-Mail-investigation.html\">when turning over NHS, council and other senior officials doing a bit too nicely</a> and \u2013 as with the coppers \u2013 trying to hide behind FoI walls. Quite right too, though it serves to remind us that indignation is often tribal and selective. Ripping off customers, shareholders and staff is a lesser crime. </p> <p>Brexit gives us all the chance to \u201ctake back control\u201d of all sorts of things, at least in theory. That goes for top people\u2019s pay packages, a sensitive issue long before the ratio over average pay rose from around 20:1 in the 60s \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/\">here\u2019s some context</a> \u2013 to today\u2019s FTSE 100 index\u2019s ratio of 129:1 for CEOs, a figure closer to 250:1 in the US. </p> <p>With the naivety that characterised many of her dealings with capitalism, Margaret Thatcher cut higher tax rates (60% until 1988 even under her) and taxed perks in the belief that honest achievement could be more openly rewarded. Instead the bandwagon simply gathered pace, running over lots of jobs and shareholding pensioners in the process.</p> <p>No wonder voters everywhere feel angry, even though some older trade unionists may remember voting for Maggie in 1979 to restore their own pay \u201cdifferentials\u201d, eroded by Labour 1970s egalitarianism. No wonder some now reach out to chancers who offer simple remedies: Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, the Sun and Daily Mail, even to Jeremy Corbyn if he were more of a firebrand, less of a freezerbrand, more a populist than an unpopulist.</p> <p>As for the spurned EU, its efforts to use its collective muscle to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/15/banks-extra-payments-bonus-cap-regulator-bankers-eu\">curb bankers\u2019 bonuses</a> and other monopolistic corporate excess was one source of Brexiters\u2019 complaint. Alas, it\u2019s also true that the Brussels elite looked after itself and will expect post-Brexit Britain to help pay  its <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/brexit-triggers-row-over-british-eu-civil-servants-pensions\">generous pensions</a> for decades.</p> <p>What is to be done, as Lenin might have put it? The other day a pay consultancy expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) warned that shareholders and managers must do more to constrain excess or risk public resentment triggering a government clampdown, as promised in France and threatened \u2013 before and after her becoming PM \u2013 by Theresa May.</p> <p>She wants CEOs\u2019 pay to be subject to a mandatory shareholder vote \u2013 unlike the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal \">nonbinding (and ignored) vote</a> against BP\u2019s Bob Dudley and other self-satisfied rascals last spring \u2013 and a CEO/average employee ratio to be published in the annual report.</p> <p>That sounds right, yet PwC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0636958e-4914-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c.html#axzz4Gj3OWYso\">Tom Gosling argues</a> (paywall) that May\u2019s plan might backfire by making shareholders even less inclined to challenge the board. They too are victims of the contemporary cult of the CEO, cherished in the face of repeated disaster and disappointment, much as overpaid England football managers are cherished until they crash. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/19/executive-pay-ceos-dont-need-cash\">Will Hutton saying this</a> \u2013 Google it. Firms with boards dominated by an over-mighty CEO \u2013 they\u2019re usually blokes, as the Guardian report states \u2013 are worse than those with more challenge and less testosterone. If you look at <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/sites/bank-ceo-compensation/2016/\">big international banks</a> (paywall)  there is a large variation in CEO pay, further proof that the \u201cmarket rate\u201d argument is a self-justifying racket too. Truly exceptional people <em>make</em> businesses, a different skill from climbing the corporate ladder.</p> <p>So May seems to be on the right track, though the scope for opacity and deceit is likely to remain considerable unless she really means to improve corporate governance. Thus Roger Ailes,  now leaving Fox News trailing a cloud of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">sexual harassment allegations</a>, was relieved of the burden of being a \u201cnamed executive officer\u201d in the annual report so his pay could be hidden. Wall St and City traders, who do so much damage and can earn more than the boss, often escape scrutiny or censure until they\u2019re fired or (rare) end up in court.</p> <p>Jailing some high flyers would be another improvement, one which May could help only indirectly (as is proper) by better funding  the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/sep/23/cps-chief-inspector-kevin-mcginty-cuts-can-leave-agencies-unable-to-function\">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS), overstretched and demoralised as it often is.  If there\u2019s insufficient evidence for M\u2019Learned Friend, parliament could dish out more of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/sir-philip-green-told-do-right-thing-bhs-pension-deficit\">Frank Field treatment</a>. Even \u201cKing\u201d Phil Green didn\u2019t enjoy it.</p> <p>Every little helps, so while we\u2019re on the subject, why not require boards to address their staff\u2019s low pay as well as high pay? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-raise-tax-pay-rise-public-sector-labour\">Jeremy Corbyn has just come up with an idea</a> to raise corporation tax by 1% and the top income tax rate to 50p (again) to fund a public sector pay rise after years of freeze/cap. Always good to hear some specifics from him \u2013 let\u2019s see how it goes down.</p> <p>But business is pushing in the opposite direction: 16 trade groups wrote to Greg Clark, (a man who once said the Tories should listen more closely to Polly Toynbee), urging the new business secretary to backpedal on the 2020 goal of a \u00a39 per hour national minimum wage (NMW) because of \u201ceconomic uncertainties\u201d, as Brexit is sometimes called. </p> <p>It\u2019s also a test for May, one on which she should keep her nerve, as the TUC says. NMW rose from \u00a36.70 to \u00a37.20 in April, the sharpest rise for 10 years. But employers seem to be coping, just as they did when Blair and Brown successfully introduced a minimum wage after 1997 despite dire Tory warnings. </p> <p>And that\u2019s where the sliver of good news from Tuesday\u2019s FT comes in. Tuesday\u2019s editorial in the pink \u2019un, which is full of clever people and wary of free-market zealots, supports that position, just as the Guardian does. Even George (\u201cwho he?\u201d) Osborne eventually embraced the concept. Voters are still sizing up May: does she mean it in her unflashy way?</p> <p>Symbolism matters in politics, but so does cash in pockets. And, unlike fat cats who tuck much of their surplus \u201cearnings\u201d under their king-sized beds, poor people usually go straight out and spend what they have. </p> <p>It all helps to boost demand, so fairness and macroeconomics march in step.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>The winner: Suicide Squad</strong></h2> <p>Critics may have been <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/suicide_squad_2016/\">largely unimpressed</a>, but Suicide Squad defied sunny skies to deliver a robust UK opening of \u00a311.25m from 573 cinemas. The film\u2019s most apt comparison is probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-superheroes\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, because both comic-book properties were little known to broad audiences until their respective owners, Warner/DC and Disney/Marvel, announced movie adaptations. Guardians of the Galaxy began two years ago with \u00a36.36m, including \u00a31.37m in previews.</p> <p>Another comparison for Suicide Squad might be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/deadpool-review-marvel-ryan-reynolds-film-superhero\">Deadpool</a>, which was also given a 15 certificate in the UK. Deadpool debuted in February with \u00a313.73m, including \u00a33.76m in previews.

In August 2015, no new release opened bigger than \u00a33m.</p> <p>There is a big disparity between critical and fan appreciation of Suicide Squad, which has a 40/100 score at Metacritic and a 7.0/10 user rating at IMDb.

In the school holidays it\u2019s a different story, with every day of the week a potential opportunity for a cinema trip. A case in point is Finding Dory, which debuted a week ago with \u00a38.12m and added another \u00a33.98m at the weekend. The film\u2019s cumulative total is \u00a320.25m, which means it grossed \u00a38.15m during the Monday-to-Thursday period. Over its first 10 days, the daily average gross is an impressive \u00a32.03m.</p> <p>Among Pixar films, only Toy Story 3 reached \u00a320m at a quicker pace.

Of that total, \u00a343,556 was earned in Ireland and Northern Ireland, from 24 venues. (Mainland UK delivered \u00a32,854 from four sites.) The film recounts the 1981 hunger strike that led to the death of Sands, who became an elected MP during the protest, and nine other IRA prisoners.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland, it ranked fifth at the box-office, and in Ireland it was in eighth.

With just \u00a368,000 weekend gross, Tarzan had the lowest weekend takings of any film in the Top 10 since the first session of July 2015, when Minions was the top film on release and the Keanu Reeves thriller Knock Knock was in 10th, with takings of \u00a367,000.

No matter: they are also a very encouraging 105% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when the rebooted Fantastic Four debuted weakly at the top spot. Cinema programmers now have their hopes pinned on a quartet of wide new releases, beginning on Wednesday with the comedy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, starring Zac Efron, Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza. Teen-skewing thriller Nerve (which may lose some of its potential audience due to a 15 rating) follows on Thursday. On Friday arrives shark-peril thriller The Shallows, starring Blake Lively, and Disney remake Pete\u2019s Dragon. Indie cinemas, which are crying out for an indie hit, and many of which are currently playing wall-to-wall summer blockbusters \u2013 will be welcoming Todd Solondz comedy Wiener-Dog. Alternatives include Valley of Love, The Wave, The Idol, the documentary Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words and football hooligan sequel ID2: Shadwell Army. </p> <h2><strong>Top 10 films, 5-7 August</strong></h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> Suicide Squad, \u00a311,252,225 from 573 sites (new)<br><strong>2. </strong>Finding Dory, \u00a33,975,736 from 624 sites.

A fortnight ago I ran into Felix and Hugo White from the Maccabees at a solo gig by Barry from the Futureheads, a confession that suggests my indie credentials run so deep that I\u2019m officially twinned with <a href=\"http://www.radiox.co.uk/radio/xposure/\">John Kennedy</a> (also present). Discussing Felix\u2019s new <a href=\"http://diymag.com/2016/07/22/felix-white-the-maccabees-club-night-yala-records\">Yala! record label </a>and reminiscing about my decade or so of boozy interviews with the band, I blathered on about how far they\u2019d come over the course of four albums and, since they\u2019d recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/24/festival-watch-latitude-festival-2016-christine-and-the-queens-courtney-barnett-aurora-grimes\">headlined Latitude</a>, suggested they and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2016/jun/24/glastonbury-2016-friday-as-it-happens?page=with:block-576d8cb9e4b0f43038109baa#block-576d8cb9e4b0f43038109baa\">Foals</a> were the only two current guitar hopes on course for Glastonbury headline slots.

And it feels like a knell for the current era of post-millennial British guitar music.

It\u2019s a resilient blighter. Many have greatly exaggerated reports of its demise, only to watch it rise again. But it\u2019s clear that, in Britain at least, the deck is stacked imposingly against it. Inventive, wolf-clawed alternative music still thrives in the underbelly of UK culture, howling with ideas, but its support network is too sprawling and disconnected to help it do any more than pad out the festivals, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/14/savages-adore-life-review-the-looser-lighter-sound-of-a-band-moving-forward\">Savages</a>-style.

The British alt-rock scene is running fruitlessly up against the impenetrable force field of a sleek, inclusive and self-serving industry machine, refined over decades, that only sucks in a select few pliable types in tune with its needs and processes. Long-term fans of alt-rock have always felt like the Skywalkers plotting their assaults on the Top 40 death star and throwing an ewok party every time a rock band successfully hit the target. Now it\u2019s starting to look as though they\u2019ve blocked up the thermal exhaust port and the Empire might actually have won. For now.</p> <p>It\u2019s a situation we need to treat with caution. Because just as Brexit looks set to reduce Britain to the economic gimp of the US and China, we\u2019re becoming just another innocuous European market in global music terms. Until the UK allows itself to be the guitar rock hotbed it naturally is once more, chances are we\u2019ll soon be importing the new Maccabees.</p>",

According to the Russian Geographical Society, he tried to <a href=\"https://www.rgo.ru/ru/article/gde-temza-vstrechaetsya-s-eniseem\">continue</a> upriver the next year but the ship ran aground and froze to the bottom. He was forced to sell it for parts and return to Britain overland, and The Thames sank during the spring thaw in 1878.</p> <p>Later that year, Wiggins sailed to the Gulf of Ob and brought back a shipment of wheat, the first Siberian produce to be transported to Britain through the Kara Sea. Although development of Arctic sea trade with Russia was hindered by shipwrecks, Wiggins was honoured by Emperor Alexander III in St Petersburg after he transported rails for the Trans-Siberian railway up the Yenisei in 1893. The Royal Geographical Society recognised his work to open the Kara Sea route with the 1894 Murchison award.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db15118e5fcad9a9b2b465a144ac2de2d2351676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db15118e5fcad9a9b2b465a144ac2de2d2351676/121_165_1651_2063/800.jpg\" alt=\"Journalist-explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley was refused permission to accompany Wiggins.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Journalist-explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley was refused permission to accompany Wiggins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Russian Geographical Society researchers also discovered what they believe to be the wreck of the Russian schooner Northern Lights when a storm forced their motorised catamaran on to the largest of the Brekhovsky islands in the Yenisei Gulf.

Its remains are a rare example of Siberian shipbuilding of the era, Goncharov said.</p>",

  "<p>The relationship between the British and Chinese governments is under strain after the prime minister, Theresa May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">decided to delay approval</a> of the planned \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station because of concerns over China\u2019s 30% stake in the project.</p> <p>The move has prompted a warning from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, who said in a pointed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8bc62dc-5d74-11e6-bb77-a121aa8abd95\">Financial Times comment piece</a> that relations with Britain were at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d. Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay.</p> <p><strong>Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/broker-tells-investors-sell-edf-shares-hinkley-point-costs\">under significant financial stress</a>. </p> <p>That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May\u2019s biggest concerns.</p> <p><strong>Why is the UK courting Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">UK\u2019s current account deficit</a> was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\">record high of 7.2%</a> in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus.</p> <p>Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34341352\">owed their existence to China</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\">Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What does China own in the UK?</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\" data-alt=\"Comparison with France, Germany and Italy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\">Comparison with France, Germany and Italy</a> </figure>  <p>While the UK is not one of China\u2019s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined.

This has stoked fears that any cooling of relations with Beijing could damage efforts to narrow the economic gulf between the south-east and the north of England.</p> <p><strong>What future infrastructure investment will need Chinese cash?</strong></p> <p>Ambitious projects require billions of dollars of investment and Chinese infrastructure investors are among those with cash to spend. Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/hs2-bidding-process-opened-up-chinese-companies\">contracts worth nearly \u00a312bn</a> to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands.</p> <p>A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\">10% of Heathrow Holdings</a> is owned by CIC.</p> <p><strong>Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Fears about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">allowing China such close involvement</a> with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point.</p> <p>The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour\">members of the intelligence community</a>. </p> <p>One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row.</p> <p>It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking\">independent cybersecurity experts</a>, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell.</p> <p><strong>Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australian-treasurer-overrules-sale-of-13-of-country-to-chinese-firm\">blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co</a> to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China\u2019s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman\u2019s land is close to a nuclear testing site.</p> <p>Huawei was also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-huawei-nbn-idUSBRE82P0GA20120326\">barred from tendering</a> to take part in Australia\u2019s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout.</p> <p>The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage.</p> <p>Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat\">threat to national security</a> by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon.</p> <p><strong>Why does China like the UK so much?</strong></p> <p>Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made.</p> <p>But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. </p> <p>Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-corruption-zhou-idUSBREA2T02S20140330\">appropriated by the state</a>. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/22/china-cambridge-university-poet-xu-zhimo-farewell-property\">put more than $12bn</a> into UK property, nearly a third of the country\u2019s overall investment in Britain.</p>",

An <a href=\"http://wildaid.org/elephants\">estimated 30,000 animals</a> are being killed for their ivory every year, a shockingly high figure that threatens the survival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/05/two-thirds-forest-elephants-killed\">central Africa\u2019s forest elephants</a> as well as some elephant populations in east Africa.<br></p> <p>They also would have read about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/13/global-accord-illegal-wildlife-trade-london-46-nations\">international community\u2019s response</a> to the poaching crisis, with governments around the globe <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/campaigns/GiantsClub/giants-club-african-leaders-to-gather-in-kenya-to-tackle-elephant-poaching-crisis-a6896651.html\">promising action</a> and conservation organisations scaling up efforts to tackle elephant poaching and the illegal ivory trade. </p> <p>And it has made a difference, with <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-wildlife-elephants-idUKKCN1081FD\">poaching down from its 2011 peak</a>. But the killing goes on \u2013 fuelled by demand in Asia and increasingly driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/23/elephant-ivory-smuggling-kingpin-arrested-in-tanzania\">international organised crime</a>.</p> <p>So it is understandable that a raft of elephant and ivory trade proposals have been put forward for debate at this year\u2019s<a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/countdown_begins_for_the_2016_world_wildlife_conference\"> global wildlife trade conference in South Africa</a>. </p> <p>Three of them have attracted a disproportionate amount of media coverage: the call by a group of African countries for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">formal global ban on ivory trade</a> by listing all elephant populations in Appendix I under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), and <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201606020196.html\">counter-proposals by Namibia and Zimbabwe</a> to allow them to resume ivory trading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">African wildlife officials appalled as EU opposes a total ban on ivory trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These proposals to trade or not to trade seem at first glance to go to the very heart of how to stop the poaching. But it is important to remember that a de facto international ivory trade ban already exists and moving all populations to Appendix I would not change this. And it is definitely not the time to contemplate even a partial resumption in the trade. </p> <p>In fact, the main impact of these three proposals will be to fuel a divisive debate and divert attention away from measures that are needed to deal with the fundamental issues behind the illegal ivory trade.</p> <p>It is critical that attention remains focussed on the Cites-led National Ivory Action Plan (NIAP) process, which is absolutely central to global efforts to stop the poaching and the trafficking, and reduce demand for ivory. At the last Cites conference in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/ivory-poaching-sanctions-cites\">19 African and Asian countries were required to take timebound action</a> to address gaps in their legislation and enforcement or face sanctions. </p> <p>This process is now beginning to yield results. But all these gains could be lost if Cites does not continue to prioritise this approach and strengthen the monitoring of these countries\u2019 implementation of their ivory action plans.</p> <p>Fighting over whether to further formalise the international ban or to partially end it might give the impression that countries were trying to do something to address the crisis. But none of the three pro- or anti-trade proposals will address what is really facilitating illicit ivory trafficking \u2013 corruption, inadequate laws and lack of enforcement in countries along the illegal trade chain, and rampant demand in Asia.</p> <p>Well aware of this, the European commission has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">decided to oppose all three proposals</a> and urged the EU, which is a critical voting bloc representing all 28 member states, to adopt this position at the Cites conference. </p> <p>It is a decision based firmly on sense and science, and one that is good for Africa\u2019s elephants. But it has led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/06/african-wildlife-officials-appalled-as-eu-opposes-a-total-ban-on-ivory-trade\">stampede of criticism</a> from members of the African Elephant Coalition, who have blamed the EU for undermining the chances of a global ivory ban and so placed elephants at even greater risk of extinction. An <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/global_ivory_ban_loc/?slideshow\">Avaaz petition</a> taking the EU to task also quickly gathered more than 1.5m signatures.</p> <p>But WWF believes the commission is right, and we encourage all member states to follow its lead and agree to oppose all three of these proposals, while supporting resolutions that will enhance the fight against wildlife crime in general, and ivory trafficking in particular. </p> <p>Indeed, the most powerful thing the EU can do for Africa\u2019s elephants is to make it clear that it will push for trade sanctions under Cites against countries that do not fulfil their commitments under the NIAP process.</p> <p>By making its opposition clear early on, the EU could signal that none of these proposals are likely to get the necessary two-thirds majority at the conference and so could encourage the proponents to withdraw all three of these controversial proposals ahead of the meeting. </p> <p>This would avoid unnecessary bitterness and prevent a divisive debate that would split Africa in two at a time when it desperately needs to come together to solve this crisis. It would also pave the way for constructive debate on issues that will help tackle poaching and illegal ivory trade, including stronger laws, measures to counter corruption, and more vigilance at key ports, such as Mombasa and Zanzibar, from which ivory continues to be smuggled out of Africa.</p> <p>It would also provide the space to build a broad coalition in support of another draft resolution to be considered at the Cites conference to strengthen efforts to change consumer behaviour. </p> <p>Like WWF, the commission backs this critical proposal, which could help to significantly reduce the demand that drives the illegal ivory trade.</p>",

And it remains relatively uncommon, even in the US, where it is on the rise: a 2009 survey of 69 hospitals in the south-eastern US found only 22% allowed siblings to observe during delivery. In the UK there is no available data, but Gerrard tells me that, anecdotally, more women are asking for their children to be present at birth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big thing in the UK, and it probably isn\u2019t something midwives encouraged in the last 20 years,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is on the increase. Given that we are trying to improve choice, if having children present is part of that choice, we should be supporting women. Birth is a family event, and it affects everyone.

  "<p>So you\u2019ve moved to HQ. Congrats! You\u2019ve given up on the field and adventure to take a higher position in an office in the normal world.</p> <p>Sure, you had your reasons. Perhaps you were missing flush toilets and vegetables; maybe you were drawn by the allure of cheese and wine. Most likely it was the higher paycheck. Will others judge you? Absolutely, but they\u2019re probably just jealous of your all-access pass to regular people and winter sports. </p> <p>Along with all the other things you are planning to do (hello balcony garden!), you might be thinking of entering the scary world of dating.<br></p> <p>Going from a choice between ten people and thousands can be intimidating. There is also the fact that potential lovers might now expect you to be more committed. Exciting? Utterly terrifying? Gut wrenching? All the above?</p> <p>There are three basic types of people you are going to encounter in HQ: humanitarians, civilians and financiers. Let\u2019s break them down. </p> <h2>Humanitarians</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/secret-aid-worker-a-damaged-handsome-bundle-of-trouble-its-easy-to-fall-for-a-flaky-aid-boy\">Secret aid worker: flaky aid boys and other development love-life disasters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ahhhh, humanitarians, or possibly development people. Either way they will be able to relate to you at least somewhat. Shared stories of conflicts and donors will help you to form a strong bond with these men and women. They understand why you\u2019re scared of fireworks and why you are always looking for the exit in a room in case a riot breaks out. </p> <p>Caution is needed though, as flaky aid boys/girls are just as flaky at HQ as they were in the field. Often running off for field trips or even to experience a better party, they sometimes appear desperate to absorb the things that drove them to HQ in the first place. You may always feel like these humanitarians are looking over their shoulder \u2013 literally or figuratively. </p> <p>However, many of them have never really done fieldwork. They believe taking trips to the field (never exceeding a few days) count. They can get really testy if you point out it doesn\u2019t. </p> <p><strong>Overall</strong><strong>:</strong> Proceed with caution. You left the field for a reason, dating another humanitarian might be regression.</p> <h2>Civilians</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They will listen with rapt attention to even the most mundane story from the field. Goats are often big hits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Civilians, normal people as some call them, or those who are not humanitarians. </p> <p>Civilians do not feel the need to rush off into danger, and are not well-versed in the latest attacks in Bangladesh or Juba. Their first instinct is not to check whether friends or loved ones are alive when a plane has crashed because their life is at HQ. They are stable and adoring. Be very, very careful as they will fall in love with you. <br></p> <p>On the one hand, while they may not understand your particular brand of madness, they will listen with rapt attention to even the most mundane story from the field. Goats or other unusual pets are often big hits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/27/secret-aid-worker-is-there-life-beyond-the-field\">Secret aid worker: Is there life beyond the field?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You\u2019ll have to ease them into the story about that near kidnapping or the time you were almost bombed, but, if properly conditioned, they should not freak out and run screaming. No guarantees of course. Try testing a few people on Tinder first, find out who reacts to the mention of how a really bad bout of giardia is acting up again or the name you gave your tapeworm. </p> <p><strong>Overall: </strong>Over time you\u2019ll find yourself having more in common with civilians, after you finally develop some of those hobbies you\u2019ve been meaning to pick up. </p> <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Civilians are less likely to be running around the world, so they could provide a stable base for eventually transitioning into consultancies and short-term contracts. </p> <h2>Financiers</h2> <p>Yes, financiers are civilians but they are an entirely different breed. They come with big warning labels. </p> <p>Whether HQ for you means Geneva, London or New York, you will inevitably encounter this variation. Well-dressed with an expensive haircut, they may make you feel a tad self-conscious of the fact that you\u2019re still sporting a hairdo supplied by that woman in a local hut. Not to mention the fact that much of your clothes are off-label or knock-offs. </p> <p>Do not worry though, for at least a short period of time your eccentricities will entice financiers. You are different from the others \u2013 more independent, less impressed by their flashy money and antics. You\u2019ll challenge them and, perhaps, they\u2019ll challenge you back. This could make for a fun battle. At the very least the bedroom stuff should be good. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/02/secret-aid-worker-projectitis-dfid-civil-society\">Secret aid worker: the UK NGO sector is facing a funding crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Overall: </strong>It may not end up being a love connection, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to get a nice vacation out of them before it ends. An expensive island destination is recommended. </p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>You\u2019re almost prepared to enter into the world of HQ dating. Yay! But one final note before you go on any dates with strangers \u2013 always remember the buddy system and check in with friends. Stay safe. You\u2019re no longer dating one of the five expats in the village. Anonymity is both a blessing and a concern. <br></p> <p><em>Do you have a secret aid worker story you\u2019d like to tell?

  "<h2>Doping controversy hits the pool in Rio</h2> <p>The question of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/lilly-king-ryan-murphy-swimming-gold-rio-2016\">sports doping</a> was pushed to the forefront of the women\u2019s 100m breaststroke final at the Rio Olympics on Monday night, when US swimmer Lilly King won gold and then called into question her team-mate Justin Gatlin\u2019s place at the Games. \u201cDo I think someone who has been caught for doping should be on the team? No, I don\u2019t,\u201d King said after the race.

  "<p>Earlier this year, in a sweltering classroom in Delhi, I met a young Indian boy named Ram. His father is a watchman in a government apartment block, and the family live in the building\u2019s garage. But there is no toilet, so Ram, a small, whipsmart and endearingly cheeky boy, must cross two busy highways to get to the overcrowded public toilet in a nearby slum.</p> <p>Obviously, rather than risk this, Ram and his siblings sometimes do their business in the open near the apartment block, making him one of India\u2019s <a href=\"http://unicef.in/Whatwedo/11/Eliminate-Open-Defecation\" title=\"\">564 million people</a> who practise open defecation.

It also has 250 million people with zero assets. Not even a radio.

Nearly <a href=\"http://www.mid-day.com/articles/india-has-48-million-stunted-children-report/17471181\" title=\"\">50 million Indian children are stunted</a>, including Ram. Probably because, like millions of other Indian toddlers, he was constantly exposed to disease carried by faecal particles he encountered when going to the toilet wherever he could.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/19/energy.business\" title=\"\">single gram</a> of human excrement can contain 10m viruses, 1m bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts and 100 worm eggs. Living barefoot and not washing your hands, you\u2019re likely to ingest dangerous bugs with your food and drink, if you have any. Diarrhoea ensues; and any nourishment children do get is washed out by the bugs, stunting their growth and development. <a href=\"http://humanitariannews.org/20160805/wateraid-caught-short-how-lack-access-clean-water-decent-toilets-plays-major-role-child-stu\" title=\"\">Half of all cases of malnutrition are linked to diarrhoea</a>, says WaterAid.

Beyond that age, \u201cthe effects are largely irreversible\u201d.</p> <p>Ram\u2019s situation is unfair and immoral, but it\u2019s also uneconomical. Poor sanitation loses India 6.4% of GDP \u2013 $53.8bn \u2013 according to <a href=\"http://water.worldbank.org/news/inadequate-sanitation-costs-india-equivalent-64-percent-gdp\" title=\"\">World Bank calculations</a>. It is now well known that investing a dollar in sanitation can save a government $6-8 in costs: healthcare, mostly, but also days not worked and children whose earning potential is as stunted as their height.</p> <p>The writer and activist Harsh Mander, author of a searing book on Indian indifference called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Looking-Away-HARSH-MANDER/dp/9385288008\" title=\"\">Looking Away</a>, would give children a fair start (which is the name of a <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/equity/85938_85946.html\" title=\"\">current Unicef India campaign</a>), in the form of a universal social floor. It would cost 10% of GDP and cover an equal school environment, where children of different backgrounds \u2013 income, ethnicity or religion \u2013 are schooled together. There would be access to basic healthcare, in a country where a quarter of the population fall into poverty because of hospitalisation costs. This is not a fantastical proposition. In 2014, <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/financing-healthcare-for-all-in-india-towards-a-common-goal-556476\" title=\"\">World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said</a> that \u201cthere\u2019s now overwhelming evidence that [user fees for healthcare] actually worsened health outcomes\u201d. Higher taxes? What an unfashionable notion. Yet India\u2019s tax income is 14% of GDP, one of the lowest among similar nations.</p> <p>It is common in India to stop at traffic lights and see a young girl with dirty hair and a wide smile gesturing to her mouth; or a boy selling tissues or trinkets. It has also become far too common, on a micro and macro level, for India\u2019s thriving middle class to look away \u2013 or worse, to look through. Unicef\u2019s Fair Start campaign highlighted this with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ii-snseTo\" title=\"\">film</a> that used children from marginal communities as actors. It may not seem a sophisticated concept, but it is groundbreaking for one reason: when the film\u2019s wealthy children see poor children begging, or heading off into the bushes to go the toilet, they actually notice them. Unlike the adults, who have learned that windows can be opaque, these children see clearly to the other side of their prosperity and privilege.</p> <p>Do we have to wait for this generation to grow up before we stop tolerating the current levels of inequality and poverty? No one is asking Indians to look through a looking-glass. Just a window, and to acknowledge that the poverty on the other side is not only unfair and unacceptable, it\u2019s fixable.</p>",

  "<p>Although he was arguably the world\u2019s best known cosmetic surgeon, Ivo Pitanguy, who has died aged 93, never felt the need to undergo any of the procedures he pioneered. \u201cThe most important thing is to have a good ego and then you don\u2019t need an operation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/brazil-loves-nip-tuck-plastic-surgeon-ivo-pitanguy\" title=\"\">he said</a>. With a mind as sharp as his scalpel, the Brazilian understood just how important it is for people to feel comfortable with the way they look.</p> <p>He cashed in on the vanity and insecurity of the rich and famous so successfully that he was able to buy himself a private island from the proceeds of facelifts, tummy tucks and breast enlargements for global tycoons and Hollywood stars. But he also established teaching clinics and he and his students worked for nothing on those who could not afford reconstructive surgery for burns, cleft palates and deformities.</p> <p>In a speech at a global conference of plastic surgeons two years ago, Pitanguy blurred the difference between remedial and cosmetic work. Ultimately, he claimed, both were a form of healing. \u201cOne day, it will be clear that aesthetic surgery brings the desired serenity to those that suffer by being betrayed by nature,\u201d he told delegates, many of whom he had trained and inculcated with the ethos of a \u201chuman right to beauty\u201d.</p> <p>His ideas remain controversial. Critics call them a marketing ploy. Supporters say Pitanguy helped his patients overcome low self-esteem and other psychological ailments. Regardless, these ideas \u2013 and the many techniques introduced by the surgeon \u2013 are now the basis for a burgeoning global industry. They have taken particularly deep root in his home nation. Two years ago, Brazil overtook the US as the world leader in cosmetic operations.</p> <p>One of five children of a general surgeon, Ant\u00f4nio de Campos Pitanguy, and his wife, Maria, Pitanguy was born in Belo Horizonte, north of Rio de Janeiro, and followed his father into medicine. As a student in the 1940s, he was quick to see the potential of cosmetic surgery, which was then still in its infancy but developing fast as a result of groundbreaking treatments of scarred, burned and disfigured troops and civilians in the second world war. To learn more, he studied in London with Harold Gillies and <a href=\"http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/sir-archibald-mcindoe\" title=\"\">Archibald McIndoe</a>, who were experts on skin grafts for burn victims, and Paris with Marc Iselin, a leader in reconstructive bone surgery.</p> <p>On his return to Rio, Pitanguy worked initially on trauma surgery but soon created a plastic surgery department in the Santa Casa da Misericordia public hospital. It came into its own in 1961 after a fire tore through a circus tent in the nearby city of Nitero\u00ed, leaving many children disfigured with horrendous burns that his skin grafts helped to alleviate. Pitanguy said later that the incident taught him the importance of appearance to emotional wellbeing.</p> <p>It also projected him into the national spotlight and went some way towards softening negative public perceptions of plastic surgery, as did his work on the burns suffered by the Formula One driver Niki Lauda in a crash in 1976.</p> <p>His work for the poor over the coming decades gave him subjects for honing and demonstrating new techniques. He later opened his own private clinic, where he trained 586 plastic surgeons in the craft of face lifts, breast enhancement and liposuction, as well as accepting thousands of others for short-term courses and visits. Many of his alumni went on to found their own schools and clinics in an industry that mushroomed from the 1960s onwards.</p> <p>Pitanguy tweaked so many famous faces, including those of the actors Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, that he became a celebrity in his own right. His lavish lifestyle \u2013 helicopter commutes, luxury yachts and charity events \u2013 were to be a staple of Brazilian gossip magazines for more than half a century. He was an internationally renowned art collector and was once painted by Salvador Dal\u00ed.</p> <p>Pompous and self-important at times, Pitanguy argued that cosmetic surgeons were \u201cartists of the living form, dealing with body and soul,\u201d though the effects of his work were often derided as superficial and reinforcing a stereotype of Brazil \u2013 and Rio in particular \u2013 as being unhealthily concerned about looks. Despite Pitanguy\u2019s pro bono work, the cosmetic industry was primarily geared towards wealthy clients. The many aesthetic surgeons contrasted sharply with the shortage of medical staff working in primary healthcare.</p> <p>Cosmetic surgery is more popular than ever and has now expanded far beyond nips and tucks to buttock enlargements, vaginal rejuvenation, penis extensions, pectoral implants, industrial-scale quantities of fat being removed by liposuction and reality TV makeover shows.</p> <p>Pitanguy was too proud of his work and too aware of its positive effects to ever say he had created a monster, but in his final years, he warned that his \u201cart\u201d was at risk of becoming trivialised. \u201cWhat is important is being content with your own image. Plastic surgeons shouldn\u2019t banalise that. It should be treated as a specialised field like any other field of surgery.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months, his health had deteriorated. Since September, he had been undergoing dialysis after being diagnosed with a kidney problem. In June he went into hospital to be treated for an infection. He died from a heart attack, the day after taking part in his wheelchair in the Olympic torch relay in Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>That was a final moment in the global spotlight for a surgeon who \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 helped shape the way humanity sees itself and what it might be. For him, surgery was never purely cosmetic. As he said: \u201cI tried to show that it goes deeper than the skin, that it goes inside the soul.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Marilu Nascimento, four children, Ivo, Gisela, Helcius and Bernardo, and five grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Ivo H\u00e9lcio Jardim de Campos Pitanguy, surgeon, born 5 July 1923; died 6 August 2016</p>",

One fascinating example comes by way of two visual design researchers in Potsdam, Germany: Till Nagel and Christopher Pietsch have used bike sharing GPS data from three global cities to create living, breathing portraits of the cities themselves.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/cf/\">cf. city flows</a> interactive installation is hosted by Potsdam\u2019s <a href=\"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/\">Urban Complexity Lab</a>. Three high-resolution screens let visitors compare flows of urban mobility in London, New York City and Berlin, as seen through the journeys of shared bikes.</p> <p>As soon as you compare these cities\u2019 patterns of movement, several distinguishing features become apparent. As noted on the project\u2019s website, some visitors pointed out the barrier between Middle Manhattan and Central Park, as well as the inner-city area in Berlin. Others noted the contrast between New York\u2019s neatly ordered street grid and the idiosyncratic, organically-grown layouts of Berlin and London.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/26/open-data-blogger-parking-tickets-new-york-nypd\">How an open data blogger proved the NYPD issued parking tickets in error</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bike trajectories are visualised as coloured droplets flowing through the street grid, popping in and out of existence from one bike station to another. Visitors can view each city\u2019s bike journeys at three different levels:</p> <ul> <li>The citywide view gives the broadest perspective. In this view, the movement of all bike sharing trips are shown, overlaid on a map of the city.</li> <li>The small-multiple view zooms in on three select bike sharing stations, each of which explodes into four different views that separate incoming (green) from outgoing (orange) journeys and morning (left) from afternoon/evening (right) journeys.</li> <li>The station view shows only the bike journeys to and from a single station. Likewise, incoming trips are shown in green while outgoing trips are shown in orange.</li> </ul> <p>The most obvious difference between the cities is the vastly different number of bike sharing trips in Berlin as compared to London and New York City \u2013 whose bike sharing systems are comparable in size, each with about 35,000 trips represented in the animation.</p> <p>In contrast, Berlin\u2019s bike sharing trips number less than 2,000. As explained on the cf. city flows website: \u201cWhile cycling indeed is more common in Berlin than in London, Berlin\u2019s bike-sharing scheme is mostly used for tourist and leisure activities, as most riders have their own bikes.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/173885050\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/173885050\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Exploring the complex \u2018edge bundling\u2019 methodology behind the interactive</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of cf. city flows is the technical work that went into its planning and design.

More than a hundred women driven out of the camp by hunger were raped in the aftermath of the most recent violence, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54623\">according to UN figures</a>.</p> <p>Since last year, hunger has encroached on relatively stable parts of this war-ravaged nation. The region of Northern Bahr el Ghazal, left largely unscathed by the conflict, has recorded alarming malnutrition rates after erratic rains and pests devastated last year\u2019s harvest. One in three children are now at risk of starvation, while hunger has forced tens of thousands to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/12/south-sudan-hunt-for-food-drives-back-across-border-to-sudan\">migrate across the border to Sudan</a>.<br></p> <p>Shortfalls in agricultural production have been compounded by a deep economic crisis, marked by deteriorating terms of trade and skyrocketing food prices. The most recent fighting in Juba has brought the flow of goods along the main trade artery from Uganda almost to a halt, further accelerating price hikes and sending ripple effects through markets across the country.</p> <p>Experts fear that the country is on the brink of famine. An outbreak of disease could push mortality rates \u2013 one of <a href=\"http://www.who.int/ceh/indicators/faminerisk.pdf\">three indicators used to define a famine</a> \u2013 much higher.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that food consumption is extremely stretched. We know that malnutrition rates are extremely high. The biggest fear now is that it will just take a disease like cholera, malaria or diarrhoea to ignite a famine,\u201d said Joyce Luma, the South Sudan country director of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme. </p> <p>Hunger levels have also spiked in the capital Juba, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/19/south-sudan-violence-fear-looting-juba\">last month\u2019s violence</a> has forced thousands from their homes.

The inflatable pillows from the <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2012/07/20/coca-cola-beatbox-by-pernilla-asif-2/\">Coca-Cola Beatbox</a> pavilion were intended to be recycled into a canopy for a local school, but the cost of dismantling the structure intact proved prohibitive, so the whole thing was scrapped.</p> <h2>The accommodation</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77f6ac1da898e32222b363657028d35e183edda8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77f6ac1da898e32222b363657028d35e183edda8/0_90_1568_941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Just 240 of 3,604 apartments sold \u2026 the athletes\u2019 village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just 240 of 3,604 apartments sold \u2026 the athletes\u2019 village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heusi Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flats have been designed \u201cat a level that only kings have previously had\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/04/rio-olympic-games-2016-property-developer-carlos-carvalho-barra\">according to developer Carlos Carvalho</a>, the 92-year-old property tycoon behind the 31 tower blocks of the athletes\u2019 village.

But is studying a masters in Europe all it\u2019s cracked up to be? And how does it really differ from studying in the UK? We spoke to students who are doing it to find out.<br></p> <h2>It\u2019s less expensive</h2> <p>Some countries, such as Finland and Greece, <a href=\"https://www.studyineurope.eu/tuition-fees\">don\u2019t have tuition fees</a> for EU students, while in others, including Germany, many master\u2019s programmes only require a <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-germany\">small semester fee</a>. </p> <p>For Alex Griffith, 28, this has meant the chance to achieve his dream of studying for a master\u2019s in English theology at <a href=\"http://www.fu-berlin.de/\">Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin</a> \u2013 an option not available to him at home. \u201cIt was too expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cBut here it\u2019s possible. In the UK doing a master\u2019s degree is reserved for people who have money. Here it\u2019s more of a meritocracy.\u201d<br></p> <p>The cost of living can also be relatively low in European cities. \u201cI work part time on top of studying, and that gives me enough to get by,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cBack home you have to work a lot more. But here the work-life balance is tipped more towards life.\u201d<br></p> <h2>It\u2019s hard work and takes a long time</h2> <p>You might not have to pay huge fees, but you do have to work hard. Many master\u2019s degrees in Europe, though not all, are two years long. </p> <p>And if you think this will give you more time to socialise, be warned. \u201cThe reason it takes so long is that you have so much more work to do,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cThe papers are much longer.\u201d</p> <p>Jessica Abrahams, 27, studying a masters in international relations at the Barcelona Institute of International Studies, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been more demanding in terms of the quantity of essays, debates and coursework we have. Alongside working, there\u2019s a lot to juggle.\u201d<br></p> <p>In fact, many students take three or four years to complete their master\u2019s degree in Germany. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/02/will-international-love-help-your-language-skills-blossom\">Will international love help your language skills blossom?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow long it takes is up to you, but very few people I know have finished in two years,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cI\u2019m looking at three, and some people have been here for four, so if you\u2019re very career-minded and worried about time, this might not be the option for you,\u201d he says. <br></p> <h2>You can set your own pace</h2> <p>Students are expected to take charge of their own schedules, and may be surprised to find a lack of strict deadlines. \u201cThis was a shock to me at first,\u201d says Annie Rutherford, 26, who studied a masters in comparative literature at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. </p> <p>\u201cIn the UK, if I handed in an essay an hour late, I got marks taken off, whereas in Germany I found it really laid back. Friends of mine felt that we were babied a bit more in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Examination methods can also be more flexible. \u201cWe\u2019ve sometimes been given a choice between being tested with a long essay or an exam,\u201d says Abrahams. \u201cRelationships with lecturers have also been more informal. At the end of the taught course, we went for drinks with our lecturers to say goodbye and it was really nice to get to know them in that way.\u201d<br></p> <h2>You make global connections</h2> <p>One of the most rewarding things about studying abroad is meeting people from all over the world. \u201cI\u2019ve made loads of friends from all across Europe,\u201d says Samuel Phillips, 24, who is studying for a master\u2019s in German law at Munster University. \u201cWhen I was studying in England, I only hung around with English people, whereas here there are a lot of international students.\u201d </p> <p>Watch out for the international student trap though, warns Rutherford. \u201cYou can go down the route of being an international student, or you can be really integrated with the locals. Both can be a bit of a bubble.\u201d<br></p> <p>Wagaye Johannes, project director at the <a href=\"http://www.iie.org/\">Institute of International Education (IIE)</a>, studied a master\u2019s in international relations at the University of Amsterdam. She says she now has contacts and friends across the continent. </p> <p>\u201cMy classmates are all over Europe, so if something happens globally I\u2019ve got those connections. Having international experience brings the world closer to you. </p> <p>\u201cAnd studying abroad at master\u2019s level can be particularly beneficial, because it\u2019s a long degree and you\u2019re a bit older, so you\u2019ve already started carving out professional contacts.\u201d<br></p> <h2>The social life is different</h2> <p>\u201cOne of the things I liked about Germany was that it didn\u2019t have the same binge drinking culture,\u201d Rutherford admits. \u201cGerman students start drinking earlier in the day than British students, but they stick with beer.

However, when you\u2019re in an international city, it doesn\u2019t matter because there\u2019s plenty to do, they say. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of great places you can study in the UK, but Berlin\u2019s one of the most exciting cities in Europe,\u201d says Griffith. \u201cIt attracts lots of interesting young people and I can\u2019t think of a city in the UK like it.\u201d Abrahams says she loves the international feel, and the sunshine, in Barcelona.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/30/i-wasnt-prepared-for-the-culture-shock-of-being-an-international-student\">I wasn't prepared for the culture shock of being an international student</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Studying abroad helps you develop a global mindset, adds Johannes.</p> <h2>It can be challenging</h2> <p>Navigating a foreign city without knowing the language can be tricky at first. \u201cI had to post a parcel and, being in a foreign country, I didn\u2019t know whether to go to a post office or news agent,\u201d says Abrahams. \u201cIn the beginning I only had basic Spanish, so small things like that took a bit of time to figure out, when they wouldn\u2019t even cross your mind in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>However, living abroad forces you to learn quickly, and you soon pick up the vocabulary you need.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking classes at a language school, and it\u2019s great to have the opportunity to speak it every day, with flatmates, or in shops and restaurants,\u201d says Abrahams. \u201cYou have motivation to learn, and it sticks in your mind more easily. When you get to the point where you can have conversations in Spanish, it\u2019s so fulfilling and satisfying.\u201d<br></p> <h2>The return home is hard</h2> <p>\u201cMy first few months back in Edinburgh were pretty miserable,\u201d says Rutherford. \u201cI returned in January, and the weather was horrible. I just thought to myself, \u2018the buses don\u2019t work here, the alcohol\u2019s expensive and I don\u2019t know anyone\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But since she\u2019s settled back in, she has learned to appreciate the benefits of her time abroad all over again. \u201cMy new boss likes that I have international experience and I\u2019ve been able to work on international projects I wouldn\u2019t have been given the chance to do otherwise.

  "<p>This month\u2019s Reading group choice \u2013 for a book to give us hope \u2013 is Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. That\u2019s right. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/02/reading-group-help-choose-a-book-to-give-us-hope-in-august\">When asked to find a book to cheer us up</a>, Guardian readers and fate have combined to bring us one of the most pessimistic and angry books in the history of literature. A book the New Yorker famously said \u201cdoesn\u2019t even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper\u201d.</p> <p>But as was pointed out when the book was proposed, the medicinal qualities of laughter should not be forgotten. What\u2019s more, the cussedness of this choice in itself gives me hope. Far better to confront the idiocies of mankind head-on than to retreat into comforting banalities and warming platitudes. No New Age nonsense here. Instead, we\u2019ve gone for eternal verities:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t after you.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He was going to live forever, or die in the attempt.</p> </blockquote> <p>These quotes are so famous \u2013 and so right \u2013 that it\u2019s surprising to realise that they come from a book published in living memory. They might as well have been around forever. Just like the novel\u2019s title, that wonderful and confounding blast of illogic: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one\u2019s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn\u2019t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn\u2019t have to; but if he didn\u2019t want to he was sane and had to.</p> </blockquote> <p>While I\u2019m quoting from Heller\u2019s great novel, another apposite thought for us here on the books pages of the Guardian:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He knew everything there was to know about literature, except how to enjoy it.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll avoid that problem. It\u2019s pretty hard not to enjoy this particular book, after all. It may have become firmly embedded in our cultural landscape, but it still feels fresh and funny. I remember roaring with laughter last time I read it. Yes, there\u2019s indignation and tragedy \u2013 but there is also joy. In fact, the more I think about it, the better it seems that this book has been chosen to give us hope. I can\u2019t wait to start reading it again. I hope you\u2019ll join me.</p> <p>To further that end, we have five copies to give away to the first five readers from the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive comment in the comments section below.

  "<p>In early 2016, I met a group of female sex workers (FSWs) in Bagalkot district in Karnataka, India. The campaign statement for their <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/women/endviolence/orangeday.shtml\">Orange Day</a> event calling for an end to violence against women in December 2015 was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.whatworks.co.za/resources/project-resources/item/100-samvedana-plus-orange-day-2015-celebrations-infographic-report\">Violence is not love</a>\u201d. I was curious about what this meant because the women had framed it in the context of intimate relationships with their male partners. </p> <p>Just a year earlier, the results of a formative <a href=\"http://www.whatworks.co.za/resources/presentations/item/93-2015-samvedana-plus-svri-rct-presentation\">study</a> by researchers from the <a href=\"http://www.khpt.org/\">Karnataka Health Promotion Trust</a> among 620 female sex workers (FSWs) in the same district had revealed that 51% of them faced emotional, physical or sexual abuse from their intimate partners. Almost half the FSWs reported humiliation, threat of harm or intimidation, 33% were either kicked, choked, burnt on purpose, forced to engage in humiliating sex acts or threatened with a weapon, and 7% were raped by their partners in the six months prior to the survey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we don\u2019t beat them, the mistakes done by women will become visible, and then the public will question my manhood</p> <footer> <cite>Kiranmay, sex worker's partner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tara, one of the FSWs I met, shared the story of a long raised scar on her right arm. On a Friday evening in August 2014, her partner came home to find her with a client. She defended herself when he accused her of cheating: \u201cWhat will happen if I continue sex work? You don\u2019t earn and give me money. How should I earn my livelihood? I need to eat. What do you expect me to do?\u201d Seething with rage, he kicked and pinned her to the ground with his legs on her chest. The pocketknife meant to slit her neck instead slashed her arm raised in an act of self-protection.</p> <p>A majority (64%) of sex workers surveyed for the study met their current partners as clients. The men, before they transitioned into a lover/partner, were just one of the many clients the women serviced. So there is something deeper than an act of betrayal that triggers violence in these relationships.</p> <p>In early 2014, a qualitative <a href=\"http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/resources/understanding-masculinities-gender-norms-and-intimate-partner-violence-affecting-female\">study</a> with FSWs and their partners quoted Kiranmay, a 24-year-old study participant who justified hitting his lover, saying: \u201cIf we don\u2019t beat them, the mistakes done by women will become visible, and then the public will talk about me and question my manhood.\u201d </p> <p>Men reported using violence to assert dominance, correct perceived transgressions and lack of obedience, and maintain their public image of being in control of the household and family. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"247f9b6da5700371931939af8f6f5acbab020b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/247f9b6da5700371931939af8f6f5acbab020b87/0_0_5456_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A FSW gets ready to receive her clients in the red tinged room at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sex worker gets ready to receive clients in her home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Priya Pillai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a society where roles and expectations from women and men are gendered and fixed, sex workers act out the norms so that they can belong to the mainstream. According to interviews with FSWs, they feel they are more deserving of respect, love and care with a man in their lives and children from him. They expect their partners to treat them as they do their wives, and fear that they are loved less if they are not hit. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rates of condom use fall further when the relationship is violent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The norms governing these relationships have significant implications for public health interventions, particularly for HIV/Aids programmes. Women\u2019s unquestioning acceptance of masculinity norms and trust in their partners create barriers to condom use and uptake of health services by both women and men.</p> <p>An overwhelming 91% of FSWs in the survey reported trust as the main reason for not using condoms with their partners. Unlike with their clients, FSWs hesitate to insist on condom use with their partners for fear of being perceived as disloyal, losing their partners or experiencing violence. Rates of condom use fall further when the relationship is violent. Only 24% of FSWs who had experienced violence reported consistent condom use with their partners, as compared with 49% of sex workers who did not face violence.</p> <h2>Love, loss and unsafe sex</h2> <p>How do they navigate this seemingly impossible matrix of violence, love and loss, and unsafe sex? <a href=\"http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/projects/samvedana-plus-reducing-violence-and-increasing-condom-use-intimate-partnerships-female-sex\">Samvedana Plus</a> is a violence reduction intervention that aims to reduce the risk of HIV in FSWs by addressing partner violence in their intimate relationships. Since early 2015, a total of 800 FSWs in the district have been learning to better negotiate violence and condom use with their partners.</p> <p>Individual and group sessions inform FSWs about protective laws and teach them to better communicate with their partners. Peer support groups, outreach workers and a crisis management team from <a href=\"http://www.chaitanyamahilasangha.org/\">a sex worker\u2019s collective</a> work to guide them about how to better resist violence from their partners. The programme provides access to HIV services and distributes male and female condoms. Outreach workers offer counselling to the FSWs and their partners when there is a fight.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf36eeb4546b7dde31ff9583046a8e965944d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf36eeb4546b7dde31ff9583046a8e965944d63/0_0_5456_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An outreach worker meets sex workers in the village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An outreach worker meets sex workers in the village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Priya Pillai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Group sessions with men discuss gender, condom use, HIV/Aids and laws against violence.

They are seen not just as the aggressors, but also as individuals in equal need of support and potential allies in preventing violence.

  "<p>Revolver was an intimidating but beguiling record shop in Bristol where I worked during my 20s. Although I was confident it would make an interesting subject, I was wary of writing about somewhere so redolent of my youth. My intention was to evoke the peculiar atmosphere of Revolver and the sense I often felt there that time had undergone some form of adjustment. This was an experience I had accepted as part of my job, as I spent days alone in an empty, badly lit shop with a remarkable and idiosyncratic record collection at my disposal. As I listened to music in this environment, with barely any responsibilities other than to be a presence behind the counter, the records I heard seemed to connect directly with my subconscious. </p> <p>While reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/17/open-city-teju-cole-review\">Teju Cole\u2019s Open City</a> I had been struck by the manner in which the narrator and his surroundings interchanged roles as observers of the world around them, and wondered if I could adapt the idea to explore the relationship between music and place. The records I first encountered in Revolver, from fairly obscure avant-garde compositions to mid-seventies dub to Virginia Astley to Massive Attack, provided a context for these exploratory mental journeys. As the book grew into an examination of how time, our surroundings and passion for discovery shape us, I hoped the reader might recognise a similarly intense attachment to somewhere from their own lives.</p> <p>If Original Rockers is a memoir, it is a memoir of an absent space. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/why-derek-jarmans-life-was-even-more-influential-then-his-films-9137025.html\">Modern Nature by Derek Jarman</a> was an influence, as it demonstrated how one\u2019s past and passions might be written about objectively, without lapsing into solipsism. After a certain age, nostalgia feels uncontrollable and the idea of being sentimental about a subject so prone to caricature as a record shop was one I was determined to avoid. Although I was writing about my experiences, it was the shop, rather than myself, that was the subject.</p> <p>There were many anecdotes to illustrate Revolver\u2019s eccentricities at my disposal: the shop was raided by police convinced it was an LSD factory, the owner was kidnapped by concert promoters, our customer service was predicated on a dreadful musical snobbery that often resulted in animated disagreements. Such incidents were certainly entertaining, but it was Revolver\u2019s presence in the city as a meeting point for the dispossessed, who largely made up our clientele and who felt temporarily at ease with themselves within the shop\u2019s four walls, that I most wanted to celebrate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a8bb39c96326ef5046e33015445bbebeb1c333b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a8bb39c96326ef5046e33015445bbebeb1c333b/0_226_2891_3614/800.jpg\" alt=\"Writer Richard King\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard King: \u2018I was once more overwhelmed by the act of listening to records.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Faber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I began work on the book, the then-mayor of Bristol, George Ferguson, in a process that is as familiar as it is banal, was exploiting the city\u2019s reputation for bohemianism and individuality as an incentive to attract investment from property speculators. This encouraged me to emphasise how the perceived cultural capital of the city was the result of years of illegal and semi-legal behaviour, of people coming together at sound systems, blues parties and in front of graffiti-decorated walls, to demonstrate their legitimate sense of injustice at how the city had treated its less affluent areas and citizens in the past. I also felt that, through initiatives such as Record Store Day and the recent narrative of vinyl\u2019s renaissance, record shops themselves were undergoing a form of gentrification.</p> <p>On publication, Original Rockers was variously described as \u201cmoving\u201d and \u201cintensely personal\u201d. It was intensely personal: my mother, who had been seriously ill, died shortly after I completed the first chapter. Some months later, when two thirds of the book had been written, my father was diagnosed with an advanced cancer. Although the book concludes in the present I felt it unnecessary to share these details with the reader, but my emotions doubtless seeped into the pages. </p> <p>While completing the book I spent a great deal of time in the dream state elicited by grief, which provided me with the same unconscious receptiveness to music I had first experienced when sitting on a stool behind the counter in Revolver. I was once more overwhelmed by the act of listening to records. It is perhaps this extraordinary capacity for music to influence and sustain our lives that is the true subject of Original Rockers.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To stand inside and loiter in a record shop is to be in a separate habitat, one that feels cloistered, protective and disengaged from any other type of retail activity; an ecology whose ambience can be experienced by degree and by the subtle shifts in mood that are set by whatever music is coming through the shop\u2019s speakers. If a shop is playing a familiar album there are few greater pleasures than settling in to its running order and allowing its well-worn grooves to prompt the head to nod along while flicking through the racks. There is also a thrill in discovery. A previously unheard record coming through the store\u2019s sound system often prompts the question that, despite their studied air of indifference, anyone working behind a record shop counter longs to hear: \u201cExcuse me, what\u2019s this you\u2019re playing?\u201d</p> <p>There is never a shortage of music to play in a record store. Music from every era, especially some of an era\u2019s most unloved records, sits for years awaiting rediscovery gathering dust on a half-remembered shelf. Barely perceptible changes in taste bring forgotten albums back to life. A decade after its dominance in the recording studio, a gated digital drum machine was the totemic sound of eighties excess and records made around its production values could be found for a pound. Twenty years later some of the more esoteric or flawed albums from the period were no longer considered relics but instead appeared to new generations as talismanic recordings to be appropriated as influences. The greatest record shops are fine-tuned to these processes and are constantly aware of the shifting nuances in demand and popularity before they enter the mainstream. Such moments of precognition occur especially within the kind of music whose natural home is amid piles of unsorted records in the backrooms and improvised shelves of record shops with serious reputations.</p> <p>Revolver was that kind of shop; its ability to thread a connective love of music across genres and fashions and to encourage its customers to do the same was its <em>raison d\u2019etre</em>. Anyone who worked there was less interested in selling the weekly inundation of new releases than in delving through the racks of rare and obscure records that were kept from view. Behind closed doors Revolver contained a lifetime\u2019s worth of music that could only be absorbed one side of an album at a time. The shop stocked any and every genre that a customer might desire, but its principal sales technique, if it had such a thing, was finding new ways in which music might unlock the subconscious. It was a shop that would reasonably strike any passing customer as not so much disengaged as unhinged. The type of place that was entirely divisive; for some music lovers it was the high water mark of any Saturday visit into town, for the more casual record buyer it was best avoided and with good reason.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>A lot of Original Rockers is very personal. In its intoxicating sense of place, and King\u2019s tying together of disparate pop-cultural strands, it sometimes seems to be a modest cousin of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/greil-marcus-life-in-writing\">Greil Marcus</a>\u2019s Invisible Republic or Lipstick Traces, or an example of the idiosyncratic kind of cultural-historical writing lately done by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/super-furry-animals\">Super Furry Animals</a>\u2019 Gruff Rhys in his travelogue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/01/gruff-rhys-american-interior-review\">American Interior</a>. Such an idiom is replete with trap-doors, and from time to time the emphasis on evoking subjective experience means that King inevitably falls in: the use of such words as \u201celdritch\u201d and \u201climinal\u201d is usually a sign of over-writing, and so \u2013 very occasionally \u2013 it proves here.<br>That said, among his strongest talents is the braveness not to worry about Pseuds Corner, and capably evoke the magic that music and people\u2019s surroundings can combine to create. \u2013 <strong>John Harris<br></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/19/original-rockers-richard-king-review-bristol-record-shop-revolver-massive-attack\">Read the full review.</a></strong></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>Original Rockers is published by Faber &amp; Faber priced \u00a39.99 and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/original-rockers-413589.html\">is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a38.19</a>.</p>",

It\u2019s a metaphor for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/what-is-the-european-union\">the EU</a> in this wonderfully playful, intimate and ultimately moving show, which constantly pits idealism against self-interest and pragmatism. <strong>LG</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/22/eurohouse-review-summerhall-edinburgh-fringe\">Read the full four-star review</a></p> <h2>Tank</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/tank\">10.30am, Pleasance Dome</a> (until 20 August)</p> <p>Tackling that difficult second show with real confidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/16/what-is-it-about-warwick-edinburgh-festival-walrus-theatre-breach-barrel-organ\">Breach Theatre</a> \u2013 who debuted last year with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/13/the-beanfield-edinburgh-festival-space-on-the-mile-stonehenge-new-age-travellers-review-1985\">The Beanfield</a> \u2013 offer an engaging deadpan satire on John Lilly\u2019s 1960s research programme, which remains best known for its use of LSD on captive dolphins and because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/08/the-dolphin-who-loved-me\">one of the researchers, Margaret Lovatt</a>, lived for a period in close proximity with one of the males.

It\u2019s a question considered by Hannah Nicklin in this engaging performance-cum-lecture, inspired by her decision to take part in an Ironman triathlon before she turned 30. On one hand it\u2019s an account of her personal journey, but it\u2019s also a metaphor for life itself: the way you lose people along the way, and how the heart is a muscle that requires exercising. It\u2019s a tad long, but it\u2019s full of questing intelligence, fascinating facts and wry humour as Nicklin considers what drives her \u2013 and us \u2013 on. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>World Without Us</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/world-without-us\">11.30am, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>One of the great things about the Belgian company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/07/ontroerend-goed-theatre-audience\">Ontroerend Goed</a> is that every piece they make is different. They\u2019ve always dared to take risks \u2013 some of which pay off and some of which definitely don\u2019t. That\u2019s just as it should be, and in this latest piece they take the risk of trying to get us to contemplate the unimaginable: a world in which every human has vanished. <strong>LG</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/07/world-without-us-edinburgh-festival-review-ontroerend-goed\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <h2>Once \u2026</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/once\">11.30am, Assembly George Square </a>(until 29 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"632ea10369c45036127340c0197b702ab195ad11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632ea10369c45036127340c0197b702ab195ad11/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Once by Derevo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fairytale for adults \u2026 Once by Derevo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Love makes fools of everyone in this clowning show from the Russian company <a href=\"http://www.derevo.org/\">Derevo</a>, who swept the board with awards when it was seen in Edinburgh in 1998. Even Cupid gets it wrong in this fantastical tale: a ragged old man falls in love with a beautiful waitress in what is effectively a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequinade\">Harlequin and Columbine</a> story. It\u2019s cute as hell, and often quite kitsch, but it would be a frozen heart that didn\u2019t respond to the sweet openness and pain of this fairytale for adults \u2013 or admire the skill with which it is executed. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Fabric<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/fabric\">11.55am, Underbelly Cowgate</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Nancy Sullivan is completely engaging and utterly heart-breaking as Leah who grew up dreaming of marriage and who thought she had found her prince in Ben. Abi Zakarian\u2019s script for this one-woman piece is beautifully observed and funny too. What initially seems to be a whip-smart contemporary version of an Alan Bennett Talking Head turns into something far darker as romance gives way to reality and Leah\u2019s life is stained in many different ways. Clever set and sound design, too, in a show that brings dirty little male secrets out into the light. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Josie Long and Martin Williams: Investigations</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/josie-long-and-martin-williams-investigations\">12pm, Stand Comedy Club</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Comedy on the fringe can take many forms: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/19/the-wrestling-at-edinburgh-festival-review-pleasance-grand-max-and-ivan\">wrestling</a>, therapy, <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2012/s/20066/simon_munnerys_la_concepta\">fine dining</a>. So why not investigative journalism? The well-loved DIY standup Josie Long teams up with Guardian writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-williams\">Williams</a> on a show that fuses comedy with politics, exposing truth, and muck-raking beneath and beyond the news headlines.

But Binari, an unexpected charmer of a show that\u2019s based on the songs and dances of Korean funeral rites, makes the journey to the western stage with real grace. On paper it sounds forbiddingly austere, its narrative essentially the rite of passage by which the soul of a dead woman is released into the afterlife. Yet Binari is choreographed with such a satisfying fusion of dance, music and imagery that the work feels anything but remote. <strong>JM</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/18/binari-at-edinburgh-festival-review-assembly-hall-korean-funeral-rites\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <h2>AFTERNOON</h2> <h2>Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons\">12.10pm, Roundabout @ Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/15/lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-lemons-review-edinburgh-festival-southside-walrus-theatre\">Last year</a>, playwright Sam Steiner\u2019s debut show was in the hottest room on the fringe, but it (and the audience) will have room to breathe now that it is staged in Paines Plough\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.roundaboutpp.com/\">Roundabout</a> tent. This smartly conceived, pared-back love story imagines a world in which everyone is only allowed an allocation of 140 words a day.

It weaves stories of space exploration with accounts of those who risk their lives on leaky boats to make the perilous journey between Africa and Europe. Last Dream (on Earth) may feature live music but it\u2019s not a piece with bells and whistles \u2013 rather, it takes audiences on a quietly rewarding journey of their own. <strong>LG</strong><br></p> <h2>Austentatious<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/austentatious-an-improvised-jane-austen-novel\">1.30pm, Underbelly, George Square</a> (until 21 August)</p> <p>When I reviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/14/austentatious-edinburgh-festival-review\">Austentatious: An Improvised Jane Austen Novel</a> a few years back, I was happy to help spread the word about a very funny long-form improv show making hay with the conventions of Regency-era period drama. I didn\u2019t know then that Austentatious would also become a production line for eminent solo comics: in the years since, musical act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/16/rachel-parris-edinburgh-2013-review\">Rachel Parris</a> and multimedia innovator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/13/desert-island-discs-kirsty-young-joseph-morpurgo-soothing-sounds-for-baby-invisible-dot\">Joseph Morpurgo</a> have joined co-star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/07/cariad-lloyd-comedy-standup-solo-shows-edinburgh\">Cariad Lloyd</a> as acclaimed performers in their own right.

It\u2019s deceptively rackety stuff, but it gets to the heart of a situation in which the social cleansing of London\u2019s poor is taking place almost without comment, and people\u2019s lives are becoming dominated by the need to find somewhere affordable to live. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Goggles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/goggles\">2pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>Edinburgh is full of young companies making fluffy, whimsical theatre, and at first sight This Egg\u2019s two-hander about love, friendship and breaking free seems to be just one more. But there are hidden depths in a hugely enjoyable story in which the performers also play two goldfish, and where the metaphor for escaping the fish bowl of a suffocating relationship is handled with humour and a lightness of touch. Lots of fun. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>One Hundred Homes</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/one-hundred-homes\">2.05pm, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>You go into a shed in the Summerhall courtyard and are offered tea and biscuits. Then Yinka Kuitenbrouwer delves into her archive, and tells you about her encounters with some of the 100-plus people she has visited in the places where they live, and asked what home means to them. It\u2019s as simple as that. But it\u2019s quietly heartwarming and thoughtful too, as it makes unexpected connections, raises questions about expectation and privilege, knocks back assumptions and probes whether home is a place or a state of mind. Just lovely. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Giants</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/giants\">3.15pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abb29e67b2e87972ffb3ff82cc2e554eebfc7f91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abb29e67b2e87972ffb3ff82cc2e554eebfc7f91/0_4324_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engaging \u2026 Giants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engaging \u2026 Giants</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born two days apart, apparently, and \u2013 if their show is to be believed \u2013 boon companions in infancy, Barney Fishwick and Will Hislop (son of Ian) now debut in Edinburgh with their double-act Giants. Former Oxford Revue presidents, there\u2019s a sense here of a duo still working out their USP, in a show that brings nothing blazingly new or distinctive to the sketch world. But they\u2019re engaging and watchable hosts, whose charm offsets the weaker sketches, and who have enough strong alternatives (including the one where Fishwick amusingly misplaces his cup of coffee) to make this maiden set worth a visit. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Smother</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/smother\">3.20, Zoo Southside</a> (until 27 August)</p> <p>Hip-hop has progressed a long way beyond its old macho image, but still it\u2019s a surprise to encounter a dance work like Smother, which places a story of gay love and gay relationships at its heart \u2026 While Smother has the dramatic texture of a play, it is unequivocally a dance piece: and with performers of terrific strength and personality, it takes hip-hop into thrillingly new terrain. <strong>JM</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/18/smother-edinburgh-festival-review-street-dance-gay-romance\">Read the full four-star review</a></p> <h2>Lucy, Lucy and Lucy Barfield<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/lucy-lucy-and-lucy-barfield\">3.30pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>I love the fringe because it throws up small, thoughtful, moving and unassuming shows such as this one in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/01/lion-witch-lucy-lucy-and-lucy-barfield-edinburgh-festival-cs-lewis\">Lucy Grace sets out in search of Lucy Barfield</a>, the girl to whom CS Lewis dedicated The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A piece about growing up and discovering that you are locked out of Narnia forever \u2013 and about trying to make a future when the magic is lost \u2013 it may not be very sophisticated but it has an unaffected grace (in more ways than one) as it unravels the mystery. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Bilal Zafar: Cakes<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bilal-zafar-cakes\">3.40pm, Just the Tonic at the Mash House</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Bilal Zafar won the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2016/01/31/24073/bilal_zafar_is_top_of_the_bill\">New Act of the Year award</a> earlier this year, after which you might expect he\u2019d hit Edinburgh eager to show off his acclaimed standup chops. Instead, he makes his debut with a gentle PowerPoint show, telling the story \u2013 illustrated by screengrabs from Twitter \u2013 of how a fake identity he adopted online attracted the ire of the far right. The show\u2019s charms arrive in a fairly low key: the Islamophobic e-kerfuffle he kicks up is a minor one, and there are no great surprises in the revelation that Twitter is permanently manned by idiots. But Zafar\u2019s wry circumspection is well-judged, and the material cribbed from his online persecutors duly delivers some big laughs. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>The Interference</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/interference\">3.45pm, C Chambers</a> (until 16 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"494b98d7d7ef5d504616845470559e433029d250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/494b98d7d7ef5d504616845470559e433029d250/0_193_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gripping \u2026 The Interference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gripping \u2026 The Interference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brittney Rivera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In American football, an interference is when one player obstructs another using his body.

Will the police take her seriously? How will the university deal with the matter? Everyone has got an opinion on the internet, and soon Karen finds that it\u2019s Smith who is being cast as the victim. There\u2019s a questing intelligence to a gripping drama that doesn\u2019t shirk the complexities of the case and cleverly uses a fragmented style to reflect the noisiness of a connected media and online world where all the chatter interferes with justice. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Ada/Ava</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ada-ava-by-manual-cinema\">4pm, Underbelly Potterrow</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>If you love the work of Paper Cinema you will also fall for this macabre little charmer by the Chicago company <a href=\"http://manualcinema.com/\">Manual Cinema</a>, who hand-craft a movie in front of your eyes using puppetry, live music and action. It\u2019s got a real black-and-white, silent-film retro appeal as it tells the story of an elderly woman learning to cope alone when her identical twin unexpectedly dies. Full of loving detail, skill and ingenuity, the show takes grief very seriously as it plays with mirror images to clever effect. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Radio Active</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/radio-active\">4.20pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a><strong> </strong>(until 28 August)</p> <p>Inspired by the staging of old <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32189443\">Hancock\u2019s Half Hour</a> scripts on the Fringe last year, Angus Deayton is now doing the same with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00c7zvk/episodes/guide\">Radio Active</a>, his commercial-broadcasting spoof, co-written with the late Geoffrey Perkins, that ran for seven years in the 1980s on Radio 4.

And there\u2019s a killer finale to a niftily constructed, frenetical hour. <strong>BL</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/17/goose-hydroberserker-edinburgh-festival-review\">Read the full four-star review</a></p> <h2>Infinity Pool: A Modern Retelling of Madame Bovary</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/infinity-pool-a-modern-retelling-of-madame-bovary\">4.35pm, Bedlam</a> (until 29 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0e751315e50aafb503cb67e4e642514dfd5e7e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e751315e50aafb503cb67e4e642514dfd5e7e7/0_198_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deliciously quirky \u2026 Infinity Pool: A Modern Retelling of Madame Bovary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deliciously quirky \u2026 Infinity Pool: A Modern Retelling of Madame Bovary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s something completely different and deliciously quirky. Bea Roberts, who wrote the terrific <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/08/and-then-come-the-nightjars-review-touching-tale-of-love-and-loss-on-the-farm\">And Then Come the Nightjars</a>, reimagines Madame Bovary for the 21st century without actors but with considerable help from two screens, a TV monitor, an overhead projector and a sound deck. Our heroine is no French provincial housewife but an admin assistant in a Plymouth plumbers with a ruinous Asos habit and a marriage long gone stale. Imagine Bridget Jones meets The Office meets 19th-century realist fiction. Even with technical difficulties at the performance I saw, this original show proved painfully funny and oddly moving. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Katy Brand: I Was a Teenage Christian</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/katy-brand-i-was-a-teenage-christian\">4.45pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>Katy Brand has a fine story to tell of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/04/katy-brand-teenage-christian-comedy-interview\">youthful obsession with revivalist Christianity</a>. In the telling, it lacks dramatic shape or climax. But what it loses in artfulness, it gains in honesty: Brand feels the cringe and does it anyway, parading her teenage egotism and delusion to diverting, if not uproarious, comic effect. It\u2019s an entertaining account of a teenager\u2019s search for herself and of the impulses that drive some of us into religion\u2019s comforting embrace. <strong>BL</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/07/katy-brand-at-edinburgh-festival-review-teenage-christian\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/jun/08/edinburgh-festival-2016-what-to-see-and-where-to-go\">Edinburgh festival 2016: what to see and where to go</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How (Not) to Live in Suburbia</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/how-not-to-live-in-suburbia\">4.50pm, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Annie Siddons turns personal disaster into art with witty, engaging satire that sends up both herself and the inhabitants of Twickenham as she succumbs to fiscal failure and professional paralysis in the leafy suburbs. Of course it\u2019s not really about suburbia but about a corrosive, creeping loneliness and depression. It\u2019s dark, but it\u2019s also playful and inventive with a lovely Jane Austen-style leave-taking spoof and a brilliant scene in which she is evicted from the book club for making everyone else feel stupid. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Dancer</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/dancer\">5pm, Dance Base</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>An exquisite two-hander created by Gary Gardiner and Ian Johnston with the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/24/adrian-howells\">Adrian Howells</a>. Howells\u2019 mantra that \u201cit\u2019s all allowed\u201d underpins a simple but moving piece in which the learning disabled Johnston tells us about who is and isn\u2019t allowed to dance, and in the process offers up his sharpest moves. It celebrates the sheer joy of losing yourself on the dance floor and challenges preconceptions and expectations. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>Barrowland Ballet: Whiteout</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/whiteout\">5pm, Zoo Southside</a> (until 27 August)</p> <p>Natasha Gilmore has a warm, witty and poetic eye for the nuances of ordinary life. In her previous fringe hit, Carmel, she assembled a vividly assorted cast (ranging from an 18-month-old baby to an 82-year-old dancer) to explore the dynamics of family life. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/01/whiteout-barrowlands-ballet-review\">Whiteout</a> she uses her own marriage to a West African as the springboard to probe the possibilities and the problems of falling in love in a multi-racial society. Set to a soundtrack by Luke Sutherland, Gilmore\u2019s work promises a rich choreographic mix, layered with her acute observation of everyday human behaviour. <strong>Judith Mackrell</strong></p> <h2>Daphne\u2019s Second Show</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/daphne-s-second-show\">5.45pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcb0b5dc26b8241aa09c037d91c2489f9b105fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcb0b5dc26b8241aa09c037d91c2489f9b105fee/0_2336_4912_3905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uneven charm \u2026 Daphne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uneven charm \u2026 Daphne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Crockett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They were the buzziest new sketch troupe in the run-up to last year\u2019s fringe, and Daphne (Phil Wang, George Fouracres and Jason Forbes) duly delivered with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/09/daphne-edinburgh-festival-review-pleasance-phil-wang-jason-forbes-george-fouracres\">seductively off-beam debut</a>. Peter Pan, Henry V and the American slave trade featured in the sketches; arch self-consciousness attended every punchline. And yet, here was a trio that didn\u2019t quite work like other sketch troupes. Their unevenness was part of their considerable charm. Might the intervening year have planed down Daphne\u2019s jagged edges, or will their second fringe outing build on their first? <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>Rose Matafeo<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/rose-matafeo-is-finally-dead\">5.45pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>Twenty-four-year-old New Zealander Rose Matafeo was nominated for best newcomer at the Melbourne Comedy festival, and within moments of her appearance onstage, you can see why. She\u2019s a whirlwind of comic energy, with a confidence and ability you seldom see in rookie standups. In her first fringe outing, ostensibly themed around her own funeral, she doesn\u2019t quite sustain that steamroller force: she\u2019s out of breath for much of its second half. But this is still a stellar debut: silly, charismatic, and packed with great gags about mortality, clothes shopping and the Jamaican dancehall king Sean Paul. <strong>BL </strong></p> <h2><strong>EVENING</strong></h2> <h2>Kiri Pritchard-McLean: Hysterical Woman</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/kiri-pritchard-mclean-hysterical-woman\">6pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>In this bold solo debut, Kiri Pritchard-McLean \u2013 director of sketch troupe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/09/edinburgh-festival-2014-review-geins-family-giftshop\">Gein\u2019s Family Giftshop</a> \u2013 explains how women seldom get to appear alongside other women in comedy clubs, and how all-female bills get called \u201cParalympic nights\u201d. She talks about how she has internalised that thinking; how she\u2019s scared of ever not being funny and letting down all womankind. Credit to her for making a show that\u2019s raucous and good-humoured without stinting on the protest. <strong>BL</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/06/kiri-pritchard-mclean-hysterical-woman-edinburgh-festival-pleasance-courtyard\">Read the full three-star review</a></p> <h2><strong>Brennan Reece</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/brennan-reece-everglow\">6pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63b03733ce4e5375dcbc4960b5c5bf57346fae68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63b03733ce4e5375dcbc4960b5c5bf57346fae68/0_514_3695_2216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Impressive \u2026 Brennan Reece.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impressive \u2026 Brennan Reece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Duncan Elliott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You probably won\u2019t know him as the <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2015/07/14/22822/english_comedian_of_the_year_2015_final\">2015 English Comedian of the Year</a> \u2013 chances are you won\u2019t even know the award exists \u2013 but such is the pedigree of young Brennan Reece, now making his fringe debut. You can see what must have impressed the judges: good jokes, an idiosyncratic personality and a poetic regional voice with stories to tell of an unglamorous Lancashire hinterland. Reece brings a bit of it with him to Edinburgh, recreating his parents\u2019 front room in the Pleasance Bunker. It\u2019s a lovely introduction to a comic exploring the transition from childhood to adulthood, frankly addressing the pitfalls he\u2019s pitched into \u2013 and celebrating his own hard-won refusal to fit in. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>Scorch</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/scorch\">6.05pm, Roundabout at Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341faa231bccecd4a0244f8762ea50b89af5dab2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/341faa231bccecd4a0244f8762ea50b89af5dab2/0_326_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Utterly mesmerising \u2026 Amy McAllister in Scorch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Utterly mesmerising \u2026 Amy McAllister in Scorch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Produced by the fine Northern Irish company <a href=\"http://www.primecutproductions.co.uk/\">Prime Cut</a>, Stacey Gregg\u2019s play is clearly inspired by the case of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2015/12/dark-truth-behind-convictions-gender-fraud\">Justine McNally</a>, who was convicted of \u201cgender fraud\u201d after starting a sexual relationship with a teenage girl who believed her to be a boy.

At the show\u2019s tender heart, though, is an account of Parris\u2019s recent breakup, which pitched her for the first time into depression. She\u2019s endearingly frank and funny about the experience, even if the sometime jauntiness of her Samaritans correspondence sits uneasily with the air of emotional candour.

Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s airborne trio Qutb sees Osipova\u2019s exceptional suppleness and strength pitted against two other men; the evening is a fascinating instance of ballet dancers who are willing to perform outside the box. <strong>JM</strong></p> <h2>Sofie Hagen: Shimmer Shatter</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sofie-hagen-shimmer-shatter\">7.50pm, Liquid Room Annexe</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>The Danish standup Sofie Hagen won the best newcomer award at last year\u2019s fringe with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/13/sofie-hagen-comedy-standup-review-soho-theatre-london\">Bubblewrap</a>, a show addressing her teenage self-harm. It was also about her Westlife obsession, which usefully anchored the riskier material in extracts from her adolescent boyband fan-fiction that couldn\u2019t fail to amuse.

This stage version, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/26/nazeem-hussain-soho-theatre-fear-of-a-brown-planet-comedy-review\">which played in London last year</a>, offers an upbeat, cartoonish \u2013 but smart \u2013 take on interracial misunderstandings, everyday discrimination, and being a brown man in a white man\u2019s country. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Nina Conti</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/nina-conti-in-your-face\">8pm, Pleasance Courtyard</a> (until 29 August)</p> <p>On her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/01/nina-conti-review-criterion-theatre\">West End run this spring</a>, ventriloquist Nina Conti largely dispensed with what you might consider to be the voice-thrower\u2019s most essential prop: her doll. OK, so Monkey does feature in her new show, In Your Face \u2013 now at the fringe in a condensed version. But in this set, it\u2019s usually the audience that Conti voices. They come onstage, Conti straps them into an animated mask, and \u2013 as their rubbery lips flap up and down \u2013 improvises them crazy stuff to say. It\u2019s a surpassingly curious spectacle, a real plate-spinning feat from Conti and \u2013 in the lucky-dip environment of the fringe \u2013 a reliably entertaining hour. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>Lucy McCormick: Triple Threat</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/lucy-mccormick-triple-threat\">8.10pm, Underbelly</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>She can sing, act and dance \u2013 but the real threat of this show created by <a href=\"http://www.getinthebackofthevan.com/\">Getinthebackofthevan</a>\u2019s McCormick is that you will no longer be able to think about the New Testament without associating the Three Wise Men with Christina Aguilera\u2019s Dirty \u2013 or Doubting Thomas with anal fingering. Listen, this irreverent, provocative and vastly enjoyable show is definitely not for everyone. Or for anyone who is easily offended, doesn\u2019t like live art and has never thought that the body of Christ needs reclaiming by a woman. This is a sly, funny piece that knows exactly what its doing and boasts an unholy trinity of brilliantly skilled performers. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2>(I Could Go on Singing) Over the Rainbow</h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/i-could-go-on-singing-over-the-rainbow\">8.15pm, Summerhall</a> (until 28 August)</p> <p>If you are looking for human contact amid the noise of the fringe, then FK Alexander\u2019s Autopsy award-winning show may well fit the bill \u2013 although it makes quite a racket, as it features the Glasgow noise band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8pokXQaDwE\">Okishima Island Tourist Association</a>. The premise is simple: FK Alexander serenades one audience member at a time to Judy Garland\u2019s final recording of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

This year, one third of that trio, Joe Barnes, doubles up with Henry Perryment in another excellent \u2013 if not quite so eye-catching \u2013 sketch hour. The conceit finds Barnes and Parryment presenting \u201ca selection of characters and occurrences from around the world on a single day in 2016\u201d. In practice, that plays out much like any other sketch show, save that, when this twosome are good \u2013 Perryment deploying his acting chops; winsome Barnes flirting with the audience \u2013 it can be very funny indeed. <strong>BL</strong></p> <h2>30 Cecil Street</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/festivals/2011-festivals/edinburgh-festival-2011/core-artists/dan-canham-30-cecil-street/\">9.30pm, Forest Fringe</a> (until 27 August)</p> <p>Part of a double bill with Paper Cinema\u2019s enchanting DIY movie <a href=\"http://www.louboutinsale.me.uk/#thepapercinema.com\">NightFlyer</a>, this show from Dan Canham raises the ghosts at a derelict Limerick theatre. Using sound, music, movement and gaffer tape \u2013 as if at the scene of an accident \u2013 Canham brings the past alive. The walls themselves seem to leak memories of past glories, one last time before the place finally falls silent. It\u2019s a spine-tingling performance, laced with ideas about the ephemeral nature of theatre and its place in the community. <strong>LG</strong></p> <h2><strong>Richard Gadd</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/richard-gadd-monkey-see-monkey-do\">9.45pm, Banshee Labyrinth</a> (until 28 August)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eaac1c461fee96d1dbebecb1d53e269aa417c8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eaac1c461fee96d1dbebecb1d53e269aa417c8c/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Open-vein confession \u2026 Richard Gadd\u2019s Monkey See Monkey Do.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Open-vein confession \u2026 Richard Gadd\u2019s Monkey See Monkey Do.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his earliest shows, full of sex, violence and debasement, there was a sense that a less cartoonish Gadd might be evading detection beneath the surface schlock.

In this new solo play, Kitson portrays William, a lonely writer cooped up in his \u201cwarehouse\u201d office, 12 years into creating a story about a woman and a communicative rodent. Kitson interrupts the action to narrate, in flashback, the events that led William to this point.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s dogs are becoming less fertile. Researchers who have systematically examined canine sperm over a span of 26 years say that overall sperm quality has been in decline.</p> <p>Environmental chemicals are implicated. And the study may throw light on the fertility changes in male humans.</p> <p>Richard Lea, of Nottingham University\u2019s school of veterinary medicine and science, and colleagues collected samples of semen from a carefully monitored population of labradors, border collies, German shepherds and golden retrievers used as stud to breed dogs intended to help the disabled. They tested 1,925 samples of ejaculate from a total of 232 different dogs at the rate of between 42 and 97 dogs every year.</p> <p>And they found a drop in sperm motility \u2013 the ability to swim in a straight line - of 2.4% per year from 1988 to 1998. Even once some dogs were excluded from the study because their fertility was in some way in question, from 2002 to 2014 the scientists still measured a decline of 1.2% per year. </p> <p>They also confirmed the presence of environmental chemicals known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/uks-last-resident-killer-whales-doomed-to-extinction\">PCBs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/10/phthalates-plastics-chemicals-research-analysis\">phthalates</a> in the canine semen, and in testicles of dogs castrated by veterinary surgeons in the course of routine neutering treatment. These chemicals are ubiquitous, and have been linked to both fertility issues and birth defects. </p> <p>At the heart of the research is not the dog, but the question of male human fertility. Repeated tests over more than 70 years have shown a downward trend in male fertility, but there has always been argument about the consistency and accuracy of the findings.</p> <p>\u201cWhy the dog?\u201d said Dr Lea. \u201cApart from the fact that it is a great population of animals to work with, dogs live in our homes, they sometimes eat the same food, they are exposed to the same environmental contaminants that we are, so the underlying hypothesis is that the dog is really a type of sentinel for human exposure.\u201d</p> <p>One analysis of human sperm counts examined 60 separate studies over a 50-year span. But different research teams used different techniques, and in any case the advances in laboratory equipment over many decades meant that it would always be difficult to compare like with like. </p> <p>There has been much less doubt about measured increases over the decades in rates of testicular cancer, and a condition known to affect a proportion of boy babies at birth: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/19/hitler-really-did-have-only-one-testicle-german-researcher-claims\">cryptorchidism</a>, in which the testicles do not descend normally to the scrotum. </p> <p>The Nottingham canine study group resolved a number of problems of consistency. All the dogs were healthy and well cared for. The semen sampling was supervised by Professor Gary England, Nottingham\u2019s foundation dean of veterinary science, who launched the project, and all the samples were handled by just three technicians in the 26-year study. The researchers also looked at the dog\u2019s food, and the chemicals in the food.</p> <p>The decline in canine sperm quality does not, for the moment, augur the end of the dog as a species. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely\u201d Dr Lea said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say at what point this becomes a problem.\u201d </p> <p>The researchers saw increases in cryptorchidism in the study dogs\u2019 pups over the years. They also saw a clear connection between environmental chemicals and declining fertility. How this might work, however, is not so clear. </p> <p>\u201cIf you think about it, we are exposed to a cocktail. Who knows how many chemicals are out there and what they are doing? It gets even more complicated when you start to look at the effects of mixtures of chemicals,\u201d Dr Lea said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have been able to do here is just to pull out ones that we know are present, and we have tested those in terms of their effects and it does suggest there is an impact. The next stage \u2013 and it is a big next stage - is trying to tease out what else is there and how those chemicals are interacting.\u201d</p>",

And after Monday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court win and a clean sweep in the elections</a> to Labour\u2019s national executive committee, support for Corbyn shows no signs of abating \u2013 despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/762699781546381312?s=09\">continued suggestions</a> that those supporters are nothing more than an abusive rabble. How many of the journalists writing panicked screeds about these awful people have actually met any of them, do you think? I ask because writing about the Corbyn phenomenon over the last year means I\u2019ve met probably hundreds of his supporters and to be honest, I find dealing with them the most pleasant element of writing about Corbyn.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, I went to a political event that included a branch of Momentum. All young women; they were energetic, funny and very friendly. Two weeks ago, I had a debate with a Momentum member about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/14/does-jeremy-corbyn-have-a-media-strategy-apparently-not\">Corbyn\u2019s media strategy</a>. Of the two of us, it was me who was the ruder, more impatient one. When Corbyn ran for leadership last year, I visited phone banks for him dozens of times, and spent hours in the company of the very people who went on to found Momentum. I told myself I was <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/11/britains-bernie-sanders-is-about-to-win-big-jeremy-corbyn-labour/\">researching a piece</a>; actually I think I just liked talking to them.</p> <p>Sure, my experiences of these Corbyn supporters might not be representative. But they do suggest that the depiction of them as a madcap bunch of deluded cultists is not representative either. Broadly speaking, the media has failed to understand the political moment in the Labour party; it has shown a damning lack of interest in the fact that people who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands \u2013 preferring instead to dismiss them as an angry mob.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'People who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One half of that description is accurate, however. Corbyn supporters may not be a mob, but they are angry. And to understand why, it is useful to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/jeremy-gilbert/is-momentum-mob-no-this-is-what-democracy-looks-like\">consider the words</a> of the academic Jeremy Gilbert, a longstanding Labour member and activist who has joined Momentum: \u201cMomentum is simply trying to give a voice to a body of opinion which has been widespread throughout the country for many years, but has been denied any kind of place in our public life since the early days of New Labour. It is a body of opinion which believes, with good reason, that the embrace of neoliberal economics and neoconservative foreign policy under Blair was a disaster \u2026 Naturally some of those voices, suppressed for so long, sound raucous, aggressive and uncouth.\u201d</p> <p>The anger that commentators detect in the Corbyn movement, in my experience, is not a symptom of the fact that it has been infiltrated by bullies \u2013 but that its members feel as though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/labour-coup-disastrous-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour coup</a> is as much an attack on their right to participate in public discourse as it is on Corbyn.</p> <p>Everything the left traditionally stands for \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/04/theresa-may-wrong-cat-deportation\">human rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\">socialism</a> to a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/02/the-iraq-wars- real-victims- laurie-penny- and-the- narcissistic-left/\">foreign policy driven by diplomacy</a> \u2013 has been, at best, marginalised and, at worst, actively mocked in mainstream political discourse since the 1970s. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the depiction of the trade unions, the last bastions of organised British socialism, as insidious barons intent on wrecking British life (a claim that sounds particularly ludicrous when made by newspapers who supported the Conservatives at the last election \u2013 a party consisting of members of the actual landed gentry).</p> <p>I am yet to meet a single Corbynite who is naive about Corbyn\u2019s failings as a leader, the great challenges he faces, or who does not want to win a general election. But the reason so many have coalesced around him anyway is because they view his leadership as the only opportunity they have had in at least 30 years to see their views finally represented in public life. The Labour rebels\u2019 attempt to unseat him is, in their minds, as much an attempt to excommunicate the wider left as it is to get rid of Corbyn himself. Perhaps the most salient evidence of this is the decision to charge affiliate members \u00a325 to vote in the leadership election, and ban outright members who joined fewer than six months ago \u2013 a decision that has now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">overturned in court</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pd7c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2627517\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a06c0ae4b07e27cb7e00e3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\">Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Worse still for Corbyn supporters, the policy positions they have taken over the last 30 years have often been proven right. Lack of social housing has led to a spiralling housing crisis; the deregulation of the financial industry would have caused economic collapse had it not been for state intervention; queasiness around public ownership has caused escalating transport costs and arguably the shambles that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/aug/08/southern-rail-strike-begins-live-updates\">Southern Railway</a>; inequality is the UK\u2019s most pressing social issue; a reluctance to rein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels\">fossil fuel companies</a> has led to a climate emergency; and even Tony Blair accepts that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/25/tony-blair-sorry-iraq-war-mistakes-admits-conflict-role-in-rise-of-isis\">Iraq war may have led to the rise of Isis</a>. This is why so many Corbyn supporters are upset by the coup, and why they have decided to back him unequivocally, in spite of the incompetence that has at times been part of his leadership.</p> <p>I have a lot of sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/owen-smith-plan-low-paid-workers-labour-leadership\">Owen Smith</a> supporters who are horrified by Labour\u2019s poll ratings. But I have zero sympathy with those in the party who have been utterly unwilling to engage with Corbyn supporters, and who have not reflected on why they lost control of their party to someone they so clearly regard as useless. There are simply not enough delusional Leninists in Britain to make up the entirety of Corbyn\u2019s support \u2013 these are ordinary British voters who want radical solutions to a growing number of crises. And until they are listened to and taken seriously, Corbyn and the movement keeping him in power is not going anywhere.</p>",

Switzerland voted narrowly in a 2014 referendum to cap EU immigration and is now faced with a constitutional obligation to apply the vote. </p> <p>The problem, as both <a href=\"https://infacts.org/swiss-send-message-alps-pennines/\">InFacts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/swiss-could-become-brexits-latest-casualty-european-union-migration/\">Politico</a> observed last week, is that curbing immigration would violate the EU\u2019s fundamental principle linking free movement to single market access, jeopardising a raft of vital bilateral deals between the Swiss and the union \u2013 their largest trading partner. Sound familiar? </p> <p>So far, Brussels has made it clear to Bern that free movement is strictly non-negotiable, and Switzerland \u2013 caught between the rock of its referendum result and the hard place of EU principles \u2013 has admitted Brexit makes things tricky. It may well be that a second referendum is the only way out: watch this space.</p> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>With parliament on its hols there is little of consequence in SW1, but the row over David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list rumbles on.

In the past, China has declared it will follow applicable laws <a href=\"http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/06/11/12/0200000000AEN20160611002400315F.htm\">and always \u201cuphold the normal order\u201d</a> when fishing on the high seas.</p> <p>No one knows how much fish China hauls each year from distant waters, but in 2013 the Pew Charitable Trusts estimated it at 4.6m tonnes \u2013 far more than Beijing reported to the UN. The bulk of this fishing takes place off the coast of west Africa, but Chinese fleets are increasingly plying waters off Antarctica and Central and South America. </p> <p>In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/argentina-sinks-chinese-trawler-during-pursuit-for-illegal-fishing\">Argentina sank a Chinese boat</a> it claimed was fishing illegally in its waters.

In other words, government investments in fishing fleets are not producing a corresponding increase in revenues.</p> <p>In Fujian province, for instance, the number of distant-water vessels grew 149% from 2012 to 2014, but the production value increased only 63%, according to Greenpeace.</p> <p>China\u2019s fishing subsidies \u201cneed to be reformed in order to promote healthy development and an industry which can sustain healthy oceans,\u201d said Li Shuo, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia and an author of the report.<br></p>",

The email they had sent was well over 140 characters and I found it too difficult to digest. In order to even get through it I had to record myself reading it aloud in a series of Snapchats and watch them back. Some of it was difficult to decipher, as the sound effect of a dog\u2019s tongue every time I opened my mouth muffled some of the words but, from what I remember, they wanted to know if being funny online was part of a comedian\u2019s job, and if there\u2019s a pressure to live up to the expectations of everyone with an internet connection.</p> <p>The answer is simple. Being funny on social media is not a comedian\u2019s job, it\u2019s their duty. We\u2019re not artists any more. We\u2019re meme conduits. Gif deliverers. There is no longer any value in laughter. Retweets are our only currency. </p> <p>It is with great sadness, then, that I fire up my iMacintosh G3 every day to see some comedians tweeting opinions instead of fail videos. To see some comedians telling the followings they built from being funny what their political views are.

Changing your mind on the internet is unforgivable and something no one is allowed to do. You tweeted you like Frubes in 2009? You better not get caught slagging off lunchbox yoghurt tubes in 2016, you hypocrite. On the internet, your views are your views for ever, regardless of societal change.</p> <p>The best way to not offend anyone on Twitter is to delete your account. Even then you run the risk of offending Milo Yiannopoulos, who recently had his account deleted. The fact you even have that choice is an honour. Check your privilege. Even if you\u2019re being ironic and you explain that critics might\u2019ve had a sense of humour bypass, should you really be joking about bypasses? Or senses? Some people are blind. Some can\u2019t smell. Others have no sense of taste. (Those ones are on GooglePlus.) </p> <p>If you delve deep enough into the internet superhighway you might stumble on a movie-talkie website called YouTubes. This is where spoken word artists will become the human manifestation of think-pieces and faux-passionately tell you we all need to \u2018log off\u2019 so we can reconnect as people, in person, face to face, in the real world. They\u2019ll then demand you like their video, subscribe to their channel and share it on Pinterest or something. They\u2019re wrong. The real world is too dangerous. You can\u2019t get punched in an @reply. Unless the person has tweeted a reply to your joke which explains your joke back to you, in which case you will be forced to smack yourself in the face until you draw blood.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just about tweeting. Retweeting is also vital. Play the game! You retweet my back, I\u2019ll quote tweet yours. In summary, if you want to be a successful Twitter comedian, which wasn\u2019t even the question posed by the Guardian, you\u2019ve got to log out of your feelings and log into your meme-catalogue.

Despite ministers trying to shut down the planning process and silence legitimate peaceful protest, local people do still have a powerful voice and are not afraid to use it.

The dreaded cinematic universe</h2> <p>Ever since the Avengers assembled across multiple movies, every other studio has been eagerly brainstorming ways to turn a linear franchise into a criss-crossing \u201ccinematic universe\u201d. Those two words have been attached to everything from the Fast &amp; Furious series to Hasbro\u2019s films. This year has seen Warners\u2019 DC masterplan start to collapse, with their attempt to replicate Marvel\u2019s impressive handiwork feeling laboured. While Captain America, Iron Man and their cohorts zipped around effortlessly from film to film, Batman and Superman have sluggishly stomped between efforts, grimly smashing everything in their sights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/dc-comics-cinematic-universe-struggles\">What can DC do to save its struggling comic book cinematic universe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not exactly breaking news that studios are eager for cash, but cinematic universes have made them blind, deaf and dumb with greed. The sharp drop-offs for both Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad show that anticipation and brand awareness will only get you so far, and that audiences, savvy enough to understand what\u2019s being constructed beyond the framework of the film they\u2019re watching, need something more to maintain their interest. Everything now hinges on next year for Warners, with Wonder Woman and Justice League testing both the loyalty of their fanbase and the studio\u2019s ability to learn from their mistakes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88a2f4698779562717c66e2dc0201b24bc65b785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a2f4698779562717c66e2dc0201b24bc65b785/0_0_4919_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the many China-based scenes in Now You See Me 2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the many China-based scenes in Now You See Me 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2. Eastern promises</h2> <p>The growing importance of the Chinese market, and studios\u2019 pandering to overseas audiences to ensure added profits, have never been more noticeable than during this year\u2019s set of blockbusters. Independence Day: Resurgence crowbarred in two Chinese characters, lines of dialogue in Chinese and prominent placement of the Chinese drink Moon Milk, while around one-third of Now You See Me 2 was set in Macau.</p> <p>Now, adding some internationality to the often dull uniformity of American blockbusters is no bad thing, but these decisions aren\u2019t led by creative impulses. A blockbuster that feels like a commercial product is hardly a unicorn, but the Chinese influence is making movies feel more mechanical than ever before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8951d5ac149c936f7f92a8eee6a22ba86c82f9c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8951d5ac149c936f7f92a8eee6a22ba86c82f9c8/0_60_3444_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Patton in Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Patton in Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. Franchise non-starters</h2> <p>The only thing a studio wants more than a successful sequel is a film so successful that it will need a sequel of its own. This summer, Universal, coming off a record year, hoped that its ambitiously titled video-game adaptation Warcraft: The Beginning would launch a new set of related films, but the $160m adventure was a washout in the US, making less than $50m. It might have clawed back some cash in China, but local interest has been so poor that a sequel is unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/the-legend-of-tarzan-flaws-africa-colonialism\">King of the bungle: why Tarzan will never be OK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warners was also hoping that an umpteenth Tarzan film would lead to further adventures, but current box office suggests otherwise. A $335m global total is no disaster but with a $180m budget attached, making more jungle-set capers would be a risky decision. The Nice Guys was also given one of the most blatantly open endings of the season but, despite strong reviews, it failed to catch on with audiences so more instalments seem unlikely. The original films that have secured sequels this season are The Secret Life of Pets and Lights Out, showing that animation and horror are still the most reliable genres in the business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7670092a5ab9ce81c24be7e4a1ce2502fa41d25c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7670092a5ab9ce81c24be7e4a1ce2502fa41d25c/591_0_3271_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by LMK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Franchise fatigue</h2> <p>While audiences and critics were happy to see a sequel to Finding Nemo (Finding Dory has become the biggest animated film of all time in the US), they\u2019ve been less impressed with most other sequels offered up this summer. Globally, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows made less than half of the original\u2019s surprise $493m take; Alice Through the Looking Glass made less than a third of Alice in Wonderland\u2019s $1bn total; and The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War made just $164m in comparison to the $396m that Snow White brought in.</p> <p>The first Alice and Snow White films worked because of the awareness that their title characters brought with them, but audiences were less familiar with anything that came after (the Huntsman plot was an entirely new invention), while a Ninja Turtles sequel was hardly at the top of anyone\u2019s wish-list. Even no-brainers under-performed, such as X-Men: Apocalypse ($534m to Future Past\u2019s $747m) and Ice Age: Collision Course ($288m to Continental Drift\u2019s $877m), suggesting a general franchise boredom. But all of these films had one other thing in common ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"605893726e333075b06b505cd0881b4e20b801dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/605893726e333075b06b505cd0881b4e20b801dc/371_155_1660_997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lawrence in X-Men: Apocalypse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lawrence in X-Men: Apocalypse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20TH CENTURY FOX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Bad reviews</h2> <p>It\u2019s the most obvious point to be making but one of the major problems this season is that Hollywood just isn\u2019t making good films. The battle to lure audiences away from Netflix was temporarily won last year thanks to event movies that were loved by fans and critics (Star Wars: The Force Awakens; Jurassic World; Inside Out; The Martian) but this year\u2019s crop has seen a major dip in quality. Angry DC fans tried to shut down Rotten Tomatoes last week after the negative Suicide Squad reviews, but the film\u2019s sharp drop-off shows the reviews were representative of the film\u2019s general lousiness.</p> <p>With audiences tweeting their reactions, good word of mouth is even more important, which explains why the films that have succeeded this summer have been the ones that have benefited from critical support. The season\u2019s biggest hit, Finding Dory, has a 94% Rotten Tomatoes rating, Captain America: Civil War boasts 90%, while surprise smash The Secret Life of Pets is up to 75%. That two of these three hits are animated, along with Zootropolis\u2019 huge $1bn take in March (a film which had a 98% rating), also indicate that children remain the most reliable demographic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d96c98969bbaa66e9f2ba37da2ea0cd70e0d4f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d96c98969bbaa66e9f2ba37da2ea0cd70e0d4f01/0_1191_7854_4715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zootopia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zootopia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The success of Zootropolis, along with pre-summer 2016 hits The Jungle Book, The Revenant and Deadpool, also shows that seasons have shifted at the box office. The summer months and the Christmas period are no longer the only times when studios unleash their major releases. Audiences are no longer saving up until June but are splashing out on Imax and 3D surcharges all year round. </p> <p>This summer might have been a disappointment, but this spring definitely wasn\u2019t, and this autumn and winter, bringing along new Star Wars and Harry Potter spin-offs, is unlikely to be either ...</p>",
  "<p>On the north-west coast of Turkey, atop a hill overlooking the mouth of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Dardanelles\">Dardanelles</a>, lies the memory of a city which blurs the line between myth and history like no other. </p> <p>In mythology, Troy inspired the Greek epic poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/homer\">Homer</a> to conceive his two great works in (probably) the eighth century BC: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/30/iliad-war-charlotte-higgins\">the Iliad</a> \u2013 set in the final year of the decade-long siege of Troy by a coalition of Greek states \u2013 and its \u201csequel\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/30/journeys-in-literature-the-odyssey-by-homer-the-first-step\">the Odyssey</a>.</p> <p>In reality, it was said the city witnessed one of the greatest battles in Greek history. In his History of the Peloponnesian War, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thucydides-Greek-historian\">fifth-century BC historian Thucydides</a> describes the Trojan war as \u201cnotable beyond all previous wars\u201d.</p> <p>But the precise location \u2013 and even the very existence \u2013 of Troy has been a source of dispute throughout the ages. Reputedly razed after a battle in around 1200 BC, the city was later reinhabited by both the Greeks and Romans and renamed Ilios/Ilium. It decayed into insignificance by 500BC, and was lost until two centuries ago.</p> <p>Now Troy\u2019s location is widely believed to be the site of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisarlik\">Hisarlik</a> in Turkey: essentially a mound of 30 metres or so in height, with the remnants of stone walls and lonely structures scattered in the grassland. Within this meadowed hill may lie 4,000 years of Trojan history.</p> <p>Indeed, there was likely not just one city here, but at least 10. The Hisarlik site contains layer upon layer of ancient settlement, from the first circa 3000 BC to the last around 500 BC.

He was \u201camong the luckiest individuals ever to put a shovel into the earth\u201d, writes archaeologist and historian Eric Cline in his<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-trojan-war-a-very-short-introduction-9780199760275?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\"> short introduction to the Trojan War</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"701b8946f9f2d252e28749b44c12aaba9d0e3118\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701b8946f9f2d252e28749b44c12aaba9d0e3118/72_0_3569_4458/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Heinrich Schliemann\u2019, (1822-1890), German archaeologist, 1893.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heinrich Schliemann (1822-1890)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How the amateur archaeologist Schliemann managed to find Troy and kick off the field of Aegean prehistory is nothing short of astounding. He was, however, prone to falsifying his excavation journals, which might also put the veracity of that childhood dream in doubt.</p> <p>In April 1870, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Hisarlik\">Schliemann began to dig at Hisarlik</a>. Soon he claimed to have found the \u201cburnt city\u201d of Homer\u2019s Troy, and among it King Priam\u2019s treasure \u2013 some of which he later <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priam%27s_Treasure#/media/File:Sophia_schliemann_treasure.jpg\">famously gave his wife to wear</a>. In the process, however, \u201che threw away the thing he was going to look for,\u201d says Cline.</p> <p>Schliemann dug through \u2013 and decimated \u2013 layers and layers of Bronze Age Troy (1700-1200 BC), until he reached what is now known as Troy II: a city more than 1,000 years older than the Troy of the Iliad.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look on excavation maps, there\u2019s a gap in the middle where it says \u2018Palace removed by Schliemann\u2019. He got Priam\u2019s palace and then threw it away,\u201d Cline says. \u201cHe found Troy, but he also destroyed Troy.\u201d</p> <h2>A grand Bronze Age city</h2> <p>The city of Troy started as a simple settlement in around 3000 BC, growing and thriving on trade, agriculture and fishing. There were found to be nine major phases of construction before the city\u2019s major destruction, in <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/trojan-war\">approximately 1180 BC</a>.</p> <p>However, since there aren\u2019t any contemporary texts that describe Troy, and as Schliemann managed to ruin the remains of what could well have been King Priam\u2019s city, we actually know very little about it. </p> <p>The historicity of the Trojan War and the fall of the city at the hands of the Greeks (the narrative of the Iliad) was still questionable until the groundbreaking work of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/19/obituaries/manfred-korfmann-63-is-dead-expanded-excavation-at-troy.html?_r=0\">archaeologist Manfred Korfmann</a> in the 1990s. Until then, excavations in Hisarlik had revealed only an insignificant town, but Korfmann and his team discovered a lower city that covered 75 acres: 15 times larger than was previously thought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db332f8445c5367fc760c1b03c4397267dee6b4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db332f8445c5367fc760c1b03c4397267dee6b4d/0_286_3467_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reconstruction of the Homeric city of Troy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A reconstruction of the Homeric city of Troy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: G Dagli Orti/De Agostini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These findings suggested that Troy was, \u201cby the standards of this region at that time, very large indeed, and most certainly of supraregional importance,\u201d Korfmann <a href=\"http://archive.archaeology.org/0405/etc/troy.html\">wrote in Archaeology magazine</a> in 2004. \u201cIts citadel was unparalleled in the wider region and, as far as hitherto known, unmatched anywhere in southeastern Europe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what nailed it for me for the identification,\u201d says Cline, who suggests the Troy that Homer describes could in fact be a hybrid of Troy VI and VIIa. The sixth construction layer is thought to have been destroyed by an earthquake, rather than the Greeks \u2013 although one tenuous theory suggests that the legendary Trojan horse was an allegory for the god Poseidon, whose animal was a horse. Also known as \u201cEarth shaker\u201d, Poseidon could have represented the destruction of the city by a natural disaster.</p> <p>On the other hand, Troy VIIa \u2013 a city with much less grandeur than the Troy described by Homer \u2013 was almost certainly destroyed by a major battle, as archaeologists have found arrowheads in the remains of the citadel. So is this evidence of the Trojan war? </p> <p>Nobody is sure. Cline suggests that with the whole area in turmoil at the time, a single major battle between forces of east and west is unlikely. \u201cThe fall of Troy is part of the larger picture of the fall of the entire Bronze Age,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole G8 of the ancient world goes down.\u201d </p> <p>With a little creativity, however, Homer\u2019s words can be made to place Priam\u2019s city at the site in Turkey. The great poet says Troy is steep and windy, much like Hisarlik. He describes it as \u201cstrong-founded\u201d, \u201cgate-towering\u201d, with \u201cwide ways\u201d (streets) and an \u201cindestructible citadel\u201d. He presents an image of a large city run by a powerful elite, protected by magnificent walls; a grand Bronze Age city that would have housed between 4,000 and 10,000 inhabitants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5351d6e301c51bca6c22fff81da8fa3acaf0f741\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5351d6e301c51bca6c22fff81da8fa3acaf0f741/0_256_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of the ancient remains in Hisarlik, Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of the ancient remains in Hisarlik, Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is from these walls that some of Troy\u2019s greatest losses are witnessed in the Iliad. In book 22, there is the heart-wrenching moment when Hector\u2019s wife sees the fallen hero\u2019s dead body being dragged by Achilles in front of the city: \u201cThe running horses dragged him at random toward the hollow ships of the Achaians. The darkness of night misted over the eyes of Andromache.\u201d</p> <p>The walls that play such an important role for the Troy of the Iliad could also be linked to Hisarlik: parts of the bottom walls, still visible today, are 4-5m wide and 8m high. These walls had multiple towers and gates that would have led directly to the city centre.</p> <p>The citadel, home to the ruling elite, was a densely occupied area with monumental buildings and two-storey houses of extensive rooms. As city planning didn\u2019t come along until the classical period of the Iron Age, according to Joritt Kelder of Oxford University\u2019s Oriental Institute, \u201cso far the only real division is who has power and who doesn\u2019t. The power was clearly focused on the citadel, with the king and his immediate family and friends.\u201d </p> <h2>A multicultural city</h2> <p>There is no doubt that Troy was a major city of strategic importance throughout the Bronze Age. Its location guarding the Dardanelles meant it was effectively the gateway to the Black Sea, and held an important trade route.</p> <p>Sandwiched between the Mycenaean world to the west and the Hittites to the east, it was the meeting point of two opposing cultures. And it seems Troy thrived as a multicultural city: archaeologists have found evidence of cultural foreign influence, such as local potters making Mycenaean pots with their own Trojan touch. There is also evidence of extensive trade with Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and the Bronze Age civilisations in Greece.<strong> </strong>It was, for the time, a very cosmopolitan city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec7a278ae3b3feafac0777e33120a59d7b89b700\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec7a278ae3b3feafac0777e33120a59d7b89b700/108_658_4523_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A depiction of archaeologist Schliemann\u2019s devastating impact on the historic Hisarlik site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A depiction of archaeologist Schliemann\u2019s devastating impact on the historic Hisarlik site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like London,\u201d says Kelder, \u201ca capital with lots of foreign influence as a result of trade and migration. I have no doubt that foreigners were residents of Troy in the 14th\u201313th century BC as well.\u201d</p> <p>Not only did the city seem to accept different cultures, but Troy and the mythology behind it had an impact on a global scale. The Persian king Xerxes, on his expedition through Greece, was said to have made an offering to Athena at Troy. One hundred and fifty years later Alexander the Great, who went on to conquer the Persian empire, stopped off at Troy on his journey, and allegedly took the shield of Achilles from the temple of Athena. He also carried a copy of the Iliad on his expeditions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/10/lost-cities-3-muziris-india-kerala-ancient-port-black-pepper\">Lost cities #3 \u2013 Muziris: did black pepper cause the demise of India's ancient port?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even the Romans claimed to have descended from the Trojans. In the Aeneid, Roman poet Virgil narrates the story of the Trojan Aeneas, who escaped from the war, travelled to Italy and turned out to be one of Rome\u2019s founding fathers.

He even doesn\u2019t resent being knocked down by Erislandy Savon, a Cuban heavyweight in the fine tradition and a nephew of the great Felix. On Monday night Okolie went over again, having been stopped in a round by Savon before the tournament, but got up and gave a decent account of himself to go the distance.<br></p> <p><br>\u201cIt was good and bad,\u201d he said, as a psychology student might. \u201cBad because I didn\u2019t get the decision, good because I\u2019ve progressed since our last fight. This time I went the three rounds. The knockdown took a lot of the momentum that I was trying to build.\u201d<br>His seemingly modest effort has to be put in context: Savon has had more than 250 amateur bouts; Okolie has now had 26 - and he would fight the Cuban again tomorrow if he could. He reckons he could be among the top four amateur heavyweights in the world, and says he is learning new tricks in every fight. Good place to learn them: at the Olympics against a Cuban.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking knowing there\u2019s someone better than me out there but it can\u2019t stay that way much longer.\u201d<br><br>Okolie said he took a call before the fight from the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, who took a close decision against Savon in London four years ago. \u201cHe told me to just relax,\u201d Okolie said. But not to the point of going on the canvas, he might have added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a91c2ee4b0f5d064841a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T23:56:33.400Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that\u2019s game, set and match for Serena Williams</strong> as she beats Alize Cornet in two sets (7-6, 6-2.)

It was always a tough draw, with the Frenchwoman ranked world No3 to Davis\u2019s 12, but the 23-year-old from London was determined to dwell on the positives, even in defeat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. I came prepared today and you can have a hard draw and that\u2019s just judo. You get beaten on the day, that\u2019s just the way it is. You\u2019ve got to come back stronger, fitter. I 100% believe my day will come. I know I will be world champion, European champion and hopefully Olympic champion one day,\u201d she said. Tokyo 2020 will be her time, she vowed.</p> <p>She said she was mentally stronger than any of her opponents, largely because of her background. She was brought up by a single mother on a west London council estate and said the hard knocks toughened her up:</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything as a kid growing up. I didn\u2019t have a lot of materialistic things. My mum didn\u2019t have a lot of money. So dealing with those things, and my mum had quite a tough upbringing in life, she came over here from Jamaica with me to give us a better life. She always taught me not to take things for granted and anything you do get in life you\u2019ve got to work hard for. I think that\u2019s where my mental strength and toughness comes from, my mum being a single mum and how hard she struggled. I knew that I would have to put the work in in life to make something of myself and not be poor. So it really comes from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada8a8d1254c66fa49117500b04b6d022628d8ed/0_0_3500_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women\u2019s sabre individual quarter-finals continues at the Carioca Arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:20:58.265Z\">at 5.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a8ade0e4b03b51a99e120c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T16:07:05.322Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paul Drinkhall is in table tennis action now against Andrej Gacina of Croatia in round four</strong>.

A year-long Global Witness <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/myanmarjade/\">investigation published last year</a> found that multiple jade companies were linked to former dictator Than Shwe, high-ranking ministers in the army and former junta, and US-wanted narcotics kingpin Wei Hsueh Kang. </p> <p>Official production of the jade sector was estimated by Global Witness to be worth $31bn (\u00a323.5bn) in 2014, equivalent to nearly<a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/myanmar/gdp\"> half of Myanmar\u2019s GDP</a>, yet Kachin state \u2013 the world\u2019s largest jade producer \u2013 is racked by abject poverty, displacement due to civil war and drug addiction.</p> <p>According to Global Witness, most of Myanmar\u2019s jade is exported or smuggled to China, which borders Kachin state.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-wins-myanmar-landmark-election\">which came to power after a sweeping victory in elections last November</a>, is Myanmar\u2019s first civilian ruling authority since 1962.

After nearly 20 years of peace between rebels and the government,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/burmese-take-kachin-outpost\"> civil war resumed in 2011</a>, in part fuelled by unequal distribution of jade profits.

  "<h2>Jenny Agutter, actor</h2> <p>I was still at ballet boarding school when I went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/12/features.culture1\">Nic Roeg</a> about the role. His wife had seen me in a BBC drama and, after school one day, I met him in his flat, wearing my little grey skirt. It had been longer \u2013 but when you\u2019re at boarding school, your parents can\u2019t keep an eye on your uniform, so it was quite mini. Nic had it reproduced for the film.</p> <p>Shooting in Australia was extraordinary, though some people were terrified. They thought everything in the outback was trying to kill them, which it was, particularly the snakes. But I was never scared. There was a motel that had these draught-excluders on the bottom of its doors. I said: \u201cWhy in the world would you have draught-excluders? It\u2019s so hot at night, I just leave my door open.\u201d Someone said: \u201cThey\u2019re not draught-excluders. They\u2019re to keep the snakes out. They like to get into bed with you. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/heavily-pregnant-deadly-snake-found-under-fridge-by-australian-woman\">king browns are quite poisonous</a>.\u201d I said: \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll close the door.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc6863ef086e2fd6e40639c47ab32cafcad35ba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6863ef086e2fd6e40639c47ab32cafcad35ba8/0_107_2248_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was inhibited\u2019 \u2026 Jenny Agutter in the swimming scene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was inhibited\u2019 \u2026 Jenny Agutter in the swimming scene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We travelled to so many different places. I was staying in a caravan, but that got stuck somewhere. I slept in a riverbed, lying on a brass bed we were using in the film, with a mosquito net thrown over it. And I remember seeing these huge clouds of flying ants at one point. They were dropping to the ground because of the rain.</p> <p>Nic wanted the scene in which I swam naked to be straightforward. He wanted me to be uninhibited \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t. I was a very inhibited young woman. I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable about the intention of the scene, but that doesn\u2019t make you feel any better. There was no one around, apart from Nic in the distance with his camera. No lights, nothing. Once he\u2019d got the shot, I got out of the water and dressed as quickly as possible. I don\u2019t think people were as obsessed with nudity back then as they are today. <br></p> <p>I remember having too much wine over dinner in Darwin and then filming hungover. The crew drank a lot. It was like travelling around with a bunch of circus people. I went back to school for a couple of months and was really dozy, not very together.

Just press the release button on top, pull it out, lift the lid and shake into the bin. A 30 second job at most.</p> <p>Clearing obstructions from the brush bar is simple.

For comparison, iRobot\u2019s Roomba 980 with visual navigation also costs \u00a3800, while bump-navigation robot vacuums start at around \u00a3150 and up.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Dyson 360 Eye is the best performing robot vacuum available. It\u2019s simply better at cleaning than all the others, but it also has its downsides. It can\u2019t get under as many things as a Roomba, it still bumps into thin things and it still can\u2019t clean everything, meaning it\u2019s not the only vacuum you need to own.</p> <p>Its smaller footprint makes a difference in its ability to get in and around table and chair legs, and it takes up less space when sat on its dock, which makes it a lot easier to live with in cramped flats and terraces.</p> <p>Robot vacuum cleaners are designed to vacuum everyday or at least several times a week, which means that out-and-out cleaning power doesn\u2019t matter as much. The regular cleaning never lets it get to particularly bad levels, and if you spill something you\u2019re more likely to get out a vacuum then and there and clear it up rather than leave it for the robot.</p> <p>You could therefore argue that a less capable robot could do the job just as well, but the 360 Eye also doesn\u2019t need to run as frequently as some others to maintain a perceivable level of clean, precisely because it gets more on its first sweep. It\u2019s also easy to transfer between floors to cover different areas on different days.</p> <p>It costs a lot, it isn\u2019t perfect and it certainly isn\u2019t a must-buy for everyone. But it is the best robot vacuum right now.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> fits in tighter gaps, cleans better on each run, makes a more pleasant noise, better edge cleaning, easy maintenance, good app, simple scheduling</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>can\u2019t get under as much furniture, expensive, cannot be your only vacuum, requires internet access for most features beyond push-button cleaning, can get stuck like all robot vacuums</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd3824bbb119e91cf403e36df9e58741a1d23ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3824bbb119e91cf403e36df9e58741a1d23ccd/0_0_4266_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dyson 360 eye review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dyson 360 has a smaller diameter than the Roomba 880 pictured here, but is taller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/24/irobot-roomba-880-review-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-thats-almost-a-pet\"><strong>iRobot Roomba 880 review: a robotic vacuum cleaner that\u2019s almost a pet</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/04/dyson-v8-review-absolute-animal-cordless-vacuum\"><strong>Dyson V8 Absolute review: finally a cordless alternative to an upright</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/05/tried-and-test-five-best-vacuum-cleaners-dyson\"><strong>Best vacuum cleaners?

  "<p>In the long history of the Games there can\u2019t have been many sadder silver medalists than Yulia Efimova. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the race, or that she finished second. She said herself that it was \u201cthe best I can do right now\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/efimova-and-sun-on-podium-as-king-delivers-victory-for-clean-sport\">Efimova and Sun on podium as King delivers 'victory for clean sport'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the fact that winning it meant she finally had to talk to the press. And everything else she has been through too; the boos she has heard every night in the pool, and the blunt opinions expressed by her fellow competitors. </p> <p>Not least the one who beat her, the USA\u2019s Lilly King, who said over and again that Efimova shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to swim here, and refused to congratulate her after the race was over, because Efimova had twice failed drugs tests. </p> <p>And here\u2019s the thing: King was right to take that stand. Too few in her sport do, least of all the men and women who run it.</p> <p>Efimova said she was happy, but didn\u2019t seem it. Speaking in faltering English, she said that she couldn\u2019t explain how she felt but that she would ask everyone to \u201cjust try to understand me, if you can.\u201d She felt she was being persecuted. </p> <p>She has been living in the USA for four years, she said, and was only in Russia for \u201cmaybe one month a year\u201d. She insisted she had nothing to do with, and knew nothing about, the Russian state-sponsored doping program which was exposed in the McLaren report, and that she was being unfairly persecuted for political reasons. </p> <p>\u201cIn the Olympic Games, usually all wars stop, but now they can\u2019t find a way to beat Russia and now they try to make use of athletes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would really like to encourage my fellow athletes to understand my problems,\u201d Efimova said, \u201cand not let politics into it,\u201d Efimova said. \u201cIt is very upsetting that some athletes don\u2019t believe that. They watch television, they read newspapers, they have no idea of the facts.\u201d </p> <p>Efimova failed her first drugs test in 2013 when she tested positive for the steroid 7-keto-DHEA. She said then that it was a hidden ingredient in a supplement she was using. Last night admitted that was a lie, and that she had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/michael-phelps-cupping-russian-tv-meldonium-rio-2016\">Russian TV likens Michael Phelps cupping therapy to meldonium</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then she failed again this winter, for meldonium. This, she says, was not her fault. She insists that she was only using meldonium before it was banned, but that it stayed in her system so long that subsequent tests still picked it up after she gave it up.</p> <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency might yet agree. After the positive test Efimova was temporarily suspended by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (Fina), then reprieved after Wada decided that they needed more time to investigate how long meldonium stays in the body. Fina allowed her to compete while the decision is pending. </p> <p>Then she seemed to have been banned again when the IOC recommended that any Russian competitors who had served suspensions for doping violations should be withdrawn from these Olympics. But she was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who ruled that she shouldn\u2019t be punished twice for the same offence.</p> <p>As confusing as the situation is, it\u2019s still clearer than Fina\u2019s thinking. The Russian press reported that Fina actually wrote to CAS to support Efimova <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio-2016-279-russian-athletes-cleared-olga-zabelinskaya-yuliya-efimova\">in the very case she was bringing against them</a>. Fina declined to comment on that. </p> <p>They were, however, very keen to talk about Wada\u2019s McLaren report. So keen, in fact, that two days before it had even been released their President, Julio Maglione, put out a statement saying that the report lacked credibility and that he was worried there was \u201ca drive behind the scenes to get a global coalition of support\u201d to \u201ccall for the total ban on Russia\u201d. A little later, he added that he felt Wada had \u201cexceeded its powers\u201d.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t so long ago \u2013 a year and ten months to the week, if you like to be precise \u2013 that Maglione flew to Russia to personally present Vladimir Putin with something called <a href=\"http://www.russkiymir.ru/en/news/152560/\">the \u2018Fina Order\u2019</a>, which they award \u201cto a head of state or individuals of high dignity who have achieved remarkable merit in the world of aquatics\u201d. </p> <p>It was a thank you for his personal contribution to their sport. Putin\u2019s most notable contribution was that he had Russia host the lavish World Championships in Kazan last year. The very same World Championships, of course, which McLaren revealed had been systematically undermined by the Russia\u2019s sports ministry, security forces, and anti-doping agency. Which is what Efimova says she is now being punished for.</p> <p>Long before those Championships had even started, Fina\u2019s Executive Director Cornel Marculescu <a href=\"http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/john-leonard-calls-fina-executive-director-asking-updates-russia-doping-scandal\">was warned by the World Swimming Coaches Association</a> that \u201c[Rusada] are clearly complicit in the doping of Russian athletes\u201d and \u201cthat the legitimacy of the Fina world championships this summer is at great risk.\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t inside information. It was readily available in a German TV documentary that could be seen on YouTube. Marculescu\u2019s response was to promise \u201cthat we have excellent working relations with Rusada and we co-ordinate with them our doping control programme in Russia.\u201d Marculescu and Maglione both agreed that the Kazan Championships were the best there had ever been.</p> <p>No wonder that Jon Rudd, who coaches the former Olympic champion Ruta Meilutyte, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/04/poison-pool-swimming-scandal-trust-rio-2016-olympics-fina\">told the Guardian last month</a> that Fina have \u201clost their way\u201d, that their \u201ccredibility and respect could not be any lower\u201d. No wonder that the great Australia coach Bill Sweetenham thinks the doping problem is \u201cas bad as it has ever been\u201d. </p> <p>Because Efimova isn\u2019t the only one. Like Rudd said, she\u2019s just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, a \u201ca representative of the system that doesn\u2019t work\u201d. </p> <p>Efimova may be a cheat, but they run the system that has let her compete. It is Fina\u2019s fault that there have been as many jeers as cheers in the Aquatic Stadium so far this week, so if you really want to know who to boo, it isn\u2019t her, but them.</p>",
  "<p>In the end, the most compelling drama took place in a press conference room in the bowels of the aquatics centre. At one end of the table sat the new Olympic breaststroke champion Lilly King from the United States. Further down sat her controversial Russian rival, the silver-medallist Yulia Efimova, keen to explain why people should have more sympathy over her previous 16-month ban for taking steroids. As a symbol of the fragile mood of the Games, the sport of swimming and global politics it was spot on.</p> <p>It rounded off an evening that, depending on your perspective, either summed up the hopelessly compromised modern Olympics or saved the IOC\u2019s bacon. When two swimmers previously banned for doping offences are garlanded on a podium in front of millions of TV viewers worldwide it is hardly a resounding win for athletic integrity. Yet, as King bluntly informed the world she had just achieved \u201ca victory for clean sport\u201d, it was equally possible to see her triumph as the moment the forces for good finally began their overdue fightback.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/olympic-swimming-yulia-efimova-fina-fallout\">Yulia Efimova met with boos, but it is Fina who deserve opprobrium | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It had not seemed likely to end that way when China\u2019s Sun Yang, another with a contentious doping record, stormed to 200m freestyle gold. Sun, who still maintains his positive test and three-month suspension this year was a result of taking heart muscle medication, was a spectacular winner of a thrilling race, battling back to defeat South Africa\u2019s Chad le Clos. So when Efimova, back in circulation having been suspended between 2013 and early 2015 after testing positive for a steroid hormone, looked to be edging an equally gripping women\u2019s 100m breaststroke contest, the worst-case scenario loomed. Had the Russian also won gold the last fig-leaf of the IOC\u2019s shredded dignity would have floated embarrassingly away. A number of people owe King, perhaps the steeliest 19-year-old on the planet, a vote of thanks.</p> <p>Her intervention, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/mack-horton-speaks-out-gold-medal-rio-2016\">along with Australia\u2019s Mack Horton at the weekend</a>, will certainly be seized upon by clean athletes and disenchanted spectators, who have been growing steadily more militant in Rio. With a tearful Efinova just yards away, King used her victory platform to twist the knife a little further, even hinting the American sprinter Justin Gatlin should not have been selected. \u201cShould people who have been caught for doping issues be on the team? No they shouldn\u2019t. There shouldn\u2019t be any bouncing back and forth. I stand by what I said yesterday but I have to respect the IOC\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>Given the rancorous back story with Efinova \u2013 King mockingly raising her index finger to mimic the Russian\u2019s No1 gesture following her semi-final victory, while the defending Olympic champion Ruta Meilutyte tweeting her dismay at Fina\u2019s decision to allow Efinova to compete at the Games \u2013 it made for an unmissable race, a globally-broadcast morality play lasting just a shade over a minute.</p> <p>The loud boos that accompanied Efimova to her blocks further increased the sense of melodrama.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/09/rio-olympics-great-britain-miss-bronze-in-rugby-lilly-king-wins-and-brazil-take-first-gold-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q59z\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2641434\"            data-video-name=\"Great Britain miss bronze in rugby, Lilly King wins and Brazil take first gold \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a9793ae4b03b51a99e14ee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/16080olympicsxx_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/09/16080olympicsxx_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/09/16080olympicsxx.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/09/rio-olympics-great-britain-miss-bronze-in-rugby-lilly-king-wins-and-brazil-take-first-gold-video-highlights\">Great Britain miss bronze in rugby, Lilly King wins and Brazil take first gold</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As it turned out it was King, brimming with determination in the last 25 metres, who came through in 1min 4.93 secs, a mere 57 hundreths of a second ahead of Efimova, with the Plymouth-based Meilutyte back in seventh. King could not have looked more thrilled, leaving Efimova to rail against inaccurate perceptions from her fellow competitors, the mixing of politics and sport, why her doping \u201cmistake\u201d should be forgiven and the \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of Russian athletes. \u201cThey have no idea of the facts. They can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like if they swapped places with me.\u201d</p> <p>It was hard to remember a more charged press conference, the inevitable consequence of athletes being left exposed to the weather-vane of public opinion by their governing bodies. An IOC spokesman was even forced to issue a plea to athletes \u201cto respect their fellow competitors\u201d following the particularly pointed weekend spat between Sun and Horton. Horton, having beat his Chinese rival into second place in the 400m freestyle, openly refererred to his rival as a drug cheat and has since been subjected to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/swimmer-mack-hortons-social-media-accounts-flooded-by-angry-chinese-fans\">torrent of social media abuse from the Far East</a>.</p> <p>As Sun skipped around the arena last night brandishing his national flag to polite applause, it was not hard to guess how this sequel was going down back in his homeland. Having served his ban \u2013 curiously it was not announced by the Chinese authorities until after it had elapsed \u2013 he clearly sees this as the beginning of a new chapter. \u201cWhat is past is past,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe medal to me means I have to work even harder.\u201d The American bronze medallist Conor Dwyer described Sun as \u201cone of the greatest freestylers of all time\u201d, but added a caveat. \u201cWe just have to be more on top of cleaning up the sport. The people that do get caught I think should be punished harder. I think Sun is a good guy, a great competitor. But as far as drug testing goes I have no control of that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/08/lilly-king-ryan-murphy-swimming-gold-rio-2016\">Lilly King wins grudge-match gold and takes aim at US team-mate Justin Gatlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fairness to Sun he did produce a rousing comeback,surging back over the second half of the race after Le Clos had gone out ominously fast. Having touched first in a time of 1min 44.65secs he sat on the lane markers punching the air with both arms and milking the applause of his country\u2019s supporters. The only hiccup came when he tried to toss them his swimming hat and flipped it back into the water behind him. Otherwise he looked an insanely happy and vindicated man.</p> <p>Michael Phelps, who produced the second fastest time in the 200m butterfly semi-finals, added his views, unsurprisingly backing up his team-mate King. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that today in sports in general, not just only swimming, there are people who are testing positive who are allowed back in the sport and multiple times. It breaks my heart and I wish somebody would do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>Phelps will bid for his 20th Olympic gold medal in the 200m butterfly final which is being billed as a rematch with Le Clos, who edged him out in London four years ago, but the Hungarian duo of Tamas Kenderesi and Laszlo Cseh are also very much in contention. \u201cShould be a fun race,\u201d Phelps said to which Le Clos countered, \u201c\u201cMay the best man win. I\u2019ll race my heart out. Of course there\u2019s a huge rivalry between Michael and myself. I race to win and I want to beat Michael.\u201d</p> <p>There was scant consolation for Britain\u2019s James Guy, who could not quite replicate the outstanding feat of his room-rate Adam Peaty and finishing an agonising fourth behind Sun. Starting in lane eight he delivered his best swim of the Games but ended up suffering the sixth fourth-place finish for a GB athlete at these Games so far.</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s Katinka Hosszu, in contrast, cannot stop winning, adding the 100m backstoke title to her gold in the 400m medley. There was also gold and a new Olympic record for American Ryan Murphy in the 100m backstroke but only frustration for Missy Franklin. Having won four gold medals in 2012, the former queen of American swimming finished last in her 200m freestyle semi-final and failed to make the final.</p> <p>For many, though, this will be remembered as the night when a significant new King was crowned.</p>",

In Roberts\u2019 case, the needle has been stuck for about six years. </p> <p>What about his conspiracy theories (he says they\u2019re not conspiracies, just facts) that climate change is a scam pushed by global banks looking for cash and the UN on the hunt for global domination? Roberts didn\u2019t disappoint there either. <br></p> <p>On <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/774-abc-melbourne/one-nation-senator-elect-malcolm-roberts-with-raf-epstein\">ABC Melbourne</a>, host Rafael Epstein asked Roberts: \u201cDo you think the UN\u2019s trying to impose some sort of global government through climate change policy?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d replied Roberts. \u201cReally?\u201d checked Epstein. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d confirmed Roberts. </p> <p>For years, Roberts has been writing to politicians, government agencies, universities and scientists making the same claim that there is \u201cno empirical evidence\u201d to show fossil fuel burning causes climate change.</p> <p>You can go and read all that <a href=\"http://www.climate.conscious.com.au/\">material on his website</a> \u2013 I\u2019ll see you in six months once you\u2019ve read it all.</p> <h2>Empirical evidence?</h2> <p>So what does Roberts mean by \u201cempirical evidence\u201d? According to him, decisions should be based on \u201cobservations in the real world \u2026 it\u2019s measured, real world data\u201d and nothing else counts. </p> <p>There are two very obvious problems with Roberts\u2019 argument. </p> <p>The \u201creal world data\u201d is sending a clear message that the Earth is gaining heat at a rapid rate and that this is a long-term trend. Whether you look at global air temperatures measured in the real world by thermometers or derived from satellites, or the temperature of the oceans at multiple depths, or the increasing frequency of extreme temperatures, or the rising sea levels, the melting ice sheets, the disappearing Arctic sea ice, the increasing risk of bushfires \u2026 we could go on and on with a parade of \u201cempirical evidence\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone can claim there is no evidence if they refuse to look at it.</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Steven Sherwood, UNSW</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere and oceans at a rate that groups like the Geological Society say are unprecedented \u201ceven in comparison with the massive injections of carbon to the atmosphere at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary, which led to a major thermal event 55m years ago\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts\u2019 argument that science is only about \u201cempirical evidence\u201d might sound all sciencey to his interviewees and the lay audience. But it\u2019s bunk. </p> <p>If all you rely on is \u201cempirical evidence\u201d, and reject modelling and analysis that uses that data, then you basically throw out large swathes of modern scientific endeavours. </p> <p>Prof Steven Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The argument is specious.</p> <p>Anyone can claim there is no evidence if they refuse to look at it. In Galileo\u2019s time, some people refused to look into his telescope and then claimed there was no evidence to support what he was saying. Same thing today.</p> <p>The problem is that evidence does not stand up by itself and announce the answer to any given question. Evidence must be interpreted by humans. Scientists have all interpreted the evidence, going back decades, and unanimously agree that it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) humans are increasing CO2 and (b) this is causing warming. There is not a single respectable atmospheric scientist in the world whom I know of, who disagrees with either of these conclusions (there are a handful who challenge the magnitude of the effect but that\u2019s a different question).</p> <p>It is impossible to make a prediction based on data alone. Only a model can make a prediction of anything that has not happened yet.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Denial suite</h2> <p>Roberts has built a whole suite of well-rehearsed arguments to enable him to reject any assertions put to him.</p> <p>They go like this, and I\u2019m paraphrasing here. Climate scientists only say it\u2019s warming because if they didn\u2019t their grants would dry up. The Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO have corrupted climate science and are thus guilty of corruption. Government agencies are politicised, which means anything they produce cannot be trusted. You can\u2019t trust climate models, so anything that comes from them should be chucked out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Roberts] has no understanding of how science works.</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Peter Doherty, Nobel winner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of Australia\u2019s most famous and celebrated scientists is Prof Peter Doherty, who, in 1996, was jointly awarded a Nobel prize for his research into the immune system. </p> <p>Doherty told me he had sent Roberts \u201cplenty of reports and material\u201d but Roberts had ignored it.</p> <p>So Doherty has first-hand experience with Roberts and also knows a bit about the scientific method. He told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve never used the term \u2018empirical evidence\u2019, or heard any other working scientist say it. [Roberts] has no understanding of how science works.</p> <p>Discoveries in science stem from a mix of hypothesis, experiment, data generation, data analysis, insight and even a bit of guesswork. Telling the story of what\u2019s happening in something as complex as climate science further depends on integrating information from a diverse spectrum of fields, then designing to see if the conclusions are valid or false. There\u2019s a constant process of correction and further interpretation that then has to be supported by measurement.</p> <p>You can tell a genuine sceptic from a denier (as I discuss in <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/160807\">The Knowledge Wars</a>) because the sceptic will want to look at new data and conclusions and, like any real scientist, will modify their conclusions accordingly. The denier remains \u2018locked in\u2019 to a sort of \u2018<a href=\"http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfitzake/Lectures/DMED/MotorControl/SupraspinalControl/DecerebrateRigidity.html\">decerebrate rigidity</a>\u2019.</p> <p>All good scientists are sceptical, not least about their own data and conclusions. Further data show that we\u2019re wrong, and we prefer not to be wrong, so people change their positions with new evidence. And, if you want to understand very complex, interactive systems, you have to use modelling approaches.</p> <p>With climate science, data is coming in from a very broad spectrum of scientific disciplines that no one person can pull together ... thus the IPCC.</p> </blockquote> <p>So how should journalists react when a newly-minted senator makes claims that run against science academies across the planet while suggesting institutions and governments the world over \u2013 from the <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/612710\">US military</a> to the UN \u2013 are either part of, or have been hoodwinked by, a conspiracy that only he can and a few other people on the internet are able to see?</p> <p>Deference?

  "<p>Our society is at a tipping point between two stages of development, from the old society to a new one. Prof Jan Rotmans, from the Dutch Research Institute for Transitions, says the last major transition we went through was the industrial revolution, and the modernisations that followed have served us well for the past few hundred years.</p> <p>However, now it\u2019s time to transition to something new. Rotmans calls this<a href=\"http://simavi.org/three-questions/jan-rotmans/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Society 3.0.</a> He believes it will be characterised by decentralisation, bottom-up change, flat organisations and networks, systems thinking, flexibility and collaboration. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/28/australia-can-do-much-better-than-a-rank-of-20-on-sustainable-development-goals\">Australia can do much better than a rank of 20 on sustainable development goals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Thrive Research Hub we talk about the shift from the old society to the new one as moving from a mechanistic worldview to an ecological one. Our vision for Society 3.0 is framed within an ecological worldview where humans and nature are not separated from another, but co-exist and co-evolve in a holistic manner, supporting each other to thrive.</p> <p>The key is to change our attitude to development and growth,<em> </em>to change the story of what success looks like and the model by which we arrange our communities. This requires a shift in thinking from taking away from our world, community, economy and environment to giving to it. The way to increase the capacity of the system is to contribute to it, not deplete it: when we increase the capacity of the system, we can thrive and constructively adapt to change. </p> <p>Business has a key role to play in a thriving future. In an increasingly privatised world, businesses can implement and contribute to change as they intersect with many parts of consumers\u2019 everyday life. We see businesses taking this on through initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">B Corporation Certification</a>, which has the goal of using \u201cthe power of business to create a positive impact on the world and generate a shared and durable prosperity for all\u201d. </p> <p>Similarly there are successful businesses such as <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patagonia</a>, the outdoor clothing and equipment company, which have set out to \u201cbuild the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Within the built environment in Australia, there are organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.breathe.com.au/the-commons-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breathe architects</a> that lead the way on contributive practice socially, ecologically and financially with their Commons and <a href=\"http://nightingalehousing.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightingale</a> projects. They seek to create housing in contemporary urban environments that supports wellbeing, community and liveability. <em> </em></p> <p>All three examples go beyond doing less bad and focus on doing more good.</p> <p>These businesses are on to something. The green economy is one of the <a href=\"http://environment.nationalgeographic.com.au/environment/sustainable-earth/green-jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fastest-growing industries</a> in the world. In 2014 the US labor department announced that 3.1 million people worked in green jobs, compared with 800,000 in oil and gas extraction. Rotmans says: \u201cFor every dollar invested in the new economy, it yields three dollars added value in terms of innovation, employment and economic structure. Compared to every dollar invested in the old economy costs society two dollars.\u201d </p> <p>There is more for the wider business community to do. We need business to create value rather than dependency, rather than just throwing money at a problem. Concepts and practices such as social enterprises, social finance and strategic corporate social and environmental responsibility are gaining traction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/03/my-super-my-future-australians-put-their-money-where-their-morals-are\">My super, my future: Australians put their money where their morals are</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Consumers will support businesses who are tackling the issues. The success of companies such as toilet paper supplier <a href=\"https://au.whogivesacrap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Who Gives a Crap</a> and soap supplier <a href=\"https://thankyou.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thank You</a> is undoubtedly due to the fact that 50% and 100% of their profits, respectively, go to ending poverty and funding safe water. Similarly a recent report from Responsible Investment Association found a surge in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/03/my-super-my-future-australians-put-their-money-where-their-morals-are\">ethical investing</a> by consumers, while groups such as <a href=\"http://www.cleancapital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clean Capital</a> or Market Forces are growing because they release information about how to invest responsibly and to prevent investments in projects that will further harm the environment.</p> <p>There is also considerable value in pursuing things that are not monetised.

  "<p>Australia\u2019s offshore camps are a house of cards. They\u2019re unsustainable and liable to collapse amid increasing corporate aversion to complicity in abuse, legal uncertainty and human despair. <br></p> <p> The arrangements rest precariously on four pillars: corporate complicity in abuse; legal and regulatory frameworks that allow innocent people to be warehoused indefinitely; the public\u2019s willingness to accept deliberate cruelty to innocent people; and bipartisan political support. </p> <p>After years of uncertainty, hopelessness and abuse in the camps, only the final pillar holds strong and even the collusion of our major parties can\u2019t avert the looming chaos. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/refugees-dont-self-harm-because-of-me-peter-dutton-they-self-harm-because-of-you\">Refugees don't self-harm because of me Peter Dutton, they self-harm because of you | Sarah Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Confronted with mounting risks and liabilities, Ferrovial, the Spanish multinational that runs the camps on Nauru and Manus, has committed not to retender when its current contract expires. The contract was to end in February next year, but the Australian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/detention-centre-operators-contract-extended-despite-owners-objection\">recently extended it for a further eight months</a>. Now Ferrovial must either exit the camps, or become mired in material risk \u2013 including operational uncertainty, exposure to legal action and the devastation of its reputation \u2013 until October 2017. </p> <p> Ferrovial\u2019s financial stakeholders have also come under fire. A recent <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Association_with_Abuse.pdf\">report</a> released by the Human Rights Law Centre and GetUp\u2019s No Business in Abuse campaign reveals the global banks and corporate investors linked to the offshore camps through their relationship with Ferrovial, and calls on them to take immediate action to end the business relationships that associate them with gross human rights abuse. </p> <p> Already the Norwegian Central Bank, which holds a stake in Ferrovial, has acknowledged the potential for an ethical problem and referred the issue to Norway\u2019s Council on Ethics for an independent judgment. This response will sound a warning to Ferrovial\u2019s prospective successors: business in abuse will hurt you. </p> <p> Ferrovial\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/30/new-manus-and-nauru-operator-signals-plans-to-quit-detention-centre-business\">decision to walk away</a> ought to deter any company considering profiting from human suffering. The government\u2019s decision to unilaterally extend the offshore contract despite Ferrovial\u2019s clear indication that it does not want to continue its work in the camps certainly suggests that the market is not crowded with contractors eager to step into Ferrovial\u2019s shoes. </p> <p> Cracks are also appearing in the legal framework underpinning the arrangements. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">highest court in PNG recently ruled that the Manus centre is illegal</a> and PNG prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill has conceded it must end. It took retrospective legal changes and a last minute opening of the gates to fend off a similar <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/high-court-set-to-hear-challenge-to-offshore-detention-on-nauru-nauru-announces-transition-to-open-centre/\">legal challenge</a> we made to the detention facility on Nauru. </p> <p> The PNG supreme court is currently considering exactly how it will enforce its own orders. It has demanded answers from the Australian and PNG governments about resettlement plans for the 900 men still languishing in limbo. Our government will pretend that everything is fine but something has clearly got to give. PNG sovereignty, so often used as a shield by successive Australian governments to deflect criticism of the Manus camp, is poised to become the sword, striking a blow to the core of the current detention arrangements.</p> <p> Finally, slowly but surely, public opinion is shifting. During the recent <a href=\"http://hrlc.org.au/letthemstay/\">#LetThemStay</a> campaign we saw the faces of 37 babies born in Australia but facing deportation to Nauru. These kids have never set foot on a boat but are classified by our laws as if they arrived on one, meaning they face mandatory deportation to a tiny island. Also at risk were men violently beaten on Manus, women who had been sexually assaulted on Nauru and over 50 children, many of whom had been going to Australian schools and were beginning to rebuild their lives in our communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/08/detention-centre-operators-contract-extended-despite-owners-objection\">Detention centre operator's contract extended despite new owner's objection</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The response to their plight was phenomenal.

So the trajectory of public opinion is clear. People are realising that the status quo is unsustainable, cruel and fundamentally wrong. </p> <p> Pressure is clearly building. Rather than waiting for the current system to collapse the Turnbull government must look at innovative, humane policy alternatives. And they do exist \u2013 instead of using costly and cruel measures to close unsafe pathways, we could look at smart ways of opening up new ones. Measures which improve conditions in transit countries and re-allocate skilled migration places to skilled people who are also seeking asylum should be considered. </p> <p> The Manus and Nauru camps are dead ends, not long-term solutions.

It concluded that Trump had \u201caspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul\u201d.</p> <p>Naturally, Trump didn\u2019t appreciate Singer\u2019s efforts, attacking him in his book Trump: the Art of the Comeback, in a letter to the New York Times (\u201che was not born with great writing ability\u201d), and finally in an irate missive that read: \u201cMark, you are a total loser!

Even more remarkable is that top neoconservatives in the party are all taking the Democrat\u2019s side: Clinton has said Trump \u201cshouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button\u201d of our nuclear arsenal. It looks like even Republican top brass agrees.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/politics/republican-national-security-letter-donald-trump-election-2016/\">a long list of GOP national security hands wrote a letter</a> saying Trump would be \u201cthe most reckless president in American history\u201d and that electing him in November would but the nation\u2019s security at risk. Some of the 50 signatories said they\u2019d vote for Clinton while others deemed it better to abstain from voting entirely. But all were in fundamental agreement on one main point: \u201cTrump is not qualified and would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>This comes after Evan McMullin, a former CIA official who recently worked for the House Republican conference, filed papers to run for president as an independent candidate. He doesn\u2019t support Clinton, and having missed the ballot-access deadlines in most states, the move is expected to have little effect on the race other than to help the former secretary of state by cutting into Trump\u2019s margins.

It was the latest sign of traditional Republicans, usually a fractious group, striking at Trump while the nominee reels under signs of cratering poll numbers and self-inflicted political wounds.</p> <p>Many of the signatories have made their doubts known before. A March letter published at the online national-security salon<a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/\"> War on The Rocks</a> sounded warnings on Trump\u2019s character, policies and fitness for office. It included many who signed the current letter, including George W Bush\u2019s homeland-security secretary Michael Chertoff; ex-Pentagon undersecretary for policy and ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman; Condoleezza Rice aide Philip Zelikow; John McCain advisers Richard Fontaine and Kori Schake; and former US ambassador to Iraq Robert Blackwill.</p> <p>But the previous letter was penned in the midst of the Republican primary, when several other candidates remained competitive in the race. For dozens of high-profile intelligence officials to rebuke their own party\u2019s nominee with the general election officially underway is yet another indication of the unprecedented nature of Trump\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>The new letter also arrives amid heightened concerns over Trump posture toward Russia -- the former reality TV star has lavished unusual praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, while his campaign manager Paul Manafort has been scrutinized for holding ties to Russian politicians. Former CIA acting director Michael Morrell, who endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this weekend, has insinuated that Putin is manipulating an unwitting Trump.</p> <p>Signing the new letter are former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, who has let his antipathy to Trump be highly public in recent months, and John Negroponte, a senior official in the Reagan, George HW Bush and Clinton administrations and George W Bush\u2019s first director of national intelligence.

  "<p>In 2014, Johnny Slager was trying to come off methadone. He recognised that he was struggling to care for his 22-month-old son Braxton and had contacted child protection services for help.</p> <p>Despite reservations about putting his son into foster care (he had suggested alternative accommodation with family), Slager signed the temporary care form, assigning care of his son to an accredited, non-government organisation for three months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/08/rio-olympics-2016-day-three-adam-peaty-gold-michael-phelps-tom-daley-live\">Rio Olympics: Serena Williams wins,  USA hoops beat Venezuela \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three weeks later <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4240283.htm\">Braxton was dead</a>. He had drowned in the backyard pool of the western Sydney foster home in which he had been placed. The photographs from the scene show a slimy green pool and a backyard littered with debris, and a pool gate that did not self-lock.</p> <p>The police report was damning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... the pool fence did not comply with legislative standards as it was not a self-latching gate ... the premises were not safe or secure for young children placed under foster care. There were also excessive amounts of alcohol ... and blister packs with medication left throughout the location and within reach of the children.</p> </blockquote> <p>How was this environment deemed suitable for the care of a vulnerable child? </p> <p>Since 2012, more than 7,500 children have been transferred from the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services to the care of NGO out-of-home care providers, which represents approximately 56.2% of all children in out-of-home care.</p> <p>Despite the significant number of children receiving care by NGO providers, there is no measurable way to assess the adequacy of care being provided, or outcomes to be achieved with respect to the welfare and wellbeing of children.</p> <p>The department must have a role in monitoring the number of caseworkers providing care in the NGO sector, the nature of the care being provided, and an assessable measurement of welfare goals to meet the complex needs of a child.</p> <p>One of the primary roles of government is to take care of those children whose parents are unable or unwilling to care for them. The government cannot absolve itself of responsibility from providing oversight into the operations of NGO foster care providers, because the community counts on the government to step in where no one else can. With increased scrutiny, the department, alongside the NGO providers, can work hand in hand to deliver better outcomes.</p> <p>A government must be held to account where it fails in its duty of care to those children. And we must leave no stone unturned in our efforts to improve the care and protection of children.</p> <p>The 2016/17 NSW budget papers reveal that 100 child protection jobs are forecast to be cut over the next 12 months, including 56 staff involved in the assessment of children at risk of serious harm and 35 staff supporting children in foster care.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the recently announced <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nsw-government-does-not-add-up-child-abuse-reports-20160614-gpj6jg.html\">NSW inquiry into child protection</a>, to examine the amount and allocation of resources in the sector, is so important.</p> <p>There are too many instances where children in care have slipped through the cracks. We cannot tolerate a system where the cascade of mistakes that allowed Braxton to wander into a murky pool and drown can be repeated.</p> <p>But repeated attempts to access statistics and information under the Government Information Public Access Act are denied, met with the Baird government\u2019s usual secrecy.</p> <p>Much vaunted attempts to increase transparency and accountability in child protection outcomes, trumpeted by a succession of ministers in the family and community services portfolio, have come to nought. Under this government, things are only getting more opaque.</p> <p>When the caseworker dashboard was established in 2013, just 28% of all children at risk of significant harm received a face-to-face assessment by a caseworker. Not only has that number remained stagnant for three years, a majority of children in out-of-home care are no longer included in those quarterly statistics because the dashboard does not cover children in the NGO sector.</p> <p>Children in NSW deserve better than mere bureaucratic sleight of hand.</p> <p>And just as horrifying is the fact that the NSW government has admitted <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nsw-government-does-not-add-up-child-abuse-reports-20160614-gpj6jg.html\">it does not know how many reports of sexual abuse against children in state care</a> it receives. Compiling totals of alleged abuse incidents was deemed not a \u201creasonable\u201d use of resources.</p> <p>How can the government determine where resources are most needed if accurate statistics about abuse aren\u2019t readily available?</p> <p>And now we hear that <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/children-in-nsw-protection-sleeping-overnight-in-government-offices/news-story/a301e8654cedc9c68c0cec153d61be18\">at-risk children are being placed in motels, or even worse, sleeping on beanbags</a> in the corner of department offices. </p> <p>The parliamentary standing committee inquiry into child protection will hopefully shine a light into the full functions and activities of the Department of Family and Community Services, as well as the NGO providers they work with.</p> <p>It will scrutinise the ability of the government\u2019s systems and procedures to identify and investigate the risks facing children in the care of the minister, the systems by which we assess risk, and their overall adequacy and reliability.</p> <p>Perhaps most crucially, it will examine the adequacy of funding allocated to the department and NGOs for casework and the associated costs of caring for children in care.</p> <p>Despite a 20% increase in the number of children reported to the department as being at-risk of significant harm, incredibly the Baird government has cut funding for administrative staff in the department. The minister says it won\u2019t affect the jobs of frontline caseworkers. Yet these frontline staff speak of soaring workloads, as the day-to-day administrative tasks overwhelm caseworkers who would otherwise be working to protect children or reunite them with their families.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/handy-greyhound-facts-and-other-reasons-to-adopt-a-large-pointy-dog-today\">Handy greyhound facts and other reasons to adopt a large pointy dog today | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The inquiry will review the relationship between the department, the NGO providers, and the Office of the Children\u2019s Guardian, the organisation tasked with accrediting providers and carers through the working with children check.</p> <p>The inquiry will also examine the specific initiatives targeted at our at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The auditor general has identified the lack of services in rural and remote areas as an area of shortcoming. This inquiry will only reveal more about what can be done in this critical area, especially when it comes to increasing the percentage of children we place in kinship care.</p> <p>It has been almost eight years since the Wood special commission of inquiry shook up child protection in NSW. In the last five years, the situation in this portfolio has decreased markedly. </p> <p>It\u2019s high time we took another look at the way we care for at-risk children, because we can ill afford to it get wrong. </p> <p>Johnny Slager asked for help from the system. The system failed him. And most tragically, it failed Braxton.</p> <p><em>Tania Mihailuk is the NSW shadow minister for family and community services.</em></p>"
