  "<p><strong></strong>The vote to leave the EU has increased demand for consultants and boosted their pay as jittery business chiefs bring in outside help to navigate uncertain times, according to a snapshot of the jobs market.</p> <p>The average advertised salary for consultancy jobs was 8.9% higher than a year ago at \u00a347,760 in August, according to jobs search engine Adzuna. The increase defied the trend of the overall jobs market, where the average advertised salary was down 1.6% from August 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/brexit-anxiety-financial-services-sector-cbi-\">Brexit anxiety taking its toll on financial services sector, CBI finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The higher salaries on offer for consultants reflected a significant increase in demand. Consultant jobs were up 10% on a year ago, again bucking the trend of the overall jobs market where vacancies dipped 2.3% from a year ago.<br></p> <p>Adzuna, which tracks job adverts from about 500 sources, said the market was still looking resilient in the face of political uncertainty after June\u2019s referendum. It also noted that while advertised salaries were down on a year ago, they were up in month-on-month terms, by 0.3% to \u00a332,784 in August. That was the first monthly rise since February.</p> <p>Alongside consultants, other sectors enjoying year-on-year salary growth in August included maintenance, with a 12.1% rise, and public relations (PR) at 4%.</p> <p>Doug Monro, Adzuna\u2019s co-founder, said the consultancy industry was benefitting from the leave vote. \u201cIn an uncertain environment, companies are looking for highly skilled experts, without having to shoulder the burden of an expanding wage bill. Consultants are also helping them demystify the business consequences of the vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOther industries like PR are also seeing salaries rise as employers prefer to commission projects to outside agencies, rather than hire permanent internal staff.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jun/07/brexit-make-uk-businesses-less-competitive\">Would Brexit make UK businesses less competitive?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Official data since the referendum showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/wages-growth-slows-after-brexit-vote-eu-referendum-uk-labour-market-employment\">earnings growth slowed</a> in the wake of the Brexit vote, but unemployment held at a multi-year low.

  "<p>The UK must not water down its environmental laws as it leaves the European Union, one of the government\u2019s most senior advisers on climate change has warned.</p> <p>Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s (CCC) adaptation committee, told the Guardian: \u201cIt will be absolutely crucial that governments in the UK replace European legislation and don\u2019t see this as an opportunity to say we can now have dirtier vehicles or less efficient household appliances.\u201d</p> <p>Krebs said EU regulation played an essential part in setting industrial pollution, energy use and air quality standards in the UK, and also on habitat protection, biodiversity and marine conservation \u2013 areas controlled by the UK and devolved governments. </p> <p>\u201cIt is really, really important that we replace that legislation,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The peer, a former head of the Food Standards Agency, is to tell Scottish ministers on Tuesday their efforts to prepare for the potentially severe impacts of global warming are being undermined by poor monitoring and weak delivery timetables. </p> <p>He said his experts found there was insufficient evidence to say whether Scotland\u2019s vulnerability to global warming was decreasing or not when they reviewed the Scottish climate change adaptation programme. </p> <p>In a detailed <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/national-summaries/scotland/\">climate change risk assessment</a> for the UK released in July, the CCC said Scotland was already experiencing the first signs of climatic change, and faced huge risks if manmade warming continued, particularly to infrastructure, farming and housing. </p> <p>It said annual rainfall had increased 13% since the early 20th century, while sea levels at Aberdeen had increased by about 15cm in the last century. Maximum temperatures had already increased by 1C, cutting average snow cover in the central Highlands. </p> <p>Under a high-impact scenario, it said, summer temperatures in Edinburgh could rise by 4.4C by 2060, and five-day rainfall levels increase in the city by nearly 25% to 78.4mm. </p> <p>As well as altering habitats, often to the benefit of farming, that would increase risks of severe flash floods of the type that devastated north-east Scotland earlier this year but also introduce damaging droughts in farming areas \u2013 currently a rare occurrence in Scotland.</p> <p>Data published separately on Monday found that greenhouse gas emissions from Scottish industry had fallen again last year, by 10% for a group of six gases. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said that brought overall emissions down by 34% since 2007.</p> <p>The CCC\u2019s analysis of the <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/05/4669\">Scottish climate change adaptation programme</a>, published on Tuesday, found that 109 of its 148 policies and proposals for improving resilience had no timescale for delivery, even though ministers said they were \u201con track\u201d. Another 11 had been revised or delayed, and there was no information on another eight. It said good progress on adapting key target areas was only being made in two out of 28 target areas: roads and railways, and in energy distribution. </p> <p>Scottish planners and ministers were given a red mark for failing to deal with flood plain developments and for failing to make progress on soils and agriculture; there was an urgent need to address this. In 12 areas there was no information or monitoring, including emergency planning, healthcare, recovery from extreme weather and building on flood plains. </p> <p>There was still no clear strategy on coastal erosion, damage to biodiversity from warming rivers and lochs and the potential for disruption to telecommunications and digital infrastructure, despite those being raised by the committee nearly five years ago.</p> <p>Krebs will tell MSPs at Holyrood on Tuesday that even though the Scottish strategy was simpler and clearer than the UK government plan for England, a lack of data and target-setting is now a pressing issue. It was too unclear in many cases who was responsible for these policies, he added, despite clear leadership on climate from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister. </p> <p>In many key areas, \u201cwe simply don\u2019t know [if resilience is being improved] because we don\u2019t have the data\u201d, Krebs said.</p> <p>\u201cScotland and England are in a pretty similar place in terms of progress [but] I would say Scotland wants to put a bit more emphasis on collecting information to show what\u2019s actually happening,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Roseanna Cunningham, cabinet secretary for climate change in the Scottish government, said the CCC report had found her government\u2019s adaptation programme was \u201ca positive start in taking steps to prepare\u201d and further improvements were under way. </p> <p>\u201cWe have been developing and improving our adaptation response, for example with new indicators and reporting duties on public bodies and our new national centre for resilience. We will continue to develop our approach and the next adaptation programme, due to be published in 2019, will be based on the best available evidence and the advice and recommendations of the [CCC],\u201d she added.</p>",

Perhaps because of his deference to his former employers \u2013 Dyche continues to be held in very high regard by Watford fans, who appreciate that his 35% win ratio while at the Hornet helm was something of a miracle in unusually testing circumstances \u2013 but more likely simply because they have been pretty well matched in recent years, every one of those four games has been drawn. In fact these teams have drawn five of their last six encounters (a 0-0, a couple of 1-1s, a 2-2 and a 3-3 \u2013 they\u2019ve covered their bases), which is one more draw than they had experienced in all of history before lateish 2011 (not a very long history, but still 29 games\u2019 worth).</p> <p>As for this season, Burnley surprised the world with a 2-0 win over Liverpool back in August, but we\u2019re still not quite sure what that game meant. Were Liverpool displaying a familiar weakness in games they really should be winning? Did Burnley display a widely unexpected top-flight match-readiness? Or was it just a bizarre and inexplicable gag from the footballing gods in a game where the visitors had 80% of the possession, 89.7% of the shots, and 92.3% of the corners? After all, that afternoon apart Liverpool have been excellent, and Burnley a fair way below average. Only time, and games like this one, will tell.</p> <p>Watford have started the season excellently, emerging from an opening five-game burst that looked exceedingly testy \u2013 four of last season\u2019s top six, plus Chelsea \u2013 with seven points and in eighth place before this weekend\u2019s matches (a two-goal victory here would send them seventh). They\u2019ve also been quite good fun, both scoring and conceding in every game. For now they appear good enough only to be beaten by teams that are probably pretty decent (only Arsenal and somewhat fortunate Chelsea in the league so far), while remaining The Kind of Team You Don\u2019t Want to Lose To (Especially At Home). </p> <p>Winning here, though, might suggest an imminent upgrade to Watford\u2019s status. \u201cIt will be very important for them to win against us. Maybe they will be a little bit aggressive towards us and I think it is going to be a difficult away game,\u201d says Walter Mazzarri\u2019s translator. \u201cWe have shown that we can fight against anyone, but the real step forward I want to see is how we will behave against a club like Burnley.\u201d</p> <p>Both sides will be missing key players through either injury or regrettable ancient tweeting. Watford\u2019s Daryl Janmaat, who wasn\u2019t always great in Newcastle\u2019s back four last season but looks a very fine fit in Walter Mazzarri\u2019s preferred back five, has hurt and possibly even fractured a shoulder and will probably be replaced by Nordin Amrabat, who attacks well enough but as Arsenal showed can be a liability in defence. The other wing-back, Jose Holebas, could also miss the game with a muscle strain. Burnley, meanwhile, are without the strikers Ashley Barnes, who is injured, and more importantly last season\u2019s top scorer, Andre Gray, for whom this is the first of a four-game Twitter-related suspension.</p> <p>An evening of thrills, skills and great suspense lies ahead*.

They have this nonstop energy and they\u2019re cool, yet goofy and silly. There\u2019s no ego or attitude, it\u2019s just a very open and comfortable environment. Monkey Wrench was one of the first I learned how to play, reading tablature in Guitar World magazine. I feel like I\u2019ve known them for a long time and it\u2019s like we\u2019re jamming in a garage as teenagers, and I don\u2019t get that feeling a lot. A lot of the time I\u2019m too nervous or have a fear of messing up or hitting a wrong note or whatever, but with those guys it\u2019s just loud, wild rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</p> <p><strong>You also opened up for the Rolling Stones last year on their tour. What were they like?</strong></p> <p>That was one of the ones I was more nervous about. It was kind of the same vibe as hanging with the Foo Fighters and them being just cool people.

(Laughs) We got to hang and I spent a lot of time in Keith (Richards\u2019) dressing room eating shepherd\u2019s pie and listening to Howling Wolf records, which was kind of surreal. I was saying to myself: \u201cDude, just be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool.\u201d He was like: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re from the same school, mate. We\u2019re like brothers.\u201d I\u2019m like, ho-ly shit. I walk out of that room and was thinking, I can not believe that just happened. I\u2019ve had some great, crazy experiences and have gotten the chance to jam with some of the biggest artists in the world, so every day I\u2019m just grateful. I get up every morning and grind and strive to be something like that. </p> <p><strong>It seems like you\u2019re always touring. Is it a perpetual thing?</strong></p> <p>It kind of never ends. I get a few days here and there to deal with other things, then it\u2019s back out on the road. </p> <p><strong>Do you actually get to see the sights of a city?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s tour bus, venue, hotel, tour bus. You can slowly piece the city together every time you come and get the vibe. Perfect example: the ultimate destination spot for everybody is Rome. When we went, we didn\u2019t see anything except this venue which is an old horse track, the Sheraton hotel, and the European tourbus I can\u2019t stand up properly in because it\u2019s a double-decker and I\u2019m 6ft4in.

But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating \u2013 the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant.</p> <p>Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. \u201cFor a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth,\u201d Nasa astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics.

The ESA has also planned a mission to launch the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), which will <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/juice/55055-juice-mission-gets-green-light-for-next-stage-of-development/\">aim</a> to orbit the moon Ganymede and collect data and Europa and a third moon, Callisto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44486e684caf406797172b432e88f6e452cfaa0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44486e684caf406797172b432e88f6e452cfaa0f/0_0_4500_4500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"europa jupiter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nasa image of Europa shows suspected plumes of water vapor erupting at the bottom left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Europa flyby is not a life-finding mission,\u201d said program scientist Curt Niebur. \u201cThat mission is focused on finding the habitability of Europa.\u201d </p> <p>Niebur said that Nasa was well versed in evaluating habitability, but had little in its history evaluating for life. \u201cWhen it comes to finding life we don\u2019t have as much experience, and we have an ongoing and vigorous debate in the scientific community when it goes to finding out.\u201d</p> <p>Sparks and Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman similarly downplayed the chances that a flyby mission could find direct evidence of life. \u201cBy the time it gets into space, with radiation and cryogenic temperature, it\u2019s not going to survive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe jury\u2019s out,\u201d said Wiseman. \u201cIt first depends on whether the plumes are really there.\u201d</p> <p>Should the plumes exist, a spacecraft orbiting Europa could collect samples from plumes to get a taste of what Hertz called \u201ca global saline liquid water ocean\u201d that \u201cengulfs the moon at the present time, hidden under miles of ice\u201d.</p> <p>Last year Nasa\u2019s Cassini spacecraft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/30/nasa-cassini-images-enceladus-saturn-moon\">dove into the plumes erupting</a> from <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/deepest-ever-dive-through-enceladus-plume-completed/\">Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus</a>, finding ice and dust that revealed qualities of the moon\u2019s ocean. \u201cIt has revealed a tremendous amount of information about the ocean that is present beneath Enceladus\u2019 ice shell,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cWe would kill to have that kind of information and data about Europa.\u201d</p> <p>Sparks said the observations announced today were actually made in 2014, only a year after Nasa researchers saw what they believed to be evidence of water vapor plumes shooting 120 miles into space from Europa\u2019s south pole. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking a picture,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather complicated way of observing.\u201d He said that engineers had to develop the software to analyze a table of observed events, about 50 miles in total, and that the researchers continued to observe the moon throughout.</p> <p>Sparks said that they had found statistically significant results, but cautioned: \u201cWe do not claim to have proven the existence of plumes but rather to have contributed evidence that such activity may be present.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u201cWell I did have this dream the other night that I had Michael Buffer announcing the floor competition with the words: \u2018Let\u2019s get ready to tumble.\u2019\u201d And with that Barry Hearn announced his arrival into&#xa0;gymnastics.</p> <p>The exuberant boxing, snooker, darts and crown green bowls promoter launched his latest project, the World Cup of Gymnastics, at the Shard in London on Monday. Sitting alongside him were those responsible for bringing home five of Team&#xa0;GB\u2019s six medals at Rio last summer \u2013 Max Whitlock, Amy Tinkler, Nile Wilson as well as the trampolinist Bryony Page. It is Hearn\u2019s intention to make each of them \u201cglobal superstars\u201d.</p> <p>Scheduled to take place on 8&#xa0;April at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena in London, the World Cup of Gymnastics will feature eight national teams in an all around competition. The men will compete in six events (floor, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and high bar), the women four (vault, uneven bars, beam and floor) and there will be other showcase activities, including Page on trampoline. Sky Sports will screen the entire event live.</p> <p>That similar events already exist in the US and Germany and this one has been held in Glasgow for the past three years did not make it into Hearn\u2019s address. \u201cWe\u2019re not messing about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the 0<sub>2 </sub>and it\u2019s going to be lavish. It\u2019s going to be parties. It\u2019s not just about a provincial domestic event, it\u2019s about taking these guys and making them global superstars. Not just once every four years, but every day.\u201d</p> <p>When asked whether they were as enthusiastic about becoming superstars, the Olympians \u2013 whose apparent normality has been part of their overwhelming appeal \u2013 were more ambivalent.</p> <p>\u201cWe do it because we love it,\u201d Whitlock said, \u201cand that\u2019s the main reason we\u2019re sitting here today. Everyone has different directions \u2013 for us four the main goal is working towards 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for Hearn, his philanthropic interest in the best of British gymnastics also coincides with a business opportunity. Not only did gymnastics prove to be a ratings winner during the Rio Games (more than 10.4m viewers watched Whitlock claim pommel horse gold on prime-time TV), it is also a sport showing substantial growth in participation.</p> <p>Jane Allen, the chief executive of British Gymnastics, says the number of Britons who participate in gymnastics has grown by 10-15% every year since 2011. \u201cWhen you\u2019re having that sort of growth in your numbers, you feel a real benefit,\u201d she says. \u201cOur clubs are expanding too, and we\u2019ve got better business models out there. They\u2019re not just family clubs, they\u2019re business clubs. They\u2019re attracting investment. In terms of spectators, we\u2019ve sold out the Emirates Arena in Glasgow for the past three years. If we could sell 5,000 in Glasgow what could we get in London? So we\u2019ve taken the gamble to go to the 0<sub>2</sub>. We\u2019ve been very fortunate, we\u2019ve got some very good athletes and without them we wouldn\u2019t have the product. But we\u2019re also represented by 1,500 gymnastics clubs across the country.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal of gymnastics is growing and the audience is youthful, too. \u201cGymnastics has been around for centuries, since ancient Greece, and continued through the army,\u201d said Allen. \u201cBut all of those deviations of the sport, the hip hop and street-running and parkour, all the people who do those sports will probably have learned a base level of skills in gymnastics at a young age. We call ourselves a foundation sport, and I think you can see there\u2019s a synergy there.\u201d Synergy \u2013 now she\u2019s talking Hearn\u2019s language.</p>",

The result was behind the former Serbian foreign minister, Vuk Jeremi\u0107, whose score was eight to six. Both men lost support since the last vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/lot-of-factors-east-west-north-south-inside-the-race-for-un-secretary-general\">Deal-making and dirty tricks: inside the race for UN secretary general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guterres is a surprise frontrunner, as many people had expected the next secretary general to be an east European and a woman, to break new ground. But the former UN refugee chief was generally considered to have performed well in public hearings in the general assembly, and his advocacy on behalf of refugees is seen as important at a time of mass displacement from wars, terrorism and climate change. </p> <p>However, his lead is not decisive. A winner must gain at least nine votes and no vetoes from the five permanent council members. It is possible that one or both of the votes against Guterres come from one of the permanent five (P5). Moscow has said it wants an eastern European as the international community\u2019s next top diplomat. A potential veto will only make itself clear in the next round of voting, on 5 October when P5 states will cast coloured ballots. </p> <p>A Russian veto of Guterres in the face of such broad support could bring western retaliation in the form of vetoes on Russian favourites among the other eight remaining candidates.</p> <p>\u201cIf Guterres is blocked, everyone on the list will be blocked, and we will be looking for new entrants,\u201d said a senior security council diplomat. </p> <p>Georgieva could face the same barriers as Guterres. She is a senior member of the European commission that is currently imposing sanctions on Russia over its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Both Guterres and Georgieva would be expected to be activist secretary generals, using all of the powers in the post to put pressure on the security council on humanitarian issues. For that reason, both may seem unpalatable to Russia, and possibly China too. Moscow was <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/moscow-slams-un-chief-ban-ki-moon-for-syria-comments/articleshow/50908723.cms\">furious with</a> the current secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, when he challenged Russia on its role in Syria earlier this year.</p>",

He was speaking on behalf of Fight for $15, which started off as a campaign for a $15 an hour minimum wage in the fast food sector but which is now <a href=\"http://fightfor15.org/why-we-strike/\">a global minimum wage campaign.</a></p> <p>The international speaker rarely receives much attention, and you won\u2019t see any clips from the speech on the news. But it was the probably best speech anyone has delivered so far from the conference platform, and it explained why support for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda on the left is so strong better than John McDonnell\u2019s speech did.</p> <p>Unfortunately there isn\u2019t a text, but here are some key quotes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a completely different type of economy today, and you can see it in many industries that once gave people a real shot at the middle class.</p> <p>If you look at the airports, it used to be if you worked at an airport, you worked for one of the two or three airlines in the US, no matter if you were selling tickets, or taking tickets, or driving the airplane, or serving drinks on the plane. Today, instead of working for those three or four airlines, you work for a contractor of a contractor of a contractor of the airline. You are four or five or six steps removed the real boss and where the real money is and as a result of that those jobs that in 1975 in the airports, those jobs were union, decent wages, had health insurance, today they make $7.25 an hour, no pension, no health insurance, no nothing.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s worse than that in airports. If you push one of the wheelchairs around, you are not allowed to ask for a tip, but you are allowed to accept them, so because of that you\u2019re only paid two bucks an hour. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like in the US in an industry that was 100% union, where people had decent jobs.</p> <p>Truck drivers, the same story. 1975, virtually every truck driver in the United States was in the Teamsters union. They weren\u2019t rich, it was hard work, but they had a decent life. They had a fair wage. They could hope, if they did everything right, they played by the rules, they could get their kid into school and their kid would live a better life. Today, because of deregulation, the union has been busted. Almost no truck drivers in the United States are in the Teamsters union today. </p> <p>These did not happen by accident. They did not happen because we lack money and it did not happen because it was some false choice. These are choices and priorities that our country made. Last year, just to give you a few examples of some of our choices, the money given out in Wall Street bonuses - not pay, bonuses - was more than the total earnings of every American making the minimum wage. That\u2019s a choice. </p> <p>Today corporate profits make up the largest ever share of the United States economy and wages make up the lowest share. That\u2019s a choice. Today the pay of the average fast food CEO is more than 1,200 times the average fast food worker. That\u2019s also a choice.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1dcd944a39f85ea867983fa862d341d7fa51e57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1dcd944a39f85ea867983fa862d341d7fa51e57/0_91_3459_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Courtney of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Courtney of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94657e4b08ee6d0d2f04f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:03:59.160Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ian Lavery,</strong> the shadow minister for trade unions, appealed to delegates in his speech to the conference to contribute to Labour\u2019s Workplace 2020 consultation on what the world of work will look like in the future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Workplace 2020 ... will be the biggest discussion with working people and employers in a generation.

However, businesses will be wary of his combative tone in places and a focus on extensive intervention. </p> </blockquote> <p>From Adam Marshall, acting director general of the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>John McDonnell talks of an \u2018interventionist\u2019 future Labour government, but needs to remember that there\u2019s both good intervention and bad intervention. Good intervention creates the conditions for all businesses to thrive, but bad intervention ensnares them in red tape and makes them less inclined to employ, train or invest.</p> <p>Businesses would welcome a massively expanded infrastructure programme because it helps get the fundamentals right, but their confidence would be undermined by a wave of new regulation and compliance regimes.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Mike Cherry, national chairman of the <strong>Federation of Small Businesses</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>FSB welcomes the high-profile announcement from John McDonnell that the Opposition will look at expanding the employment allowance, which was arguably one of FSB\u2019s biggest wins in recent years.</p> <p>Our members will also be pleased by moves to create new small business workspaces in local communities, strengthen small business access to finance to enable them to grow, shake-up the energy market to allow small local suppliers to compete and innovate, and bring greater parity between how the welfare system treats the self-employed and the employed.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Tim Thomas, head of employment and skills policy at <strong>EEF</strong>, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst we are supportive of a national living wage, this proposal [the minimum wage increase] would be extremely damaging.

All well and good but what use is that if Labour fails to oppose Trident replacement? How can Labour claim to work for multilateral disarmament if it supports the government building a new nuclear weapons system at a cost of \u00a3205bn? This means Labour is supporting nuclear rearmament.</p> <p>Lewis has clearly signalled that the Labour leadership will not seek to change Labour policy and appears to have abandoned its defence review conducted extensively over the past year. The majority of Labour members oppose Trident replacement, so where is the democracy in that?</p> <p>Lewis made it clear that this was a decision designed to avoid political attack by the prime minister - but it has merely handed Theresa May support for one of her most controversial projects.</p> <p>There is enormous opposition to Trident replacement within the Labour party and there will be huge disappointment at this U-turn by Clive Lewis. We have no doubt that Labour members will work to oppose this disastrous announcement and bring a democratic debate to Labour\u2019s conference next year.

Some of it sounded a bit technical and dull (or \u201cone for the business pages\u201d, as political reporters would put it) but that level of seriousness is a bonus in a speech from a shadow chancellor. And McDonnell does have a governing philosophy, which he has lifted from Mariana Mazzucato, the economist who sits on Labour\u2019s economic advisory committee. She wrote a well-regarded book called <a href=\"http://marianamazzucato.com/the-entrepreneurial-state/\">The Entrepreneurial State</a>, which now seems to be McDonnell\u2019s routemap.</p> <p>But, given the amount of substance in McDonnell\u2019s speech, it was surprising that the party decided to push the \u00a310 minimum wage as his big announcement. Why? <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/15/story_n_8138900.html\">Because McDonnell announced this a year ago, in what was described as his first policy announcement as shadow chancellor</a>. There was a tiny bit more detail this year, and the policy plays well with a Labour audience, but it was an old one, and it is already generating significant criticism from business.</p> <p>Although some of Corbyn\u2019s individual policies are popular, Labour still polls badly compared to the Tories on the issue of economic credibility. This morning McDonnell claimed that Labour and groups like the CBI and the IoD were all \u201con the same page\u201d in terms of economic policy. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8d371e4b03598d1ce8af8#block-57e8d371e4b03598d1ce8af8\">10.26am.)</a> If he can prove that is true, those poll numbers may start to shift.

It was a speech that contained various surprises. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis said Labour would make multilateral disarmament a priority.</strong> Emily Thornberry said the same thing earlier (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8ef7ee4b0831a514026de#block-57e8ef7ee4b0831a514026de\"> 11.01am)</a> and glossed over what this meant for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan to commit Labour to unilateral disarmament too. Lewis was a bit more forthcoming, admitting that Labour is divided on this.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As you know, I am sceptical about Trident renewal, as are many here.</p> <p>But I am clear that our Party has a policy for Trident renewal.</p> <p>But I also want to be clear that our Party\u2019s policy is also that we all share the ambition of a nuclear-free world.</p> <p>So we will take steps to make that ambition a reality.</p> <p>So we will make our long-standing multilateralism reality, not rhetoric. We will be working with international organisations, including the United Nations General Assembly First Committee on Disarmament and International Security, within the spirit and the letter of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p> <p>That will stand in stark contrast to the Tories\u2019 lip service on nuclear disarmament; they have not brought forward a single proposal as to how they intend to achieve it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is interesting for two reasons. First, some of Corbyn\u2019s allies have argued that Labour effectively does not have a policy on Trident, because it is subject to review. They made this argument around the time of the Commons vote on Trident. But Lewis is saying that the party does have a policy, and that it is to renew Trident.</p> <p>Second, by stressing Labour\u2019s commitment to multilateral disarmament, as Thornberry did, Lewis may be pointing to a possible compromise that would enable the party to go into the election with a policy backed by Corbyn and the pro-Trident unions. (A policy that says achieving multilateral disarmament is the priority, allowing Corbyn to say he is still committed to getting rid of the UK\u2019s nuclear weapons, and Unite and the GMB to say that the party would not scrap Trident?)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis praised Nato, saying it was a body that embodies Labour values. </strong>(It was set up partly at the behest of Ernest Bevin, Labour\u2019s post-war foreign secretary.) Lewis said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, when I look at our key military alliance \u2013 NATO \u2013 I see an organisation that springs directly from our values: collectivism, internationalism and the strong defending the weak. Its founding charter \u2013 a progressive charter \u2013 includes standing up for democracy and defending human rights. These are values that I believe go to the core of our political identity. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because in the past Corbyn has been very sceptical about Nato. During the Labour leadership contest last year he was initially reluctant to commit to keeping the UK in Nato, although he firmed up his support for Nato after his suggestion that Britain could leave the organisation left him exposed to criticism.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis said that Labour would fulfilling its commitments under Nato, including its collective defence obligations under article 5.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So, of course, a Labour government would fulfil our international commitments, including those under Article 5. But let\u2019s be clear: that means both our military and our diplomatic obligations. We cannot have one without the other, and nor should we.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sounds like a rebuke to Corbyn who, at a hustings in August, was reluctant to give this commitment. Asked what the UK would do if Russia invaded a fellow Nato member, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/08/jeremy-corbyns-nato-stance-first-labour-leader\">Corbyn replied:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t wish to go to war. What I want to do is achieve a world where we don\u2019t need to go to war, where there is no need for it. That can be done.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour would maintain defence spending at at least 2% of GDP.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every Labour government since Attlee\u2019s has met NATO\u2019s spending target of at least 2 per cent of GDP, every single year. And I confirm today that the next Labour government will do the same, including our UN and peacekeeping obligations.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is quite a significant commitment. Even David Cameron was unwilling to make this promise before the 2015 election - although the Tories did make the commitment after the election was over. When Liz Kendall (seen as a dreadful Blairite by many Corbynites) launched her (very unsuccessful) leadership campaign in 2015, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32838024\">she also made spending 2% of GDP on defence one of her key proposals.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Lewis, a former soldier who served in Afghanistan, said there was no contradiction between being a socialist and serving in the military.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve found there are some who are surprised to find an Army veteran serving as a Labour MP, as if it was somehow against the values we collectively believe in.</p> <p>But I see no contradiction between my service and my socialism. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd4da515b5ba4ce49c694e1295c0e853d2003e2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4da515b5ba4ce49c694e1295c0e853d2003e2e/0_137_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clive Lewis speaking to the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clive Lewis speaking to the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/26/clive-lewis-labour-committed-to-multilateral-disarmament-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54nv8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2752712\"            data-video-name=\"Clive Lewis: Labour committed to multilateral disarmament \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"YouTube\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e91a7ce4b0f55a9f403605\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/26/26092016CliveLewis_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/26/26092016CliveLewis.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/26/26092016CliveLewis_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/26/clive-lewis-labour-committed-to-multilateral-disarmament-video\">Clive Lewis: Labour committed to multilateral disarmament</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T13:42:36.574Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e8f5d8e4b0831a51402705\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T10:19:38.156Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"102fa89e7b0d7a1b92bf14bc73351573ca43d7a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102fa89e7b0d7a1b92bf14bc73351573ca43d7a0/0_131_5472_3285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Prescott and Dennis Skinner (who used to share a flat in London) together at the Labour conference this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Prescott and Dennis Skinner (who used to share a flat in London) together at the Labour conference this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e8f4bbe4b0f55a9f403520\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T10:16:42.748Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour would 'expand' international aid, says Osamor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In her speech to the conference<strong> Kate Osamor, </strong>the shadow international development secretary, launched a particularly sharp attack on her Tory opposite number which went down well in the hall.

Here is the key extract:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is almost 60 years since a Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary demanded that, when it came to negotiations over nuclear weapons, he not be sent naked into the conference chamber. But people forget what Nye Bevan said beforehand in that famous speech.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is not a question of who is in favour of the bomb, but what is the most effective way of getting the damn thing destroyed. It is the most difficult of all problems facing mankind.\u201d</p> <p>What would Bevan think of the fact that six decades on, we are now further than ever from solving that problem, and that the conference chamber he spoke of lies empty and silent.</p> <p>We all know how irresponsible it would be to ignore the problem of climate change, allow it to get worse, and leave our children and grand-children to worry about the consequences.</p> <p>So why don\u2019t we say the same about nuclear weapons which have the power to destroy the world we live in within minutes, not just over decades?</p> <p>So a future Labour government will not just revive talks on multilateral nuclear disarmament among the world\u2019s great powers, we will make the success of those talks the test of our success on foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thornberry was talking about multilateral nuclear disarmament. Corbyn is also committed to unilateral disarmament (getting rid of Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent regardless of what other countries do) but he has not yet persuaded the party to adopt this policy and at the moment the issue is still under review. Thornberry\u2019s speech did not say anything about how the party would resolve this issue.</p> <p>Her speech was also noteworthy for what she said about Corbyn. No other shadow minister speaking from the platform has praised him so lavishly. She told delegates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, I\u2019m so proud to stand here today in Liverpool: a loyal member of Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet in what is now again Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party ...</p> <p>When I was selected for the neighbouring seat [to Corbyn\u2019s] in 2005 we were behind to the Liberals in every poll.</p> <p>On election day, without anyone asking him to, Jeremy left his own constituency and went round by himself knocking on doors in mine, telling voters: \u201cI know you disagreed with Iraq and so did I, so did Emily, we were on the marches together; you\u2019ve got to get out and vote Labour.\u201d I won by 484 votes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got to know Jeremy very well since then and there\u2019s many words I know that sum him up: kindness, generosity, courage.

Here are the key points he has made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell ruled out an early shadow cabinet reshuffle.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8cd20e4b03598d1ce8ada#block-57e8cd20e4b03598d1ce8ada\">8.31am.)</a></li> </ul> <p><em>UPDATE AT 3.35PM: </em>A Labour source has been in touch to say that, when John McDonnell ruled out an early shadow cabinet reshuffle on the Today programme this morning, he was not intending to give out that message. So it is possible that we might get a shadow cabinet reshuffle soon after the party conference after all.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that Jeremy Corbyn did campaign hard for a remain vote in the EU referendum - but that he deliberately avoided being \u201cEurophile\u201d.</strong> Alan Johnson, the chair of Labour In Britain, and others have accused Corbyn of adopting a half-hearted approach to campaigning. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/marieleconte/leaked-emails-raise-more-questions-for-corbyn-team-over-eu-c?utm_term=.jeOMVa1ROd#.gevK8DwY72\">Leaked emails have shown that Corbyn\u2019s office repeatedly toned down the pro-EU content in Corbyn\u2019s campaign speeches. </a>Asked about this, McDonnell said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the accusation that Corbyn did not campaign properly for a remain vote.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was really shocked at that ... Not just Alan ... There was this view Jeremy didn\u2019t do enough during the campaign. I saw what he did. He travelled hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles, meetings all around the country. We were knocking on doors all round the country, holding mass meetings as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about why draft speeches were altered, McDonnell said he and Corbyn met Hilary Benn, the then shadow foreign secretary, and Angela Eagle, the then shadow business secretary, last September to explain his approach to the referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We explained to them our view was that the best way of campaigning was to remain, but reform as well, because of the criticisms [of the EU]. If we went solely on a Europhile basis we never stood a chance, particularly in areas outside of London and the south east that felt left behind in the economy overall. So our argument was remain but reform, and create a reform agenda.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell said that Labour wanted the UK to retain \u201caccess\u201d to the single market, casting doubt on the extent of Labour\u2019s opposition to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit</strong>. Yesterday Corbyn told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that he was opposed to a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, implying the party would fight to retain full single market membership. When asked about this, McDonnell just said the party wanted \u201caccess to the single market\u201d. When pressed why he would not commit to opposing a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t want to restrict ourselves at the moment in the discussions that we are having with our European colleagues.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell dismissed David Blunkett\u2019s critique of Jeremy Corbyn (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8d4a4e4b0f55a9f4034a8#block-57e8d4a4e4b0f55a9f4034a8\">9.07am),</a> saying Blunkett was \u201ccompletely out of touch\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a lot of time for David but I just think he\u2019s completely out of touch. He should come here and talk to us about the policies we are debating at conference, all of which I think have really mass popular support. In addition to that, he should come, just feel the vibe here, because we\u2019ve got a massive new party now with over 600,000 members wanting to get out on the streets campaigning.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell suggested Labour would be willing to legislate to ensure better conditions for Uber driver. </strong>Asked if Labour supported Uber, as an example of a new, disruptive business start-up, McDonnell said he was concerned that drivers for the company did not have proper job security (because they are self-employed). He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So what you try to do is work with that company to ensure that they do abide by basic standards and employment conditions. If they don\u2019t, then you need to legislate. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour planned to invest \u00a3250bn in the economy.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are setting up a national investment bank. We are putting into that bank \u00a3100bn. Yes, that will be borrowed, but it will be borrowed at the cheapest rates in our history. That will lever in, at the average leverage rate, another \u00a3150bn. And we will use that to invest in our infrastructure, in our skills and we will be working with entrepreneurs. </p> </blockquote> <p>During his leadership campaign Corbyn talked about <a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/economy\">a \u00a3500bn investment programme. </a>He confirmed this figure on the Marr Show yesterday. Asked why McDonnell was just highlighting the proposed \u00a3250bn investment, a spokesman for him said that he was only talking about one aspect of the Corbyn plan. The investment programme has not been cut by \u00a3250bn overnight.</p> <p>McDonnell also insisted his investment plans would not lead higher taxes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Short term interventions like that do pay dividends pretty quickly. We think we can get growth growing very quickly in this economy and it will then pay for itself. So in the short term, yes there will be some increased costs, but borrowing at the moment is extremely low-cost.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said business backed Labour\u2019s general approach to the economy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been meeting with the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Chambers of Commerce, and we are all on the same page. You need government working with the private sector hand in hand, looking at where investment\u2019s needed - particularly in research and development - and then you develop the products and the markets that enable us to compete effectively with our European and other global competitors. I think that\u2019s the modern way of how you do business in government.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to apologise for calling Esther McVey, the Conservative former disabilities minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/mcdonnell-defends-calling-female-mp-stain-of-inhumanity-esther-mcvey\">a \u201cstain of inhumanity\u201d.</a> </strong>He said he was expressing the anger that people felt about McVey\u2019s disability cuts when he used the phrase in the Commons.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not apologising for the words I used in parliamentary debate. Of course you have to be constrained in your language, but also you have to be honest about how you feel. And sometimes there\u2019s such a thing as justifiable anger. That doesn\u2019t justify words like \u2018lynching\u2019 or anything else but in the parliamentary debate. if you look at my words. you will see it is an honest expression of the anger and anguish I felt in dealing with these families.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed Labour was ahead of the Tories in the polls before the leadership contest.</strong> This claim is misleading (Anthony Wells explains why <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9749\">here, at UK Polling Report)</a>, although, having made the claims in early interviews, McDonnell was more accurate on Today, talking about Labour just being ahead in some polls.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a128471545425337f8a325a02536e3b5b2821dbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a128471545425337f8a325a02536e3b5b2821dbd/0_150_5173_3104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McDonnell at the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell at the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T14:35:29.094Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e8dc48e4b03598d1ce8b11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T08:30:37.746Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Politics Home\u2019s <strong>Kevin Schofield</strong> has more on this morning\u2019s NEC meeting.

There has to be a credible opposition party, one that the wider public can trust. </p> <p>If not, there will be a permanent Conservative majority in the Commons, with nobody to keep the government honest and accountable.</p> <p>And even for the most dyed-in-the-wool Tories that is very bad news.

He has been giving interviews this morning and is about to appear on the Today programme. I will be covering that in detail.</p> <p>Overnight McDonnell and <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, have announced that a future Labour government would compensate deprived regions for any funding they will lose when the UK leaves the EU. The government has promised to make good this shortfall up to 2020, but not beyond that. Labour would continue to compensate them \u201cinto the 2020s and beyond\u201d.</p> <p>Making the announcement, Thornberry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the period 2014 to 2020, the UK was allocated \u20ac10.8 billion in structural funding for our most deprived regions and communities. The Tories have given an undertaking hedged in conditions that funding up to 2020 will be protected.</p> <p>For the period after, they have said nothing. That is not good enough. Without long-term certainty over funding, our most deprived regions and communities cannot plan ahead. They cannot attract other investment. They cannot make progress.</p> <p>So thanks to John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, we can guarantee that a future Labour government will make up any shortfall in structural funding into the 2020s and beyond. And the same will go for the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell has already given three interviews this morning. He was keen to talk about the funding announcement, but inevitably other topics have come up, and on Sky he found himself having to explain that he was not in favour of lynching the Tory ex-minister Esther McVey. Here are some of the key points he made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McDonnell said Labour would take an interventionist stance to economic policy.

The next Labour government will back the clean technologies of the future.\u201d</p> <p>Within minutes, the GMB denounced the proposal, with Gary Smith, its Scotland secretary, saying it was \u201cnot ethical\u201d and an \u201cabdication of our environmental and moral responsibilities\u201d to become increasingly reliant on gas from dictatorial regimes overseas.</p> <p>Stuart Fegan, the GMB\u2019s national officer, added: \u201cIt is a nonsense that any political party serious on forming a government after the next planned general election in 2020 could promote a ban on shale gas extraction outright. With our national dependency on gas consumption set to increase in the immediate future, ruling out the possible use of a natural fuel that exists beneath our feet in parts of the UK is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Flint, the former shadow energy secretary, also criticised the proposed ban without there being a policy to replace it. She told a fringe event: \u201cWe can\u2019t just be against things. Nobody is going to vote for a policy if they think that [energy] security is going to be at risk.\u201d<br></p> <p>The stance leaves the party even more strongly opposed to fracking than the Scottish government, which has a moratorium in place until the impacts of hydraulic fracturing are researched further. The Welsh government opposes fracking and has instructed local authorities to turn down applications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/climate-ministers-bribe-local-fracking-environment\">Nobody can buy the silence of a climate spinning out of control | Caroline Lucas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast to the negative reaction from the GMB, many environmental groups were delighted. Hannah Martin, energy campaigner at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/uk-advertising-watchdog-admits-it-was-wrong-to-ban-greenpeace-fracking-advert\">Greenpeace UK</a>, said: \u201cWith opposition to fracking at an all-time high across the country, this ban on an unproven and inexperienced industry will be widely welcomed.\u201d</p> <p>The industry has confirmed no shale gas wells will be drilled in Britain this year, as a deadline regarding a fracking deal approaches. Within the next fortnight, the government will decide whether to accept shale company Cuadrilla\u2019s appeal against Lancashire county council who decided last year to turn down its application for two fracking sites.</p> <p>But even if the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, approves the deal as expected, Cuadrilla said construction at the two sites on the Fylde would require drilling to begin perhaps as early as April next year.</p> <p>The industry trade body told the Guardian that no wells had been drilled into shale in 2016, and it knew of none planned before 2017.</p> <p>Chemicals giant Ineos, which has heralded the promise of a \u201cshale gas revolution\u201d in the UK and last year promised to \u201cmove quickly\u201d, has yet to submit a single shale planning application, it emerged last week, but plans to submit five before the year\u2019s end. Another shale company, Third Energy, recently had its hopes of fracking in North Yorkshire this year dashed due to delays over a legal challenge by Friends of the Earth and a local anti-fracking group.</p> <p>The lack of action on the ground does not match the government\u2019s aspirations for fracking. David Cameron said more than two and half years ago that the UK was going \u201call out for shale\u201d, and ministers one year ago promised they would \u201cfast track\u201d bids.</p> <p>Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cReality and rhetoric parted ways long ago on this because quite simply the government backed the wrong horse. Opinion polls repeatedly show that people in the UK strongly support renewables and oppose fracking.\u201d</p>",

Other issues to be discussed include the legal and sustainable wildlife trade, measures to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking, and enhanced enforcement.</p> <p> Controversial and thought-provoking topics, such as interventions to address the poaching of elephants, the proposed listing of elephants, lions, rosewood species and sharks, and the illegal trade in rhino horn and pangolin, are areas that will probably receive the most international attention.</p> <p> African countries, through their participation in the conference, have the potential to influence negotiations.

  "<p>My idea of power dressing for success in the high-stress, male-dominated environment of medical school finals a decade ago was a smart blazer, hair in a bun and the strict avoidance of cleavage. Margaret Ann Bulkley, born in Ireland at the end of the 18th century, took things to another level. In her quest to break into medicine, Bulkley adopted an entirely male persona \u2013 it worked, and she emerged from Edinburgh University as the fully qualified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/21/medicine.mcelhone\" title=\"\">Dr James Barry</a> in 1812. This \u201cbeardless lad\u201d served as a British army surgeon across the Empire for more than 40 years, her secret <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/doctor-in-disguise-the-secret-life-of-james-barry/\" title=\"\">largely undetected</a>.</p> <p>Barry developed a reputation not only for her surgical prowess but also for her abrasive personality. After one unpleasant encounter, Florence Nightingale described her as a \u201cblackguard\u201d, writing that she \u201cbehaved like a brute\u201d. Barry had a dog called Psyche and was prone to offering herself up for duels, including one over the establishment of a leper colony. Her close friendship with Lord Charles Somerset, governor of the Cape Colony, South Africa, where she was assistant surgeon to the garrison, led to rumours of a homosexual relationship \u2013 at that time, a capital offence in the armed forces. Somerset offered a hefty reward for the capture of the person who had spread gossip about the alleged \u201cunnatural practices\u201d and the rumours were quashed.</p> <p>It was only on her death in 1865 of \u201cdiarrhoea\u201d that the charwoman laying out her body discovered that James Barry was, in fact, biologically female. Stretch marks on her lower abdomen show that she may have even had a child. The Manchester Guardian described her life as \u201ca supreme deception\u201d, but acknowledged that she had been a brilliant surgeon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b58be4dc257d3204d6cecf6f743a571e315f5e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b58be4dc257d3204d6cecf6f743a571e315f5e9/71_188_542_678/400.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Dr James Barry.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of Dr James Barry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barry\u2019s is not the only tale of cross-dressing in medical history \u2013 it echoes the tale of Agnodike, a fourth-century Athenian woman who is said to have cut off her hair and posed as a boy in order to study medicine under Herophilos, a follower of Hippocrates. Being a female doctor was a crime punishable by death, so Agnodike maintained her disguise, becoming a popular gynaecologist. Suspicious of her success, the male doctors accused her of seducing the women of Athens, an allegation she was only able to refute by lifting her skirts. Only her patients\u2019 protests saved her from execution. While this story is likely to be apocryphal \u2013 dramatic skirt-lifting is a surprisingly common trope in ancient myths, and the only account of Agnodike\u2019s life is from a shoddy Latin compilation of stories written hundreds of years later \u2013 the theme is familiar.</p> <p>Women have always been intimately involved in medical matters \u2013 and not only through their familiarity with the act of expelling oversized babies from undersized pelvises. In the Middle Ages and beyond, women worked as midwives, nurses, apothecaries, bone-setters and surgeons. Yet, as the study of medicine became formalised, women were increasingly excluded. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/03/henry-viii-exhibition-british-library\" title=\"\">Henry VIII</a> made a point of this in his 1540 charter forming the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/barbersurgeons\" title=\"\">Company of Barber Surgeons</a>, forerunner of the Royal College of Surgeons, in which it was decreed \u201cNo carpenter, smith, weaver or women shall practice surgery.\u201d</p> <p>By the mid-19th century, more women were demanding entry to medical school. The British Medical Journal at the time declared: \u201cIt is high time that this unnatural and preposterous attempt ... to establish a race of feminine doctors should be exploded.\u201d Men expressed concerns that exposure to gore might pose a risk to delicate female health, apparently oblivious that women deal with blood on a monthly basis.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/garrett_anderson_elizabeth.shtml\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Garrett Anderson</a>, born in 1836, was the first English woman to qualify as a doctor. Despite her passion for studying medicine, not a single British medical school would accept her. Undaunted, she first enrolled as a nursing student, and then exploited a regulatory loophole to practice medicine by sitting exams for the <a href=\"http://www.apothecaries.org/\" title=\"\">Society of Apothecaries</a> in 1865. She was the last woman to sneak in via this backdoor; the following year, it was closed. Garrett Anderson\u2019s campaigning contributed to the 1876 \u201cEnabling Act\u201d that allowed the licensing of both male and female doctors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/nhs-plans-to-make-senior-doctors-reveal-outside-earnings\">NHS plans to make senior doctors reveal outside earnings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This legal change wasn\u2019t sufficient to thaw the antagonistic attitudes of most British medical schools towards women. But while teaching hospitals kept their doors shut, women set up their own hospitals. The coming decades would see more and more medical schools accepting women, and in 1892 the British Medical Association finally accepted female doctors.</p> <p>The first world war allowed women to take up posts in hospitals that would ordinarily have been occupied by men. But despite their competence, female physicians still faced major career obstacles in the interwar period, including discrimination on the basis of their marital status. In 1948, the educational reforms that came with the inauguration of the NHS required that a \u201creasonable proportion\u201d of medical students were female.</p> <p>Today, female medical students outnumber their male colleagues. Currently, <a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/register/search_stats.asp\" title=\"\">45.4% of all registered medical practitioners in the UK are women</a>. However, the proportion of senior hospital specialists who are women drops to 33.4%. The top echelons of medicine and surgery, especially senior academic posts, continue to be dominated by men. And there remains a significant gender pay gap.</p> <p>Next month, <a href=\"http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserProfilePage.action?userUrl=henriettabowdenjones\" title=\"\">Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones will be leading a group of runners on the Royal Parks half marathon in support of the Medical Women\u2019s Federation</a>, which celebrates its centenary next year. For the last hundred years, it has been committed to strengthening the position of women in medicine.

  "<h2>NEXT UP \u2026 WORLD PEACE</h2> <p>Considering it took them just three years to eliminate racism from football, the Fiver can\u2019t help but feel that, rather than hastily disband the task force they assigned to the job, Fifa might be better advised to put this crack team to work sorting out the many other problems pertaining to colour that continue to blight the game: half-and-half friendship scarves, Sunderland\u2019s emetic mauve and purple third kit and the glaring lack of consistency that means some Premier League referees brandish circular red cards while others prefer rectangular ones.</p> <p>Set up by Sepp Blatter in 2013 to tackle the pressing issue of racism and discrimination in football, Fifa\u2019s website announced at the time that the group \u201chas been tasked with identifying tougher sanctions on the one hand and initiatives in the area of education and prevention on the other, in order to eradicate this scourge on the beautiful game\u201d. Despite several hiccups, most notably the arrest on charges of corruption of its head, Jeffrey Webb, Fifa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/fifa-anti-racism-task-force-russia-2018-world-cup\">has now declared the task force dissolved</a> on the grounds that its work is done. An impressive achievement by any standards, not least when you consider the force tasked with the job didn\u2019t gather for a single meeting for two of the three years of its existence.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The task force was officially disbanded by Gerd Dembowski, who glories in the title of Fifa\u2019s diversity and anti-discrimination manager and must surely be worried for his own future following the elimination of discrimination and bigotry of every kind in the world of football. \u201cI wish I could say that I am shocked by the decision, but unfortunately I am not,\u201d task force member, lawyer and journalist Osasu Obayiuwana said on Sunday. \u201cThe problem of racism in football remains a burning, very serious and topical one, which need continuous attention.\u201d<br></p> <p>With the next World Cup slated to take place in Russia, traditionally a hotbed of racism in football until Fifa sorted it all out, some cynics have suggested that disbanding the task force responsible for solving the problem might have been a tad premature. Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, Fifa\u2019s secretary general, Fatma Samoura, was keen to stress that while the group no longer exists, her employers will continue to act on their recommendations. She also promised that Fifa would commit itself to combatting \u201cnot only racism but any kind of discrimination including violation of human rights\u201d. So, some good news there for the put-upon of this world, not least the families of the many hundreds of migrant workers who have made the ultimate sacrifice while helping to prepare Qatar for another of Fifa\u2019s harmonious global jamborees. <br></p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT!</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Follow Burnley 1-1 Watford</a> with Simon Burnton\u2019s minute-by-minute report at 8pm. </p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfcd85ee7e8327f24c8757b2c798b361f99403ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfcd85ee7e8327f24c8757b2c798b361f99403ec/468_175_1227_736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Moyes doing some touchline thinking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Moyes doing some touchline thinking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Lee/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to get a better team, it\u2019s as simple as that\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/david-moyes-sunderland-crystal-palace-premier-league\">Sunderland boss David Moyes has his eureka moment</a>.</p> <h2>FOOTBALL WEEKLY LIVE!</h2> <p>AC Jimbo and his pod squad have been allowed to return to London\u2019s London Palladium, and <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/football-weekly-live-in-london-26602443625\">tickets are now available</a> for their show on 15 November.

  "<p>Magers and Quinn was opened in the summer of 1994, by Denny Magers, who has been the sole owner for 21 years. Before Magers and Quinn, he\u2019d purchased a small antiquarian bookstore near the University of Minnesota that was not infrequently compared to the bookstore in <em>The Neverending Story</em>. Looking for more bookselling opportunities, Magers saw the space in the Uptown neighborhood and decided to open another store, Magers and Quinn Booksellers (his paternal and maternal family names). Magers and Quinn Booksellers has been Uptown\u2019s favorite destination for reading material ever since.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favorite section in the store?</strong><br></p> <p><em>Jessi (retail manager)</em> Heraldry &amp; Chivalry, because once you know where the section is in the store then you are officially an expert browser or employee in the know.</p> <p><em>Ann (events coordinator) </em>Firefighting.

It\u2019s quiet.</p> <p><strong>If you had infinite space what would you add?</strong></p> <p><em>Annie (assistant manager)</em>: There\u2019s a new luxury apartment building nearby that has a pool/hot tub on the second-floor patio that juts out over the sidewalk. It\u2019s very exhibitionist and un-Minnesotan, but if we installed one of those I\u2019m pretty sure it would be the first hot tub reading room in the nation.</p> <p><em>Emily B (bookseller): </em>The Mitford Sisters section. It\u2019d only take up a foot of shelf space, for sure, but it would be a foot of shelf space catered exclusively to my politically discomfiting and sort of shameful special interest.</p> <p>The majority of the staff agrees that a bar stocked with Minneapolis craft brews would be an enhancement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2e18badfd244c6d44a9f9b07ce461c0b43ec73c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e18badfd244c6d44a9f9b07ce461c0b43ec73c/0_0_1000_353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Magers and Quinn bookstore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you do better than any other bookstore?</strong></p> <p><em>Gary (community outreach and B2B sales director):</em> New books, used books, rare and collectable books, our events, our outreach and bulk sales, etc\u2026 we do it all and we do it well!</p> <p><em>Beth (assistant manager)</em>: Make recommendations, of course!

She must have broken her arm badly in the winter because she\u2019s had a number of surgeries since\u2026 and she\u2019s only ever been in the store after a surgery. Whatever they pump into her to dull the pain, it inspires an insatiable urge for books. She usually gets a foot-high stack of picture books from the sale cart and makes the guy who drives her to and from the hospital carry it. I love her.</p> <p><em>Ann: </em>This guy comes in every couple of weeks and asks for a recommendation\u2014of anything. He will read literally anything you recommend. He holds a special place in my heart because he actually bought, read, and (supposedly) liked <em>The Monk </em>by Matthew Lewis.</p> <p><em>Emily B: </em>I also love that guy.

It was terrifying but the <a href=\"http://blog.jordanmatter.com/2012/10/i-cant-believe-this-all-happened-in.html\">photos are great</a>.</p> <p><em>Beth</em>: Guy came in looking for a book, which was about WWII, main character was a Nazi\u2014but you don\u2019t find that out until the end.

  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11151931/Fr-Benedict-Groeschel-obituary.html\" title=\"\">Father Benedict Groeschel</a> \u2013 a psychologist and priest \u2013 was asked for a foreword to the American edition of Gabriele Amorth\u2019s first book, he refused. Though Amorth too was a Roman Catholic cleric, his outlook was \u201cquite foreign to the ideas of the English-speaking world\u201d, wrote Groeschel. His fellow priest, he said, inhabited \u201ca world that vacillates between severe rationalism and wild speculation\u201d.</p> <p>It was a view of Amorth that was to be expressed several times over the course of his career, as when he denounced yoga or declared that Hitler and Stalin had been possessed by the devil. But then Amorth, who has died aged 91, worked in a field that most people today dismiss as mumbo-jumbo, and one with which many of his fellow Roman Catholics are profoundly uncomfortable.</p> <p>He was an exorcist \u2013 founder, in 1990, of the International Association of Exorcists and its president until his retirement 10 years later. But whereas most of the other practitioners of his trade shunned publicity, Amorth embraced it.</p> <p>He published a string of books and was seldom reluctant to give a comment or an interview. With his pale, round face and a surname JK Rowling might have bestowed on one of her hero\u2019s more tenebrous adversaries, Amorth was a journalist\u2019s dream. Yet the man they encountered turned out to be disarmingly jovial and with a matter-of-fact way of describing his extraordinary calling.</p> <p>\u201cHolding two fingers on the patient\u2019s eyes, we raise the eyelids,\u201d he told one interviewer. \u201cAlmost always, in cases of evil presence, the eyes look completely white. Even with the help of both hands, we can barely discern whether the pupils are towards the top or the bottom of the eye.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had seen victims levitate. He said he had watched as four strong men struggled to hold down an 11-year-old child. He kept a little collection of items \u2013 nails, keys and the like \u2013 which he said his \u201cpatients\u201d had spat out during exorcism. And in one book, An Exorcist Tells His Story (1994), he blithely remarked that \u201cthe hardest to cure are the victims of the most powerful spells. I remember some people who had been subjected to a spell in Brazil called macumba. I exorcised others who had been afflicted by African witch doctors.\u201d</p> <p>Amorth did not choose to be an exorcist. Born into a middle-class family in Modena, Italy, he joined the partisans in the second world war. Shortly before his death, indeed, he was awarded a medal for his wartime exploits. When peace came, Amorth joined the nascent Christian Democrat movement, serving for a while as deputy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/06/giulio-andreotti-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Giulio Andreotti</a> at the head of the party\u2019s youth wing. He was ordained in the early 1950s as a member of the order of the Pauline Fathers, who publish the influential \u2013 and often controversially liberal \u2013 Italian Catholic weekly, Famiglia Cristiana.</p> <p>It was not until 1986 that he was asked by Cardinal Ugo Poletti to assist the ailing chief exorcist of the diocese of Rome. How many exorcisms Amorth performed over the next 14 years is hard to establish, because the number seemed to climb after his retirement until, in 2013, it reached the improbable tally of 160,000. He did stress, however, that an exorcism might denote no more than a brief prayer and that he had dealt with fewer than 100 out-and-out demonic possessions.</p> <p>In an interview with Vatican Radio, Amorth said exorcism was needed \u201cbecause things happen that reason cannot explain but which the Bible, on the other hand, expounds\u201d. Though his more rational fellow believers may wish to ignore them, the New Testament contains more than 20 references to Jesus casting out spirits, and exorcism has an established, though diminished, place, not just in Catholicism but in other Christian faiths.</p> <p>Catholic bishops are empowered to perform exorcisms as of right. Traditionally, they delegated the work to a priest chosen for the task. But progressively fewer Catholic dioceses have an official exorcist. The Vatican last codified the rites of exorcism in 2004 in an updated Latin-language document, De Exorcismis et Supplicationibus Quibusdam. It stressed that whoever claimed to be possessed should first be \u201cevaluated by doctors to rule out a mental or physical illness\u201d. But both the last two popes performed exorcisms. And only two years ago the Vatican officially recognised Amorth\u2019s global brotherhood of demon-ejectors and spell-breakers.</p> <p>Even Groeschel had second thoughts after reading Amorth\u2019s account of his career. In the foreword he produced, he wrote that \u201cas a priest rather than a clinician, I recognise in this book the account of an intelligent and dedicated pastor of souls who has had the courage to go where most of us fear to tread\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Gabriele Amorth, priest, born 1 May 1925; died 16 September 2016</p>",

Adding in all proposed reforms, to areas such as building codes, emissions standards for trucks and fertilizers, would still see a shortfall of 356m to 924m tonnes by 2025.</p> <p>While the US still has time to close this gap, the study warns that additional measures will probably be required at a time when action on climate change is anathema to Republicans whose presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has called global warming a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/\">hoax</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en\">bullshit</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Greenblatt said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to set ambitious targets, it pushes us to be creative and find ways to meet them.

Soberingly, the 2C guardrail is also in jeopardy, with several analyses showing that nations\u2019 emissions reduction pledges are insufficient.</p> <p>Calculations <a href=\"https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/scoreboard/\">released this month</a> by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that proposed emissions cuts would lead to a 3.5C increase in average global temperatures by 2100. This warming would probably trigger a range of dangerous environmental changes for humans and other species.</p> <p>John Sterman, director of the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the new emissions projection study, which he wasn\u2019t involved in, was \u201csound\u201d in its conclusions.</p> <p>\u201cThe target is absolutely not beyond our reach, it\u2019s just not likely with current policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the technology to dramatically cut emissions and economically we know it\u2019s affordable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/15/marshall-islands-climate-change-springdale-arkansas\">Lives in the balance: climate change and the Marshall Islands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe problem is a political problem and an implementation problem. The US, and the world, needs deeper and sooner cuts.\u201d</p> <p>Sterman said cheap gasoline and natural gas prices in the US have led to overconsumption of fossil fuels and slowed efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that putting a price on carbon, which has been done in California but fiercely resisted by Republicans nationally, would provide the largest single shove towards meeting the 2025 target.</p> <p>\u201cIf you had to take one policy to a desert island, it would be a price on carbon,\u201d Sterman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the only one. There\u2019s no silver bullet to dealing with climate change, there\u2019s silver buckshot.\u201d</p>",

At times, the most harmless human enjoyment is in direct conflict with other animals: an increase in walking, for instance, has caused some shoreline-nesting birds to plummet in number on remote beaches.</p> <p>In Scotland, where wild camping is widely permitted, I see plenty of notices about the \u201cleave no trace\u201d principles \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trowel-leaflet.pdf\" title=\"\">some illustrated with a trowel</a> \u2013 to teach you how to dispose of your business. Unfortunately the lochside ban has been triggered by abandoned tents, horrendous litter and, yes, shitting in the woods.</p> <p>The ban symbolises a government giving up on trying to improve behaviour. Unruly camping could be cleaned up with better education and enforcement. The canoeist told me of a Loch Lomond police officer who on finding partying campers throwing away beer cans would take their details and tell them that if they were gone \u2013 without a trace \u2013 in the morning he\u2019d tear up the charge. It worked every time. Wild camping has helped Scotland maintain a healthier culture of enjoying nature than England. My Glaswegian mates were urban twentysomethings but they eschewed Ibiza for the equally lively (and far cheaper) holiday of fishing, drinking and camping in the Highlands. It would be tragic if this was regulated&#xa0;out&#xa0;of&#xa0;existence.</p> <h2><strong>Gunning for rare birds </strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpliQXvgo58\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bpliQXvgo58?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpliQXvgo58\">Woodcock roding</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Chris Packham was last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/23/chris-packham-bbc-trust-countryside-alliance-springwatch\" title=\"\">cleared by the BBC Trust of \u201cbias\u201d</a> after daring to campaign against the illegal killing of wildlife.

The United States are desperate to end a miserable run after losing six of the past seven events and, on home turf this week, at Hazeltine in Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/ryder-cup-us-europe-darren-clarke-davis-love\" title=\"\">the US are favourites against a team</a> in which Clarke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/31/darren-clarke-ryder-cup-captains-picks-thomas-pieters\" title=\"\">has picked six rookies</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve put my heart and soul into it,\u201d Clarke says intently when we meet a few days before the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-dies-87-peoples-champion-the-king\" title=\"\">Arnold Palmer</a> and on an afternoon when golfing fervour swarms through him. \u201cAm I sleeping well? No \u2013 because I want to give my guys the best opportunity to play well and win. I wake up in the middle of the night and think: \u2018Did I do that? Did I do this?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-dies-87-peoples-champion-the-king\">Arnold Palmer: the people\u2019s champion with an unmistakable aura of greatness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke once told me the biggest flaw in his game was his perfectionism \u2013 and an exhausting pursuit of ideal circumstances that are usually impossible to attain. \u201cVery much so,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cHave I been the same way this time? Totally. I go into great detail to ensure everything possible has been done.\u201d</p> <p>There is a fanatical streak in Clarke \u2013 and he admits readily to having obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder \u2013 but his team are fortunate that their captain is also aware of the vast difference between sport and real life. He has a reputation for being tetchy to some interviewees but Clarke\u2019s layered past is far more interesting than whether or not he is in the mood to be charming. Of course it helps that he is relaxed and hospitable today and we can talk about him growing up amid the Troubles and his reaction to personal devastation.</p> <p>Ten years ago this month he produced one of the most memorable displays of Ryder Cup golf when, only weeks after losing his wife Heather to cancer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/25/rydercup2006.rydercup10\" title=\"\">Clarke won all three of his matches at the K&#xa0;Club</a>. His steely performance was followed by a very human reaction at its tearful conclusion, as victory was tempered by grief. After such tumult, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/nov/28/golf.comment\" title=\"\">which we addressed in an interview that year</a>, Clarke should control his emotions in a mere sporting arena.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the big difference. Ten years ago was incredibly testing. The most pressure I will ever, ever feel is on the first hole of that 2006 Ryder Cup. Walking to that first tee, hitting that first shot, the world watching so soon after losing Heather, was like nothing else. Nothing compares to that intensity. Down the stretch at the Open in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/17/open-2011-darren-clarke-wins\" title=\"\">when Clarke won his only major</a>], did that experience help me win? I guess it did. The Ryder Cup first tee is a place where very few people get to stand and, in 2006, the pressure was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke smiles at the tears that followed \u2013 when he said men from County Tyrone were not meant to cry or hug one another. But his emotion was uncorked after his singles opponent Zach Johnson conceded the putt that gave Clarke the win. \u201cIt was a lovely gesture which meant so much. I will cherish forever the support I got from my team and the Americans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All I ask for is etiquette when our team hit their shots. Home support is an integral part of the Ryder Cup</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This week a fevered home crowd will provide partisan support but Clarke is suitably sanguine. \u201cAll I ask for is etiquette when our team hit their shots. Home support is an integral part of the Ryder Cup and creates its unique atmosphere. It\u2019s going to be loud because Davis Love III [the USA captain] and his team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/10/davis-love-iii-ryder-cup-wildcards-darren-clarke-hazeltine\" title=\"\">want to win it back</a>. But it\u2019s a huge compliment to Europe that America have formulated a taskforce to figure out how to win.</p> <p>\u201cThe atmosphere is going to be right on the edge. But Davis and I have been friends a long time and if anyone moves over that line I\u2019m sure he will step in. If roles are reversed I\u2019ll do exactly that. It\u2019s not life or death. It\u2019s sport \u2013 a game of golf.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s illuminating to meet Clarke in Belfast and to reflect on how far Northern Ireland has moved from sectarian violence. Hearing him talk about a conflict as bloody and tangled as the Troubles underpins his emphasis that the Ryder Cup, which can carry a militaristic jingoism in the US, is nothing more nor less than sporting theatre. \u201cBelfast has a wonderful feel about it these days. There are great restaurants and bars. We\u2019re so far along the peace process that people are too used to it to ever let it go back to how it was.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke grew up 40 miles away in Dungannon and he grimaces when asked if the worst of the Troubles reached his home town. \u201cOh, they did. They were all over the place. Dungannon was right in the middle of an area where lots of dark stuff happened. There was trouble everywhere. Thankfully we\u2019ve come a long way from those dark old days but we didn\u2019t give in to fear. People in Northern Ireland are very resilient. Throughout the Troubles they battled on to live as normally as they could.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup-darren-clarke-hazeltine\">Rory McIlroy excited at prospect of helping boyhood hero Clarke win Ryder Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems incredible that, in Belfast in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/18/carl-frampton-jeremy-parodi-barry-mcguigan\" title=\"\">boxers from Republican areas would be embraced on the Loyalist Shankill Road</a> \u2013 and amateur fighters from fiercely unionist territories were proud to box for Ireland. \u201cGolf was another mixed one,\u201d Clarke stresses. \u201cA few sports were untouched and we all played for Ireland. There is no Northern Irish golf team. Same with boxing, rugby and swimming. I was fortunate to be in two unifying sports. I played rugby and golf and they were inclusive. I was Protestant but it was no problem playing for Ireland. I was lucky because my parents got me travelling around Ireland playing in boys\u2019 tournaments. My eyes were opened to a big and different world and I wasn\u2019t here day in, day out, while the Troubles were raging.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s love of the Ryder Cup coincided with the advent of a European team to replace Great Britain and Ireland as the USA\u2019s opponents. \u201cI was born in 1968 and swept up in the Ryder Cup as a teenager. Seve [Ballesteros] changed everything when Europe became part of the Ryder Cup [in 1979] and it\u2019s grown massively.\u201d</p> <p>The 2016 Ryder Cup is being held only weeks before a US election where, disturbingly, Donald Trump harbours hopes of becoming president while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/21/ryder-cup-donald-trump-brexit-usa-europe\" title=\"\">Britain and Europe are still absorbing the Brexit fallout</a>. Clarke, unsurprisingly, does not indulge in Brexit discussions. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d he&#xa0;stonewalls.</p> <p>Surely the European players talk about Brexit? \u201cNo. Our game is global. At the end of the day we will stand proudly under the European flag. Whether or not the UK is going to be part of the European Union is irrelevant because we\u2019ll always be on the continent of Europe. The Brexit thing is a complete irrelevance.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s final wild-card pick, having added the experience of Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/thomas-pieters-impresses-tiger-woods-darren-clarke-europe-ryder-cup\" title=\"\">boiled down to a choice between Russell Knox</a>, a Scot who is the world No19, and Thomas Pieters, a young Belgian who is 42 in the rankings. Clarke chose Pieters.</p> <p>\u201cRussell is a great player and it was a very difficult phone call. I don\u2019t like letting people down but I go back to 2008 and Nick Faldo didn\u2019t pick me. I was upset but I understood I hadn\u2019t done enough as a qualifier. That was me being philosophical and, maybe, thinking at some stage I might be lucky enough to have to make the same decision. But I understood exactly how Russell was feeling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c578ef5cd498438510e72f8487e454b1cb91e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c578ef5cd498438510e72f8487e454b1cb91e67/38_348_4835_2902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Darren Clarke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Clarke: \u2018Am I sleeping well?

He sent me a really nice text afterwards and massive respect to him for doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke and Pieters played together for the first two days in a Danish tournament \u2013 where the Belgian shot an astonishing opening-round 62. \u201cHe played phenomenally but I\u2019ve been keeping my eye on him a long time because he\u2019s a rare talent. But I hadn\u2019t made my mind up until I watched the way he finished that tournament with birdie, birdie, birdie on the last three holes to win. To do that when you need it most to give yourself the best chance to make the Ryder Cup was very&#xa0;impressive.\u201d</p> <p>He underlines his belief that Pieters has a talent that warrants comparison with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. \u201cYes. Thomas is the same. He\u2019s heading to the very top.\u201d</p> <p>The art of Ryder Cup captaincy resides in selection \u2013 especially in terms of pairings. \u201cI am 90% there in knowing my Friday morning foursomes,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cThe afternoon fourballs are trickier. Midway through those morning matches I\u2019ve got to pick the afternoon pairings. I will have my ideas but I have to be fluid.\u201d</p> <p>The US team are under immense pressure but Clarke will also feel a weight of expectation \u2013 after sustained European supremacy. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it that way,\u201d he insists. \u201cEach Ryder Cup is a new event. Yes, it would be unprecedented for Europe to win four times in a row. Yes, I would love to add another European victory to the list. If they play the way in which I know they can we\u2019ll have a great chance of winning again. But the past is past.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/ryan-moore-united-states-final-wild-card-ryder-cup-golf\">Ryan Moore named as United States\u2019 final wild card for Ryder Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two years ago, Europe\u2019s captain Paul McGinley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/sep/23/alex-ferguson-ryder-cup-europe\" title=\"\">invited Sir Alex Ferguson</a> to address his Ryder Cup team. Clarke, an ardent Liverpool fan, also met Ferguson at the Masters this year. \u201cI sat down with Fergie for an hour and had a wonderful conversation. To have the opportunity to talk to one of the best managers \u2013 if not the best manager of any sport in the world \u2013 meant an awful lot. I had all my questions ready and taped the whole thing. Some of the answers were expected and some were definitely ones I learnt a lot from.

It would be stupid if I wasn\u2019t taking advice from people who\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p> <p>Will he ask a famous character to talk to his team? \u201cI do have someone in mind. I obviously can\u2019t tell you who it My five vice-captains have also been fantastic. I\u2019ve got the experience of Sam Torrance, the straightforwardness of Paul Lawrie, the political correctness of Thomas Bjorn, the passion of Poults [Ian Poulter] and thinking on a different level from Padraig Harrington. It\u2019s a special combination.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years ago, after his emotional victory at the K&#xa0;Club, Clarke apparently drank 24 pints of Guinness on the Sunday night. Does that number seem feasible? \u201cTotally! But this time I will be very reserved in my captain\u2019s role. On Sunday I\u2019ll have a few drinks but I will have commitments on the Monday, so I have to be sensible. But after Monday I get my life back.\u201d</p> <p>It is a life that has been scarred by division and loss, by obsession and death.

  "<p>The illegal trade in wildlife is a most attractive crime. But it is highly destructive, and its scale is threatening the extinction of some of the world\u2019s most iconic species.</p> <p>It is also grotesquely cruel: poachers slice off the faces of live rhinos to steal their horns; militia groups use helicopters to shoot down elephants for their tusks; factory farmers breed captive tigers to marinate their bones for medicinal wine and fry their flesh for the dinner plate; bears are kept for a lifetime in tiny cages to have their gall bladders regularly drained for liver tonic.

At the other end of the supply line, in Beijing, it sells for well over ten times as much, with some sales reaching $2,025 a kilo, according to research by Chatham House. The markup is even bigger with rhino horn: from $1,000 for a pair of horns (average weight 6kg each) at poacher level to upwards of $66,000 a kilo in China.</p> <p>Profits have increased dramatically over the past decade, driven by the wealthy new elites in Asia, accumulating ivory carvings and tiger skins as status symbols for their homes; buying ground powder of rhino horn and tiger-bone wine as traditional remedies for almost every ailment from hangovers to cancer, none of it based on any scientific evidence.

And up against this collection of highly organised and well-resourced criminals, we currently deploy some of the world\u2019s weakest law enforcement.</p> <p>The only global body tasked with protecting the world\u2019s wildlife is a network of officials in each of the nations signed up to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which is co-ordinated by a small secretariat in Geneva.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad76ab49e9952b77fa24567e3a82ae590fd8b84d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad76ab49e9952b77fa24567e3a82ae590fd8b84d/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal rights activists carry placards outside the Sandton convention centre in Johannesburg, where the Cites summit is being held.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal rights activists carry placards outside the Sandton convention centre in Johannesburg, where the Cites summit is being held.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cites was written in 1973 when the main threat to wildlife was the encroachment of human settlements on vulnerable habitat. Now it finds itself confronting these criminal networks, even though it has no detectives, no police powers and no firearms. In short, Cites is not a law enforcement agency. It is there to regulate trade. It can try to punish rogue governments by asking its members to stop trading Cites species with them, but it has no tools to punish the criminals who have already decided to defy those governments.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/bach-brothers-elephant-ivory-asias-animal-trafficking-network\">The crime family at the centre of Asia's animal trafficking network</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The global agencies set up to fight organised crime have bigger priorities: terrorists, arms traffic, narcotics, counterfeit goods. Other agencies try to fill the gap. Interpol distributes intelligence on the worst wildlife offenders; the UN Office on Drugs and Crime publishes research; the World Bank advises on the tracing of laundered money. None of them goes out to catch criminals. The few specialists who try to work internationally find themselves swimming against a tide of inertia.<br></p> <p>A senior law enforcement figure in southern Africa who specialised in wildlife crime told the Guardian that the crime groups enjoyed far better international links than he does. \u201cI have to rely on people I meet at conferences,\u201d said John Sellar, who spent 14 years as enforcement support officer for Cites before he took early retirement.</p> <p>\u201cA major reason for that,\u201d he told the Guardian, \u201cwas that I was fed up with the complete hypocrisy of people coming to Cites meetings and passing resolutions and then going home and, frankly, doing bugger all about them \u2013 politicians and law enforcement people.\u201d</p> <p>The few traffickers who are caught are dealt with by prosecution systems riddled with failure. When the international law firm DLA Piper in 2014 investigated criminal justice in ten countries on the frontline of wildlife traffic, it found \u201ca host of weaknesses\u201d including legal loopholes, chronic shortage of funds for prosecutors and courts, low rates of conviction, inadequate penalties and corruption. \u201cThe only consistent theme,\u201d it concluded, \u201cis that significant work needs to be done in every country in order to effectively tackle the illegal wildlife trade.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/map-zip/giv-1406tNPPpDInvw0U\" data-alt=\"Trafficking network\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/map-zip/giv-1406tNPPpDInvw0U\">Trafficking network</a> </figure>  <p>Currently, the void is being filled to some extent by a loose network of volunteers, journalists and NGOs running their own investigations and attempting to get local law enforcement agencies to make arrests and prosecute. This includes NGOs like Freeland in Bangkok running long-term investigations of the kind whose results we are publishing today. That investigation was paid for by a small English charity that has sent tens of thousands of pounds across the world to pay Freeland to do the policing that was otherwise absent.<br></p> <p>The effect of this law enforcement void is traumatic. From African bush to Asian jungle to Russian steppe, the valuable parts of animals are ripped and sliced from their skeletal sockets and shovelled onto invisible conveyor belts, almost all headed for the same destinations in South East Asia and China. They leave Africa by sea, most often from Mombasa, Kenya, where the Elephant Action League last year ran a 12-month undercover investigation, which concluded that \u201cmassive amounts of ivory continue to pass unhindered\u201d; or by air, from Johannesburg, where the Guardian found a long-term airline employee who was part of a smuggling network, or through Maputo, Mozambique, which was described to us by a South African policing source as \u201ca major security problem\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10ab83ed6d2bb07926f4af76e9933734dbe4b21c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10ab83ed6d2bb07926f4af76e9933734dbe4b21c/0_412_5412_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants gather at Big Toms waterhole in Hwange national park, Zimbabwe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephants gather at Big Toms waterhole in Hwange national park, Zimbabwe.

Several sub-species are already extinct. Others are officially \u2018critically endangered\u2019. The biggest surviving population is the 21,000 southern white rhino, most of whom are in South Africa. And that is where the rhino poachers are busiest: 88% of the rhinos killed last year were in South Africa.<br></p> <p>The attack on elephants is even more frenzied. The conveyor belt to Asia sags under the weight of the ivory from something like 90 dead African elephants every day. In 2013, a single seizure in Guangzhou uncovered 1,913 tusks, the product of nearly 1,000 dead animals. The US National Academy of Sciences in 2014 found that in the previous three years poachers had killed 100,000 elephants, reducing the species to a total of only 450,000 in all Africa. And the numbers are still falling: the kill rate has exceeded the birth rate every year since 2010. Central Africa has lost 76% of its elephants since 2002. Tanzania has lost 66% in the last six years alone. Mozambique has lost 48% in five years. </p> <p>The scale of ivory poaching is so colossal that the UN Office of Drugs and Crimethis year concluded that it could not be explained simply by looking at its sales, legal or illegal. In his time at Cites, Sellar speculated that financial and/or criminal elites were hoarding ivory as a long-term investment and method of laundering cash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31b264313159203647aa88e54e1ab26f51ec373c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b264313159203647aa88e54e1ab26f51ec373c/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Zimbabwe National Parks official inspects the country\u2019s ivory stockpile in Harare.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Zimbabwe National Parks official inspects the country\u2019s ivory stockpile in Harare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the conveyor belt alongside these iconic creatures there are the remains of hundreds of other animals: paws for ashtrays; teeth for pendants; genitals for sex drive; the skins of snakes; the scales of pangolin anteaters to be roasted and chewed for a health fad, 275 of them a day, 100,000 a year. There is a steady flow of tiger corpses, sometimes whole, sometimes only the skin and bones. A hundred years ago, there were some 100,000 wild tigers spread all across Asia and into eastern Russia: now there are an estimated 3,500, only 2,200 of whom are in populations big enough to make breeding and survival viable.<br></p> <p>This trade has been allowed to grow not only because of the failure of law enforcement but because it is inextricably linked with power.<br></p> <p>The wealthy elite in Asia that consumes illegal animal products overlaps with the political elite, and the commercial elite.

The work focuses on a doctor haunted by her role in the country\u2019s population control effort, where women are often given incentives to be sterilised and doctors have targets to reach in insanitary conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThe big question is why spend so much money and resources on birth control as opposed to providing [better] healthcare,\u201d says Simha. \u201cOf course the birth rates are very high, but so are the infant mortality rates. It\u2019s an agrarian society so you do require hands in the field and you know that at least three of your five kids are going to die in the first 10 years of their life, so of course the birth rate is going to be high in those regions. Why not provide medical facilities?\u201d<br></p> <p>To research her play, Simha spent two weeks in a rural village in the state of Jharkhand. \u201cIt was quite revealing,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no electricity in the primary health centres and there\u2019s no transportation.

  "<p></p> <p>There is a simple reason why there is always trouble in Nakhon Phanom. It is the reason why the US air force came here during the Vietnam war, and the reason why this dull and dusty town in north-east Thailand now serves as a primary gateway on the global animal trafficking highway. It is all to do with geography.</p> <p>Nakhon Phanom, population 30,000, sits on the western bank of the Mekong river and is directly opposite the shortest route across Laos, on the other side of the river, and into Vietnam.</p> <p>For the US air force it was the closest allied territory to Hanoi, 380km (236 miles) away as the bomber flies. For the wildlife traffickers, it is the perfect place for business. To the west, Thailand has some of the best air and sea connections in South East Asia; and to the east, across the narrow strip of Laos, are the markets of Vietnam and China, bursting with the wealth of their new economies and hungry for the flesh, skin, claws and bones of exotic wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/wildlife-trafficking-network/giv-1406nXN0sgoCEN4t/\" data-alt=\"The trafficking network\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/wildlife-trafficking-network/giv-1406nXN0sgoCEN4t/\">The trafficking network</a> </figure>  <p>Today the Guardian exposes the crime family that controls this gateway. And we name three mainstream Lao companies with powerful political connections as leading brokers in the global trafficking of wildlife. Together with other suppliers they have been trading many tonnes of elephant tusk, rhino horn and lion bone from Africa and truckloads of tigers, turtles, snakes, monkeys and pangolin anteaters from Asia. A substantial amount of their business is illegal. All of these traders earn a good living; the kingpins are millionaires. All the animals they handle lose their freedom; almost all of them also lose their lives.

But when law enforcement agencies failed to act, Freeland pushed deeper, working with a Thai government surveillance team, persuading some of the traffickers to talk to them and stepping round the corrupt public officials who guard the network to gather intelligence from reliable police sources in Africa and Asia.</p> <p>Freeland has shared its evidence with the Guardian in the hope it will finally jumpstart cross-border police action against this and other networks.

Told now in full for the first time, this is the story of the Asian connection.</p> <h2>The Asian connection</h2> <p>The secret life of Nakhon Phanom revolves around one crime family, the Bachs. Four wildlife traffickers, speaking independently, name two of the Bach brothers as the key players who control the smuggling gateway from Thailand into Laos: Bach Mai, known to his friends as \u2018Boonchai\u2019, 38; and his older brother, Bach Van Limh, 45. Although they are active in Thailand, the brothers are originally Vietnamese and have networks in both countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f665cfc93d9c2d7a2989e125da7fb61d2062eda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f665cfc93d9c2d7a2989e125da7fb61d2062eda/0_0_720_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boonchai runs the operation in Nakhon Phanom with a dozen men and a handful of women.

He originally set up the family business in Nakhon Phanom some 15 years ago but recently left, allegedly after Thai police started investigating his involvement in the drugs trade. In Son Tay, according to Vietnamese police sources, Bach Van Limh is involved in running prostitutes and in smuggling cars as well as wildlife. He owns a hotel, a cafe and legitimate businesses trading gold and placing migrant workers.</p> <p>The Bachs are key players in a busy market, buying from whoever will sell to them. Among numerous smaller suppliers, three Lao companies have been operating for as long as the Bach brothers. One is already notorious in the animal world: the Xeosavang Trading Company run by Vixay Keosavang, who has been hammered by a combination of policing and publicity, much of it organised by Freeland. But just as the Bachs, until now, have escaped public attention, so too have the other Lao companies. Vinasakhone and Vannaseng are big players \u2013 both breaking the law and both still enjoying one of the world\u2019s most destructive trades.</p> <p>All three Lao companies opened wildlife farms in the early 2000s. They imported tigers bred in captivity, which was legal so long as they were used for science and education, not for commercial trade. One of them \u2013 Vannaseng \u2013 illegally imported 2,000 macaque monkeys captured and sold by villagers in Cambodia, according to an internal Lao government report. All three companies went on to break international and Lao law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07b544c81b07f111b18b7598771286700724bc93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07b544c81b07f111b18b7598771286700724bc93/57_38_587_734/400.jpg\" alt=\"Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At that time, the Bach brothers were already smuggling wildlife, primarily from a dealer widely known as \u2018Fatty\u2019, though his real name is Leuthai Tiewcharoen. He ran a farm in Nonthaburi, just outside Bangkok, where he stored and bred animals he had illegally smuggled into the country \u2013 tigers from Myanmar and Malaysia as well as bears, snakes and turtles. According to a source who worked at the farm, Fatty was earning 500,000 Thai baht ($14,400) a week killing these animals in a special slaughter area and shipping the carcasses eastwards to be used in food and medicine and as jewellery and home decoration.</p> <p>Sometimes, he sent them across the Mekong himself. There was a standard technique that Fatty and other Thai traffickers used, according to the source. The trafficker would go to a remote spot on the Thai side of the river, signal to a contact on the Lao side and drop a carcass in a sealed body bag into the water. The Lao contact would row over, haul the bag back across the river, weigh it and then make a phone call to send money to the trafficker\u2019s bank account. Some of these consignments would go straight into the farms set up on the Lao side of the Mekong by the three big companies. But, according to the source, Fatty also routinely sent carcasses direct to his best smuggling contacts \u2013 the Bach brothers.</p> <h2>The South African link</h2> <p>One day late in 2002 or early in 2003, Fatty came up with a new scheme. He had met an ambitious man called Chumlong Lemonthai, then aged 35, who had been earning a living selling fruit in a street market in Bangkok but who wanted to move into the wildlife trade. Chumlong reckoned he knew somebody who could provide rhino horn, originally sourced from Africa, and bones of big cats from the dry forests of central Thailand. Fatty set up a meeting between Chumlong and the Bach brothers at his farm, hoping to earn a commission as a middleman. At first, it went well. The Bachs brought with them a suitcase containing 40 million baht (about $1m), which impressed Chumlong. He agreed to supply the horn and bones. Then it went bad for Fatty: the Bachs cut him out of the deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"436546463470a551b3ceae2c4ecc062ea293f918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436546463470a551b3ceae2c4ecc062ea293f918/0_74_700_420/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chumlong Lemonthai.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chumlong Lemonthai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chumlong went on to thrive in the trade and, apart from selling to the Bachs, he made a connection to one of the big Lao companies, Xeosavang, owned by Vixay Keosavang, who was to become notorious as a wildlife trafficker. From his base in Paksan, western Laos, Keosavang was sucking in animals from all over Asia and illegally churning out body parts at up to ten tonnes a week, investing his profit in hotels and a transport business. By 2005, Chumlong was having trouble supplying his customers from the dwindling sources of wildlife in South East Asia, and he decided to move to the biggest potential source in the world, South Africa.</p> <p>There, Chumlong rapidly made friends with Thai sex workers in the bars of Pretoria. Through them, he got to know white South African landowners who bred lions on their ranches. Chumlong commissioned the killing of hundreds of lions and supervised the boiling of their corpses to separate the bones from the flesh. He then parceled up the bones in ten-kilo bags - roughly one bag for each dead animal - and shipped them back to the Bachs and to Keosavang, who variously sold them onwards to Vietnam and China to be boiled and brewed as a cheap substitute for tiger bones in health tonics (although there is no evidence of its medicinal effect).</p> <p>This was potentially illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which allows commercial trade in lions only within set limits. The first two white farmers he dealt with had a licence to export a limited quantity of lion bone, which could be sent to Thailand under cover of official Cites paperwork. However, the evidence also suggests that some of Chumlong\u2019s lion trade was illegal. Often, he would have the teeth and claws of lions smuggled out of South Africa by Thai sex workers; they were helped through Johannesburg airport by an airline worker whose identity is known to the Guardian. In Bangkok, a corrupt airport official guarded Chumlong\u2019s packages as they arrived in Thailand.</p> <h2>The \u2018pseudo\u2019 hunt</h2> <p>With his lion bone business flourishing, Chumlong turned his attention to rhino horn, which was in huge demand in Vietnam after 2007 when a rumour spread that a government official had used it to cure his cancer. The international sale of rhino products is prohibited in Cites, but Chumlong and other Vietnamese traffickers now started to exploit a loophole which allowed hunters in South Africa to take home one set of rhino horns each year as a trophy. They set up \u201cpseudo\u201d hunts in which a willing stooge was paid to stand next to a professional hunter while a rhino was shot dead and had its horn removed. The stooge would then have a photo taken with the corpse and allow their name to be used on the paperwork to take the horn to Asia. There, instead of being displayed as a trophy, it would be sold and ground down for traditional medicine, although rhino horn is materially no different to fingernails and no more effective as medicine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f0c058e1883a594251c7b41a2bf5322ceb5aa5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f0c058e1883a594251c7b41a2bf5322ceb5aa5d/0_151_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chumlong started to import stooges from Thailand, paying them 5,000 rand (about $350) for their help. The Bach brothers sponsored some of these pseudo hunts. Paperwork seen by the Guardian shows that at least six members of their extended family travelled from Vietnam to South Africa to take part. Then in a neat money-saving manoeuvre, Chumlong substituted Thai prostitutes from his favourite bar in Pretoria, who played the same role for him without the cost of the international air fare. In this way, Chumlong arranged the killing of dozens of rhinos, earning himself $20,000 a time for their horns, which were shipped back to Keosavang and the Bachs.</p> <p>All this was illegal, though the pseudo hunts gave him the bogus protection of Cites paperwork for their export as trophies. The evidence suggests that Chumlong was also trafficking rhino horn from poachers, whose killing of rhinos in southern Africa escalated fast from 2008 as the demand from Vietnam and China increased. By this time, Chumlong, the former street trader, had bought himself two new houses in Bangkok.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ivory_prices-zip/giv-140668ah2gcJJjDl/\" data-alt=\"High profit margins\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ivory_prices-zip/giv-140668ah2gcJJjDl/\">High profit margins</a> </figure>  <p>In June 2011, following work by Freeland and a Johannesburg private investigator called Paul O\u2019Sullivan, Chumlong Lemtongthai was arrested by South African revenue officers in a high-profile operation. They seized his laptop, which contained commercial records and photographs recording the death of hundreds of animals and the despatch to Asia of millions of dollars worth of ivory, lion bone, and rhino horn.</p> <p>During one six-month period, the laptop documents revealed, Chumlong had paid a total of $1,394,282.40 to a white South African hunter who was shooting rhinos in his pseudo hunts. The same documents show that Chumlong was paying $6,500 per kg for the horn \u2013 a tenth of the end-user price in China, meaning that for that six-month period his rhino traffic alone was potentially worth $13.9m to those involved. Invoices also revealed the rate at which he was commissioning the death of lions: 327 of them during one two-year period, roughly one every couple of days, for which he personally received some $350,000.</p> <h2>A kingpin falls, but the trade continues</h2> <p>In November 2012, a South African court jailed Chumlong for 40 years, though this was reduced to 13 years on appeal. Bach Van Limh tried to save him, offering $600,000 to a key official in Johannesburg to release him. Chumlong has since claimed that the official was willing to accept the bribe if his money could be paid into an offshore account, but that this alarmed Bach Van Limh, who feared that with no record of the payment, the official would renege on the deal. So Chumlong stayed behind bars.</p> <p>Keosavang was hit hard by the documents in Chumlong\u2019s laptop. A combination of publicity and pressure from the US government finally forced him to step back in early 2014. At the time, his fall was celebrated as a turning point; the removal of the kingpin from the global machine. But when Freeland followed up on their investigation, they found that the Asian connection was as busy as ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71ae0a98074caa2c57a10458578df401258e937a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71ae0a98074caa2c57a10458578df401258e937a/0_44_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They started to focus on the Bach brothers, who had not been exposed, realising that they were key players.

During 2014 \u2013 the first year after Keosavang\u2019s departure \u2013 the evidence suggests that between them they traded $45m of animal body parts including derivatives from three iconic endangered species: tigers, rhinos and elephants. </p> <p>Other evidence separately suggests that both companies have been breaking the law on the farms they opened in Laos in 2002; that Vinasakhone has been illegally killing and selling tigers to order for buyers in Vietnam and China and also selling tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle area on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand where they are sold as meat, drink and decorative skins; and that Vannaseng, on one of its farms, has been breaching Cites by trafficking hundreds of tigers and bears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a8419ee02f5e9c52d30c1fc03fec21b2c970ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a8419ee02f5e9c52d30c1fc03fec21b2c970ae3/62_129_634_380/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boonchai, Keosavang and Bach Van Limh pictured together on holiday.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boonchai, Keosavang and Bach Van Limh pictured together on holiday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keosavang himself is not known to have been directly involved in wildlife trafficking since 2014.

The team have photographed multiple visits by two South African lion bone merchants with whom Chumlong was working.

She was married to a police officer and was said to have other good police contacts. After the raid, she travelled to Bangkok and lobbied senior officials to sack the officer who had organised it. Following an inquiry by the Thai Anti Money Laundering Organisation, Amlo, a court in May 2014 ordered her to hand over $35.6m as the proceeds of crime. This year the order was revoked. Her Facebook page displays a photo of her smiling over a basket full of cash.</p> <p>In a town with few sources of wealth, the surveillance teams have identified warehouses, apartment buildings and a nightclub as Bach properties and videoed the Bachs and their men driving a fleet of new high-end vehicles, some of which have had their licence plates changed.

  "<p> More needs to be done to combat financial crime, a senior lawyer at HSBC has said as he called for global collaboration over the rules imposed on banks to keep \u201cbad actors\u201d out of the financial system.<br></p> <p>Stuart Levey, HSBC\u2019s chief legal officer, said worldwide agreement over the rules would reduce the risk that banks refuse to do business with legitimate customers for fear of being punished by regulators.</p> <p>A former official at the US Treasury, Levey told a conference in Geneva: \u201cPut simply, the way we do financial crime compliance is outdated. It is neither as efficient nor effective as it could be at protecting the financial system from abuse and preventing financial crime.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two countervailing forces that provide us with a real opportunity to drive forward meaningful change in this area. On one hand there is a deepened policy and political commitment to combat financial crime and preserve the integrity of the financial system. On the other, there is the growing policy concern about the unintended consequence of financial exclusion that is resulting from robust pursuit of these objectives without great enough precision.\u201d</p> <p>Levey, in his first speech since joining HSBC four years ago, said governments and private sectors were using their own financial data to try to combat crime but were not working together . He called for the Financial Action Task Force \u2013 an intergovernmental organisation \u2013 to create global roles allowing legal protections when information is shared and ensure that secrecy and privacy laws do not stop information being shared.</p> <p>HSBC has been battling to restore its reputation after it was fined \u00a31.2bn by the US authorities in 2012 for breaches of money laundering rules and it has since emerged that George Osborne, the then chancellor, intervened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/hsbc-us-money-laundering-george-osborne-report\">argue that prosecuting Britain\u2019s biggest bank could lead to a \u201cglobal financial disaster\u201d.</a> It has also been embroiled in revelations, in the Guardian and other publications, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/hsbc-files\">its Swiss arm helped customers avoid tax</a>. <br></p> <p>Levey said rules to combat financial crime had unintended consequences such as banks \u201cde-risking\u201d \u2013 pulling out of countries or business sectors. \u201cDe-risking is being applied more and more widely as an alternative to managing risk. There are various reasons for that: the basic desire of reputable financial institutions not to facilitate illicit conduct, the challenge of identifying the individual bad actors, a weighing of the commercial benefit verses the cost of compliance and, of course, fear of enforcement,\u201d said Levey.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a heightened imperative to keep bad actors out of the financial system in order to promote security and also an imperative as a matter of economic policy to mitigate the unintended consequences of our efforts. If we do not collaborate better, we risk being one step behind in our efforts to keep illicit actors out of the system while also exacerbating the problem of financial exclusion.\u201d</p> <p>Banks, including HSBC, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/17/charities-and-bookies-among-those-caught-in-money-laundering-dragnet\">facing scrutiny of the way they have pulled back from a range of services </a>to countries such as Somalia and individuals, such as MPs.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Levey criticised the US for asking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/europeanbanks\">European banks</a> to do more business with Iran while Washington<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/hsbc-criticises-john-kerry-business-iran-europe-banks\"> was restricting American financial firms from doing the same</a>. In his speech on Monday he said he said that the sanctions against Iran - imposed in 2006 and lifted this year - had worked, leaving the country isolated and affecting its economy.<br></p>",

  "<p>Foreign coaches can\u2019t win in MLS, right?</p> <p>Wrong.</p> <p>New York City FC have qualified for the playoffs for the first time in their two-year history and much of that success rests on the back of one man: Patrick Vieira.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to forget that NYC FC were considered an outlier in the MLS Cup conversation leading into 2016 \u2013 and with good reason. The signing of Vieira did little to inspire hope. Pundits skewered City Football Group for the appointment of an inexperienced, foreign-born coaching novice to handle its high-profile American arm, especially following the release of the decorated and respected Jason Kreis.</p> <p>Furthermore, the core of last year\u2019s disastrous 2015 roster was left nearly intact. Ronald Matarrita, Federico Bravo and Diego Martinez were the only real notable offseason additions, and a standout center-back remained elusive.</p> <p>But like the 2015 Red Bulls, NYC FC thrived in the face of adversity and much of that success can be traced directly back to their coach.</p> <p>So what made Vieira successful where Kreis fell short? For starters, he commanded the respect of every player in the locker room. That is a big deal, especially when your roster includes the likes of David Villa, Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo. The offseason purge of MLS veterans such as Chris Wingert, Andrew Jacobson and Ned Grabavoy also gave him a clean slate to work with, offering a smoother transition to his more European minded way of managing the side. </p> <p>Training became noticeably stiffer. Two-a-days became a way of life. Team dinners occurred with more frequency. And each approach led to a more unified side.</p> <p>On the touchline, Vieira proved to be both stubborn and pragmatic in his coaching approach. He never compromised his desire to play out of the back, no matter how ugly some matches went (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/new-york-city-fc-red-bulls-mls-hudson-river-derby\">7-0 Red Bull loss anyone?</a>). Despite that approach, he was surprisingly malleable when it came to his tactical deployment, often compensating for the team\u2019s defensive deficiencies with multiple fronts. He experimented with everything from a modified 4-3-3 to a 1920s throwback W-M formation, cobbling together three-, four- and five-man defensive lines, sometimes in a single match.</p> <p>All the while, he stressed competition and a tough-love approach to his team. That quickly steeled the will of youngsters like Jack Harrison and Khiry Shelton while creating the kind of team environment NYC FC\u2019s veteran foreign core was accustomed to.</p> <p>The result? Victories. NYC FC finished 2015 with a league high 58 goals conceded while scoring 49. This year, they are tied for first place with the Red Bulls and Toronto, and have scored a league high 55 goals and conceded 53. Take away the 7-0 loss to the Red Bulls, and the turnaround is all the more impressive.</p> <p>Yes, Villa has been instrumental in that success and Lampard, indispensable. But make no mistake \u2013 were it not for Vieira\u2019s managerial brilliance, NYC FC would not be where they are today. <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2><strong>With defeat to Seattle the LA Galaxy must avoid last season\u2019s fate</strong></h2> <p>The LA Galaxy don\u2019t take defeat so well. And so with the full-time whistle still lingering at StubHub Center following their 4-2 loss to the Seattle Sounders the club enveloped itself in indignity. Captain Robbie Keane and Steven Gerrard were gone by the time the locker room opened to the media, while manager Bruce Arena did his best bad loser routine. \u201cOh, God. I really have to answer that? That\u2019s a fairly dumb question,\u201d he reacted when asked how the Galaxy can cut down on their defensive errors.</p> <p>This was a damaging defeat for the Galaxy, leaving them five points adrift of FC Dallas at the top of the Western Conference and Supporters\u2019 Shield standings. Damaging not because it hurts their league position particularly \u2013 FC Dallas have been favourites in the West for some time now \u2013 but because it could have an impact on their mentality heading into the play-offs. </p> <p>Of course, LA\u2019s record has been impressive of late. This was their first defeat in seven league outings and their place in the post-season is all but assured, if not locked in. But the Galaxy found themselves in a similar situation last year, performing well until a catastrophic 5-2 home defeat to the Portland Timbers. The defeat rattled them all the way into the play-offs, where LA exited in the knockout round.</p> <p>Arena must ensure the same thing doesn\u2019t happen this season following Sunday\u2019s home defeat to the Sounders. The same hallmarks were there, with the Galaxy losing their grip of things just as quickly as they did against Portland the year previously. There was a certain raggedness to their performance that will surely give Arena more concern that he let on to the media after the match. </p> <p>The momentum that seemed to have been gained by Landon Donovan\u2019s equaliser against Sporting KC the week before has now been lost. It\u2019s something of a cliche in soccer, but Arena must make sure the defeat to Seattle is considered as nothing more than a mere blip in the locker room. Otherwise the effects could seep into their mindset at the worst possible time. Sounders 2016 mustn\u2019t become Timbers 2015. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>The Kamaras never lie</h2> <p>Kei Kamara\u2019s return to Columbus was the big story going into Sunday night\u2019s primetime encounter against the Crew. However, it was the <em>other</em> Kamara leaving MAPFRE with all the glory.</p> <p>Ola Kamara notched a brace against New England, leading the way towards an important 2-0 victory. Astonishingly, the win puts the ninth place Crew just five points behind DC United for the sixth and final playoff spot in the East \u2013 with a match in hand.</p> <p>Individually, the win also adds an important chapter in the ongoing, intertwined tale of Ola and Kei Kamara. No, I did not mean to say Federico Higuain. The fact is Ola Kamara has been more effected by Kei Kamara\u2019s trade than anyone on the Crew -- Higuain included. </p> <p>Since that fateful May day, Ola Kamara (who played just 50 minutes through the team\u2019s first nine matches) has been asked to fill the boots of the beloved Kei Kamara, and he has delivered. His first 11 matches following the trade saw Ola start 10 times, scoring 10 goals for the Crew. After a brief dip in form this summer, the Norwegian striker has once again cemented his spot in the starting XI, scoring five goals in his last three starts while leading Columbus to a pair of victories.</p> <p>Kei Kamara has been another story altogether. Unlike Ola, Kei has had a difficult time moving on from his trade to New England. The 32-year-old has scored just five goals in 18 appearances with the Revolution, matching his five-goal output through nine matches with Columbus earlier this season. </p> <p>And there is another dimension to Kei\u2019s trade to consider: the emotional aspect. Kei Kamara was a community leader for the Crew. He loved Columbus and Columbus loved him, making the move all the harder for him to accept. Fans were divided on his trade, and that was still evident on Sunday night, with a smattering of boos and cheers following him throughout most of the match.</p> <p>Ola Kamara? He has been the lone constant of hope in this unlikely Crew postseason run, making him a beloved figure with the Columbus faithful.</p> <p>The funny thing is, both Kamara\u2019s now find themselves in a similar situation. New England and Columbus are searching for a postseason berth, and time is running out. Their form down the stretch may very well dictate their team\u2019s fate. And ultimately answer the question \u201cwho got the better of the deal?\u201d<strong> DM</strong></p> <h2><strong>The San Jose Earthquakes will have a lot to think about this off-season</strong></h2> <p>When the San Jose Earthquakes made their move for Dominic Kinnear two years ago they did so with one objective in mind: making the play-offs. After eight years with the Houston Dynamo the Scottish-born coach had earned a reputation for himself as a maximiser, making the most of what he had to ensure a certain consistency matched by very few in MLS. Having taken Houston to the play-offs in seven of his nine seasons at the club, making four MLS Cup finals, Kinnear was appointed at San Jose on the hope he would achieve similar success there. It hasn\u2019t panned out that way.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s 2-1 home defeat to Sporting KC - their first to the Kansas City franchise in 16 years - means the Quakes now sit slumped second bottom of the Western Conference, seven points short of the play-off spots with just five regular season fixtures left to play. For the fourth successive year, and the second with Kinnear in charge, San Jose look set to miss out on the post-season. They\u2019ll once again have their face pressed against the window, watching the party from outside.</p> <p>And so the Earthquakes will have some serious thinking to do this off-season. The move to the shiny new, glittery Avaya Stadium, with all its hospitality suites and pitchside bars, was supposed to signal a shift in identity and ambition at the club. Kinnear\u2019s appointment symbolised that. Even if he endured something of a difficult final season at Houston, the Scot was still considered MLS\u2019s go-to-guy for overachievement.</p> <p>But should San Jose finish where they currently lie in the Western Conference they will have matched their worst ever MLS finish in franchise history. Their conference title win of 2012 now seems a long time ago and the Earthquakes could now face something of an existential juncture before the start of the 2017 season. </p> <p>Of course, San Jose could still make the play-offs this season. It may be an unlikely scenario, but with two games in-hand over the Portland Timbers in sixth place they could still secure a post-season spot. The Seattle Sounders have three games in-hand over the Timbers, but it\u2019s not impossible that the Quakes could make a late run.</p> <p>However, should the probable ultimately materialise the San Jose Earthquakes must consider whether the club is heading in the right direction. If things are getting worse rather than better could Kinnear\u2019s job be under threat? What happens when the play-off man no longer makes the play-offs? <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>The picture becomes clearer</h2> <p>There is finally some clarity to the MLS playoff picture.</p> <p>As week 31 of the MLS campaign comes to a close, four teams have booked their place in the postseason. FC Dallas led the way last week as the first and only team to qualify for the playoffs. This week, they are joined by a trio of Eastern Conference powers: New York City FC, New York Red Bulls and Toronto FC.</p> <p>All three teams are tied atop the Eastern Conference with 48 points. The Red Bulls and NYC FC share identical 13-9-9 records, while Toronto FC hold a game advantage on both at 13-9-8. </p> <p>New York City FC proved they were more than just the production of Frank Lampard, unleashing four goals on the Chicago Fire en route to a 4-1 victory. That win, however, was not enough to book their place in the postseason. After watching DC United destroy Jason Kreis and Orlando City 4-1, NYC FC were forced into the uncomfortable role of cheering the New York Red Bulls against the Montreal Impact. </p> <p>As fate would have it, the Red Bulls 1-0 win not only booked their place in the postseason, but also pushed NYC FC and Toronto into the playoffs as well.</p> <p>Despite the helping hand, each team has overcome obstacles to reach their position. For Toronto, it is the second time in team history that they have qualified for the postseason \u2013 and their second consecutive postseason berth. While their roster screams contender on paper, key injuries and streaky play from the likes of Jozy Altidore, Giovinco and Michael Bradley have slowed the potential gains of an otherwise imposing roster.</p> <p>The Red Bulls, meanwhile, have struggled to find consistent winning football. They started the year losing six of their first seven matches. They followed that run with six victories in their next eight. Currently, they are undefeated in their last 13 matches, but seven of those results were draws, with six coming after conceding two goal leads, leaving questions over their consistency.</p> <p>As for NYC FC, they were never supposed to be here in the first place. A rookie, foreign coach and a near-identical roster to their poor 2015 season seemed to spell doom for the second year club. However, they have exceeded expectations and done what was once considered improbable. </p> <p>Now, all eyes are on the remaining 16 teams in the chase. <strong>DM</strong></p>",

  "<p><strong>Debt:</strong> $16,000<br></p> <p><strong>Source:</strong> Credit cards<br></p> <p><strong>Estimated years until debt-free:</strong> Six years </p> <p>My childhood was spent straddling two distinct economic classes. During the school year my three sisters and I lived with my mother and stepfather in a huge, rambling house that projected affluence. In reality, we lived in perpetual financial crisis mode, and my mother was constantly worried about money. The way my life appeared from the outside rarely reflected actual money in the bank. This financial cognitive dissonance has, in many ways, defined my life to this day.</p> <p>My mother and stepfather\u2019s precarious financial situation reflected the turbulent nature of our lives: my stepfather was an eccentric free spirit and my mother was an alcoholic. Though she showered us all with affection, the routine tasks of parenting often fell through the cracks. </p> <p>In contrast, summers were spent with our father and stepmother in Florida, where love was in short supply, but dinner was on the table every night promptly at 7pm, and money was never an issue. When we weren\u2019t in his luxury apartment overlooking the water, he was flying us in his private plane to the Bahamas, where the family kept a boat.

I wanted to look like the prosperous country club crowd my father and stepmother held in such high regard.</p> <p>By the time I married in 1999, at the age of 34, I had perfected the art of living on a shoestring, while cultivating an image of upscale comfort. As a struggling journalist I often ate $1 boxes of rice from the Chinese take-out so that I could buy expensive shoes or a handbag. If scrimping on meals wasn\u2019t enough, I\u2019d pull out my credit card. I went into my marriage with credit card bills hovering around $5,000, which took a few years to pay.</p> <p>In the first decade of our marriage, my husband rose from a low-level accountant to a country CFO at a global bank. I no longer had to pretend to be affluent; we were affluent. When we (our children were born in 2000 and 2003) relocated to Asia, we lived like royalty. The bank paid most of our major bills \u2013 including rent in luxury homes, cars and yearly trips back to the US in business class \u2013 which left us a huge amount of discretionary income. We racked up massive credit card bills every month, which were promptly paid in full. The shame from my childhood was buried deep beneath our picture-perfect family. My money problems were over.</p> <p>But it was an illusion. When we moved back to the US in 2011 we purchased a grand home that was just out of our reach. My husband was determined to have the house, so we used all of our savings \u2013 including a small inheritance I had put aside for our children \u2013 and scraped together every bit of cash we had for the down payment. My husband told me to use credit cards for expenses, and not to worry because we would pay it back. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/will-boyfriend-reject-me-debt\">Will my boyfriend reject me if he finds out about my debt? | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next year he left me for another woman.

But his market research revealed a problem: of 12 schools he visited, 11 had previously lost solar panels to thieves. So he decided to pack his system into a reinforced shipping container, creating a secure, mobile power station that could be shut away at the end of each day. </p> <p>The prototype Solar Turtle has survived its first year powering a school in the Eastern Cape, despite civil unrest that forced the school to close for three months. Save for some scratches where someone tried to break in, the unit came through intact. \u201cNothing got broken, nothing got damaged,\u201d says van der Walt. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s actually working\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Solar Turtle is just one example from a clutch of startups trying to navigate the challenges of Africa\u2019s off-grid electricity sector with mobile, flexible solar technology. It\u2019s part of a mosaic of businesses, social enterprises and philanthropic schemes fuelling talk of an African \u201csolar revolution\u201d. Other startups include Juabar and ARED, which supply portable solar kiosks for phone-charging businesses in Tanzania and Rwanda respectively, creating jobs while boosting access to clean, cheap energy.</p> <p>New ideas and declining costs are already leading to a dramatic uptake of solar technology across Africa, according to a <a href=\"http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=141&amp;SubcatID=2744\" rel=\"nofollow\">report published this week</a> by the International Renewable Energy Agency. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f47bfaa8bb4a7f5117fb70d6b1984fdff531d4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f47bfaa8bb4a7f5117fb70d6b1984fdff531d4bf/0_190_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solar panels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solar power is being used to give remote villages access to reliable sources of electricity for refrigeration and irrigation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Solar Turtle</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/20/energy-renewables-climate-change-finance-investment-east-africa-india-off-grid-development\">Investors' neglect of small-scale renewables threatens universal energy access</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Van der Walt is not alone in using shipping containers.

More than 630 million people lack electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2015/WEO2015Electricityaccessdatabase.xlsx\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Energy Agency</a>. The majority of additional investment required to achieve the UN target of universal energy access by 2030 needs to go into <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WEO2011_WEB.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">off-grid and mini-grid systems</a>, it has said.</p> <p>One hope is that electrification won\u2019t just bring light, TV and phone charging, but spawn new industries too. Africa GreenTec\u2019s prototype, launched in south-west Mali\u2019s Mourdiah village in 2015, offers a glimpse of what\u2019s possible. Locals used to throw away 80% of their goats\u2019 milk, says Schreiber, but thanks to energy for cooling from the solar container, they now use it to make cheese. Mango juice is also newly on sale.</p> <p>Despite the buzz around such ventures, most are very small and in need of funds. Commercial investors have shown some appetite for backing bigger players such as solar systems business M-Kopa Solar, which raised $19m in one investment round last November. But young, innovative startups still rely on money from donors and so-called impact investors, who look for social benefits as well as a financial return, says the <a href=\"http://global-off-grid-lighting-association.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Off-Grid Lighting Association</a>\u2019s executive director, Koen Peters.</p> <p>Schreiber\u2019s experience at Africa GreenTec bears this out.

The 60 kilowatt pilot in Mpanta, a fishing village, lost customers when a six-month fishing ban kicked in, says Oliver Johnson, senior research fellow at SEI\u2019s Africa Centre. Designing the right system, or payment plan, requires deep understanding of local conditions, he says. \u201cThe big question is how do you scale up things that need to be context-specific?\u201d</p> <p>Answering that may get easier as domestic expertise and supply chains grow \u2013 something Gillian Davies, a renewable energy expert at UK-based international development consultancy IOD PARC, has been monitoring. She points to emergent solar panel manufacturers in Kenya and Ghana, and the fact you can now take a renewable energy degree in Malawi\u2019s Mzuzu University. This shift to domestic capacity and expertise will ultimately help with finding solutions that better match local, or at least regional, conditions, says Davies.</p> <p>Products that directly boost income generation may also have an advantage over generic electrification when it comes to creating sustainable, scalable ventures, says Toby Hammond, whose Kenya-based company Futurepump sells solar-powered irrigation pumps to small-scale farmers. \u201cBeing able to irrigate a crop in dry season when you wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to grow anything translates directly into income for the farm,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more bankable.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A new book by <a href=\"http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/about/\">Michael Mann</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/tom-toles/\">Tom Toles</a> takes a fresh look on the effects humans are having on our climate and the additional impacts on our politics. While there have been countless books about climate change over the past two decades, this one \u2013 entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Madhouse-Effect-Threatening-Destroying-Politics/dp/0231177860\">The Madhouse Effect</a> - distinguishes itself by its clear and straightforward science mixed with clever and sometimes comedic presentation. <br></p> <p>In approximately 150 pages, this books deals with the basic science and the denial industry, which has lost the battle in the scientific arena and is working feverishly to confuse the public. The authors also cover potential solutions to halt or slow our changing climate. Perhaps most importantly, this book gives individual guidance \u2013 what can we do, as individuals, to help the Earth heal from the real and present harm of climate change?</p> <p>To start the book, the authors discuss how the scientific method works, the importance of the precautionary principle, and how delaying actions have caused us to lose precious time in this global race to halt climate change. And all of this done in only 13 pages!</p> <p>Next, the book dives briefly into the basic science of the greenhouse effect. Readers of this column know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/feb/23/climatology-versus-pseudoscience-new-book-checks-whose-predictions-have-been-right\">the science of global warming is very well established with decades of research</a>. But some people don\u2019t realize that this research originated in the early 1800s with scientists such as Joseph Fourier. The book takes us on a short tour of history. Moving beyond these early works that focused exclusively on global temperatures, the authors come to expected impacts. They explain that a warming world, for instance, can be both drier and wetter! </p> <p>This seeming paradox is a result of our expectation that areas which are currently wet will become wetter with an increase in the most-heavy downpours. A great example is the flooding this year in the Southeast United States. The reason for this is simple: a warmer atmosphere has more water vapor. In other areas \u2013 especially those already dry - it will become drier because evaporation will speed up. If there is no available moisture to enter into the atmosphere (i.e. an arid region), then the result is more drying. Using their candid, humorous, and clear language, the authors also discuss impacts on storms, hurricanes, rising oceans, and so on.</p> <p>With the basic science covered, the authors quickly move into reasons why readers should care. Many of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/23/climate-change-greatest-risk-management-failure\">the big risks climate change presents</a> are covered. Included here are security, water availability, food production, land use and availability, human health, and risks to the world economies and ecosystems. Simply put, these are not future and abstract risks. They are current risks that are becoming more severe and will affect all of us.</p> <p>The chapter that was most interesting to me was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/16/climate-change-contrarians-5-stages-denial\">the stages of climate denial</a>. The first stage is \u201cit\u2019s not happening,\u201d where outright denial of the reality of climate change was discussed. The authors use an example of this stage which came from the climate contrarians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/feb/21/nazis-climate-contrarian-credibility-gap\">Roy Spencer and John Christy</a>, who claimed that the Earth wasn\u2019t warming. <br></p> <p>Technically, Christy and Spencer claimed that a part of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere was cooling \u2013 in contrast to mountains of contrary evidence from around the globe. It was discovered that these contrarians had made some elementary errors in their calculations. When those calculations were corrected, their results fell into line with other research. I\u2019ve written many times about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/11/climate-change-research-quality-imbalance\">the many errors from contrarian scientists</a> \u2013 certainly not limited to Christy and Spencer. Within the scientific community, the contrarians have made so many technical errors that their work is no longer taken seriously by many scientists. But this hasn\u2019t stopped the denial industry from showcasing their work, even though it is discredited. <br></p> <p>The next stages of denial involve admissions that climate change is happening but that it is natural, it will self-correct, or it will climate change will benefit us. The tale of mistakes made in the science underlying these arguments is told in the book, and would be humorous if not so serious. The tales involve cherry-picked data, resigning editors, and other mistakes. For readers who may be concerned about getting lost in the weeds, don\u2019t worry. The authors do an excellent job hitting high points in an intelligible manner so that readers don\u2019t need a PhD in climate science to see the patterns.</p> <p>Next, the book covers the denial industry including some of the key groups and persons who were responsible for a systematic rejection of the prevailing scientific view, or at least insidious questioning so that in the public\u2019s mind there would be no consensus. This effort which not only denied the causes and effects of climate change, but also the health risks of tobacco was coupled with funding to scientists, \u201cpetitions\u201d designed to appear as if they originated from the National Academy of Sciences, and an interconnected network of funded think tanks.</p> <p>One result of all of this is that actual scientists who spend their lives studying the Earth\u2019s climate have been attacked. One of the authors of this book (Michael Mann) is perhaps in the world\u2019s best position to tell this tale because he personally knows many of the scientists who have been attacked professionally and personally, including the late Stephen Schneider, Ben Santer, Naomi Oreskes, and himself. <br></p> <p>I have had the fortune of knowing these scientists and I can attest that they (and others) go into this field because they have an intense curiosity. Scientists want to know how things work and why. A side benefit is our understanding can give us guidance about the future. I don\u2019t know of a single scientist who went into this field either for money or ideology. It\u2019s shocking to be attacked for wanting to know, or for doing our jobs and telling the public about the scientific implications of our actions.</p> <p>The book finishes by moving to the main <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jul/12/us-senators-detail-a-climate-science-web-of-denial-but-the-impacts-go-well-beyond-their-borders\">political persons and groups that now populate the contrarian landscape</a>. These groups and persons either continue the attacks on scientists, fund the denialist groups, or try to claim that taking action on climate change will do no good.

Evidence <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/documents/Development.and.Conflict2.pdf\">has shown</a> that the more violence there is in a region or country, the less development. It is fairly obvious why. How can you set up schools and hospitals when there is a danger they will be bombed? Where will the doctors and teachers come from? And how can businesses grow if they are in constant fear of losing their investments, or having to pay off armed groups? </p> <p>No business means no jobs; no schools means no education. No development. De-development, in fact, because existing schools, hospitals and businesses may fall into disuse or go under. </p> <p>Of course, the relationship also works the other way. Factors such as inequality and human rights violations provoke grievance and lead to conflict. The social conflict that has divided Colombia into haves and have-nots for centuries is not about to miraculously disappear, but breaking the vicious cycle offers a chance for differences to be aired in political debate rather than mountain skirmishes, and for development initiatives to get a stronger footing in often remote areas. <br></p> <p>The danger is that post-conflict scenarios can also be highly violent. There has already been a demobilisation in recent Colombian history, of the right-wing paramilitary forces. But many are concerned that, rather than return to civilian life, many former members of these organised terrorist forces simply formed criminal gangs and continued to wreak havoc among defenceless communities, controlling not only the illicit drug trade but also many legitimate businesses and government positions.<br></p> <p>The end of civil war does not mean the end of violence. El Salvador and Honduras have proved that. Moreover, there are countries, like Mexico and Jamaica, where there has been no formal armed conflict in living memory, but where incredibly high levels of violence can often be just as antagonistic to development efforts.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time for a new designation to describe countries that have no formal conflict, but where violence is so rife that it seriously and systematically affects efforts to govern and develop. Violence-affected states?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/20/colombia-city-of-women-safe-haven-from-violence-conflict\">Colombia's City of Women: a haven from violence | Sibylla Brodzinsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Assuming Colombia does vote for peace, there are three priorities.<br></p> <p>First, a huge peace dividend must be felt by all sections of society. Those who have suffered under the poverty and inequality that has accompanied the prolonged civil war need to feel this most. Then there will be the \u201cno\u201d voters, who still need convincing that a decisive rejection of violent conflict is the best way forward for Colombia, and who could yet stand in the way of a successful peace.<br></p> <p>Second, the already significant focus on improved governance, accountability and democratic institutions must continue. These areas have suffered greatly as people of violence have taken control of important levers of power. Only gradually, and with care, can corruption be rooted out.<br></p> <p>Finally, a focus on security is needed. The development sector has sometimes failed to appreciate the importance of investing in policing and security interventions. However, in a post-conflict situation where people are expecting less violence but the threat of more is just around the corner, security has to be a key priority. It is incredibly difficult to get right \u2013 especially as Colombia\u2019s security services have themselves been strongly implicated in corrupt and violent practices \u2013 but it cannot be ignored.</p> <p>For these reasons and many others, the international community will be needed more than ever if Colombians vote \u201csi\u201d. Rather than exiting the scene as though the job were done, international agencies \u2013 both official and non-governmental \u2013 should be doubling or tripling their presence and levels of investment. The history of Colombia and of countless other conflict countries shows that a return to violence of some kind is, depressingly, a likely scenario.</p>",

  "<p>In the coming weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/paris-climate-agreement-poised-to-come-into-force\">the Paris climate agreement could be about to enter into force</a>. Action to meet the deal\u2019s targets of holding global warming to 2C is most clearly visible in the energy sector - where a low-carbon transition is underway. There is, however, one sector where, until now, action has been invisible owing to its exemption from contributing to the fight to limit carbon pollution: international aviation.<br></p> <p>Aviation is one of the top-10 global carbon polluters. The industry <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Meetings/a39/Documents/WP/wp_209_en.pdf\">emits more CO2 each year than the 129 countries with the lowest annual emissions</a>. Worryingly, those <a href=\"http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/aviation-and-marine-report-2009.pdf\">emissions are expected to balloon by 300%</a> if no concerted action is taken sooner rather than later. In 2010, 2.4 billion passengers travelled by plane, but <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/Documents/vision-2050.pdf\">by 2050 that number is expected to rise to 16 billion</a>. <br><br>The global agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">reached in Paris last December committed the world\u2019s governments to fighting climate change</a>. Curbing aviation emissions is absolutely essential to fulfilling those commitments. However, aviation was conspicuous by its absence from the text.</p> <p>Aviation has, in fact, historically found itself in a parallel universe when it comes to the industry\u2019s contribution to the fight against climate change: it has made none. Airlines have been operating in a world where they pay no fuel taxes, are VAT-exempt, face no legally-binding fuel efficiency requirements, <a href=\"http://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Aviation-Policy-Brief_final.pdf\">and have no limits placed on their CO2 emissions</a>. But this could all be about to change and not before time.</p> <p>The UN body responsible for international civil aviation, ICAO, has been charged with creating a global market-based mechanism to offset the industry\u2019s growth in emissions from 2020 onwards. Transport ministers from all around the world are set to meet at the next ICAO Assembly in Montreal, from 27 September to 7 October 2016, and they must live up to their responsibilities. It is essential ministers agree a global market-based mechanism for international aviation that delivers carbon neutral growth from 2020 - with a significant ramping up of that ambition over time.</p> <p>Such a commitment to carbon neutral growth post-2020 would, itself, not be enough to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement. And the current state of negotiations suggests that any final agreement will, in any case, fall far short of even that fundamental commitment.</p> <p>Worryingly, in a blatant attempt to delay vital action, <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2016-09-06-02.aspx\">ministers are set to agree that binding limits should not come into force before 2027</a>. Until then, two \u2018voluntary phases\u2019 of the scheme are expected, allowing continued and limitless growth in aviation emissions. Furthermore, the current proposals are plagued by a large number of unacceptable exemptions that are pegging back ambition. <br><br>EU Transport Ministers attending the ICAO Assembly have a duty to make sure the global market-based mechanism is robust enough to deliver on the commitments made in Paris. </p> <p>This means, firstly, ensuring the ambitions of the scheme remain dynamic, and under constant review. It is essential that the scheme includes guarantees on the environmental integrity of offsets, and that it prohibits double-counting and provides transparency on the offsets used. Secondly, the scope of participation must be sufficiently wide-ranging, and the wealthiest countries must take responsibility for their historical burden and pledge to do more to reduce emissions. </p> <p>Finally, allowing regional blocs such as the EU to take further measures to curb aviation emissions is an essential part of enabling them to honour the commitments they made in Paris, especially if ICAO fails to deliver. Under EU law, international flights to and from the European Union will once again fall under the block\u2019s emissions trading scheme from 2017. It is vital, therefore, that there are no attempts to water down this mechanism. <br><br>While the ICAO compromise is too weak to deliver what is necessary to keep temperature increases below dangerous levels, it does have the potential to deliver significant action if certain clauses are strengthened and the widest possible political engagement is secured.</p> <p>This is why we must all increase the pressure on our governments to make sure they reach an agreement in Montreal that is as ambitious as possible and finally shakes aviation from its parallel universe, forcing it to take a stake in efforts to tackle our common challenges. With a Paris deal coming into action, the world cannot afford a failure in its first global attempt to put words into action.</p>",

Harrowingly, young adults raised in institutions are <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/stories/8-million-children-are-institutions\">500 times more likely kill themselves</a>. </p> <p>For the last 13 years DRI has been working on a worldwide <a href=\"http://www.driadvocacy.org/learn-about-the-worldwide-campaign-to-end-the-institutionalization-of-children/\">campaign</a> to shut down orphanages and institutions that, in far too many cases, neglect or even abuse the rights of the children. In particular, they focus on people with disabilities. Over their years of research, DRI has documented abuse within state-run, and donor-funded facilities \u2013 including orphanages and psychiatric wards \u2013 from the Ukraine to Guatemala. In the process they have exposed institutionalisation as a worldwide human rights issue.</p> <p>Last year, when investigating Mexican institutions for children with disabilities, DRI found \u201catrocious abuses that fall inside the definition of torture\u201d. Investigators recorded prolonged use of restraints in centres \u2013 like those in San Luis Gonzaga \u2013 that caused high levels of suffering, physical deformities and dislocations. Any restraint of people with mental disabilities \u201ceven for a short period of time, may constitute torture and ill-treatment\u201d, according to the UN\u2019s rapporteur on torture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even in the best of institutions children don\u2019t get their full needs met</p> <footer> <cite>Helen Dent</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Paraguay, researchers found autistic children locked in cages at a state-run hospital. The children were only allowed to spend a few hours every other day in an outdoor \u201cpen littered with excrement, garbage and broken glass\u201d, as <a href=\"http://www.driadvocacy.org/strategic-litigation/\">DRI described it</a>. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/mexican-women-mental-health-problems-pressured-sterilisation\">reports of forced sterilisation</a> of patients in Mexico \u2013 some pressured by health professionals \u2013 to cover up sexual abuse within an institution.<strong> </strong>In Ukraine, the teams discovered that children were given classifications depending upon the \u201cseverity\u201d of their disability. Children classed as level three or four were considered to be \u201cuneducable\u201d, and were expected to remain in an institution for life.</p> <p>Though the organisation has come across well-equipped, clean facilities and many families believe they\u2019re doing the right thing for their children, DRI\u2019s president Laurie Ahern maintains \u201cthere is no such thing as a good orphanage. Nothing replaces a family. Children still have psychological and developmental delays \u2013 you need someone to look into your eyes, a primary caregiver, and that doesn\u2019t happen in an orphanage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven in the best of institutions children don\u2019t get their full needs met,\u201d says Helen Dent, professor of clinical and forensic psychology at Staffordshire University. Dent watched DRI\u2019s videos from the institution in Mexico, and her impression is of a \u201cclean and modern\u201d facility where \u201cthe staff are trying to care for the children with apparently few resources\u201d.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThe young man banging his teeth against the cot side was clearly in need of adult attention both to stop him from self-harming and to provide positive stimulation to remove the need for self-harm. Most people kept in such circumstances would suffer serious consequences and show unusual behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>The alternative, argues DRI, should be that development funding is moved to community- and family-based care. Their campaign is a monumental task that requires changing mindsets on a global scale.</p> <p><strong>\u201cThey were literally hosed off to be cleaned\u201d</strong><br></p> <p>It was after visiting the Samuel Ramirez psychiatric hospital in Mexico City more than 20 years ago that Eric Rosenthal decided to found DRI.</p> <p>With a slight tremble in his voice he recalls an area surrounded by barbed wire where both children and adults were held naked. \u201cThey were literally hosed off to be cleaned. They were fed on trays ... they all lunged for common food and had to fight over it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were tied down. It was the most horrendous dehumanisation. These people look like animals when they\u2019re left this way, and that\u2019s how they were treated.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfa7a83382a48e725b233e3363f52b0749f60f25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfa7a83382a48e725b233e3363f52b0749f60f25/1530_586_1379_828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Rosenthal, founder of Disability Rights International\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Rosenthal, founder of Disability Rights International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rosenthal, 52, studied both mental health and international human rights before turning to law. A lifelong activist, he strongly felt the rights of people with disabilities had been overlooked by the international development and human rights communities. DRI was established with a $20,000 fellowship in an empty office above a dance studio in Washington DC. </p> <p>The organisation bases its model on Amnesty International, researching and exposing injustices to push for change. Over the past two decades, Rosenthal has visited hundreds of institutions in more than 30 countries, accompanied by a team of volunteers who are often medical experts. </p> <p>The team is small, but they\u2019ve made some genuine advances over the years. DRI now has offices in Mexico, Guatemala, Ukraine and Serbia, and have produced 18 major investigative reports. An expose of abuse in one particular facility that DRI collaborated on with the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/16/magazine/the-global-willowbrook.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times Magazine</a>, contributed to the historic 2006 UN treaty on people with disabilities, which called for disabled people to have the same human rights as the able bodied.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re exporting a model that we know is harmful to children</p> <footer> <cite>Laurie Ahern</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The organisation\u2019s work has also led to the European Union introducing a policy where European money cannot be used for maintaining any kind of institution. And in Serbia, DRI\u2019s efforts have led to a law that children under the age of three can\u2019t be institutionalised. Serbia now has one of the lowest percentages of children in institutions \u2013 though the number of institutionalised children with disabilities remains high.</p> <p>After the landmark UN treaty \u2013 the DRI focused its efforts on stopping new entrants to existing facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to establish international law than enforce that law,\u201d Rosenthal says. \u201cIf we could get countries to agree on a moratorium of no new admissions to institutions, then they would whittle [the numbers] away \u2013 it would save families, save kids at the most vulnerable point in their lives. And that was Laurie\u2019s idea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e2b6de2be4038dcabaac3156ef5c4f84a3e4a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2b6de2be4038dcabaac3156ef5c4f84a3e4a6a/0_697_2832_3539/800.jpg\" alt=\"Laurie Ahern, president of Disability Rights International\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurie Ahern, president of Disability Rights International.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laurie Ahern, 62, is the brainchild of DRI\u2019s global campaign to end institutionalisation. Rosenthal sings her praises, and when speaking to her on the phone from her office in DC, it\u2019s not hard to see why. Her passion for the cause is admirable. She cares deeply for her colleagues and seems to dedicate every waking hour to this campaign.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re exporting a model that we know is harmful to children,\u201d Ahern says. \u201cWhen I began visiting orphanages and institutions for children some 13 years ago, and witnessed unimaginable human rights abuses and torture perpetrated against children \u2013 left to die lonely painful deaths, immobile children left in cribs for years, no touch, no love \u2013 I knew we had to do something big.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that we can change,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis is really not a complicated problem; this is about donors putting money to families and not supporting orphanages.\u201d Other organisations such as <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/\">Lumos</a>, the charity founded by JK Rowling, also campaign for deinstitutionalisation, and Lumos has just launched <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/post/jk-rowlings-speech-special-lumos-gala-performance-harry-potter-and-cursed-child\">a global campaign</a> to raise awareness of the issue. DRI, Lumos and other organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.replace-campaign.org/\">Replace Campaign</a> all support the idea that we should change this culture of institutionalisation and work on keeping families together, supporting communities, and improving social networks. Lumos believes that the institutionalisation of children can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/17/jk-rowling-fairytale-orphanage-lumos\">eradicated globally by 2050</a> (backing this statement with figures including the 70% reduction of the number of children in institutions in Moldova over the last decade, despite the country\u2019s high poverty rates).</p> <p>There is also an economic argument, Ahern adds: \u201cIt\u2019s so much less expensive for government to support families to [help] children with disabilities go to school, than it is to pay to keep them in an orphanage for a long time.\u201d For example, in Tanzania\u2019s Kagera region, the yearly cost for one child in institutional care is <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/sites/default/files/In%20Our%20Lifetime_2015_Sept2015_0_0.pdf\">reportedly $1,000</a> (\u00a3770) \u2013 six times the cost of supporting a child in foster care. And in Romania, residential care for children costs up to $280 (\u00a3216), while family reintegration and local adoption costs about $19 (\u00a315) per child.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/13/concerns-unregulated-volunteer-tourism-industry\">Volunteer travel: experts raise concerns over unregulated industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>But in many senses they\u2019re fighting an uphill battle. Institutionalisation is still a development model \u2013 and in some countries it even constitutes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/13/concerns-unregulated-volunteer-tourism-industry\">method of tourism</a>, or voluntourism \u2013 supported by donors and governments.</p> <p>Money is a big problem. There is little or no funding for the services that can prevent family separation or for social care networks. Any funding that does come through is often used to renovate or reopen institutions, especially facilities for people with disabilities, rather than support the structures that can help replace them. </p> <p>Although 32 state-run institutions in Georgia were shut and replaced with family and community-based services in the last decade, a <a href=\"http://www.driadvocacy.org/report-documents-atrocious-human-rights-abuses-in-the-republic-of-georgias-orphanages-and-institutions-for-people-with-disabilities/\">2013 DRI investigation</a> found that US government money had funded two institutions specifically for disabled people, in the years since. Between 2008-2012, <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/sites/default/files/Lumos%20The%20Time%20is%20Now%20April2014%20FINAL_0.pdf\">\u20ac5.6m (\u00a34.8m) of EU funding</a> (pdf) was spent on renovating children\u2019s institutions and those for people with disabilities in just one county in the Czech Republic. Despite this investment, the quality of care did not improve and the Czech ombudsman still reported concerns over serious neglect and abuse in these facilities. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>\u2018When no one is watching out, bad things happen to children\u2019</strong></p> <p>But for Ahern and her colleagues there is no question of giving up. I speak to her just before she is about to go on holiday for three weeks \u2013 her only time off throughout the year. Can she ever switch off? \u201cYes I can. It\u2019s for my own survival and because I want to be able to stay and continue to do this work.\u201d She is going to spend time with her granddaughter, who is a poignant reminder of why she works with DRI. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her going through what I\u2019ve seen other children go through unnecessarily. In recent years the investigations have become even more nefarious than I thought they ever could be \u2013 the trafficking of children for sex, pornography, organs. There\u2019s no way I ...\u201d she falters. \u201cI can\u2019t put that into the back of my mind and just let it go.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Ahern about her motivation for the work, she says: \u201cI was abused as a child. I wish someone had come and rescued me; I wish somebody had spoken to me when I couldn\u2019t speak.\u201d Ahern believes that children left in institutions, especially those with disabilities, are forgotten. \u201cWhen no one\u2019s watching out for children \u2013 whether that\u2019s conflict or an orphanage \u2013 bad things happen to children. There\u2019s a sphere for abuse and neglect.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/20/we-need-to-stop-treating-people-with-disabilities-as-less-than-human\">We need to stop treating people with disabilities as less than human</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most extreme cases of neglect she has seen was in the Tbilisi Infants Home in Georgia, where children with hydrocephalus \u2013 a buildup of fluid in the brain \u2013 were left untreated, which is extremely painful and life-threatening. \u201cBabies, six months old with huge heads were just laying there moaning. I was overwhelmed with grief because we know the problem can be taken care of and the child can have a perfectly normal life,\u201d she says. The NGO found more than 50% of the children with this treatable condition died in the institution.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see this and not be moved,\u201d Ahern says. She tells me about the time when, a few years ago, she walked into a Serbian institution to find teenagers with cerebral palsy who looked like children because they had not been allowed to leave their beds in 10 years. Worse, this was not the first time she had come across this situation.</p> <p>\u201cBut you can take action, get a little angry, and then you see change.

  "<p>As Rory McIlroy is inevitably highlighted as a leader within Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team and a player the United States identify as a blue chip opponent, it will be easy to forget wide-eyed youthfulness. Whereas now McIlroy is a global superstar and four-time major champion, there was a time in the not-so distant past that Darren Clarke, Europe\u2019s captain, was Northern Ireland\u2019s revered golfing son.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably close to 14 years ago when I first met Darren,\u201d McIlroy recalls. \u201cI\u2019d be quite sure Darren wouldn\u2019t really recollect the moment another star-struck kid stood staring at him but I hung on his every word back then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/ian-poulter-ryder-cup-darren-clarke\">Ian Poulter: \u2018I\u2019m not giving up the ghost \u2013 I still have a couple of Ryder Cups in me\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis was a multiple European and PGA Tour winner chatting to me, someone who had convincingly beaten Tiger Woods in a WGC Match Play Championship. I was there to listen and learn. I was taken by how ordinary and approachable he was and when he said that golf was a tough business and I must hang in there, whatever happened, I came away brimming with confidence and a real desire to improve my game.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019d be safe to say that Darren was a very strong influence on the early development and direction of my game. I was lucky to have Darren as a sounding board as I developed and I felt extremely honoured when he said: \u2018Give me a call whenever you fancy a chat.\u2019 It was a particularly special moment in my life and career when Darren, Graeme [McDowell] and I appeared at Royal Portrush with our major trophies \u2013 lots of pride and plenty of banter, too.</p> <p>\u201cToday, we catch up and chat as often as our schedules allow and I\u2019m really looking forward to Darren, with all his knowledge and passion, being at the helm of the European team.\u201d</p> <p>In McIlroy, Clarke has a golfer with a natural love of the team dynamic. The 27-year-old denies the passing of 2016 without the claiming of a major intensifies his own desire to taste more Ryder Cup success.</p> <p>\u201cMajor or not this year, the Ryder Cup is an entirely different animal than anything we golfers undertake,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cObviously there\u2019s the [world] Match Play every year, and perhaps a couple of similar, head-to-head events on either tour, but the comparisons pretty much stop there.</p> <p>\u201cAt no time in any event are we reliant on a captain and his support team for strategy, geared up in the same kit and battling against the might of the Americans. And that\u2019s not to mention the almost fever pitch atmosphere in the locker room and the determination of every golfer to play not for himself but for his partner and as part of the greater team. Every personal ambition or shot at glory pales into insignificance and is given up to putting blue on the board.</p> <p>\u201cIn my early years as a professional, I perhaps didn\u2019t fully grasp the strength&#xa0;of feeling amongst a Ryder Cup team or how golfers could really throw themselves into an event where they were jumping around, hugging and&#xa0;yelling when a team-mate\u2019s putts fell. I now get that. I now get that in a very big way.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy rightly points towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/17/henrik-stenson-phil-mickelson-open\" title=\"\">Henrik Stenson\u2019s Open triumph</a> and the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/justin-rose-olympic-games-golf-gold-medal-great-britain-rio-2016\" title=\"\">Olympic gold medal as won by Justin&#xa0;Rose</a> as causes for European optimism. McIlroy\u2019s three victories of this&#xa0;year have been in the scintillating&#xa0;style which defines his career. And yet, putting woes have provided a recurring negative, most visibly at the US PGA Championship, where after a missed cut McIlroy cut as dejected a figure as at any time in his professional life.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been struggling at times this year with consistency on the greens,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cThere were times when I couldn\u2019t rely on the putter when it mattered but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/rory-mcilroy-win-irish-open-golf\" title=\"\">my win at the Irish Open</a> came after a great par save on the 15th, which then gave me the confidence to push hard over the closing holes. Then at the Barclays Championship, I made a few tweaks and found a consistency that allowed me to win that week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/lee-westwood-davis-love-iii-ryder-cup-tour-championship\">Lee Westwood ramps up Ryder Cup pressure with Davis Love III riposte</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo, in reality, I just have to take any analysis of my putting with a pinch of salt. I put the practice hours in and don\u2019t let what\u2019s written about my game influence my performance. While I\u2019ve nothing to prove or any point to make on the greens, it\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m working with putting coach Phil Kenyon at the moment. But, again, this is a process we\u2019re going through to improve my putting performance in the longer term, something I can carry forward during my career, not just a quick fix to ensure success at the Ryder Cup.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy swats aside the notion that the residing of so many European players in Florida dilutes the Ryder Cup edge. Rather, he points to the globalisation of golf as a \u201cgreat development\u201d. He regards potential Ryder Cup captaincy of his own as far too distant to consider but fully understands his European role.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all expected, as members of a very tight-knit team, to pull our weight and offer ideas and insights into the process, pairings and possible outcomes,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cI expect that this year will be no different as Darren and the vice-captains engage with players and help us bond. There isn\u2019t room for lone wolves in something this important.\u201d</p> <p>Four years ago at Medinah,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/30/rory-mcilroy-late-ryder-cup\" title=\"\"> a time-reading error by McIlroy</a> almost etched his name into golfing history for all the wrong reasons. He smiles now when looking back.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose it hasn\u2019t been a bad four years; a couple more majors, another successful European Ryder Cup defence and quite a few wins on both sides of the pond,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat sometimes gets me the most is how bunched up golf has become and the amount of talent out there with very little separation in ability. Holding the world No1 slot for a sustainable period is an increasingly difficult challenge.</p> <p>\u201cAnd am I a different Rory? Well, of course. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m maturing as the years move on \u2013 I\u2019m a pro 10 years next year \u2013 and happy with my life on and off the course. Golf, no matter what anyone says, is a work in progress but I\u2019m in it for the long run. I intend to be a multiple winner and force to be reckoned with for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>More immediately, McIlroy will cherish his realliance with a boyhood idol.</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen\" title=\"\">Bruce Springsteen</a> first played London in November 1975, he was so angered by the hype surrounding the show \u2013 \u201cFINALLY!

Why he submits to them, even now as a sixtysomething, is a mystery explained in <em>Born to Run</em>. There is the joy of performance \u2013 \u201clife-giving, muscle-aching, mind-clearing, cathartic pleasure and privilege\u201d \u2013 and a work ethic inherited from his blue-collar New Jersey upbringing.</p> <p>Then comes the revelation of a deeper propellant, a profound unease that began in childhood \u2013 Bruce was nicknamed \u201cBlinky\u201d in primary school on account of his fluttering eyelids \u2013 and erupted into full-blown depression in his 30s, on the eve of 1984\u2019s <em>Born in the USA</em>, the album that brought him global stardom. \u201cMy depression was spewing like an oil spill over the beautiful turquoise green gulf of my carefully planned existence,\u201d recalls Bruce.

Certainly few of the millions for whom Springsteen has been a joyous, affirmative force, a man not without his moody, reflective moments, for sure, but to most eyes a model of dignity, whose songs empathised with the marginalised and the oppressed, and who defiantly sang: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrKh1zxv_rQ\" title=\"\">I believe in the promised land</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Depression was in the family, not in the exuberant Italian lineage of his mother, but plain enough in his dour, heavy-drinking Irish father, with whom the young Bruce had a troubled, warring relationship to which he returns repeatedly here, admitting that \u201cI was always in the market for a surrogate and appreciative daddy\u201d, a role that would be fulfilled by assorted friends and managers. There is a lot of self-knowledge on display here, and acknowledgment of the help and love he has received from fellow travellers and, most of all, from his second wife, singer Patti Scialfa, with whom Springsteen has three children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Later, he would learn to live 'high on the hog', but the belief in graft and self-control has never vanished</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Boss\u201d, as Springsteen is known \u2013 a name he dislikes and conspicuously absent here \u2013 has never shied away from interviews, and his 18 studio albums have been endlessly analysed and the inspirations for their songs located in a plethora of biographies. <em>Born to Run</em> adds little that\u2019s new, but its narrative voice proves insightful. Springsteen\u2019s high school years were spent forming bands such as <a href=\"https://brucebase.wikispaces.com/The+Castiles\" title=\"\">the Castiles</a> that negotiated a tricky path between competing teenage cliques \u2013 the pompadour and sharkskin-sporting \u201cgrease\u201d and the cheerleading, college-bound \u201crahs\u201d who populated the segregated New Jersey shoreline. The \u201csmall-town Caesars\u201d and \u201cgreaser girls with dive-bomber bras\u201d would show up later on Springsteen\u2019s early albums.</p> <p>First, though, came a rugged apprenticeship with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxyprIEfHqU\" title=\"\">Steel Mill</a>, a Zeppelin-style heavy rock band formed&#xa0;by an 18-year-old Springsteen once his parents had departed for a new life in California. Left to fend for himself, Springsteen became a \u201cfaux hippy\u201d, living in the concrete storeroom of a surfboard factory, too much of a control freak to do drugs or drink (\u201cMusic was going to get me as high as I needed to go\u201d).</p> <p>Later, he would learn to live \u201chigh on the hog\u201d, but the belief in graft and self-control has never vanished; \u201cwork\u201d is one of the most favoured words in his book. By his own admission no musical revolutionary, Springsteen worked at his craft, winning a contract with Columbia Records as a singer-songwriter, to be hailed as first \u201cthe new Dylan\u201d (one of several) and then, in a review by his future manager, Jon Landau, as \u201crock and roll\u2019s future\u201d. Springsteen is droll about this accolade but, as he came to see it, \u201cif somebody had to be the future, why not me?\u201d</p> <p>By the standards of most rock star autobiographies, <em>Born to Run</em> is neither sensational nor self-serving (you can forgive Bruce for dropping that Jack Nicholson called him \u201cking of New Jersey\u201d at Sinatra\u2019s funeral), with plenty of self-deprecatory digs and way fewer cars than in the songs. Springsteen has delivered his story with quiet dignity.

But it\u2019s also an ambiguous, upbeat, finally rather moving story of self-delusion, madness and lost love. With Dano handling the wide-eyed, manic side of the story, Radcliffe makes a different kind of hay with his far from inert role. He deftly turns what could be a tedious acting exercise into a complex performance, full of life, despite being technically dead.</p> <p>It feels like the final, decisive act of auto-infanticide for Radcliffe and Harry Potter: the Kid is dead; long live the King.</p> <p><em><strong>Swiss Army Man is in cinemas from Friday</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>Jump first, ask later. That\u2019s the motto of the Fairfield-based Dauntless Movement Crew (DMC) and the name of their show at the Sydney Opera House. This slight 50-minute performance exhibits the urban extreme sport of parkour, a mishmash of scaling walls, leaping off blocks and sprinting along rooftops. On the street, however, they don\u2019t ask authorities for permission; they just jump right in. </p> <p>Now the dance company Force Majeure, in collaboration with the Powerhouse Youth Theatre, is bringing parkour to the mainstream, providing a platform to six founding members of DMC: Joseph Carbone, Johnny Do, Jimmy James Pham, Patrick Uy, Justin Kilic and its sole female representative, Natalie Siri, to show off their acrobatic skills. All six performers come from immigrant backgrounds, ranging from Italy to Vietnam; they also all grew up in Sydney\u2019s Fairfield, a place recently referred to in the media as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/four-shootings-in-two-weeks-and-a-gang-war-on-the-rise-inside-australias-most-dangerous-suburb/news-story/b5df1aa69cf2f4d1d2c884760e315745\">Australia\u2019s most dangerous suburb</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac45f7a5a66290c0c5c7000515414585d2df0499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac45f7a5a66290c0c5c7000515414585d2df0499/0_0_2464_3948/624.jpg\" alt=\"All six performers in Jump First, Ask Later come from migrant backgrounds and grew up in Sydney\u2019s Fairfield\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All six performers in Jump First, Ask Later come from migrant backgrounds and grew up in Sydney\u2019s Fairfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Elwood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fairfield has been in the news for gang violence but Jump First, Ask Later director and designer Byron Perry wanted to portray a different side to the suburb: one in which kids on the block used parkour to find community and purpose. To drum that home, statistics regarding the multicultural make-up of the region are sprinkled liberally throughout the dialogue; we are reminded, above all, that western Sydney is one of Australia\u2019s most culturally diverse regions (in Fairfield itself, more than half the population was born overseas).</p> <p>Force Majeure\u2019s strong sense of social responsibility is clear from its previous productions. Nothing to Lose, which had its premiere at the Sydney festival in 2015, saw seven plus-sized dancers challenge the preconception that thin means beautiful. Never Did Me Any Harm (2012) was a frank look at parenthood. Jump First, Ask Later seeks to rebut stereotypes about street culture and celebrate its possibilities. </p> <p>The show opens with the crew warming up on stage, followed by group exercises including push-ups and the plank. In what boils down to a basic introduction to parkour, each member introduces an isolated movement, from backflips to something more akin to breakdancing. It\u2019s a stilted structure, made all the more awkward when the crew stops dancing to tell their own stories. </p> <p>Everything from parental disappointment to anger management, shyness and the mind-numbing boredom of factory work is touched on, often with intimacy and vulnerability. But DMC is not an acting troupe and it shows. The issues are discussed in too shallow a form to have much impact; worse, what should come off as casual chitchat and funny riffs between the crew is often mistimed. Conversation is designed to look impromptu but, when the performers regularly stumble, it seems heavily scripted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/09/my-workout-shirley-darlington-rowat-parkour\">My workout: Shirley Darlington-Rowat, parkour - \u2018It forces you to focus on the moment\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bumps might be bearable if there was a pay-off in the form of dazzling acrobatics or a big set piece. But while the performers are clearly talented and driven, the choreography is simply not strong enough to carry the show and it falls flat as a consequence. The fact that circus is today very much having a renaissance \u2013 and audiences are used to more sophisticated and physically impressive displays \u2013 only adds to the disappointment.</p> <p>Ultimately, this feels more like a social project and self-help guide (right down to the inclusion of R Kelly\u2019s song I Believe I Can Fly) than a polished production. No doubt its heart is in the right place, yet Jump First, Ask Later does not quite manage to shake its aura of amateurism.

Whereas previously lower-skilled jobs were affected, the current wave is likely to disrupt many mid-level positions. </p> <p>The Committee for Economic Development of Australia\u2019s 2015 <a href=\"http://www.ceda.com.au/research-and-policy/policy-priorities/workforce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australia\u2019s future workforce? report</a> found that 40% of Australian jobs, or 5m jobs, that exist today have a high probability of disappearing in the next 10 to 15 years due to technological advancements. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fya.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fya-future-of-work-report-final-lr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">A similar study published</a> by the Foundation for Young Australians found that close to 60% of Australian students (71% in vocational education and training) are currently studying for occupations where at least 68% of jobs will be automated over the coming decades. </p> <p>Those headline-grabbing numbers are, justly, cause for concern. Jobs that involve low levels of social interaction, creativity, mobility and dexterity are more likely to be replaced by automation. These include brokers, mechanics, telemarketers, cashiers and construction workers. Some non-routine jobs are also being threatened by automation and these include accountants, commercial pilots and real estate sales agents. </p> <p>Obsolescence is not the only concern. In some instances, a significantly<strong> </strong>different set of skills may be required for the same job. For example, 3D printing and modular construction trends are already disrupting the skill sets needed for the construction industry and traditional trades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2af8ac92079df791ac208826cf80af8508aa248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2af8ac92079df791ac208826cf80af8508aa248/0_111_4937_2962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radio robots displayed at Mivar\u2019s stand at the opening of the Army-2016 international military-technical forum at the Patriot Expocentre in Russia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radio robots displayed at Mivar\u2019s stand at the opening of the Army-2016 international military-technical forum at the Patriot Expocentre in Russia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Serebryakov/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Disruption: friend or foe? </h2> <p>While much of the discussion is centred on the negative aspects of digital disruption, one aspect rarely mentioned is the associated opportunities. Not all jobs are at risk of being automated and past waves have created jobs that no one could have predicted. </p> <p>That is already happening and will continue to happen. For example, there has been much speculation about the number of new job titles collected in the census that didn\u2019t exist five years ago such as social media manager, cloud services specialist and data scientist. While the fourth industrial revolution is more threatening as it is essentially based on automation of increasingly complex rather than simple human tasks, it does not necessarily mean that there isn\u2019t potential for job creation. </p> <p>The jobs of the future are likely to be in areas where machine thinking and robotics are most challenged in imitating human thought, and jobs that require a high level of social and emotional intelligence, creativity and critical thinking. These jobs include dentists, teachers and occupational therapists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/26/future-of-work-remote-controlled-vehicle-operators-in-demand-in-2035\">Is this the future of work? Scientists predict which jobs will still be open to humans in 2035</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for new jobs that do not exist yet, we may not know exactly what these will look like but one thing is clear \u2013 jobs of the future will require a more diverse set of skills, including creativity, problem solving, patience, critical thinking and resilience. Service-sector skills, particularly in care industries (health, aged, child) will continue to be significant growth areas.</p> <h2>Opportunities for growth</h2> <p>Like past revolutions, this current wave shows capacity to improve productivity and efficiency.</p> <p>The growth of the sharing economy through the likes of Airbnb, Uber and Airtasker is changing what it means to be an employee and has created employment, in some cases, for people who may not have been employable in a more traditional workplace system. </p> <p>Manufacturing is another example. Traditional manufacturing may be all but dead but advanced manufacturing has the potential to radically reshape the sector into a productive and efficient contributor to economic growth. As a general rule, advanced manufacturing goes beyond the production line definition of manufacturing to capture the more complex trends such as participation in global value chains and technological innovation. </p> <p>Advanced manufacturers typically innovate and invest in research and development and understand the role of technology as a competitive edge. They focus on high-value, low-volume production in niche product areas and have highly skilled employees. </p> <p>That skill set is quite different from the skill set required by traditional manufacturing. With the demise of the car manufacturing industry, the retraining challenge for its workers is significant and difficult. The average auto worker is a 55-year-old male who has only ever worked on the production line. The jobs of the future, however, will be in the service sector, in particular in personal service and care sectors. This will require a serious rethink of how we train and retrain our workforce. </p> <p>This is already happening to some degree. The vocational education and training sector has seen a rise in the share of students studying service-sector courses such as aged care, child care, nursing and disability care \u2013 reflecting that this sector is adapting to changing workforce needs despite being traditionally blue collar. Some universities in Australia are also <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-01/sydney-university-reduce-number-of-degrees-from-122-to-20/7293454\" rel=\"nofollow\">moving towards generalist degrees</a>, presumably to equip their students with a broader set of skills and capabilities that would promote mobility of employment and flexibility to adapt to changing workforce needs.</p> <h2>The broader risks to society and our economy</h2> <p>While growth in service-sector jobs is a clear trend favouring occupations that are typically female-dominated, this will come at a cost that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. The findings in CEDA\u2019s report suggested that regions heavily dependent on mining (such as Western Australia and Queensland) will bear a bigger burden from disruption, with regional areas faring worse than cities. There is a consequential concern that the current industrial revolution could lead to higher inequality in Australia. </p> <p>The other key risk is increased competition. Improvements in technology have made Australia\u2019s historical disadvantage of the tyranny of distance much less of a problem. However, at the same time, it exposes Australian workers and industry to a global marketplace, which brings with it both challenges and opportunities. </p> <p>Opportunities include tapping into high-end global value chains as many advanced manufacturers are already doing, while challenges include increased competition for goods and services (and skilled labour) due to the breaking down of international barriers. It is a stark fact that, armed with a computer, work can be performed irrespective of geographic location of both you and your customers.</p> <h2>Are we ready?</h2> <p>While these challenges are worth noting, and there will always be significant economic and social risks during periods of structural economic upheaval, Australia is certainly well positioned to reap the benefits that the age of digital disruption will bring.</p> <p>The fourth industrial revolution will see many jobs go. However, it will see many more created. Our challenge is to embrace this tsunami of change and ensure, through continuous and innovative training and re-skilling, that no section of the workforce is left behind. </p>",

Each contender had to present a personal manifesto before the 193 countries in the general assembly, and Guterres won points for his humour, charisma and mastery of his brief.

A fortnight ago, government officials briefed journalists in Sofia that Borisov was about to swing his support behind Georgieva. However, soon afterwards he changed his mind and said he <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-mulls-kristalina-georgieva-for-un-post-ban-ki-moon-secretary-general/\">would wait to see</a> how Bokova did in the fifth ballot on Monday before making up his mind. </p> <p>Since then, Russian officials have been canvassing votes for Bokova as a way of keeping Georgieva out of the race. </p> <p>\u201cIf Russia can get her to 10 \u2018encourages\u2019 it would be hard for Borisov to defenestrate her. If she stays at seven or eight, she is not safe,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at the European Council for Foreign Relations. </p> <p>Even if Georgieva did make a late entrance into the race, she could still face a veto from Russia. She is after all a member of a European commission, currently enforcing sanctions on Moscow. </p> <p>The permanent five\u2019s potential vetoes in the secretary general contest are bargaining chips on a table on which rivalry in Syria, Ukraine and other conflicts is being brokered. The poisonous atmosphere in the council could make for a protracted struggle to which the most qualified candidates fall victim, opening the way for a more obscure contender. </p> <p>Alternatively, Gowan argues, the permanent five might momentarily bury their differences to protect their shared privilege, as failure to do so would open the way for the wider UN membership in the general assembly to play a greater role in resolving security council deadlock.</p> <p>\u201cFor all the geopolitical difference, the logic of P5 control means they could still do a deal.

This means that whenever capital can find a way to turn a buck without employing a human, it will take it, whether it be with robots in factories, automated checkouts at supermarkets or<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/amazon-faa-drone-rules/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> drones to deliver packages</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/26/future-of-work-remote-controlled-vehicle-operators-in-demand-in-2035\">Is this the future of work? Scientists predict which jobs will still be open to humans in 2035</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past, this preference for machines over humans hasn\u2019t necessarily meant a loss of jobs, and in fact, new technologies have often created new sorts of work. MIT economist David Autor points out in his influential essay <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.29.3.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Are There Still So Many Jobs?</a> that with the advent of ATMs, banks reinvented their business model and ended up employing more people selling financial products.</p> <p>Still, the relationship between old jobs destroyed and new jobs created isn\u2019t always this neat. Often the process involves the loss of jobs in one sector followed by the creation of them in another as increased productivity and profits \u2013 redistributed in the form of increased wages \u2013 creates demand elsewhere in the economy. </p> <p>But this happy confluence between job creation and technology might be coming to an end, and there are two key reasons for this.</p> <p>The first is that machines are getting smarter. </p> <p>The first wave of automation replaced blue collars jobs in manufacturing. To some extent, the economy was able to absorb those losses through the creation of new jobs in the service sector, and to a lesser extent in the culture and knowledge industries.</p> <p>The next wave of automation is going after jobs in exactly those sectors.

(Of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/windfarms-unfairly-blamed-for-south-australias-high-energy-prices\">this was neither the full nor the real story</a>.)</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/climate-change-solutions-65-want-australia-to-be-world-leader-study\">our research has shown</a> this \u201ccrisis\u201d didn\u2019t actually have a negative effect on the continued growth in enthusiasm for renewable energy.</p> <p>In fact, public support for renewable energy (wind and mainly solar) has continued to grow at the expense of coal and gas. While the real discovery is that so too has Australians\u2019 frustration with our politicians for not supporting it more. This has translated into widespread disappointment with the performance of all levels of government, as well as with business.</p> <p>And after a turbulent 10 years in national policy, Australians strongly hold the view that government at the national level should hold the lead responsibility for climate action. This view is held quite consistently across the political spectrum of voting preference. Only a handful of people say governments \u2013 federal, state or local \u2013 should not take action.</p> <p>Through our research, and that of others, we have identified that mid-2012 marked the low point in support for climate action. Since that point \u2013 when it became clear the dire warnings that the carbon pricing mechanism, or \u201ctax\u201d, would deliver darkness and destruction didn\u2019t eventuate \u2013 expectations have been rebounding. Even the repeal of the carbon laws, two years later, didn\u2019t halt this trend.</p> <p>We can identify a number of elements that buttress this rebound. A growing realisation that we are already being hit by the impacts of climate change has been accompanied by growing trust in the science \u2013 from a minority in 2012 to a strong majority now. And the myth that Australia was somehow acting alone has now been demolished, most notably via the strong Chinese and US climate partnership, as well as the success of the Paris climate negotiations.</p> <p>Perhaps most powerfully, clean energy alternatives are now a very real part of our lives. This goes beyond the global investment reality where we have seen the level of investment in renewable energy double that in fossil fuels. Plunging costs for solar and wind technologies are being matched by the emergence of other more tangible technologies that people can directly interact with in their everyday lives \u2013 electric cars and household batteries. Australians can see the clean energy future and they want to be part of it.</p> <p>Of course, realising this future isn\u2019t simple. We are going to need careful, fair and inclusive strategies to accompany policies that will unlock markets while encouraging the modernisation and decarbonisation of our electricity, transport, buildings and other sectors of the economy. It is now clear that years of policy and political turbulence has sapped a sense of urgency, as well as the confidence people place in politicians. And electricity prices still cause concern.</p> <p>Though the potential is clear, Australians think that continuing with inconsistency, half measures, partisan politics or backtracking will undermine efforts to seize this community potential.</p> <p>Next year the federal government will review our climate policies and will be considering post-2030 carbon pollution targets. It will do so, not only as other nations step up their action initiatives and commitments, but also as the global investor community becomes increasingly attentive to climate change risks and opportunities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/bp-drilling-plan-great-australian-bight-lacks-detail-on-managing-oil-spills\">BP's plan to contain oil spill in Great Australian Bight labelled 'flimsy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am starting to wonder if we are about to turn a corner \u2013 that a political rethink may be under way.
