  "<p>The Magnus Carlsen v Sergey Karjakin world championship match has been confirmed for New York starting on 11 November and ending months of speculation with rumours that the 12-game series would be switched to Moscow. The global body Fide\u2019s commercial partners AGON have announced that the \u20ac1m contest will be played in the redeveloped Fulton Market, a historic and scenic site in the South Street Seaport district of downtown Manhattan. The match sponsors have yet to be announced, although two seven-figure backers are said to be on board.</p> <p>The Fulton Market was, for nearly 200 years, the site of the city\u2019s fish market. At its peak the market was the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo), supplying 400,000 pounds of fish a day to restaurants and fish markets up and down the East Coast. In 2005, the fish market moved to the Bronx and the old market is being converted to a dining and entertainment complex.</p> <p>Carlsen and Karjakin will play in an enclosed glass sound-proof area, still to be built and part of a 3,000 sq ft second floor area that will also house spectators, up to 300 paying from $50 a day, plus a media and commentary centre. The schedule will be leisurely, with a rest day after every two games, but there could be a real climax if the score goes to 6-6 and speed tie-breaks. That is possible though unlikely since Carlsen is a hot favourite to keep his crown by around a two-point margin.</p> <p>It still remains to be seen whether the US public and media will warm to a match between a Norwegian and a Russian. Success would have been surer if the US champion, Fabiano Caruana, had defeated Karjakin in the final round of the candidates tournament in Moscow.</p> <p>New York last hosted a world championship match in 1995, when Russia\u2019s Garry Kasparov defeated India\u2019s Vishy Anand at the World Trade Center. That series was rather low-key as a media event, lacking the professional back-up which will support Carlsen and&#xa0;Karjakin.</p> <p>The vast majority of chess fans will watch the games on the internet. AGON have abandoned their ill-fated attempt at the Moscow candidates to copyright game scores and bar other websites from using the moves, though a crucial question for the organisers will be whether they can deliver the high-class game commentaries ordinary players now expect.</p> <p>Some critics still remain sceptical about the entire project. Nigel Short is one of the most vociferous and the former world title challenger has dismissed AGON\u2019s announcement as \u201csleight of hand\u201d before the approaching Fide congress in Baku and the match as \u201cwithout sponsors in an empty building\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the $150,000 Sinquefield Cup in St Louis has its final rounds this weekend.

At the end of a long conveyor belt, two men and a boy piled up the roti for bagging and transporting to enormous meal tents.<br></p> <p>The roti operation overseen by Abed was just one element of the huge logistical challenge of organising <a href=\"http://jalsauk.org/\">the 50th Jalsa Salana</a>, a 40,000-strong international gathering of Ahmadiyya Muslims taking place this weekend at Oakland farm, near Alton. </p> <p>For the UK\u2019s Ahmadis, this affirmation is particularly apt after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/tanveer-ahmed-jailed-for-murder-glasgow-shopkeeper-in-sectarian-attack\">the jailing this week of Tanveer Ahmed</a> for the murder of Glasgow newsagent Asad Shah in a sectarian attack motivated by hatred of Shah\u2019s Ahmadi faith. </p> <p>The Jalsa, which opened on Friday lunchtime and runs until Sunday, is an opportunity for \u201cspiritual uplift\u201d among members of the Ahmadi community and others, according to Abdul Quddus Arif, a 26-year-old imam. \u201cWe stand together and pray together as an international community across cultures and boundaries.

But the key question for many of us is, where does it lead?\u201d</p> <p>The risk was that \u201creligious and cultural bigotry\u201d in South Asia \u2013 and Pakistan in particular \u2013 could be imported to the UK, Walker added.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Ahmadiyya moved their global headquarters to the UK in the 1980s after Pakistan essentially outlawed their faith. But in the past few years, there have been signs of increasing animosity from other Muslims in Britain, with boycott movements, harassment and ostracism reported on university campuses.</p> <p>Many orthodox Muslims regard the Ahmadiyya as blasphemous for not adhering to the belief that Muhammad was the final prophet. In the UK, the Ahmadis are a minority within a minority: there are about 30,000 among a Muslim population of 2.7m, itself only about 5% of the general population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5ca38d5fd3c3109342df4da7e54fb0c11eb7594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5ca38d5fd3c3109342df4da7e54fb0c11eb7594/0_196_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees outside an ice-cream van at the UK\u2019s largest Muslim convention, Jalsa Salana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We stand together and pray together as an international community across cultures and boundaries.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hampshire, Mohammed Nasser Khan, the man in overall charge of operations, was considering the scale of his logistical task.

  "<p>The cream quickly rose to the top on the opening day of the heptathlon with Britain\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Ennis-Hill producing spectacular performances in the first two events with the Canadian Brianne Thiesen-Eaton, who leads the standings this year, also deep in the mix for gold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/12/rio-olympics-2016-day-six-cycling-athletics-rowing-doping\">Rio Olympics 2016: double GB rowing gold, Ennis-Hill and Andy Murray \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ennis-Hill made a typically fast start during the morning\u2019s action, winning the 100m hurdles, and then cleared 1.89m in the high jump \u2013 her best since the UK Indoor trials of February 2012. Johnson-Thompson kept the pressure on as she recovered from a so-so hurdles to make a series of first-time clearances that culminated in a personal best of 1.98m in the high jump.</p> <p>It meant that after two events Johnson-Thompson led with 2,264 points, with the Belgian Nafissatou Thiam, who also cleared 1.98m, second on 2,252, and Ennis-Hill just behind on 2,242. Theisen-Eaton was fifth on 2,151 but has her stronger events to come.</p> <p>Before the start of every heptathlon Ennis-Hill\u2019s mere presence sows doubts in her rivals\u2019 minds. They know that the opening event is her strongest and they will be playing catch-up from the off. Through repeated experience, they also know that Ennis-Hill always delivers close to her best, whatever her physical condition. Some people allow pressure to engulf them. The Olympic champion is so strong mentally she is able to brush it off.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson was the first of the major contenders to appear in the 100m hurdles, in the penultimate heat, and produced a solid time of 13.48sec. It was not quite as quick as her performance at the world championships in Beijing last year but it was good enough to score 1,053 points.</p> <p>Then it was Ennis-Hill\u2019s turn. Outside her was Thiesen-Eaton. Both looked nervous: Ennis-Hill slapped her hamstrings and shook her shoulders, trying to release the tension, Thiesen-Eaton managing only the thinnest of smiles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/heptathlon-ennis-hill-wows-in-hurdles-and-johnson-thompson-sets-british-record-in-high-jump-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4qttx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2651131\"            data-video-name=\"Heptathlon: Ennis-Hill wows in hurdles and Johnson-Thompson sets British record in high jump \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ae0bd6e4b0c23bfed88e72\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/mainwebsite/2016/08/12/160812heptathlonmoments_KP-28702590_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/HLS/2016/08/12/160812heptathlonmoments_KP-28702590.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ukonly/webM/2016/08/12/160812heptathlonmoments_KP-28702590_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/12/heptathlon-ennis-hill-wows-in-hurdles-and-johnson-thompson-sets-british-record-in-high-jump-video\">Heptathlon: Ennis-Hill wows in hurdles and Johnson-Thompson sets British record in high jump \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When the gun went off, Ennis-Hill was out of the blocks fastest and over the hurdles smoothest, coming through to win in 12.84.

It\u2019s not a learning curve, it\u2019s just an experience and what I could do different from now I just don\u2019t know.

  "<p>It is very commendable that George Monbiot has converted to veganism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/vegan-corrupt-food-system-meat-dairy\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 10 August), but perhaps he is deluding himself into thinking that this will alter our output of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. We can practise all the accepted methods of reducing carbon emissions, but nothing is more effective than choosing to have no more than two children. As we hurtle towards the point of no return with regards to global warming, choosing not to eat meat is quite low down the scale of things we need to do.</p> <p>Which are: 1 Stabilise world population. 2 Eradicate poverty. 3 Stop using fossil fuels and change to renewables. 4 Use our land to produce crops more effectively. 5 Reduce excessive meat consumption.</p> <p>We need to get over the taboo against discussing population growth and face the facts. The most effective national and global climate change strategy that governments can put into action is to limit the size of our population, in a non-coercive way with better family planning and education.<br><strong>Sheena Howarth</strong><br><em>Worcester</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am a fairly experienced organic farmer. I have just 100 acres of land in an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is chalk downland and on it I rear 30 or 40 beef shorthorn cattle, an old and noble native breed that has been recently recognised for its ability to thrive and fatten on grassland. I use no artificial fertiliser derived from fossil fuels and depend entirely on the manure that the cattle produce when they lie on straw in the barn during the winter. This way I can replenish the land and its fertility. I also have a vegetable garden and this too&#xa0;depends on the manure to boost the&#xa0;quality of the soil, to make it friable and moisture retentive.</p> <p>So when Mr Monbiot declares that he will have no truck with animal products, I am at a loss as to how he or any vegan imagines that vegetables, or indeed grain, can be grown without animal manure \u2013 unless it is with artificial fertilisers. With a lot of care and attention, it is possible to produce enough compost to nurture a veg garden \u2013 but a whole field of wheat, oat or barley? When Lady Balfour founded the Soil Association, the health of the soil was at the basis of her philosophy. I firmly believe that organic farming can strike the balance between consumption of animal products and caring for the environment. I was horrified by the story of the river pollution in Devon and hope that the dairy farm in question was not organic because we really do have some very strict rules and are inspected to enforce these. In any case, the CAP rules also regulate emissions from farms and if these are broken one would expect the farmer to be fined and subsidies to be severely reduced.</p> <p>What I would really like is a reply from someone who grows 20 acres of wheat on thin soil without the use of animal manure. Maybe this rara avis exists. But meantime I look down on the hundreds of tons of rich FYM ( farmyard manure lying waiting to be spread in the autumn and feel that this recycling is the best way of maintaining the soil whose health in turn ensures that of man and beast whether wild or domestic.<br><strong>Penny Reid</strong><br><em>Wantage, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I wish that anti-meat-eaters would stop making veganism look such a no-brainer. George Monbiot states that \u201creplacing meat with soya reduces the clearance of natural vegetation, per kilogram of protein, by 96%\u201d. It actually reduces it in Britain by 100% because, unlike most meat we eat in the UK, soya can\u2019t be grown here at all, so it is 100% imported. No wonder we\u2019d apparently use so little agricultural land to support a nation of vegans. But what about food security?<br><strong>David Mills</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot does not mention the other big existential threat facing our species. The huge amount of antibiotics fed to animals means that the consumers of meat are becoming immune to them. This is a nightmare scenario and diseases that were brought under control over the last 100 years are reappearing. People are already dying as antibiotics are no longer working. Because George consumes milk, fish and meat albeit occasionally he cannot be counted a vegetarian or a vegan. Perhaps he needs to look at the compassionate factor of not eating animals.<br><br><strong>Nitin Mehta</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 On a recent train journey from Reading to Devon \u2013 having attended a conference spelling out the many benefits of a plant-based diet for people with multiple sclerosis \u2013 I couldn\u2019t help but notice the vast majority of our countryside is dedicated to the production of meat and dairy products which George Monbiot quite rightly describes as the reason we need to import so much food, create so much pollution and indeed, ill health.</p> <p>I have MS, and have benefited from a plant-based, no-sugar diet. The NHS would be able to cope with capacity to spare if less dairy, meat and sugar were consumed. The UK would be self-sufficient in food and it might even become possible to meet our climate change obligations with sustainable production.</p> <p>I wonder what a train trip of our country would look like with a nation of vegans. More woodland, more wetlands, more wildlife, more jobs, more diversity, and smaller hospitals. This would be a big improvement on the \u201cgreen desert\u201d passing the railway window at the moment.<br><strong>Dr Colin Bannon</strong><br><em>Crapstone, Devon </em></p> <p>\u2022 Two cases involving what appears to be uninformed parenting are no grounds to throw parents of vegan children behind bars (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/parents-children-vegan-diet-prosecuted-italian-law\" title=\"\">Parents who feed children vegan diet face prosecution under proposed Italian law</a>, theguardian.com, 10 August). Vegan foods \u2013 which are cholesterol-free, low in saturated fat, and rich in complex carbohydrates, protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals \u2013 are optimal for children.</p> <p>The late Dr Benjamin Spock, a leading authority on childcare, spoke out against feeding animal-derived foods to children, advising that they can cause diabetes and, in the long term, set kids up for obesity, cancer, high blood pressure and heart disease. He also held that consuming plant-based foods forms the foundation of dietary habits that support a lifetime of good health.</p> <p>This is one of the many reasons why countless conscientious parents have raised or are raising healthy babies on well-planned, nutritionally complete vegan diets \u2013 and our children are thriving.

Will your effort be rewarded appropriately? Or will you get a good degree? Those who receive a 2:2, and jauntily tell their friends they \u201cgot a Desmond\u201d because they are at an age where they still find rhyming slang funny, are generally using banter to disguise mild disappointment. It\u2019s a Desmond, sure, but if only they\u2019d occasionally responded to that irksome 11am alarm, it might have got a Trevor Nunn or even a Geoff Hurst.</p> <p>In Test cricket, where colons are replaced by dashes, a 2-2 is nothing to be disappointed about. It\u2019s a rare and admirable thing. There have been only ten 2-2 series draws in Test history, and that result is so much worthier than a 1-1 draw: the players have been through so much more \u2013 look at Moeen Ali\u2019s arc for an example \u2013 and the ebb and flow has been greater. They are Test series in name and nature, and at the end of the series, two weary teams get together to chew the fat over a beer Gatorade.</p> <p>The 2-2s of the modern era were all memorable, heartwarming series: the 1972 Ashes, England v West Indies in 1991 (<a href=\"http://www.alloutcricket.com/features/golden-summer-1991\">READ ALL ABOUT IT HERE</a>) and 1995, Brian Lara v Australia in 1998-99, and England v South Africa in 2003. Most ended with the kind of goodwill that is unique to the hard-fought 2-2 draw.</p> <p>Pakistan want a Desmond here, they want it real bad, and they are in with a fair chance after an excellent morning at the Oval. They reached 97 for two, a deficit of 231, with the nightwatchman Yasir Shah the only man to go. There were also three dropped catches from England. </p> <p>A 2-2 would probably be the right result in what has been a lovely series. For Pakistan, there is additional motivation: a Desmond would probably ensure they are Geoff Hurst in the Test rankings by next weekend. (<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/1044027.html\">You can view the permutations here</a>.) Pakistan have never been top since the rankings were introduced in 2003. Even if you backdate them to the beginning of time, they have only been No1 for two months in August and September 1988. It would be quite an achievement.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57adbcc8e4b007f802bad5c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T12:11:11.703Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Philosophical question</strong></p> <p>If catches win matches, what happens if both drop 25 between them in the series?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57adbc4ce4b05ef4244a4ea5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T12:10:43.584Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello.</strong> First to the important business: Sir Gary Naylor <em>is </em>a Guardian JCL.

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019.

The forthcoming figures are for June, early estimates of which were published by the ONS at the time of last week\u2019s GDP data. These suggested that the sector shrank by 1.0% over the month following a (revised) decline of 1.5% in May. </p> <p>Of course the main interest will be in the economic data for all sectors for July onwards, following the result of the referendum. In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.lindafairstein.com/\">Linda Fairstein</a> was the chief of the sex crimes unit, later called the special victims unit, at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office from 1976 until 2002. Since 1996, she has published 18 crime novels about a female prosecutor named Alexandra Cooper, who just happens to be the chief of the special victims unit at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Smartly plotted, the novels draw on Fairstein\u2019s considerable experience and expertise. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/linda-fairstein/killer-look/\">Killer Look</a>, the most recent entry in the saga of Alexandra Cooper, sees a heroine slowly regaining her strength after a dramatic kidnapping experience. Three weeks after her release, Cooper is not yet back at her desk, but can\u2019t help herself from tagging along with the handsome detective Mike Chapman as he investigates the high-profile death of a big-name American fashion designer. Fairstein spoke from Montana about her new fun, fashion-loving crime novel.</p> <p><strong>Alexandra Cooper is loosely \u2013 perhaps even not-so-loosely \u2013 based on your actual experiences as the chief of the sex crimes unit in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office. What is it like continue your career as a prosecutor through fiction?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m still a lawyer. I keep all my credentials current and actually work on cases and write pieces about the law. I\u2019m still very involved in advocacy and lawyering for victims of violence, and, in particular, I stay very close to the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, where I worked for 30 years, and where Alex Cooper works in the novels. I stay connected because I love it. And, of course, it serves me well, I think \u2013 I can stay up to date on forensics, for example, and that can inform how Alex might handle a case. When I started the series, Alex Cooper was 35, and I was maybe a decade older. She\u2019s only 38 now, 18 books later. Of course, I\u2019m much past that point. It requires a lot more of me to think and act like a 38-year-old woman. I\u2019m saying that with a big smile on my face. It\u2019s part of the fun.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like Alex, as a 38-year-old female prosecutor in 2016, has a lot of privileges that you didn\u2019t?</strong></p> <p>Yes. One of the things I really thought I was going to show in in these books was a woman in a non-traditional role. Most crime novels written by women before the 80s, let\u2019s say, featured amateur sleuths \u2013 like in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/agathachristie\">Agatha Christie</a>\u2019s novels. Women never used to be police chiefs or forensic scientists or homicide prosecutors. So, I thought how great to be able to show an actual female prosecutor in a very high profile position. It was totally uncommon in the 70s, and people were just getting used to it in the 90s. Now, it\u2019s old hat. </p> <p>But when I joined the DA\u2019s office in 1972, there were only seven women, out of about 200 prosecutors. Back then, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/frank-hogan-keeping-decent-proper-article-1.849350\">Frank Hogan</a>, the district attorney of New York, did not allow women to work homicide cases. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in the law library,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think women should be trying murder cases, talking about blood and guts in front of juries.\u201d</p> <p>But things changed. Mr Hogan died in 1974. Diversity of all kinds became a much healthier thing in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office. But that was just in New York. Imagine the rest of the country, then. For the most part, we just didn\u2019t exist \u2013 we, meaning women prosecutors. Ours, in Manhattan, was the first sex crimes unit in the country. So it was a very different world, and, yes, I very much wanted to show a strong woman in a non-traditional role. Now, you see it on TV. You see it in movies. You see it in a lot of crime novels. And of course, you see it in real life, which is the happiest change.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like that\u2019s changed the way that you\u2019ve written these books? The fact that when we do watch crime procedurals on television, for example, there is, very often, some sense of gender parity on the team?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve not gone back and read my first three novels, from the 90s, but I\u2019m quite sure that they reflect a different tone. It was more unusual for someone like Alex Cooper to show up at a homicide crime scene, or to walk into the morgue. Now, it\u2019s far less shocking. </p> <p>For instance, if you were to call up the New York chief medical examiner\u2019s office today, I think more than 70% of the forensic biologists are women. There were no, or very few, women medical examiners in \u201972, when I started. That was an all-male profession, and that\u2019s changed, too. </p> <p><strong>Why did you pick the fashion world for this book, for Alex\u2019s not quite-on-the-clock, getting-back-on-her-feet case?</strong></p> <p>In writing these novels, I\u2019ve always picked a world to go into to set as the backdrop, exploring some aspect of New York City. So, I\u2019ve been all over the place. I\u2019ve done the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/\">public library</a>. I\u2019ve done <a href=\"https://govisland.com/\">Governors Island</a>. I\u2019ve done bones in the <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/\">Museum of Natural History</a>. It makes it more interesting for the reader. You\u2019re not reading these books to be educated, but they\u2019re not car chases and shootouts and people committing crimes for no reason.</p> <p>So, I had my eye on the Garment District, the physical area, and the business of it. New York is the US fashion capital, on par with Paris, London, Milan. I did not want to do a book about a beautiful model who\u2019s vulnerable to sexual assault on the designer\u2019s couch kind of thing. You see a lot of mysteries like that. </p> <p>What fascinated me was the business side of it. I just had no idea about the numbers. I really did not stop to think of the global impact, of how big these New York businesses are, around the whole world. I never thought of Muslim women and haute couture, and if you just Google those two words, you could read all day. So, there was so much to drive the business end of it. That happily surprised me, because I still got to use the runway, to have the big show at the end, but to have a business background that was a little more intense. And unexpected.</p>",

  "<p>David Enthoven, who has died aged 72, was one of a group of English public schoolboys who fell in love with the pop music industry in the 1960s, and helped reshape it. His early success as the co-manager of King Crimson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/marc-bolan-death-car-crash-t-rex-1977\" title=\"Marc Bolan's death\">Marc Bolan</a>, Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Roxy Music was followed by a descent into an abyss of drug and alcohol addiction. When he emerged from the ruins of his former life, he used his experience to help others rebuild theirs. Among them was Robbie Williams, whose solo career he guided for 20 years.</p> <p>Williams had arrived at the office of Enthoven and his partner in his second management company, Tim Clark, one day in 1996, a year after leaving Take That. Neither man was impressed by the demo tape they were played, or by the 22-year-old singer\u2019s general condition. Nevertheless, they agreed to a second meeting, at Williams\u2019s flat in Maida Vale, north London, during which, as a last resort, the singer began reciting his poetry to them. \u201cIf you can do that, you can write songs,\u201d they told him, and guided him towards a collaboration with the songwriter Guy Chambers. Among the initial results were two songs, Angels and Let Me Entertain You, that would lay the foundation for a career in which Williams would dominate the British charts and sell tens of millions of records around the world.</p> <p>Enthoven accompanied Williams on his concert tours and helped the singer wean himself off his addictions. After his recovery, Enthoven did much work through Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous to help others.</p> <p>\u201cWithout David, I might have died,\u201d Williams once said, and others could have said the same.</p> <p>Brought up in Houghton Green near Rye,<strong> </strong>East Sussex, by his mother, Margo, and her husband, Tom, a businessman who had served in Malta<strong> </strong>during the war, Enthoven did not discover until his late 20s that his biological father had been a member of the Sitwell family.</p> <p>From 1957 to 1962 he attended Harrow school, where he fell in with the members of the school pop group A Band of Angels. After leaving Harrow, the band turned professional and made several records, and Enthoven became their roadie, although, as the group\u2019s rhythm guitarist, John Gaydon, recalled, Enthoven usually drove to their gigs in his Austin Healey sports car while the musicians were crammed into their Commer van.</p> <p>In 1966, when their singer, Mike d\u2019Abo, left to replace Paul Jones as the frontman of Manfred Mann, Enthoven and Gaydon, who were sharing a mews house bought by Margo in South Kensington, west London, went to work in Denmark Street, London\u2019s Tin Pan Alley, for the Noel Gay artists\u2019 agency. The clients included a comedy trio called Giles, Giles and Fripp. One day in 1968, Robert Fripp, the group\u2019s guitarist, invited the pair to visit a rehearsal room in Fulham Palace Road, where he unveiled a new band called King Crimson, performing songs from an album they had written and part-recorded, In the Court of the Crimson King.</p> <p>That day Enthoven and Gaydon became managers in their own right. Enthoven borrowed \u00a34,500, secured against the mews house, to pay the costs of finishing the album, and the duo made a deal to lease the tapes of the album to Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records and an old Harrovian of an earlier generation.</p> <p>Through a series of Sunday afternoon concerts at the Marquee Club in Soho in 1969 and an appearance on the bill of the Rolling Stones\u2019 free concert in Hyde Park that summer in front of an audience of more than a quarter of a million, King Crimson became the hottest new band in Britain and the standard-bearers for progressive rock. When Enthoven and Gaydon made a deal for a US release with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/dec/17/1\" title=\"Ahmet Ertegun obituary\">Ahmet Ertegun </a>of Atlantic Records, who gave them an advance of $100,000 and a remarkable 12% royalty rate, King Crimson\u2019s global success was assured.</p> <p>Unlike their Tin Pan Alley predecessors, the partners behind EG Management looked like rock stars and deployed a raffish charm. They wore leather jackets and cowboy boots, rode motorbikes and took drugs (they and Blackwell had celebrated the Island deal, which was settled over a spliff in Windsor Great Park, by going out and buying matching 650cc BSA Thunderbolts). A new generation of artists readily warmed to their approach. EG\u2019s select roster soon expanded to include Emerson, Lake and Palmer, formed by Greg Lake, an ex-member of King Crimson, and Bolan, whom they encouraged to add a bass guitarist and drummer to his formerly acoustic lineup, thus transforming the cult duo known as Tyrannosaurus Rex into the chart-topping T Rex.</p> <p>Next to arrive were Roxy Music, whose leader and singer, Bryan Ferry, had failed an audition with King Crimson but had been impressed by EG\u2019s sense of style, not least the location of their first-floor office on King\u2019s Road, Chelsea, overlooking the Markham Arms. When Roxy performed their own audition for EG in an old cinema in Wandsworth, south-west London, one afternoon in February 1972, Enthoven arrived in his Aston Martin and left impressed enough to offer them a deal. Once again the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/roxy-music-mw0000202228\" title=\"Roxy Music (1972)\">debut album</a> \u2013 with its startlingly glamorous pin-up cover \u2013 was offered to Island, where Clark, then the marketing director, was particularly enthusiastic about their prospects, helping to override Blackwell\u2019s reservations about the group\u2019s brand of retro-futurism.</p> <p>Disagreements led to Gaydon\u2019s departure soon after Roxy\u2019s arrival. He was replaced by Mark Fenwick, a department store heir, who took on the role of managing Ferry and Roxy day to day. Enthoven, too, left in the mid-70s, when his habits began to get the better of him. In his absence the company gradually declined, its fall hastened by losses<strong> </strong>at Lloyd\u2019s of London, until the catalogue was sold to Virgin in 1992.</p> <p>Enthoven\u2019s own decline, however, went further and faster. By the time he committed himself to rehab in 1985 he had lost his marriage, his houses in London and the Chilterns, and his collection of vintage motorbikes, although not the affection of many who had known him in the good times, remembering his warmth, kindness and droll humour. They were cheered by his resurrection as Clark\u2019s partner in a new company, eventually known as the ie:music group, which started quietly in 1991 but achieved great success with a roster including Massive Attack, Archive, Sia and, for a while, Ferry, as well as Williams.</p> <p>He and Clark were active in the founding of the <a href=\"http://thefac.org/\" title=\"Featured Artists Coalition\">Featured Artists Coalition</a>, which campaigns for musicians\u2019 rights and is supported by Annie Lennox, Ed O\u2019Brien of Radiohead, Billy Bragg, Nick Mason of Pink Floyd and Sandie Shaw, among others. Enthoven also supported the Hepatitis C Trust and Steps2Recovery.</p> <p>His first marriage, to Penelope Wills, ended in divorce. His second was to the model Maren Greve, who survives him, as do the children of his first marriage, Belinda and James, his step-daughter, Tania, three grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>David Enthoven, pop music manager, born 5&#xa0;July 1944; died 11 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>This week <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/youthday/\">UN International Youth Day</a> raises awareness about people aged between 15 and 24, and their contribution to society worldwide. Lower-income countries typically have more young people, and African nations have the largest proportion of youth. In Uganda, 70% of the population is under 25, and almost 50% under 15. Namibia has the highest proportion of 15- to 24-year-olds in the world, at 23%.</p> <p>The world\u2019s population continues to grow, though the global birth rate has levelled in recent years. This is due to population momentum: as fewer babies are born, population growth is a result of more people living longer. Higher-income countries tend to have aging populations and a diminishing proportion of young people. Globally, 15- to 24-year-olds make up 16% of the population. But every European country \u2013 except Albania, with 19% \u2013 has fewer young people than the global average. Antarctica has no young people \u2013 it is the only continent with no permanent human population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/data-graphic/giv-31075OElutUmu4FaL/\" data-alt=\"Countries with biggest proportion of young people\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/data-graphic/giv-31075OElutUmu4FaL/\">Countries with biggest proportion of young people</a> </figure>",
  "<p>Jeff Stelling, you have company. Three years after its entry into sports broadcasting and more than \u00a32bn of investment later, BT Sport is challenging Sky Sports on Saturday afternoons.</p> <p>The catalyst is that under the new Premier League deal, for which BT and Sky paid \u00a35.14bn over three years, BT Sport will now air its matches at teatime on a Saturday rather than lunchtime.</p> <p>According to Simon Green, the head of BT Sport, that prompted them to launch its own version of Sky\u2019s Soccer Saturday \u2013 the programme fronted by Stelling that has made the sight of three former professionals watching monitors and delivering score updates an integral part of the sports broadcasting landscape.</p> <p>Like launching BT Sport from scratch in a matter of months, Green says it is a challenge he will relish. \u201cWhat they do they do very well. We\u2019ll do it in a BT Sport way and I think it will be a show that a lot of people are happy to watch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we think is right for our viewers, leading into our most important time of the week.\u201d</p> <p>He says BT Sport Score will have a different feel to the Sky show, with the aim being to capture viewers before the Saturday teatime game. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Harry Kewell. Jermaine Jenas. Mark Pougatch is going to be presenting \u2013 he is a thoroughly accomplished, professional broadcaster,\u201d says Green, speaking from their headquarters in an Olympic Park in a constant state of flux.</p> <p>\u201cThe combination of those guys and our established names \u2013 Robbie Savage is going to appear in it quite a bit \u2013\u2013 will give it a BT Sport feeling rather than a more claustrophobic type show. We\u2019ll have personalities from the women\u2019s game, we intend to have more foreign participation.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new deal, whereby Sky retained the lion\u2019s share of matches and the best picks but at a huge cost, BT will show 42 matches per season and Sky 126. As he did at the time of the deal, the scale of which underlined the Premier League\u2019s importance to both media companies and raised new questions for fans over the cost of continuing to get their fix, Green insisted that BT remained happy as the junior partner. \u201cWe\u2019re in a better timeslot. We\u2019ve got a few more games. Our evolution with the Premier League has been very good as well,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe go into our fourth season in a very healthy position. We never anticipated we were going to get a point where we were ahead of Sky in that last auction. This is a long-term strategy for BT to be in pay sports and Premier League rights are part of that because they\u2019re so important in this territory.\u201d</p> <p>He believes that last season, its third on air, was key for BT Sport because it marked the first season of a \u00a3897m deal for Champions League and Europa League rights.</p> <p>It spent more money on signing up Gary Lineker and a host of new pundits and received plaudits for innovations such as a live goals show and its app. But there were plenty within the industry willing to suggest that Uefa was unhappy with the ratings for its flagship competition , particularly for the handful of games shown free to air after it had opted to take it behind a paywall for the first time.</p> <p>Green says that was not the case and that he expected Uefa to sell the rights on a similar basis next time around. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any of that back from Uefa. In terms of what we put to air, they were very happy. Anecdotally, they think our coverage is often the best. As for the ratings, Uefa signed with us in November after we\u2019d only been on air for three months,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe were a start-up television service. They signed and I think you\u2019d say they were taking a leap of faith. They certainly weren\u2019t expecting us to deliver ratings to compare with ITV or even Sky. But if you look at our ratings compared with Sky\u2019s last season, ours compare quite favourably.\u201d</p> <p>Nor does Green believe Uefa will do anything radical with the Champions League format, despite pressure from Spanish and Italian clubs.</p> <p>Green is also excited about the addition of Australian cricket to the channel, starting with Test series against South Africa and Pakistan, plus coverage of the Big Bash Twenty20 competition. That will lead into the real reason they seized those rights \u2013 next year\u2019s overseas Ashes tour.</p> <p>BT\u2019s entry into the market provoked a bidding war with Sky that has been good news for rights holders, with huge sums gambled in the battle for TV and broadband customers. Success is hard to quantify given the many ways of measuring it \u2013 this is no longer a simple battle for ratings or even for new subscribers, but also for brand loyalty and additional services.</p> <p>Three years on from its launch, Green believes that BT Sport has established itself as genuine alternative to Sky Sports and is here to stay. \u201cThe priority was to have our own identity, personality and for it to be a healthy, friendly, positive identity and personality, with a little bit of attitude. I think we have achieved that,\u201d he says.</p>",
  "<p>There is something like gold flowing through the veins of 100-year-old Maria Tegas, and everyone wants a piece of the treasure.</p> <p>The centenarian, who lives in a poor and remote area of central eastern Sardinia \u2013 in one of 14 villages known to geneticists and genealogists as <a href=\"https://www.bluezones.com/2012/02/sardinias-blue-zone-lessons/\">the Blue Zone</a> \u2013 has not had an easy life.

But the most intriguing theory of all is one that\u2019s more intrinsic: the possible existence of a \u2018longevity gene\u2019 that has helped centenarians like Tegas fend off disease. </p> <p>A British biotechnology company, AIM-listed Tiziana Life Sciences, <a href=\"http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/TILS/12895248.html\">announced last month</a> that it was ready to weigh in on the mystery following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/19/uk-firm-buys-sardinian-dna-samples-for-research-into-ageing\">the purchase of a DNA database</a> that contains blood samples from 13,000 residents of the Blue Zone, including Tegas and other members of her family. It was a remarkably cheap deal: just \u20ac258,000 (\u00a3217,000) for a database that took years to collect after the company that ostensibly owned the database, <a href=\"http://web.tiscali.it/shardna/storia.html\">Shardna SPA</a>, went broke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04708a3639c77a726110678c6021dadaf8b55885\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04708a3639c77a726110678c6021dadaf8b55885/0_50_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Tegas, 100\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Tegas, 100, and her peers are considered a \u2018medical mystery\u2019 by scientists trying to understand how so many Sardinians live to be centenarians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Kirchgaessner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In announcing its acquisition, Tiziana founder Gabriele Cerrone said the company\u2019s team of scientists, including <a href=\"http://pathology.ucsd.edu/faculty/ferrara.htm\">Napoleone Ferrara</a> \u2013 who helped develop cancer drug <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/bevacizumab\">Avastin</a>, had the expertise and insights to use the biobank to discover new drugs and diagnostic tests.</p> <p>But not everyone is enthusiastic. On the night of 5 August a small group of concerned Sardinians gathered at a meeting spot in the town of Tortoli to discuss the deal. Most of those at the meeting, including two former mayors and members of a citizens\u2019 rights group, criticised the Tiziana acquisition, suggesting it was fundamentally unethical and possibly illegal, while a minority thought the deal could still be beneficial.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is it that something meant for the collective has been stolen for different purposes?

He  suggested that participants in the DNA database could be asked to rescind their consent agreement, effectively making their blood samples unusable.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that use of the DNA will be decided by the population. You don\u2019t consent forever,\u201d Falchi said. </p> <p>The conflict has raised the kind of thorny ethical questions that are likely to become more pervasive as scientists tap into the promise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/nhs-genetic-analysis-serious-diseases-diagnosed-treated\">massive DNA databases</a> to learn more about disease. Should a private company be able to profit from the study of a population\u2019s DNA, when the DNA was voluntarily donated? The deal also raises uncomfortable questions for local critics: why did Shardna go bust to begin with?</p> <p><strong>Establishing the Blue Zone</strong></p> <p>The story starts nearly 20 years ago when Gianni Pes, a Sardinian scientist at Sassari University, visited nearly all of Sardinia\u2019s 377 municipalities to try to prove that certain areas had an unusually large number of people who lived extremely long lives. When they found a town that met their criteria, they marked it on their map with a blue marker. When they were done, the Sardinian Blue Zone was established.</p> <p>Scientists soon descended on the territory, dividing up the 14 towns among themselves in a way that resembled competing organised crime syndicates, Pes said. </p> <p>In all, four databases of DNA samples have been collected over the years, with some researchers refusing to collaborate with others.</p> <p>One of them was Shardna, created by a scientist called Mario Pirastu. Another entity, a partly publicly funded group called Parco Genetico, was established at the same time to facilitate the data collection and act as an intermediary between Shardna and the Blue Zone towns. Now the two groups both claim rights to the database.</p> <p>Falchi, the Italian researcher from King\u2019s College, worked for Pirastru in the early days when Shardna was a promising startup competing with an Icelandic company called DeCode that was engaged in similar work. The Icelandic group would \u2013 controversially \u2013 eventually be sold to the huge US biotech company Amgen for $415m.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has raised the ethical questions likely to become pervasive as scientists tap into DNA databases to learn disease.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn the beginning, Shardna and DeCode were competitors. Then DeCode built a real company, and had articles in medical journals every month,\u201d said Falchi.<br></p> <p>After a while, Falchi said he and others abandoned Shardna because they were unhappy with the management of the company, despite its potential.</p> <p>Shardna eventually collapsed and was sold to a famous research institute, San Raffaele hospital in Milan. In 2012 San Raffaele itself became embroiled in a <a href=\"http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/news/english/458045/staffing-cuts-warded-off-at-san-raffaele-hospital-in-milan.html\">financial scandal</a>, which opened the door to the bargain sale of the Sardinian database by a bankruptcy court.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Tiziana founder Cerrone, who said he had followed Shardna\u2019s progress for years and was \u201cobsessed\u201d by the database, swooped in and bought it.<br></p> <p>\u201cHere we\u2019ve resurrected this company from a coma,\u201d Cerrone, a native Italian, said. \u201cIf this was done in the UK or the US, people would be very positive. Unfortunately what you are seeing is people being envious that they didn\u2019t do it themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Opponents of the deal have turned to a local businessman and dentist named Piergiorgio Lorrai to lead the fight against Tiziana. Lean and sporting a permanent-looking tan, Lorrai bought Parco Genetico earlier this year for an undisclosed sum and claims PG is still the rightful owner of the database it helped created back in 2000. The very same database Tiziana now apparently owns the rights to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44ebd066d522ce5811771c40f5fff6f178462d64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44ebd066d522ce5811771c40f5fff6f178462d64/0_66_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Piergiorgio Lorrai\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piergiorgio Lorrai bought Parco Genetico for an undisclosed sum to \u2018safeguard the work\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Kirchgaessner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI bought this to safeguard the work that has been done and to continue what has been started. To safeguard the research, the science, the culture, and to give vitality and dignity to our territory,\u201d Lorrai told the Guardian. \u201cHuman material doesn\u2019t have a price.\u201d<br></p> <p>Lorrai has hired attorneys \u2013 including one whose own DNA is included in the disputed database \u2013 and is preparing to launch a suit to challenge the deal.</p> <p>Cerrone dismisses the controversy. \u201cHonestly, this guy [Lorrai] is seriously small potatoes,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get caught up in the minutia \u2013 that\u2019s why I left Italy \u2013 I like making and creating big companies,\u201d </p> <p>Asked about whether the sale was legal, given the alleged limits of the consent agreement the DNA database was based on, Cerrone said: \u201cIf the government and the judge in the bankruptcy court are doing an illegal sale, then I put my arms up in the air. Then there\u2019s really no hope for Italy.</p> <p>\u201cThe sale was a bona fide legal sale and there is no reason to believe otherwise ... When an asset is bought through a bankruptcy court in Italy it is perhaps the most scrutinised transactions as it is subject to approval from banks, creditors, government agencies, and finally a judge.\u201d</p> <p>If Lorrai succeeds in challenging the deal, legal scrutiny will likely focus on documents shown to the Guardian that show the DNA database was subject to a mysterious contract back in 2006, when a now-former representative of PG appears to have signed over the rights to the DNA it collected to Shardna for a sum of \u20ac50,000.</p> <p>The origin and reasoning behind the contract are unknown, but Lorrai said it was the likely product of conflicts of interest between Shadna and PG that were never closely scrutinised. Regardless of that contract, participants in the research never agreed to sell the rights of the DNA, he said.</p> <p>The question now is whether participants like Maria Tegas or her children will ever gain from the research that has put her corner of Sardinia on the map. When Cerrone was asked whether he believed Sardinians ought to benefit in the future from any potentially lucrative medical advancements that might emerge, the executive demurs. Tiziana has already \u201cgiven back\u201d to the community when it bought the database for \u20ac258,000, including all the outstanding debts.</p> <p>\u201cWe paid all the unpaid salaries from the locals who never got paid. Did I get it all for a good price? I hope so. We\u2019ll know in ten years.\u201d</p> <h2>Blue Zones</h2> <p>Four areas of the world have been designated as Blue Zones by scientists: Okinawa island in Japan, parts of central-eastern Sardinia, the Nicoya peninsula in northwestern Costa Rica, and the Greek island of Ikaria.</p> <p>Certain traits link most of these areas, where exceptional longevity has been proven. First, most of the populations have been isolated for long periods due to their geography or other reasons, which in some cases led to inbreeding between distant family members, possibly helping certain genetic variants that favour longevity to be passed on from generation to generation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2215aa2bc4a5040ff8bbc633593d74f56bdec0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2215aa2bc4a5040ff8bbc633593d74f56bdec0c8/0_316_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Greek island of Ikaria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Greek island of Ikaria is also designated as a Blue Zone by scientists studying longevity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The insularity of these communities could explain some delays in socio-economic development, researchers have found, making them relatively poorer than other nearby communities and delaying the onset of capitalism. Other similar characteristics include high quality food (though not necessarily abundant), physically-active lifestyles, and a prevailing attitude of collectivist rather than individualistic thinking. The latter, in turn, has limited the onset of high stress levels in the communities, researchers said. Finally, the four communities all exhibit strong social cohesion, a fact that potentially allows older people to still feel like they are an important part of society.</p> <p>Gianni Pes, the Sardinian scientist who helped coin the term Blue Zone, is not convinced there is any such thing as a \u201clongevity gene\u201d that sets the populations apart. For one, there are genetic differences between the populations of the 14 towns that comprise the Sardinian Blue Zone, suggesting other factors \u2013 like environment and diet \u2013 may play a bigger role than just genetics.</p>",

She came to us in November 2015, with a pitch for a story about children from a very poor village in eastern Congo who were being systematically abducted and raped \u2013 and the authorities seemed incapable of stopping it. Clearly it was a story that needed to be told, plus she had funding to go to the DRC, which obviously helped.</p> <p>We spoke and emailed frequently over the following months as she visited the DRC to do the main part of her reporting, talking to the little girls and their families, to doctors, and to investigators about the corruption they were up against.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/kavumu-village-39-young-girls-raped-justice-drc\">The village where dozens of girls have been raped is still waiting for justice | Lauren Wolfe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Traumatic as the story was to report, it became even more stressful for Lauren once she was back in the US, as she tried to establish what she could make public without endangering her sources.

Unless you\u2019ve paid a squillion dollars for the rights to broadcast it, the IOC are extremely unhappy with people using clips on social media - including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-ban-gifs-vines-social-media\">the humble gif and the use of Vine</a>.

It's time for a blockbuster face-lift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I feel a certain misunderstanding here. Con Air is a perfectly fun film, but it\u2019s not high art. What separates it from a film like Suicide Squad is that it is an unabashed B-movie. Outside of the work of Vin Diesel, Hollywood doesn\u2019t make low-brow, silly action fare any more. Nicolas Cage is partly to blame for this, as his turn in The Rock started the trend of celebrated actors taking on schlock parts to class up a genre film. Now, Michael Fassbender can star in a video game adaptation. The blurring of the line between high and low art has rendered everything an amorphous mass of bland mush.

Last week writer Kyle Chayka explored this phenomenon in an essay in <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification\">the Verge</a>, describing the way tech-led travel is homogenising what we consider to be the desirable hallmarks of any given destination. \u201cEverywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of looking the same, whether it\u2019s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up piece for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world\">the Guardian</a>, describing its key features as \u201creclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting\u201d.</p> <p>Chayka dubs this style \u201cAirspace\u201d. Its function? Making a particularly elite demographic of global travellers feel comfortable and at home as they skip from city to city booking apartments on Airbnb, checking into the local co-working hub and meeting up with fellow \u201cdigital nomads\u201d for an ideas jam (or whatever) at the nearest coffee joint. </p> <p>It\u2019s a subject I\u2019ve thought about a lot in the past, travelling to different cities for Guardian Travel. While Chayka focuses on the aesthetic of Airspace and the way it has been driven by a group of people who \u201cmove through spaces linked by technology\u201d, I\u2019ve always thought more about how the people themselves could be defined. \u201cHipsters\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to cut it, nor are these simply the \u201cupper classes\u201d. I think it goes beyond the Silicon Valley kids too. A particular class is emerging in the world who aren\u2019t bound by location, and places \u2013 particularly cities \u2013 are evolving rapidly to accommodate them and their collective tastes. Airspace is a good first step in opening up a critical discussion about who these people are.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad9aede4b0fe7550975118\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T11:40:52.380Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are Corbyn supporters delusional?

They really need to sit down and reflect on why they are losing voters, and not just since Corbyn. Scotland and the north are abandoning Labour in droves, not because of Corbyn but because of how Labour has acted prior to this.

Now I don\u2019t know if the two cooks know each other, but assuming they don\u2019t, the comparison is instructive. Reichl and Oglethorpe both plump for sourdough, cheddar and alliums, all in large quantities (thick slices of bread, mountains of grated cheese, and a medley of different coloured onions, garlic and leek, very finely chopped). And the recipes don\u2019t so much differ as compete. Oglethorpe combines his cheddar with a washed rind and some comt\u00e9, while Reichl adds both green onion and shallots to her veg. She also really pushes the boat out, adding butter on the inside of the bread, and mayo and extra cheese on the outside, because, as Food52 puts it, \u201cat this point, why not?\u201d Stella McCartney did an interview in October 2009, sitting in a west London cafe eating scrambled eggs on rye.

  "<p>Golf clubs across the world have been warned that the sport could fall into crisis unless they lighten up a little, relax strict dress codes and withdraw bans on tweeting, snapchatting and booze on the fairway.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The game, first played in 15th-century Scotland, isn\u2019t known for keeping pace with changes in wider society (Scotland\u2019s famous Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews only admitted its first female members last year; Augusta, home to the Masters tournament, opened to women members in 2012), but experts say it has to act now to embrace millennials. </p> <p>Consultants hired by the sport\u2019s various governing bodies say golf clubs\u2019 stuffy attitudes as well as the high cost of game \u2013 on wallets and time \u2013 have contributed to a roughly 10 million reduction in the number of players globally since before the financial crisis. </p> <p>Steve Mona, chief executive of the World Golf Foundation, said clubs have to urgently adapt to the demands of younger people to ensure the sport has a future, as decisions by the world\u2019s two biggest sports brands \u2013 Nike and Adidas \u2013 to pull out of golf equipment raised fears about the sport\u2019s long-term future. </p> <p>\u201cThe headlines \u2018golf in crisis\u2019 are overblown. We have a healthy number of core golfers,\u201d Mona said. \u201cBut we do need to attract new and younger players. Each year about 500,000 leave the game because of death or the physical inability to play, and so every year we have to replace them.\u201d</p> <p>Mona said the WGF, which partners with golf national associations across the world, has been working hard to make golf more appealing to younger people and minorities, but real change must come from the clubhouse. </p> <p>He said clubs should ask themselves if their rules need to be as strict as they often are. \u201cCan you go out on the golf course with your shirt untucked? Can you wear your cap backwards? Can you play music in your cart? Can you bring your mobile devices out there? Can you drink beer while you\u2019re going round?</p> <p>\u201cMillennials are used to being able to do all those things in their recreation. We need to make it the same for golf.\u201d</p> <p>Mona, 59, concedes that traditionalists may prickle at the thought of selfies and beers on the green. \u201cBut clubs have to have something to please young people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky problem. Someone like me wouldn\u2019t think of engaging in social media on the course, I\u2019d only be thinking of the next shot. But young people want to be on Facebook and Instagram between shots.\u201d</p> <p>He warned clubs that refuse to relax their rules and put all their chips in with baby boomers: \u201cI\u2019m telling you in eight to 10 years when they start ageing out, you\u2019re going to be in trouble,\u201d he said as players on a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfvOoSSh94Q\">golf board</a>, a cross between an electric golf cart and surfboard, whizzed past behind him. </p> <p>\u201cWhat does it really matter if you\u2019re in your regular foursome, and the group in front of you has golf boards and are playing music?\u201d</p> <p>If clubs listen to Mona, it may help reduce the average age of golfers and increase numbers playing. The average age of players in the US is 44, rising to 48 for core golfers who play regularly. </p> <p>Golf has dramatically declined in popularity since the financial crisis with the number of players in the US \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest golf market \u2013 falling from 30 million in 2008 to 25 million today, according to research firm Golf Datatech. The global golf equipment industry is still worth $8.6bn.</p> <p>The number of players is now holding steady in the US, but declined by 2.2% in England and 0.8% in Scotland last year according to KPMG. The number playing in England has reduced by a quarter since 2007, and in Japan numbers are down by 40% since a peak in the 1990s. At the same time the game has experienced sustained growth in South America, China and most significantly Vietnam \u2013 which is undergoing a golf course building boom to more than double the number of courses to 96 within five years.</p> <p>The experts hope that golf\u2019s inclusion in the Rio 2016 Olympics \u2013 for the first time since St Louis 1904 \u2013 will spark a renewed interest in the game. But say the challenge is to convert that interest into participation, and note that the enthusiasm for the game generated by Tiger Woods tended to stay rooted to the sofa.</p> <p>\u201cTiger Woods didn\u2019t influence people to take up golf, it got more people to watch it on television, but they didn\u2019t go out and play,\u201d Tom Stine, co-founder of Golf Datatech, said. \u201cHe drew kids\u2019 attention to the game because they wanted to be like Tiger, just like they do watching LeBron James or Lionel Messi.\u201d While you can play basketball and soccer in the playground, you can only play at being Tiger with a lot of imagination. </p> <p>Both Stine and Mona believe the US game is only part way through a major reduction of the number of courses to reflect the number of regular players rather than real estate developers\u2019 imaginations. </p> <p>Mona, who plays off a handicap of nine, reckons there is going to be a continued contraction over the next three to five years with hundreds of courses closing a year. \u201cAt the high watermark in 2005 there were about 1,600 courses, today there are about 15,200, and I expect it to fall by another 1,000.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s way too many of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the boom years real estate entrepreneurs thought they\u2019d build courses and people would flock to them. But when the market tanked, so did golf courses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d Stine, 66, agreed. \u201cDuring the real estate boom people were building courses everywhere. They didn\u2019t build golf courses because the town needed a golf course, they were building houses around them because they could get more money for the homes. There were courses literally across the street from each other.</p> <p>\u201cBut then the real estate bubble burst, lots of people lost their jobs, lost their houses and the club didn\u2019t have enough members left.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>As the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want boomed over loudspeakers after Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Kissimmee, Florida, on Thursday night, an elderly spectator walked by the media enclosure. \u201cTraitor!

If, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/donald-trump-republican-defections-susan-collins\">as every recent survey suggests</a>, he does indeed suffer defeat, it raises the question of what will happen to the 13.3 million people who voted for him in the Republican primaries and whether, ultimately, Trumpism can survive Trump.</p> <p>Several supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-clinton-mental-stamina-florida-rally\">at Thursday\u2019s rally</a> \u2013 where raucous crowds punched the air and chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d and \u201cLiar!

Should that happen, some said they intended to remain engaged in politics, but more likely with a third party than with the Republicans \u2013 especially if that party were to revert to establishment figures such as Jeb Bush. That would pose a dilemma for Republican elders seeking to rebuild from the ruins of a potential landslide defeat.</p> <p>\u201cThe liberal media are trying to skewer the vote so we won\u2019t go out and vote,\u201d said Flora Reece, 47, a commercial analyst. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to win.

I\u2019ll make sure they stay interested.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s post-convention tribulations just prompted Time magazine to publish a stylised image of his head dribbling like hot wax beside a single word headline: \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">Meltdown</a>\u201d. After his unwinnable fight with gold star family Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son died serving in Iraq, the candidate attempted to restore discipline last Monday with a major economic speech in Detroit.</p> <p> Yet by Wednesday, he had touched off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\">another furore with an off-the-cuff comment</a> widely seen as inciting supporters of the second amendment to assassinate Clinton. A day later, he began repeatedly describing Barack Obama as \u201cthe founder\u201d of Islamic State.

Yet in Trump World, the prevailing narratives do not apply. Some supporters, for example, opined that Khizr Khan had been paid $375,000 to denounce Trump \u2013 an unproven claim perpetrated by rightwing websites \u2013 and was therefore fair game.</p> <p>Capt Terry Shields, 66, a war veteran who served in Vietnam in 1969-70, said: \u201cIt was a shame it was brought up by the father in the first place. I think it was a fixed deal. The biggest thing that worries me is the Muslims taking over.

Generalisations are perilous and pose a headache for post-election Republican strategists. Another military veteran, Brett Puffenbarger, 29, said: \u201cI jumped on Trump train fairly early on. He was the only GOP candidate who wasn\u2019t outright against gay marriage and legalisation of marijuana. He was socially liberal and fiscally conservative and that was a big draw for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sabrina Motes, 36, said: \u201cI\u2019m a Jewish American, I used to be a Democrat and I\u2019m college educated. I hate the stereotype that if you\u2019re college educated or Jewish you don\u2019t support Trump. I\u2019ve followed him in his business career and I believe he\u2019s what the country needs right now.\u201d</p> <p>But looking to the future, Motes, a pharmaceutical sales rep, added: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is the perfect candidate. There are things that can be learned from and things that could be done differently. Republicans were supposed to learn from Mitt Romney but I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d</p> <p>Allegations of rigging were widespread, even though a vote has not yet been cast, but few were willing to predict what kind of backlash there would be. Bob Kunst, 74, a registered but disaffected Democrat sitting behind a cardboard \u201cTrump v Tramp\u201d sign, said: \u201cRight now the anger is intense and if, God forbid, Trump loses, you\u2019re talking revolution. You\u2019ve just had a revolution in Britain with Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>But Charlie van Esler, 60, an investment products seller who supported Marco Rubio in the primaries, said: \u201cI have no reason to believe it would be a rigged election. I respect the democratic process. The idea that Trump supporters are rednecks and yahoos is disingenuous.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the arena, where Trump addressed thousands of (nearly all white) supporters, badges, hats, T-shirts and other merchandise were on sale. The Confederate flag was flying outside a stall run by Ariel Robb, a 26-year-old nurse, who insisted that its message \u201cis more heritage than hate\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s the only candidate who says if he makes a mess, he\u2019ll clean it up.

I\u2019m trusting in God.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas Trump has a luxury home in Florida and beat local senator Rubio in the primaries, he fared less well in states such as Wisconsin. Earlier this week in Janesville, where post-industrial melancholy is evident in a closed car plant and eerily quiet downtown, House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/paul-ryan-beats-mini-donald-trump-challenger-in-wisconsin-primary\">Paul Ryan crushed a Trump-style challenger </a>in a congressional primary.

Hanging on to this man is suicidal. What surprises me is how many people in the Republican party think their fortunes would be worse if they renounced him. I think people who haven\u2019t, like Paul Ryan, are done.\u201d</p> <p>The Republicans could become the first party to lose the White House for three consecutive elections since the Democrats in 1988. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">A leading architect of the Democratic revival</a> was Al From, who said on Thursday: \u201cFirst the Republicans have got to develop an agenda that people want to vote for, not just a small sliver of the electorate.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to become more libertarian on cultural issues to appeal to young voters. You have to express views in ways that convey you\u2019re open to other points of views, too. We weren\u2019t going to win pro-life voters in 1992 but they saw Bill Clinton and said: \u2018He\u2019s not a radical on this, let\u2019s look at what he says about other issues.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>From warned: \u201cIf the governors and party leaders don\u2019t take a stronger hand in shaping the party, it\u2019s possible there will be some sort of replacement party. There could be a realignment of the parties over the next two or three elections. With the Republicans it\u2019s more extreme because Trump has hijacked the party from the leadership. The leaders could take it back but it\u2019s possible a third party could emerge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified quickly</p> <footer> <cite>Frank Luntz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That argument echoes the recommendations of a <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/\">Republican autopsy report</a>, conducted after the 2012 election defeat, which called for wider appeal to young people and racial minorities and an end to the party\u2019s anti-immigration stance. First the party could not bring itself to make that journey by passing a law in Congress \u2013 then Trump came along with his signature plan to build a wall.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.focuswithfrank.com/\">Frank Luntz</a>, a Republican consultant and pollster, also doubts that the maverick tycoon will have a long-term political legacy. He said: \u201cTrump has little formal statewide organisation \u2013 even now. He has loyalists, but they are disorganised. His campaign is being out-raised and outspent by ratios we have never seen in modern politics \u2013 and that\u2019s with just 90 days to go. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this movement will continue beyond its leader. He has become the most unpopular political figure in America today.\u201d</p> <p>It would be foolish to write the Republican party off, Luntz added. \u201cThe GOP has been through these rough elections before, and they have emerged stronger and more unified much more quickly than prognosticators ever expected. The Goldwater debacle in 1964 led to Nixon\u2019s resurgence in 1968 and a 60% landslide in 1972.</p> <p>\u201cWatergate may have destroyed the GOP in 1974, but Reagan won by nine [percentage points] just six years later and by 20 [points] four years after that.

  "<h2><strong>Richard Ford</strong></h2> <p>My old mentor and friend Shelby Foote used to say that a person couldn\u2019t understand the United States without understanding the American civil war. As a Mississippi kid who was glad the south had lost the war (100 years before!) and who felt that slavery was a blight on American history we would do well to try to \u201clive beyond\u201d, I thought Shelby\u2019s insistence was a lot of hooey intended to prove the south\u2019s undeserved centrality to all things American. In my naive view, the south and \u201csouthern values\u201d were a garish anomaly, not typical of what America stood for \u2013 those values expressed in the Declaration of Independence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58493e2e2db24ed96426a43c2c16b876234514d/0_946_3378_4219/801.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ford.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I maintained this view until I unexpectedly experienced the American right wing\u2019s irrationally hostile opposition to the Obama presidency. From questioning \u2013 completely without justification \u2013 Obama\u2019s birth and religion, to opposing virtually all Obama\u2019s policy initiatives, to slandering the president personally, to denying his actual right to hold office, the right wing formally and informally waged a campaign not only to discredit our legally elected head of state but, in essence, to erase him.</p> <p>Okay, I said I was naive; but this shocked me. And it puzzled me. What was it about Barack Obama that incensed the right to such bizarre extremes? Here is a superbly intelligent man, dignified and persuasively presidential, a good communicator, an exemplary \u201cfamily man\u201d, remarkably scandal free; he knows the US constitution, he was and is strongly supported by the other party. He in every demonstrable way has had the country\u2019s best interests clearly in his sight. One could disagree with him policy to policy. But the right\u2019s reaction was outsized and\u2026 well\u2026 mindless. And all these views \u2013 to get around to the point \u2013 are the views put forward by Trump, both today and for the past nearly eight years.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t just be his race \u2013 could it? \u2013 that set the right so against the president? Though, in America, one cannot \u2013 must not \u2013 ever discount the lowest sort of political urgings, and must never overlook race prejudice as a motive for most anything. If it quacks like a duck, etc.</p> <p>All of what I heard in the rightwing contumely, then and now \u2013 including Trump\u2019s stump speeches in the past week \u2013 certainly reminded me troublingly of the anti-integrationist, anti-black, so-called states rights \u2013 now hygienically rebranded as \u201cnativist\u201d or \u201cpopulist\u201d \u2013 calumny from my apartheid youth in Mississippi: the unrelenting attempt not just to disempower African Americans as political actors, but to extirpate them. How might I inform myself better about this growing sense of unease regarding the president\u2019s race being a primary consideration \u2013 acknowledged or unacknowledged \u2013 in the right wing\u2019s intransigence?</p> <p>Well, first, I thought, read about the civil war, the vast crucible of American race politics, the \u201cproving ground\u201d where vitriolic, mindless anti-black rhetoric found its full voice and first prominent advocates. And what was the best history of the American civil war? Everyone knew that \u2013 probably even Shelby Foote, who wrote two volumes of his own. James McPherson\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning civil war history, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/battle-cry-of-freedom.html\"><em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em></a>.</p> <p>Read it.

The eponymous antihero is a hypocrite and a conman. He has a patchy sexual past and a history of heavy drinking, yet sells himself as a convert to evangelical religion, teaming up with Sister Sharon Falconer, who leads impassioned revivals throughout the midwest. Manipulative and cunning, Gantry is driven to accrue wealth through religious hucksterism, but also power; he feeds off the roar of the crowd. He\u2019s a narcissist and a fraud who has left multiple ruined lives in his wake.</p> <p>The main difference between Gantry and Trump is that Gantry is portrayed as genuinely charismatic. Lewis\u2019s preacher gets his leg over figuratively and literally because, as a performer, he\u2019s mesmerising. Trump is not charismatic. He is artless and politically clumsy, and wears his egotism on his sleeve. Nor is Trump mesmerising, except in the sense that a train wreck is mesmerising. Gantry\u2019s success in pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes is understandable: he has a silver tongue, and on stage he\u2019s larger than life. Trump can\u2019t string a single grammatical sentence together, and at the podium he is lumpen and awkward. As a fictional character, Gantry works, and Trump doesn\u2019t. As Mark Schorer, an American academic, observed: \u201cThe forces of social good and enlightenment as presented in <em>Elmer Gantry </em>are not strong enough to offer any real resistance to the forces of social evil and banality.\u201d Some things never change.</p> <p>\u2022 Lionel Shriver\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047.html\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a> (Borough).</p> <h2><strong>David Hare</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1b2a606d305bf47371498ff354ce348a0bcb372/842_541_3967_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hare - photographed in his writing studio in North London Photograph by DAVID LEVENE For SATURDAY\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last December, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/08/trumps-repeated-claim-that-obama-is-accepting-200000-syrian-refugees/?tid=a_inl\">Donald Trump claimed </a>that President Obama planned to let 200,000 Syrian refugees into the US in 2016.

As Lipstadt says in our film, \u201cThe icecaps are melting. And Elvis is dead.\u201d Opinions backed up by fact have more value than those that aren\u2019t.

Woodard explores the US as a cluster of 11 different cultures, some of which we share with our neighbours, Canada and Mexico. In order to understand Trump and his appeal, I think we can focus on Appalachian culture, which was exported from the Scottish borders in the 18th century, and was marked by an affinity for conflict and evangelical protestantism. These people had been trained to do battle in the Scottish wars, were later put to work in the coal mines, and are now out of work (the most evocative portrait of the lives these immigrants left behind and what they did when they got to America is in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/albion-s-seed.html\">David Hackett Fischer\u2019s <em>Albion\u2019s Seed</em></a>). Another intransigent American culture is that of the deep south, slaveholders who came to the US from the sugar plantations of Barbados and were much more hierarchical and ruthless than the slaveholders in Virginia.</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting and relevant nation, though, is New Netherland, founded in 1624, a partly Dutch nation, very diverse, not religious, but authoritarian and corporate (run by the Dutch West Indies Corporation). Now New York City, it is the extreme capitalist nation, which has never minded making a buck from no matter what, including the slave trade. Woodard writes, \u201cIndeed, full on slavery was introduced to what is now the United States not by the gentlemen planters of Virginia or South Carolina but by the merchants of Manhattan.\u201d</p> <p>Three hundred slaves were imported by the Dutch West Indies corporation in 1655 and auctioned \u2013 \u201cIn the last decade before the [1685] English conquest, New Amsterdam was rapidly evolving into North America\u2019s greatest slave market.\u201d Woodard says that our 11 nations are only partly integrated with one another and have always been that way. I would say that the resistance to having a black man as president, which laid the groundwork for the current fix we are in, comes from the deep southern and Appalachian nations; but the mercenary and ruthless lack of conscience (hello, Donald Trump!) comes from the Manhattan nation.</p> <p>\u2022 Jane Smiley\u2019s most recent novel is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/early-warning-322607.html\"><em>Early Warning</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Rich Benjamin</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6db368bb75aa186b13c2a108a6f80e66fc270925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6db368bb75aa186b13c2a108a6f80e66fc270925/0_93_2848_3558/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Rich Benjamin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich Benjamin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Schuster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year I witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/apr/14/bernie-sanders-rally-washington-square-park-pictures\">Bernie Sanders supporters</a> occupy Washington Square Park to hear him speak and saw Black Lives Matter protesters<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/19/black-lives-matter-protesters-block-san-franciscos-bay-bridge\"> shut down city streets</a>, declaring, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d And, travelling to America\u2019s whitest communities in recent years, I\u2019ve seen protests against immigration and taxes, a precursor to Trump supporters who denounce our \u201crigged\u201d economy and elections.</p> <p>Christopher Lasch\u2019s ornery 1994 book <em>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</em> illuminates this election. An increasingly global, mobile and craven class, Lasch contended, isolates itself in its social networks and physical cocoons, a flight not only from daily experience in public spaces but a political abandonment of the working and middle class that also betrays basic democratic practices and values. Though they differ in temperament and outlook, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton personify versions of Lasch\u2019s self-protecting privileged class, whose careers and lives contribute to the breakdown of an inclusive, national democratic culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A man who made a fortune from golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Were he alive, Lasch might eviscerate these two very different elites, beholden to different privileged interests yet nonetheless falling over themselves to champion the \u201ccommon\u201d person. His book offers an implicit explanation of the elite\u2019s cynical exploitation of \u201cordinary\u201d people and the popular cynicism toward the elite. Lasch\u2019s book presciently exposes the hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s candidacy. A property developer who made a fortune from luxury condos and golf courses, Trump now presents himself as the voice of the silenced white masses. A onetime Democrat whose primary political allegiance is to himself, Trump precisely embodies the selfish elite Lasch dissected in the 80s and 90s.</p> <p>The physical segregation of Americans into economically or racially homogenous communities has its counterpart in the subdivision of our discussions and opinions. Roughly $7.5bn (\u00a35.7bn) will be spent on this election, the vast majority raised from the corporatised donor class. \u201cThe unreal artificial character of our politics reflects elites\u2019 insulation from common life,\u201d Lasch wrote, \u201ctogether with a secret conviction that the real problems are insoluble.\u201d Campaign chatter inundates us on social media, but dumb memes are no substitute for incisive information, rigorous analysis, or meaningful debate. Effectively excluded from public debate, most Americans no longer have any use for the information inflicted on them in such large amounts. Wealth, false choices and Trump himself devour the coverage.

It is a triumph of faith, indeed.</p> <p>Trump is fond of claiming in messianic terms that he alone can save America, and restore the American Dream. The historian who coined the phrase \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d in a book called <em>The Epic of America</em>, would, I suspect, disagree. In 1931 James Truslow Adams argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">chasing the spectre of wealth</a> is what got America into the mess of the Depression; he carefully traced that ideology back to the 19th century, when there developed a \u201cnew conception of business as somehow a social and patriotic duty\u201d. This is the ideology into which Trump has tapped so powerfully: the idea that business success is itself a virtue to be ranked above all others, to be worshipped.

In its opening pages, George Babbitt gazes upon a bank tower and Lewis tells us: \u201cHe beheld the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men.\u201d In 1926 Lewis\u2019s <em>Elmer Gantry</em> satirised the hypocrisy of selling religion, while a year earlier Scott Fitzgerald skewered the same attitudes when he said that Jay Gatsby was a son of God and must about \u201cHis Father\u2019s Business: the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty\u201d. The idea that someone in service to the American worship of wealth could through sheer force of will drive himself near to the top is at the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s morality play. The world that he envisioned was one in which character was increasingly sacrificed for wealth \u2013 and that is the world that Trump embodies, and which he would like to rule.</p> <p>A decade after Barton said that Jesus was the best businessman of all, Lewis wrote <em>It Can\u2019t Happen Here</em>, a dystopian satire responding to the rise of fascism in Europe by imagining a populist demagogue who becomes a totalitarian president of the United States. But of course, that could never happen in America.</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Churchwell\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/careless-people-2.html\"><em>Careless People</em></a> (Virago).</p> <h2><strong>Steven Pinker</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf1390177e303c1227a43a7992c62e24ba764499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1390177e303c1227a43a7992c62e24ba764499/180_5_3790_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Pinker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Pinker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most people idealise democracy as a form of governance in which an informed populace deliberates about the common good and carefully selects leaders who carry out their preferences. By that standard the world has never had a democracy. Political scientists such as Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, authors of <em>Democracy for Realists</em>, who study how democracies really work are repeatedly astonished by the shallowness and incoherence of people\u2019s political beliefs and the tenuous connection of those beliefs to their votes. Most voters are ignorant not just of current policy alternatives but of the most elementary facts about politics and history, such as the major branches of government or which countries have used nuclear weapons. Their opinions flip depending on how a question is worded: they say that the government spends too much on \u201cwelfare\u201d but too little on \u201cassistance to the poor\u201d, and that it should use \u201cmilitary force\u201d but not \u201cgo to war\u201d. When they do formulate a preference, they commonly vote for a candidate with the opposite one. Nor does voting provide a feedback signal on a government\u2019s overall performance. Voters punish incumbents for recent events over which they have dubious control, such as macroeconomic swings and terrorist strikes, or no control at all, such as droughts, floods or even shark attacks.</p> <p>Achen and Bartels suggest that most people correctly recognise that their votes are astronomically unlikely to affect the outcome of an election and so they prioritise work and family over educating themselves about politics. They use the franchise as a form of self-expression: they vote for candidates who they think speak up for their kind of people.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard and author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/better-angels-of-our-nature.html\"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/a-sense-of-style.html\"><em>The Sense of Style</em></a> (Penguin).</p> <h2><strong>Mark Lawson </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/857e26bc1bd021d9241c176aad4328b47b5c813a/0_551_2945_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Lawson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Lawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abigail Zoe Martin/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the horror of the Washington establishment, a gabby maverick with no record of political office uses his celebrity, in a depressed and paranoid America, to fuel a furious movement that threatens the hegemonies of politics, corporations and the media. Considering the insurgent unthinkable, they plot to stop him.</p> <p>The year is 1934, and Upton Sinclair, a well-known journalist and author, has sensationally won the Democratic nomination to be governor of California. Sinclair is now most remembered as the writer of industrial documentary novels such as <em>The Jungle</em>, set in the Chicago meat yards, and <em>Oil!,</em> which was adapted as the Oscar-winning movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a>. His most enduring legacy, though, has proved to be a quixotic bid for public office, which introduced two perversions \u2013 subsequently recurrent \u2013 of the political process. Sinclair\u2019s gubernatorial race was the beneficiary of one campaign innovation \u2013 the power of an anti-political candidate in times of crisis \u2013 and the victim of another: the use of negative media \u201cattack ads\u201d against an opponent. These tropes seem to have reached their apotheosis in the 2016 US presidential election.</p> <p>Ideologically, Sinclair most resembles Bernie Sanders. Both men were socialists who became Democrats for specific electoral purpose. However, in his takeover of a major party in a key campaign, Sinclair most spookily previews Donald Trump. Like Trump, he terrified the elders of his adopted affiliation and the media by being widely viewed as too peculiar to rule. Smeared as politically reckless (in his case, for \u201ccommunist\u201d views), Sinclair was attacked for his evangelical vegetarianism and tendency to speak from candour rather than calculation. The outsider\u2019s rise was seen as so threatening to the status quo that the incumbent Republican governor, Frank F Merriam, responded with a campaign that included the first recorded use of a hostile screen commercial, funded by Hollywood and screened in cinemas.</p> <p>Greg Mitchell\u2019s 1992 book about these events, <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, although historical, has tended to find topical resonance. It was first published in the election year in which an independent presidential candidate, Texas oilman H Ross Perot, became the most successful non-politician presidential candidate until Trump. In 2011, it was released for the first time as an ebook, because, as Mitchell acknowledged in a preface, he saw, in the Occupy Wall Street grassroots movement, parallels with EPIC, and wanted to offer Sinclair as both a warming and warning example to the new wave of progressive protestors.</p> <p>As it turned out, the 1934 template had less relevance to the 2012 presidential election, when an incumbent president received a handsome re-endorsement, than had seemed likely in the febrile atmosphere leading up to the vote. <em>The Campaign of the Century</em>, though, proves a useful handbook to the present political convulsions in America, although liberals will read it now looking for clues to how a feisty outsider can be stopped.</p> <p>What ultimately finished Sinclair was that the intervention of a strong third party candidate, Raymond L Haigh of the Progressive party, split the anti-establishment vote and allowed Merriam to be re-elected, helped by the media touting him as the sensible or at least safer option.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that, in November, either the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the ex-CIA agent Even McMullin, a last-minute anti-Trump runner, can do a Haigh for Hillary, spreading the resentment. The larger question, though, is which candidate will be left standing after the Trump and Clinton campaigns and their proxies have engaged Merriam-like negative tactics against each other.</p> <p>The American decision in 2016 sees the polarities of California 34 reversed \u2013 the maverick a regressive rightwinger, a Democrat running as the defender of sanity and capitalism \u2013 but the parallels are otherwise uncanny. Upton Sinclair, an unfairly neglected writer of political fiction, is a more lasting presence as a ghost in the political machine.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lawson\u2019s latest book is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/allegations.html\"><em>The Allegations</em></a> (Picador).</p> <h2><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc6f8cefd235b9add7ce48efa2c7ffa88949430/0_1482_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burkeman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burkeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long before Donald Trump started<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment\"> dropping hints about political assassination</a>s, death was a looming presence in his speeches.

The book\u2019s trio of authors \u2013 Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski \u2013 have spent many years running experiments in which participants are reminded of their inevitable fate (\u201cPlease briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\u201d, goes one typical mortality-reminder exercise) to see how it changes them. Their results endorse the hunch set forth with brilliance, but little scientific rigour, by Ernest Becker in his masterpiece <em>The Denial of Death</em>. Unable to accept the fact that our lives are finite, we seek symbolic immortality \u2013 often through child-rearing or creative work or devotion to great causes, but sometimes to demagogues instead.</p> <p>\u201cSensing a way to feel significant again,\u201d they write, \u201cpeople join the cause of the seemingly larger-than-life leader as a revitalised basis for self-worth and meaning in life.\u201d Whether he\u2019s conscious of it or not, Trump triggers the fear of death in his audiences, then presents them both with various specific \u201csolutions\u201d (a wall to keep out Mexicans, a ban to keep out Muslims) and one big implicit promise: merge symbolically with the wealthy, domineering Trump himself, and feel powerful again.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s popularity has been variously attributed to racism, misogyny and economic insecurity; but the authors show how all these only get their urgency from the unspoken, underlying fear of literal demise. And perhaps, in the end, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope in this. There\u2019s been a regrettable tendency among liberals to write off Trump supporters as utterly irredeemable \u2013 bigots we can never hope to understand, much less change.

All-American Dorothy and her charming sidekicks trip off to the dazzling Emerald City to seek help from the mighty wizard of Oz. The awesome eminence promises to give them everything they desire if they kill off his biggest (female) rival first. But when they return to claim their rewards, they discover that \u201cOz, the Great and Terrible\u201d is a cowering little ventriloquist from Omaha. \u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\u201d Dorothy exclaims.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Not a bit of it, my dear; I\u2019m just a common man.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re more than that,\u2019 said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \u2018you\u2019re a humbug.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since the 1960s it has been fashionable to read Oz as an allegory of turn of the century populism: the yellow brick road represents the gold standard, the Emerald City stands in for paper dollars, and so on.

But no issue has been more important to Trump\u2019s success than race. Trump has given vent to many white voters\u2019 fears and anxieties about the loss of racial privilege and status, and run the most avowedly ethnonationalist presidential campaign since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/civil-rights-anniversary-11-june-1963\">George Wallace</a>. And while many have argued that the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s racially coded appeals is tied to rising inequality and the economic woes of the working class voters who constitute Trump\u2019s base, it would be more accurate to say that Trump is tapping into a vein of working class racism that has been a part of American politics for a long time.</p> <p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stan-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>\u2019s <em>Middle Class Dreams </em>helps explain so much about Trump\u2019s rise. It was published in 1995, but much of it is based on Greenberg\u2019s work in Macomb County, Michigan, following the 1984 presidential election. Macomb was a nearly all white suburban county just outside of Detroit. It had been a solidly Democratic county in the 60s, giving sizeable majorities to both JFK and Lyndon Johnson. But in 1972 66% of Democratic voters in Macomb supported George Wallace in the Democratic primary, and in the general election Richard Nixon carried the county easily. In 1980 Macomb voted for Ronald Reagan, and in 1984 he took two-thirds of the vote. In other words, these working-class voters, who had once supported progressive candidates, had shifted decisively to the right.</p> <p>What Greenberg discovered in his many interviews with Macomb voters was that they felt that the Democratic party had abandoned them, that it had stopped paying attention to the concerns of working people and the striving middle class, and started paying too much attention to the concerns of black people and other minorities. The fundamental problem Macomb voters had with the Democrats was the party\u2019s embrace of civil rights in the 60s.</p> <p>What <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> demonstrates is just how important race, and racism, was in shaping many voters\u2019 political attitudes. As Greenberg puts it, \u201cthese white defectors from the Democratic party expressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics\u201d. More than that, \u201cnot being black was what constituted being middle class; not living with blacks was what made a neighbourhood a decent place to live\u201d. When the Democratic party started to take civil rights seriously and to embrace (however tepidly) antiracism, many white working class voters saw it as a betrayal.</p> <p>More than 40 years after Wallace, Trump is tapping into these same currents. The list of outsiders that many white voters fear the encroachment of is longer now: it includes Muslim and Latino immigrants as well as African Americans. But what <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> shows is that the conviction of Trump supporters that white Americans have been forgotten, and that the country is going to hell as a result, is not new. It\u2019s all too old.</p> <p>\u2022 James Surowiecki is author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wisdom-of-crowds.html\"><em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em></a> (Anchor).</p>",

If I achieved anything in terms of career, it was an accident.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer says he tries to avoid much of what being a high-profile conductor implies. \u201cAbout 90% of what a conductor represents are things I don\u2019t like. I just like a very small fraction of this profession, which is the music. The rest \u2013 the glamour, the power, the hierarchy, the routine of how to work with orchestras \u2013 is something I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. I never had a feeling that this was what I wanted to do. I bear it because I have to, but it\u2019s not something that attracts me. The last profession I would choose is conducting.\u201d</p> <p>We are meeting at Fischer\u2019s large, quiet house in a suburb of south-west Berlin. As well as being founder and music director of the <a href=\"http://www.bfz.hu/en/\">Budapest Festival Orchestra</a>, Fischer is now also music director of the <a href=\"https://www.konzerthaus.de/en/\">Konzerthaus</a> in Berlin. He has had one or two run-ins with Hungary\u2019s rightwing government recently, and living in Berlin with his wife and two sons gives him a bit of breathing space, though he remains utterly committed to his Budapest orchestra, which he will be bringing to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e6pn3d\">Proms on 26 August</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes when you go to a famous orchestra, you feel as if your only role is to be impressed by it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are in a sitting room filled with Fischer\u2019s scores. A Beethoven sonata is open on his piano; he likes to play whenever he can. Fischer keeps his jacket on throughout the interview \u2013 very Mitteleuropean, not grand in that old maestro-ish way but still quite formal. He is 65: getting on in life but less so in conducting. In the past decade he has returned to composition, writing eclectic works for voices and orchestra. He says he wishes he had made the decision to balance conducting and composing earlier in his career.</p> <p>\u201cI came back to composing very late,\u201d he explains. \u201cConducting sucked me in. I won a conducting competition when I was 25 [the Rupert Foundation competition in London in 1976], and there were offers, offers, offers. Of course it felt like an attractive thing, because I thought: \u2018Maybe the next concert will be very enjoyable.\u2019 But even then as a 25-year-old I was purely interested in the music, and not the profession itself. The role of imagining and developing a piece and training a group is attractive, but not putting on tails and going out there.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer does very little guest conducting these days, though he has maintained his relationships with Amsterdam\u2019s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic. He only wants to work with great orchestras, I suggest, but he questions the term \u201cgreat\u201d and the assumption that conductors will want to cultivate them. \u201cPeople assume that conductors love to wave their hands in front of great orchestras. I don\u2019t belong to that club. The so-called great orchestras \u2013 the old, great orchestras \u2013 like to preserve certain musical values such as their sound. They think: \u2018This is us, this is our trademark.\u2019 Now a conductor comes and he has limited influence on the so-called great orchestra. So they attract conductors who love to wave their hands while not changing anything. Sometimes when you go to famous orchestras, you feel as if you are working with a prima donna singer who has her sound, and your only role is to be impressed by it. I would much rather go to an orchestra that is receptive to my ideas because I can then create something.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ec8578bed924b1ea2c3c46ea345328bf81b3f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ec8578bed924b1ea2c3c46ea345328bf81b3f4/0_62_1406_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fischer campaigning in Budapest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fischer campaigning in Budapest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why carry on with, say, the Berlin Phil? \u201cI\u2019ve known them for over 20 years now.

You would never want to do it long term.\u201d</p> <p>Better to work with your own orchestra, and that is what he has done with the Budapest Festival Orchestra, which he co-founded with fellow Hungarian conductor Zolt\u00e1n Kocsis in 1983. \u201cI believe in long-term work,\u201d says Fischer. \u201cIt\u2019s like a psychoanalysis that lasts a few years compared with a one-time consultation with a patient. After 30 years something serious starts. We know each other inside out; we trust each other; there is a complete confidence.\u201d</p> <p>What Fischer wants to avoid above all is a sense of routine. \u201cWe work with intensity and in a very personal way. It is more like the way a string quartet works. I don\u2019t say to the principal cellist: \u2018Please a little softer.\u2019 I would say: \u2018Come on Peter, what the hell are you doing?\u2019 It\u2019s a different communication, much more personal. I immediately notice when their level of focus or concentration is not what it should be.

The \u20ac640,000 budget cut meant a reduction in the orchestra\u2019s outreach programme, which had sought to take music into schools and nursing homes. \u201cIv\u00e1n Fischer is beginning to lose his self-control,\u201d said Budapest\u2019s mayor, Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s, when the orchestra dared to protest about the budget cut.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gexnIbK-pJA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gexnIbK-pJA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Fischer and the BFO perform the first movement of Mahler\u2019s Symphony No 1</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cWe get most of our subsidy from the state,\u201d says Fischer, \u201cand that is unaffected.

One politician understands the value; another one doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer says the city never explained the reason for the sudden reduction in subsidy in the middle of the orchestra\u2019s season. \u201cEverybody can cut subsidies, it\u2019s their right to do that, but we also have the right to protest. We arranged a big public demonstration, and many people came into the streets of Budapest. It was a fantastic wave of sympathy, and we hope the mayor will change his mind because this is not the policy of the Hungarian government.\u201d</p> <p>Though Fischer dislikes the reactionary nature of Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government and the growth of antisemitism in the country, he nevertheless feels he can do business with them. Unlike pianist Andr\u00e1s Schiff, who has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25450716\">vowed not to return</a> to his native Hungary in the current illiberal climate, Fischer is trying to work for change from within. \u201cIt\u2019s a country where you can argue, discuss, raise your voice, have differences of opinion, and I will keep criticising things which I disagree with.\u201d</p> <p>Fischer is Jewish, and his political views are refracted through his family experience. His grandmother was killed in Auschwitz; his grandfather was beaten to death in Buchenwald; his parents had to hide out in Budapest for the duration of the war. \u201cDo we really want to go back to this nationalist past, where nations turned against each other and religions turned against each other?\u201d he asks. \u201cThis is the history of Europe, and the reason I believe in the integration of Europe, so that finally we become a family of nations who have peace with each other. That is more important than anything else.\u201d Music, he believes, can help bring that dream about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b22cec9844ab7afa4e68d8846846b8be57f44d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b22cec9844ab7afa4e68d8846846b8be57f44d97/0_871_3732_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e1s Schiff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pianist Andr\u00e1s Schiff has vowed not to return to Hungary in the current political climate.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the challenges of Hungary\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary\">illiberal democracy</a>\u201d (Orb\u00e1n\u2019s chilling phrase) and the fact Fischer prefers Berlin as a tolerant place in which to bring up his children and where he enjoys his job in the city, he anticipates working with his Budapest orchestra for the rest of his life. The orchestra he founded is his lifelong passion; he also sees it as a \u201claboratory\u201d for orchestras of the future, offering flexibility, openness and a group of players that he encourages to develop as portfolio musicians rather than spending their lives as fixtures with the orchestra.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are a member of the Budapest Festival Orchestra, the great thing is that you are allowed a much more versatile musician\u2019s life,\u201d he explains. He wants \u201cindividualists\u201d rather than \u201cobedient, uniform soldiers\u201d. \u201cFor the future of music, it is better to develop the symphony orchestra as a more flexible organisation that can embrace other musical styles. Now, we have a symphony orchestra that looks more or less like the one in Richard Strauss\u2019s time. It\u2019s already 100 years old. I don\u2019t really think it will stay the same 100 years from now. The idea of a symphony orchestra must develop over time or it will become a museum.\u201d</p> <p>He wants his ensemble to be able to play everything. \u201cThe conventional symphony orchestra leaves baroque repertoire to the period instrument orchestras and contemporary music to the specialised groups,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we encourage the individual interests of musicians, we have a period instrument part of the orchestra, we have a chorus, we have a group playing Transylvanian folk music, another group working on jazz improvisations.\u201d</p> <p>The aim is to keep both musicians and audience on their toes. He is known for his innovations: concerts where the audience chooses the pieces, which means they are played without rehearsal; encores in which the orchestra abandon their instruments and sing instead; operas where he does the staging himself (admittedly with mixed results). Every convention must be challenged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2015/sep/04/top-10-orchestra-conductor-bachtrack-list\">Today's top orchestra and conductor?

The hope of being with him no longer exists.\u201d</p> <p>The life and death of Luis G\u00f3ngora occurred at the intersection of twin crises: homelessness and police killings.

Los Angeles boasts Snapchat, and Skid Row.

His father, Demetrio, worked as an assistant for the local butcher, where he was paid in meat rather than cash. His mother, Estela, raised nine children in a one-room Mayan hut with a thatched palm roof and dirt floor. She rose at 5am each day to prepare the <em>k\u2019eyem</em> (corn flour mash, diluted in water) for the family to drink for breakfast.</p> <p>When the children were sick, there was no money for medicine, so Demetrio treated their ailments with traditional herbal medicines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His father, Demetrio, worked as an assistant for the local butcher, where he was paid in meat rather than cash</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps because of this poverty, Luis G\u00f3ngora would eat anything. He shot <em>loros</em> \u2013 small green and yellow parrots with just a few ounces of meat on them, if that \u2013 out of trees with a slingshot, and prepared them like poultry. If he came across a deer, he would try to shoot it and lug it home. The fat black iguanas that skulked among the rocks were good for a meal as well.</p> <p>When Luis G\u00f3ngora was just 12 years old, he left school and went to work. His younger brother, Jos\u00e9, followed a few years later. The pair were the youngest of the G\u00f3ngora siblings, and wherever Luis went, Jos\u00e9 followed. They did not like school, never learned to read, and were both more comfortable speaking Mayan than Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cWe dedicated ourselves to the fields,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora said.</p> <p>G\u00f3ngora met his future wife, Fidelia del Carmen, when they were 14.

Many men travel to Canc\u00fan, M\u00e9rida, or Chetumal six days a week \u2013 or for an entire tourist season \u2013 to earn money to support their families. But those who can put together the fee for a coyote \u2013 a guide paid to smuggle migrants across the border \u2013 usually go to San Francisco.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>The migration corridor between Yucat\u00e1n and San Francisco was established one border crossing at a time. As word of mouth and family connections grew, it turned into something of a migration highway in the early 2000s. There are estimated to be 50,000 Yucatecan migrants in the San Francisco Bay Area, 90% of them undocumented, 80% of them Mayan-speaking, and 70% of them male.</p> <p>Thousands of Yucatecos work in the kitchens of San Francisco\u2019s thriving restaurant scene, and the wages earned there are visible in the landscape of Yucatecan towns, where construction workers and modern houses are a sure sign of a relative in San Francisco.</p> <p>A few blocks from the central square of Oxkutzcab, a neighboring town to Teabo, a two-story structure featuring the iconic bay windows of San Francisco\u2019s Victorian townhouses rises above a dusty intersection.

Their mother pawned her gold earrings to pay the fee for a <em>coyote</em>, and Jos\u00e9 arrived in San Francisco on September 11. The first thing he saw was news footage of the Twin Towers falling.</p> <p>Assisted by a network of cousins already established in San Francisco, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora soon found work as a dishwasher and began sending money home.</p> <p>As Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora\u2019s wife, Julia, began to build her house, Luis G\u00f3ngora, whose family still lived in a Mayan hut in the land behind his parent\u2019s house, itched to join his brother. He sold a horse and a summer\u2019s harvest and left for San Francisco in September 2002.</p> <p>The 31-year-old migrant could be forgiven for having high expectations. Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s cousin and childhood friend, Luis Armando Poot Pat, had been living in San Francisco for 12 years, and his experience hewed closely to the American dream. After arriving in the US, Poot had found work at a restaurant as a janitor.</p> <p>Twenty-six<strong> </strong>years later, Poot is the manager at the same restaurant. His wife and children were able to join him in San Francisco. One of his sons is studying biochemical engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p> <p>When Poot ran across Luis G\u00f3ngora at the main intersection of the Mission district, a historically Latino neighborhood where the Yucatecos often cross paths, he was able to quickly set his cousin up with a job as a prep cook at Mel\u2019s Diner, a 1950s throwback restaurant where the milkshakes are thick and the staff wear white paper caps and bow ties.</p> <p>After bouncing around different buildings in the Mission for a few years, Luis and Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora settled in an apartment at 1751 Market Street, where they roomed with another man from Teabo, who they called El Torero.</p> <p>A non-descript apartment building upstairs from a popular piano bar, 1751 Market became known as San Francisco\u2019s most \u201c<a href=\"http://sf.curbed.com/2015/4/16/9969980/inside-the-nightmarish-infested-building-at-the-center-of-the-soma\">nightmarish</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"http://sfist.com/2015/04/17/this_may_be_san_franciscos_most_dis.php\">disgusting</a>\u201d apartment building when a group of tenants <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1875519-valencia-market-lawsuit.html\">sued</a> the landlords for $10m in 2014.

Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora found a job in the suburbs, doing landscaping work, and returned to the apartment infrequently.</p> <p>It was around this time, Castro said, that Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s  drinking and marijuana use transitioned into more serious drug abuse.

Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora says that he was still leaving money for rent, but he doesn\u2019t know if the money made its way to the landlord. Poot says that, once El Torero left town, the G\u00f3ngora brothers struggled to \u201cmanage the household\u201d since neither could read or speak English.</p> <p>Either way, in the fall of 2013, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora returned to the Market Street building to find his apartment locked and his belongings in the trash. He salvaged a bag with some photographs and personal items and was out on the street.</p> <p>Homelessness was a harrowing experience for both of the brothers, and the crisis forced them in different directions. Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora stayed with friends for a few days, and then found a room in a residential hotel for a week.</p> <p>\u201cFirst I lost my home, and then I lost my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI had this bag of stuff.

One day he went to the police station, hoping to turn himself in and get deported to Mexico. The police told him to go away, unless he wanted to be locked up.</p> <p>After two weeks of sleeping in a park, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora convinced his cousin Poot to take him in. It wasn\u2019t easy. Jos\u00e9 was skinny and unclean, but more than anything, Poot said, he was traumatized.</p> <p>Poot took over, imposing strict rules and caring for Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora until he recovered. Poot found him a new job, stopped him from drinking, and took control of his finances, sending all of his wages back to his family.</p> <p>\u201cJos\u00e9 has always been well-behaved. When they were kids, Luis was like the boss, the dad. Jos\u00e9 was the one following orders,\u201d Poot explained.</p> <p>Since 8 November 2013 \u2013 the day Poot accepted him into his house \u2013 Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora has not had a single beer or sip of alcohol.</p> <p>\u201cNo beer, no marijuana, only work,\u201d Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora jokes.</p> <p>Poot tried to arrange a similar rescue for Luis G\u00f3ngora, who was still on the streets, but with little success.</p> <p>\u201cLuis always wanted to make his own decisions,\u201d Poot said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If Luis had come knocking on my door instead of Jos\u00e9, maybe I would have helped him instead, but fate put Jos\u00e9 in my path.\u201d</p> <p>Poot\u2019s brother, Wilberto, tried to take Luis G\u00f3ngora in, but he didn\u2019t follow the rules of the house \u2013 not going out at night and ringing the doorbell, staying out of sight of the landlord \u2013 and it didn\u2019t work. Poot paid for Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s documents to be sent to San Francisco so he could send his cousin back to Mexico, but Luis lost the papers. Another relative took Luis G\u00f3ngora to live in San Jose, but again Luis returned to the streets.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to help him,\u201d Poot said. \u201cHe had no house, no money, no job, no papers \u2013 so many issues.\u201d</p> <p>The longer he was homeless, the worse Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mental state seemed to get.</p> <p>\u201cHe would be confused when he was talking to you. Sometimes he would be fine, and sometimes he would just be talking to himself on the street,\u201d Poot said.</p> <p>For a while, Luis slept on the sidewalk in front of the building where his brother and cousin lived in an apartment with Poot\u2019s wife and children.</p> <p>\u201cI was very sad, because I told him at some point, don\u2019t come knocking on the door because if the owner sees you, he might be given a reason to throw us out,\u201d Poot recalled.</p> <p>Despite his downward spiral in San Francisco, Luis G\u00f3ngora kept up appearances with his family in Teabo. He never told them that he was homeless. He didn\u2019t talk about himself.</p> <p>\u201cThe saddest part is that the family is learning now how he was living. Luis\u2019s mom asked me, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019\u201d Poot said. \u201cI never told them because I thought it would cause them sadness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf1d4329fa4bb829409273e1f77caeabf1464dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1d4329fa4bb829409273e1f77caeabf1464dc2/0_35_4232_2539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow stands with their daughter, two sons and grandchildren at their home in Teabo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow stands with their daughter, two sons and grandchildren at their home in Teabo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Gabaldon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora was at the laundromat on 7 April when he heard police sirens. He didn\u2019t think of it again until the next day, when he was at work. He had a bad feeling. He told his manager that he needed to leave early, that he needed to go look for his brother.</p> <p>When he arrived at the homeless encampment where Luis G\u00f3ngora had been living for the past few months, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3ngora asked for his brother\u2019s whereabouts by miming kicking a soccer ball. A homeless outreach worker from a neighborhood non-profit grabbed his arm and said, \u201cGet your strength.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us Mayans, once a person is dead, to honor them,\u201d Poot said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alive, you can defend yourself, but once you\u2019re dead, you have to honor them. In the Mayan culture, a deceased one is sacred.</p> <p>\u201cLuis is never going to die. As long as we remember him, he is going to live with us. We\u2019re always going to honor him.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>The broad details of G\u00f3ngora\u2019s death are made plain by security video provided to the Guardian by a neighbor who asked to remain anonymous because he feared police retaliation. The camera caught images of G\u00f3ngora in his final hours, the arrival of the police, and audio of the beanbag and live ammunition being fired.</p> <p>What is in dispute are the exact actions of the police and G\u00f3ngora during the final 30 seconds that led up to the shooting.</p> <p>G\u00f3ngora was sitting just out of the frame of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/12/luis-gongora-homeless-san-francisco-police-shooting-video\">the video footage</a>. The story of his killing can only be composed by the testimony of the police who killed him and the witnesses who saw it happen.</p> <p>The fatal encounter was set in motion when two homeless outreach workers went to the homeless encampment where Luis G\u00f3ngora lived, responding to a report that a baby was crying. The workers did not find a baby, but police say the outreach workers saw G\u00f3ngora \u201cswinging [a knife] indiscriminately as he walked down the street\u201d, prompting them to call the police.</p> <p>Former San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr told members of the public that G\u00f3ngora was \u201cseated on the sidewalk with a large knife and the blade pointed up\u201d when police officers arrived on the scene. (Suhr was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/19/san-francisco-police-greg-suhr-resigns-fatal-shooting-scandal\">fired</a> in May shortly after San Francisco police shot and killed an unarmed black woman in a car.)</p> <p>\u201cThey tried to shoot him in the arm to get him to drop the knife,\u201d Suhr told reporters when asked why police officers deployed beanbag rounds at a seated man.</p> <p>The San Francisco police department alleged that, after being struck by the beanbag rounds, G\u00f3ngora stood up and \u201ccharged\u201d, \u201clunged\u201d or \u201cran at\u201d at the officers with the knife, prompting them to fire in self-defense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to know if before I die there will be justice for Luis</p> <footer> <cite>Estala, mother of Luis G\u00f3ngora</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Guardian has interviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/witness-san-francisco-police-shooting-homeless-man-luis-gongora\">six eyewitnesses</a> to the shooting. They include three homeless residents of the encampment who were standing on the sidewalk about 20 yards from the shooting, two residents of apartments overlooking the street, and one pedestrian who was on the sidewalk opposite to the incident.

A civil rights attorney representing G\u00f3ngora\u2019s widow and children has filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, a precursor to a civil lawsuit for wrongful death and excessive force.</p> <p>\u201cBased on multiple eyewitness accounts that are part of our preliminary investigation, Luis G\u00f3ngora lunged at one of our officers with a large knife,\u201d a spokesman for the city attorney said in response to the lawsuit. \u201cG\u00f3ngora posed an immediate and deadly threat, and our officers\u2019 use of lethal force was necessary and legally justified.\u201d</p> <p>The legal process is likely to take years, a fact that is difficult for G\u00f3ngora\u2019s family in Teabo to accept.</p> <p> G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mother, Estala, cried as she sat in a hammock in her house in Teabo. As the 87-year-old woman broke into tears, no one reached out to touch her or comfort her. Instead, her daughter-in-law and granddaughter grabbed pillows and began to fan her with cool air from behind.</p> <p>\u201cI want to know,\u201d she said, \u201cif before I die there will be justice for Luis.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>In the living room of Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s house, Maria Guadalupe Cruz sat in a chair before a shrine to her brother-in-law Luis, leading a roomful of women in <em>el rezar</em> \u2013 the prayer.</p> <p>It was 7 July, the morning after police in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> during a traffic stop and two days after police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alton-sterling-shooting\">Alton Sterling</a> while he was selling CDs.</p> <p>The deaths of those two men made international headlines, sent protesters into the streets across the US, and drew the attention of Barack Obama, but here in Teabo, 7 July was the three month anniversary of a tragedy that continues to play out on a smaller stage, in the living room of the house that the homeless man built.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Cuando te rezo, puedo comprender que una madre no se cansa de esperar,</em>\u201d Cruz sang. \u201cWhen I pray to you, I understand that a mother does not get tired of waiting.\u201d</p> <p>Teabo is a woman\u2019s town, and a town where the women have grown accustomed to waiting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ce47edc0f984bd5048214c775c24260c5845cf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ce47edc0f984bd5048214c775c24260c5845cf5/0_248_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mother, Estela, sits at the entrance to the traditional Mayan house where her son and his wife lived when they were first married.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis G\u00f3ngora\u2019s mother, Estela, sits at the entrance to the traditional Mayan house where her son and his wife lived when they were first married.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Gabaldon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They wait for their husbands, fathers, and sons to come home from the places they go to find work: the <em>ejido</em>, the big cities of Yucat\u00e1n, or San Francisco.</p> <p>Luis G\u00f3ngora left Teabo almost 14 years ago.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s construction industry has slipped back into recession for the first time in four years, according to official figures that show the sector was struggling even before the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>Experts say the drop in business and consumer confidence since the referendum will further dent construction activity in the months ahead. The Office for National Statistics said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/constructionoutputingreatbritainjune2016andaprtojune2016\">output dipped 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016</a>, following a drop of 0.3% in the previous three months. It is the first time there have been <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/datasets/outputintheconstructionindustryallworksummary\">two consecutive quarters of falling output</a> \u2013 a technical recession \u2013 since 2012, when the eurozone debt crisis shook confidence across Europe.</p> <p>The ONS said its latest figures included a short period after the 23 June referendum, but noted that there was \u201cvery little anecdotal evidence at present to suggest that the referendum has had an impact on output.\u201d</p> <p>For June alone, construction output was down 0.9%, broadly in line with forecasts for a 1.0% drop.<br></p> <p>Economists put the industry\u2019s troubles down to government spending cuts and a blow to private sector investment plans from the referendum. A recent business survey by the data group Markit suggested pressure had intensified after the referendum. The PMI report signalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/02/uk-construction-sector-activity-falls-further-in-july-pmi\">the sharpest contraction since mid-2009</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/uk-growth-will-slow-down-markedly-despite-upbeat-gdp-figures\">UK growth will slow down markedly, despite upbeat GDP figures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Commenting on the latest news from the sector, Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cJune\u2019s official data confirm that the construction sector re-entered recession in the first half of this year, as public sector cuts and Brexit risk took their toll.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe downturn looks set to deepen in the third quarter. July\u2019s construction PMI broadly is consistent with output falling by about 3.5% quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, Brexit negotiations will be protracted, so businesses will hold off committing to major capital expenditure for a long time to come.\u201d</p> <p>When the ONS published figures last month showing a relatively strong GDP growth of 0.6% in the second quarter, it had estimated a more modest fall in construction output of 0.4%. The higher figure of 0.7% will, however, have no discernible impact on the GDP figures given that construction only accounts for about 6% of the UK economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/status/764016514135490560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Apr-Jun <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/construction?src=hash\">#construction</a> -0.7% on the quarter, too small a revision to impact GDP on its own <a href=\"https://t.co/VWCH6AeII4\">https://t.co/VWCH6AeII4</a></p>&mdash; ONS (@ONS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/status/764016514135490560\">August 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The fact that the figures show the sector was already in recession before the referendum result will still fan fears for construction jobs.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\">National Housing Federation</a> said signs of a post-referendum slowdown should prompt the government to do more to support housebuilding. The group, which represents non-profit housing associations, said a slowdown in housebuilding similar to that of the 2008 recession would result in the loss of nearly 120,000 construction jobs over the next decade.</p> <p>The federation\u2019s chief executive, David Orr, said: \u201cWe know that an uncertain economic environment will cause builders to put the brakes on. Our country\u2019s prosperity and thousands of citizens\u2019 livelihoods depend on a strong building sector. We cannot let a slowdown take hold.</p> <p>\u201cHousing associations have a track record of building through tough times, having upped their output through the last recession when private developers could not. With the right flexibility from government, and at no extra cost to the taxpayer, housing associations can keep the nation building.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the elephant conservation hub. Over the next year, with the support of <a href=\"http://www.vulcan.com/\">Vulcan</a>, Guardian journalists will be taking a closer look at the situation of elephant herds around the world.</p> <p>Elephant conservation has been a particular focus for Vulcan, a private company set up by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to look for solutions to problems like endangered species, climate change and ocean health. The future of this particular species is precariously balanced. Although in some areas (a very few) elephant herds are expanding and thriving, the overall picture is one of decline, with falls of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/tanzania-epicentre-of-elephant-poaching-census-reveals\">as much as 60%</a> in elephant population in countries such as Tanzania. </p> <p>With your help, we want to probe some of the different factors that have led us here.

How can we conserve that future? What really works? What happens if you pull away a \u2018keystone species\u2019?</p> <p>We\u2019ll also be looking into the modern ivory trade. Who are the criminals behind these international networks? Where does the ivory go (not always where you\u2019d think) and how does it get there? We\u2019ll dig into the economics of different policy approaches, the people who make the big decisions, and the countries who have managed to change their ivory culture and cut demand.</p> <p>Finally we\u2019ll be talking to the people on the frontline in Africa, Asia and Europe; the rangers and investigators and campaigners, some of whom risk their lives regularly to protect <em>Loxodonta africana </em>and <em>Elephas maximus</em>. An inspiring network of conservationists from China, Africa, the US is at work on behalf of elephants, and other species, and is growing in strength and power.

However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/24/only-complacency-can-stop-nigeria-and-africa-from-finally-conquering-polio\">the global fight to eradicate the disease</a> suffered a blow when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37054682\">two new cases were found in Nigeria</a>.</p> <p>Globally, hundreds of thousands of children used to become paralysed as a result of polio every year, before vaccines were developed in the 1950s and 1960s. While it was almost eliminated in rich countries, the problem endured in poorer states. The <a href=\"http://www.polioeradication.org/\">Global Polio Eradication Initiative</a>, set up in 1988 by Rotary International, the World Health Organisation (WHO), Unicef and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has now almost managed to eradicate the disease.</p> <p>When Nigeria marked two years without any new cases last month, Afghanistan and Pakistan were thought to be the last countries in the world left where polio is endemic. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/24/only-complacency-can-stop-nigeria-and-africa-from-finally-conquering-polio\">Nigeria\u2019s celebrations</a> were premature. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/nigeria-polio/en/\">WHO said</a> the strain of polio discovered there is most closely linked to one last seen in Borno in 2011. The two children have become paralysed.</p> <p>Nigeria\u2019s minister of health, Isaac Adewole, put the latest occurrence down to the \u201cinsurgents\u2019 eclipse\u201d, referring to the fact that the terrorist group Boko Haram controlled large swathes of territory in Borno state, where the polio cases were found.

This means that here in Piedmont there will be no outreach programmes. Any victim of trafficking who wants to escape will have to go on their own to their police to denounce their exploiters, there will be nobody to help them through this process.\u201d</p> <p>Penelope, an anti-trafficking organisation in Messina, Sicily, has also been informed of an immediate and total funding cut, said Cettina Restuccia, a coordinator with the NGO.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing more and more young Nigerian teenagers arriving [on the migrant boats].

The decision to end funding to NGOs in eastern Sicily was put down to concerns over the quality of the services provided, but the department expressed confidence that the grant given to Ragusa would cover services across the island.</p> <p><br></p> <p> </p>",
  "<p><strong>I was born in Durham, one of four children</strong> \u2013 first boy, second child. We lived in the middle of a valley next to a huge dairy where my father worked as an engineer. My father, John, was 33 and my mother, Elizabeth, was 20 when they got married. My dad\u2019s sister was a headmistress and had actually taught my mother. My father\u2019s family somewhat disowned him because my mother came from a mining family and her father was a coal cutter. Growing up, I saw my mother\u2019s family all the time but I don\u2019t think I saw a Horn once for 15 years.</p> <p><strong>My parents were horrified I wanted to go into music</strong>, even though my father was in a band and played five nights a week. They wanted me to train as a chartered accountant because I was good at maths. But I flunked my exams and kept getting sacked. I had an epiphany at 17 that I needed to become a musician and I woke my parents up at 4am to tell them. They pleaded with me to get one more job, which I did, and when I was fired, I was lucky to get a job playing bass in a band. I went from earning \u00a310 a week for working 40 hours to earning \u00a324 a week working five nights.</p> <p><strong>Just before </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs\"><strong>Video Killed the Radio Star</strong></a><strong> </strong>became a huge hit in 1979, my parents did a whole number on me saying I should train as a teacher because I was nearly 30 and had got nowhere.

We hit this landmark earlier and earlier every year, and a big part of that \u2013 60% \u2013 involves the carbon emissions driving global warming. Indeed, any idea of the UK being a world leader on climate action is sharply dispelled by the government\u2019s own latest figures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/uks-carbon-footprint-rises-3\" title=\"\">quietly released a few days ago</a>.

Almost unimaginably for the Conservative party of recent years, there\u2019s even a new department enshrining that aim in its name, alongside business and energy.</p> <p>The necessity for the UK to make a rapid environmental transition now coincides with the means; justification \u2013 given the need for an economic stimulus; and the potential political impetus to achieve it. Yet, the dots are still not being connected. Industrial strategy suggests having a long-term vision to avoid risk and grasp opportunity. It means creating jobs, rebalancing the economy away from its over-dependence on finance, and taking practical steps to begin today making the shift to zero carbon implied by the ambition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\" title=\"\">Paris climate accord</a>. According to the <a href=\"http://tyndall.ac.uk/people/kevin-anderson\" title=\"\">climate scientist professor Kevin Anderson</a>, it requires immediate, significant reductions in energy demand, <a href=\"http://kevinanderson.info/blog/the-hidden-agenda-how-veiled-techno-utopias-shore-up-the-paris-agreement/\" title=\"\">\u201ccomplemented with a Marshall-style transition to zero-carbon energy supply\u201d</a>.</p> <p>So far however, the only detail on the UK\u2019s industrial strategy is that it will be \u201cproper\u201d, and focus mantra-like on productivity (fewer people producing more things), and growth (a generalised increase in consumption). Not only will such a simplistic approach not solve the real world problems we face, it could make them worse. If May\u2019s government heads for its comfort zone and what has previously passed for industrial policy, instead of focusing on rapidly emerging sectors such as renewable energy, where costs are falling and the ratio of jobs per pound invested is high, it is likely that it will veer towards energy-intensive, export sectors such as aviation and the motor industry, where there is a history of government subsidy and support.</p> <p>That would be a mistake. Transport emissions in Europe have been rising. Expansion in these areas is incompatible with preventing catastrophic climate change and, indeed, public health and a convivial environment. And, there are other, bigger, better opportunities.</p> <p>Renewable energy is doing well. More renewable energy capacity is added to global power supplies annually now than from all fossil fuels combined. But inconsistent policy has destabilised the UK industry, putting firms out of business.

The Lensbury club was formerly a staff club for Shell employees, and is now run by the company as a leisure facility.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/22/shell-blocking-hydro-dam-project-on-thames-teddington-lock\">The club appealed against the granting of planning permission in May</a> after its proposed judicial review of the project was <a href=\"http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/14471296.High_Court_dismisses_judicial_review_into_Ham_Hydro_scheme_by_Lensbury_Club/\">rejected by the high court</a>. </p> <p>Judges ruled on Wednesday that the club\u2019s appeal can be allowed, despite the council having previously granted permission for the plant to go ahead, because of flaws in the reasoning behind the planning green light.</p> <p>The dispute raises questions over the future of small cooperative renewable energy projects in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/06/solar-farm-in-balcombe-fracking-village-shelved-due-to-tory-policies\">which have already suffered from changes to rules in taxation and planning permission</a>.</p> <p>The Thames has long been a focus for renewable energy proponents, who argue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/25/hydropower-turbine-river-thames\">small hydroelectricity projects along the river</a> could present a valuable form of renewable electricity, without harm to river ecosystems.</p> <p>Shell said that a scheme harnessing hydropower in the local area could still go ahead, and the company and club would support such efforts, but it would require modification from the original proposal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/hydro_teddington/giv-12515YHn5IkE1SPS4/\" data-alt=\"Map of the scheme\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/hydro_teddington/giv-12515YHn5IkE1SPS4/\">Map of the scheme</a> </figure>  <p>A Shell spokesman said: \u201cBoth Lensbury and Shell strongly support the principle of a hydroelectric power scheme at Teddington Weir, providing any such scheme properly addresses environmental and noise issues, flood risk during construction and impact on conservation areas.\u201d</p> <p>The company argued that the proposed scheme did not meet the required standards for planning applications of this type. The appeal court judges agreed.</p> <p>\u201cWe fully support Lensbury\u2019s desire to work with relevant bodies to agree a mutually acceptable way forward for the hydro development,\u201d the Shell spokesman said.</p> <p>It is still possible for the cooperative and Richmond council to take the case to the supreme court, but that would involve significant costs.

  "<p>Nationwide Building Society is offering solace to savers by protecting some customers from the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut, but admitted its profits could fall in the months ahead.</p> <p>Joe Garner, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s biggest building society, said the decision to hold deposit rates would only help those with regular savings products, who make up a small proportion of its overall customer base.</p> <p>He said, however: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a generation coming through thinking there is no point saving.\u201d</p> <p>Garner said customers who do not use its regular savings products will take a cut, but not any more than the quarter point imposed by the Bank. Letters to customers state that it will not, at this point, cut rates below 0.1%.</p> <p>\u201cIt is too early to say exactly what will happen in future, but the society has said that it has no plans to introduce negative interest rates for either personal or commercial customers,\u201d Nationwide said.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">to cut rates by a quarter of a point to 0.25%</a> came with a warning from its governor, Mark Carney, that lenders had no excuse not pass the reduction on to borrowers, but it has sparked concern for savers.</p> <p>Nationwide\u2019s announcement, which came as it revealed a 6% rise in first-quarter profits to \u00a3401m, means that Lloyds Banking Group is the last major lender yet to say how it will respond to Carney. </p> <p>Lloyds, which is 9% owned by the taxpayer, is the largest mortgage lender in the UK and also the biggest savings institution.</p> <p>Nationwide announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/lenders-svr-urged-pass-on-interest-rate-cut-bank-of-england\">that its mortgage rates would fall in line with the 0.25% reduction</a> shortly after the Bank moved rates for the first time in seven years on 4 August. About \u00a340bn of its \u00a3120bn mortgage book is for customers who are on a base mortgage rate, pegged at 2% above the Bank\u2019s rate.</p> <p>Nationwide was an active mortgage lender in the three months to the end of June, taking a 52.8% share of new loans. The Swindon-based society said, however, it expected a slowdown in the buy-to-let market, which accounted for 22% of its lending last year, for the rest of 2016.</p> <p>Like many banks and building societies trying to keep a balance between interest paid to savers and the rate that can be charged to borrowers, Nationwide\u2019s margin fell to 1.35% from 1.61%. Mark Rennison, its finance director, said that while this was toward the bottom of its expectations it was higher than the 0.8% margin that the society operated on during the banking crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe sustained low interest rate environment and competition in core markets will maintain pressure on margins and we anticipate profits are likely to moderate in the period ahead,\u201d the society said. Last year it made profits of \u00a31.3bn.</p> <p>Garner joined Nationwide in the spring when he replaced Graham Beale, who took the helm just before the 2008 banking crisis.

The fact of the matter is that we know pitifully little about the environmental and working conditions of faceless people in faraway places who grow fruit for our tables, but I have seen enough of foreign fruit \u201cfarms\u201d to suspect the worst.

As Banana Link, the group that raises awareness of conditions in the global food industry, <a href=\"http://www.bananalink.org.uk/sitrabi-guatemala\" title=\"\">has documented</a>, Guatemala is the most dangerous.

When you buy a non-Fairtrade organic avocado, you can assume that neither workers nor the environment had to bear the omnipresent health and environmental burden of repeated pesticide spraying. Isolated from Fairtrade, organic standards in themselves do not guarantee a living wage, let alone freedom from company harassment for anyone who raises that topic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/vegan-corrupt-food-system-meat-dairy\">I\u2019ve converted to veganism to reduce my impact on the living world | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nutritionally speaking, what\u2019s an avocado got that you can\u2019t get elsewhere anyway?

  "<p>The former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham has accused wildlife presenter Chris Packham of being an extremist and using his position at the BBC to promote his views on restricting grouse shooting.</p> <p>The pair clashed in a joint interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on the opening day of the grouse-shooting season, \u2013 or the \u201cinglorious twelfth\u201d as Packham called it.</p> <p>Botham, who is a keen shooter and the figurehead for You Forgot the Birds \u2013 an organisation that represents the views of the shooting industry and has attacked the RSPB \u2013 said that grouse shooting promoted stewardship of the environment. \u201cIt\u2019s the gamekeepers who look after the moors,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s only people like Chris that want to sabotage nature by banning success.\u201d</p> <p>But Packham countered that raising grouse by excluding predators from the moors was detrimental to the environment. \u201cGrouse moors are extraordinarily ecologically damaged,\u201d he said, adding that burning and draining the moors also had a big impact. </p> <p>\u201cOur campaign is evidentially based and scientifically based,\u201d said the Springwatch presenter and vice-president of the RSPB. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the removal of our birds of prey. What\u2019s controversial about asking for the law to be upheld?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeefy\u2019s batting on a sticky wicket,\u201d he added.</p> <p>He said there was ample evidence that rare birds of prey were being deliberately killed on grouse moors by gamekeepers in order to keep grouse numbers high. He said eight golden eagles that were electronically tagged had gone missing over grouse moors last year and that there were only three breeding pairs of hen harriers in England. There should be 300, he said.</p> <p>Botham said that there had been no prosecutions for killing birds of prey last year but Packham argued it was extremely difficult to gather evidence and secure convictions on the \u201cdark satanic moors\u201d.</p> <p>The grouse-shooting season lasts from 12 August to 10 December and grouse moors cover 1.5m hectares in the UK, <a href=\"https://basc.org.uk/game-and-gamekeeping/game-shooting-2/grouse-shooting/\">according to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation</a>. The industry <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/grouse-shooting-economics/\">employs 1,500 people full time</a> in England.</p> <p>Countryside groups and the government say grouse shooting is a legitimate activity that brings significant benefits to the rural economy, and that management by gamekeepers helps other moorland bird species. They say that as well as protecting grouse, keeping fox numbers low allows birds such as lapwings, curlews and golden plovers to thrive.</p> <p>Packham was the subject of a complaint after describing those involved in hunting and shooting as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/01/chris-packham-slams-shameful-silence-of-britains-conservation-charities\">\u201cthe nasty brigade\u201d</a> in a magazine article. A BBC Trust spokesperson said: \u201cOur editorial standards committee has discussed this complaint. We\u2019re expecting to publish [the response] in September.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Updated at 1pm with new material:</strong> </p> <p>Mail Online has gone into partnership with The People\u2019s Daily, the official organ of the Chinese communist party.</p> <p>An article about an embarrassing Chinese hospital mistake was published on the Mail group\u2019s Australian website with the tag, \u201cThis story was produced in partnership with The People\u2019s Daily - <a href=\"http://people.cn/\">people.cn</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The point of the story was obvious from the lengthy headline, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3734873/Father-waiting-hospital-accidentally-undergoes-haemorrhoid-operation-wife-gives-birth-mix-Chinese-doctors.html\">\u201cFather-to-be waiting in hospital accidentally undergoes a haemorrhoid operation while his wife gives birth after mix-up by Chinese doctors\u201d</a>.</p> <p>It concerned an incident at Shenyang Hunnan Xinqu hospital, which was originally reported on The People\u2019s Daily website, <a href=\"http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0812/c90000-9098972.html\">\u201cMan was mistaken for patient and \u2018accidentally\u2019 had hemorrhoid surgery while waiting outside for his newborn baby\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Evidently, although no-one seems to have previously noticed, the partnership goes back more than a year. Mail Online\u2019s editorial chief, Martin Clarke, explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically a copy-swap. We take about 40 stories a week from The People\u2019s Daily and they can take a similar number from us. There is no cash involved.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>So how did the partnership between a capitalist media group renowned for its advocacy of press freedom and a newspaper in a communist country renowned for censorship come about?</p> <p>Is the Mail is embarrassed by having forged a link that would seems to be something of a propaganda coup for China? Does it not compromise the Mail\u2019s integrity?</p> <p>Clarke said: \u201cAs the most populous nation on earth, and one of its most dynamic economies, China is an increasing source of stories for outward-looking global publishers like Mail Online. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe this relationship broadens our coverage there and also helps us better understand the country\u2019s social and political structures.\u201d</p> <p>I noted that the partnership was selective. A Mail Online story about <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3735517/Rio-Olympic-2016-Chinese-women-s-swimmer-Chen-Xinyi-18-tested-positive-drugs.html\">a Chinese swimmer being tested positive for drugs</a>, also using a Daily Mail Australia byline, did not carry the reference to The People\u2019s Daily. It is just the kind of story that would fall foul of Chinese censors.</p> <p>Clarke said: \u201cWe are not limited to using The People\u2019s Daily as a source for Chinese coverage, nor does it compromise Mail Online\u2019s independence (nor that of our papers).<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we do use People\u2019s Daily copy, it is clearly marked. The stories are selected and translated by a Mandarin-speaking MOL staffer working to our foreign desk.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have always found The People\u2019s Daily staff to be extremely good partners and look forward to continuing this relationship in the longer term.\u201d<br></p> <p>He argues that the partnership should be seen \u201cin the context of the British (and every other western) government\u2019s official policy to foster closer cultural and trade ties with China.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThis modest arrangement does not seem remotely odd, merely sensible.\u201d</p>",

A glance through the literature of organisations dedicated to saving elephants gives a clear idea of why people care about elephants. We find their size impressive; their improbable shape and sometimes comical behaviour endear them to children; their matriarchal society and cognitive capacity fascinate us; their ability to suffer and show compassion strikes an empathic chord in us; and they are high on the list of \u201cmust-see\u201d animals on wildlife-watching holidays in Africa and Asia, so they bring in tourist revenues.</p> <p>All these reasons are perfectly valid, if largely anthropocentric, but they do rather miss the point of what elephants are for, ecologically speaking. The role they evolved to play in the forest-savannah mosaic that covered Africa and Asia is not just of academic interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"176980ef3f9281be990ca4c8c322c9141839e31d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/176980ef3f9281be990ca4c8c322c9141839e31d/0_0_2794_4021/695.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Redmond is investigated by elephant orphans\" width=\"695\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The fact is that to stabilise the climate, we need elephants.\u2019 Ian Redmond is investigated by orphaned elephants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Redmond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fly across parts of Africa and Asia, and rainforests stretch to the horizon like a carpet of broccoli. The bumps on this broccoli are the emergent trees, rising above the surrounding canopy on massive trunks, the base of which would require several people hand-in-hand with arms outstretched to encircle. How did these centuries-old rainforest giants get there? Five or six hundred years ago, maybe a thousand in some cases, an ecological event took place: a monkey, bird or elephant ate some fruit, chewed and swallowed the seeds, then deposited them far from the parent plant in their droppings \u2013 in effect, nutrient-rich packets of fertiliser \u2013 which dung beetles then buried. In tropical forests, between 75% and 95% of tree species have seeds dispersed by animals, rather than by wind or water.</p> <p>Until recently, tropical forest trees were valued economically by the outside world only for their beautiful hardwood timber. Enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, however, is a new economic value \u2013 the sequestration and storage of gigatonnes of carbon. The inclusion of forest carbon in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate negotiations has been slow and complicated because of the tricky question of permanence. A forest can be here today and felled or burned tomorrow, so how can we guarantee the same storage of carbon per unit area long into the future? The answer is think of forests not as \u201csticks of carbon\u201d but as forest ecosystems, comprised of thousands of interdependent species of plants, animals, fungi and micro-organisms. And carbon sequestration and storage is only one of several ecosystem services these forests and woodlands provide.</p> <p>Elephants, because of their size, appetite and migratory habits, disperse more seeds of more species further than any other animal. Tree species with small seeds such as figs can have them dispersed by birds, fruit bats, antelope, etc. Species with large seeds, such as mangoes and durian, need big animals such as apes and elephants to disperse them, sowing the seeds of the trees of tomorrow. Their dung is important, too, as fertiliser. An adult elephant produces about one tonne of first-class organic manure every week. Germination and seedling survival are much higher for seeds given such a good start in life. This is why ecologists refer to elephants as mega-gardeners of the forest \u2013 though elephants play this role in <a href=\"http://www.wildlifesafari.info/savanna_woodland_habitat.htm\" title=\"\">savannah-woodlands</a> too, spreading acacia seeds far and wide (and in so doing, protecting the seeds from weevils that concentrate around the parent tree).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/uk-domestic-ivory-trade-african-elephants-face-extinction\">Britain is hastening the extinction of the African elephant | Jonathan Baillie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The current wave of ivory poaching is killing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/29/kenya-to-burn-biggest-ever-stockpile-of-ivory\" title=\"\">some 30,000 African elephants a year</a>. This is a tragic loss to the surviving members of each elephant\u2019s family, and to the potential revenues from tourism, but think of the ecological impact. Think of the loss of soil fertility of 30,000 fewer tonnes of manure a week and millions of seeds not dispersed. Consider this in a broader timescale: before the advent of modern firearms, it is thought there were some 10m elephants across Africa. Even the most optimistic estimates today put the figure at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/uk-domestic-ivory-trade-african-elephants-face-extinction\" title=\"\">under half a million</a>. We have already lost 95% of the workforce of the forest and savannah. This is why the vast majority of the countries with natural elephant populations are calling for an end to the ivory trade everywhere. As long as ivory is coveted and sold anywhere, elephants are not safe. You cannot protect an animal with a fortune on its face, especially in a continent awash with guns and poverty.</p> <p>There is one more twist to the carbon story relevant to elephants. Botanists have reported a correlation between seed size and wood density. Tree species with big seeds, it turns out, store more carbon per unit volume of wood than tree species with small seeds. Thus, to maintain the high rates of carbon storage in Africa\u2019s and Asia\u2019s tropical forests, elephants are essential \u2013 not just in small, fenced protected areas but across what is left of their former range.</p> <p>The fact is that to stabilise the climate, we need elephants (and other <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GardenersoftheForest\" title=\"\">\u201cgardeners of the forest\u201d</a>) to keep doing what they do as much as they need us to leave them alone.</p>",

These are good, though not game-changing numbers. Industry wisdom suggests readers share positive stories more readily, and that has certainly been the case with some \u2013 though not all \u2013 of our pieces. Readers and members have also suggested dozens of ideas for us to pursue, from community efforts to tackle mental health to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/modern-life-rubbish-helping-mumbai-clean-up-beach-india-city\">global moves to pick up litter</a>. </p> <p>We should stress this is not about \u201cgood news\u201d. Constructive journalism aims to focus on innovation, initiative and inspiring people trying to make a difference. It can be found in the darkest tragedies \u2013 the hero reconnecting families after the earthquake, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/whats-in-it-for-them-the-volunteers-saving-europes-refugees\">volunteers reaching out to refugees</a> at their time of need. Sometimes it can focus on controversial things: initiatives to introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/state-handouts-for-all-europe-set-to-pilot-universal-basic-incomes\">a universal basic income</a>, for example, or an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/homeless-shelter-ottawa-gives-wine-to-alcoholics\">alcohol rehab programme</a> that offers addicts ... alcohol. </p> <p>I must admit, not everyone at the Guardian thought Half full was a good idea. We had a lively exchange of views before taking the plunge. Several people warned it might create an open door for PR spinmeisters and puff merchants to peddle their saccharine message about products, services or aimless publicity antics. We would have to be astute to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/23/churnalism-pr-media-trust\">avoid becoming just another channel for churnalism</a>.<br></p> <p>But the events of this summer have convinced me that neglecting the constructive stories carries its own dangers. Because the British media failed for 20 years to show the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/reciprocal-benefits/\">constructive, positive achievements of the EU</a>, it was all too easy for detractors to dominate the game, contributing to the Brexit referendum vote on 23 June. </p> <p>The same is true of global conflict. Because the \u201conly story in town\u201d in Jerusalem involves the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, we have become accustomed to reading about never-ending confrontation and violence. It has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Media reflects society, but also shapes it. Yet when we asked a journalist in the region to find examples of Israelis, Palestinians and Israeli Arabs working side by side, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/11/israel-jews-arabs-palestinians-work-together-peace\">we were spoiled for choice</a>. Conflict is only half the story.</p> <p>That\u2019s certainly the case with Africa. Stories of corruption, brutality and bad governance have become a lazy trope, rotating on a wretched merry-go-round of doom, confirming all our worst prejudices. Of course, serious news events like those that beset South Sudan and Central African Republic belong at the heart of our coverage. But we need to fight the stereotype that every African is a victim, a migrant or desperate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/code-club-senegal-where-women-lead-the-way\">because clearly they are not</a>. </p> <p>In my view, it\u2019s critical that we cover the Europe refugee crisis with the same approach. It is clear that in the months ahead there may well be more attacks on civilians. The clamour to search for the refugee connection will be great (even though virtually none of this summer\u2019s terrorist attacks were perpetrated by recent arrivals in Europe). We have to show that most refugees bring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/from-the-cold-war-to-syria-seven-decades-of-refugee-stories-in-britain\">far more benefits than drawbacks</a>. Of course, a few will be bad people. But if we don\u2019t focus on the good as well, we risk contributing to some people\u2019s assumption that refugees are a threat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Constructive journalism is a way to keep audiences tuning in, curious, and ready to take the good with the bad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is also the case that some of these violent attacks will be perpetrated by people with mental illness. We have to fight generalisations here too: the vast majority of people with mental illness are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/14/truth-about-depression\">capable, gentle individuals</a> requiring our support, not our opprobrium. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/from-ketamine-to-cupboard-therapy-the-future-of-mental-health-treatment\">There are solutions out there for them too</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a feedback loop at play here too. Increased coverage of positive news stories can also benefit the mental health of the audience, as Southampton Business School\u2019s <a href=\"http://theconversation.com%20[http//theconversation.com/shock-horror-behind-the-ethics-and-evolution-of-the-bad-news-business-39211\">Denise Baden writes</a>. \u201cOur brains are not adapted to process the whole of the world\u2019s horrors, selected and framed to present the most shocking and horrifying picture of the world. It is no wonder then that many try to turn off and those that do engage with it experience anxiety, worry and depression.\u201d</p> <p>Baden\u2019s research and the results of more than 2,000 responses to her surveys, suggest that the negative presentation of news leads to \u201cdisengagement, avoidance, negative mood and anxiety\u201d.

In the bronze medal match, there was also disappointment for the southern hemisphere as France saw off Australia to take bronze.</p> <p>Led off by Philip Hindes, the British trio were behind until the penultimate time split following a sensational opening lap by New Zealand\u2019s Ethan Mitchell.

The tall order of bringing home a third consecutive Olympic gold was given to Kenny, Hindes and Skinner, the 23-year-old Scot tasked with filling the intimidatingly large cleats of his compatriot. Frustrated by Kenny\u2019s often patchy form, the former Team GB technical director Shane Sutton once likened the enigmatic cyclist from Bolton to a bear going in and out of hibernation. He arrived at these Games with the opportunity of equalling Hoy\u2019s tally of six Olympic golds. With four down across two Games, he has just two more to go.</p> <p>Asked if there was any aspect of their performance that surprised him, Kenny did not beat around the bush. \u201cYes, all of it to be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going quite well in training so we kind of had a rough idea of what we could do. We went into the final as second qualifiers with nothing to lose and just left it all on the track.\u201d Asked to compare the team\u2019s inability to win at the world championships with their equal inability to lose at the Olympics, Kenny said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d.</p> <p>Trott and Joanna Roswell-Shand were joined by Katie Archibald and Elinor Barker as they began the defence of the women\u2019s team pursuit title they won four years ago. Racing in a new format with a longer distance of 4,000m and four riders instead of three, the quartet finished third at the world championships behind the USA and Canada but were reported to have been close to world-record time in the buildup to Rio. The British cyclists began quickly and finished like an express train as they rumbled around the 250m track 16 times in 4min 13.260sec to shave almost half a second off Australia\u2019s world record as they qualified for Saturday\u2019s first round.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1804187377a6e14861527bf9858eab30fe93625a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1804187377a6e14861527bf9858eab30fe93625a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Britain\u2019s Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell-Shand and Laura Trott compete in the women\u2019s team pursuit qualifying.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell-Shand and Laura Trott compete in the women\u2019s team pursuit qualifying.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aiming to break Hoy\u2019s record for the most Olympic medals for Great Britain in any sport, Sir Bradley Wiggins looked in typical \u201cWiggo\u201d form as he appeared to flick jobsworth officials the Vs as they measured him in relation to some potential aero handlebar infringement. Having previously told anyone who would listen to \u201cput your house on us winning gold in Rio\u201d, Wiggins claims he will be satisfied with nothing less than gold and his team-mates, in the pursuit, Owain Doull, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy laid down the mother of all markers in qualifying for Saturday\u2019s denouement.

They qualified in first place ahead of Denmark by a chasm of almost exactly four seconds.</p> <p>A tip of the teardrop helmet is due to the Rio 2016 organisers, who got there in the end. Despite genuine concerns that the velodrome would not be built on time, the delayed Olympic venue other delayed Olympic venues called \u201cThe Guv\u2019nor\u201d seemed decidedly ready for action. In May, a Rio city government that almost certainly had more important things to do cancelled its contract with the company tasked with its construction, stating Tecnosolo \u201cdid not have the conditions to continue being technically responsible for the construction of the velodrome\u201d. They subsequently handed the reins over to Enget\u00e9cnica, previously a subcontractor at the venue and this commendable decisiveness appears to have borne fruit even if a cacophony of nocturnal drilling noises could be heard emanating from the building less than 24 hours before the first race was due to commence.</p> <p>Having hosted the training sessions of those competing in the 10 days leading up to the Games, the clean, well lit track constructed from specially imported Siberian wood showed some signs of wear and tear and was randomly splattered with the kind of conspicuous white splodges of filler you might see adorning a painter\u2019s radio. On the subject of decor, two massive screens were positioned at each end, looming over the Rio 2016 green, orange and yellow-coloured infield with the media mixed zone hosting the good and great of track cycling past, separated from the myriad cyclists\u2019 cabins by a large raised green rectangular platform on which stood the podium that so many competitors hope to climb. Britain\u2019s sprinters were the first to test the sturdiness of the top step at the end of an evening that bodes well for Britain.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Elephant evolution</strong></h2> <p>The largest of all land beasts, elephants are thundering, trumpeting six-tonne monuments to the wonder of evolution.

The 19th century brought a fashion for big game hunting among colonialists, which wiped out herds across the continent of Africa.

As the human population booms, so does demand for space. Poaching conveniently removes elephants from the land, leaving it open to development. This is a pattern seen across western Africa, where elephant declines have been most precipitous.

In an evening\u2019s feeding a herd of elephants can destroy the annual crop of many small farmers. Human lives are also in danger. In India, panicked or enraged elephants kill <a href=\"http://www.moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/ETF_REPORT_FINAL.pdf\">more than 400 people each year</a> (pdf). This leads to retaliation.

Chinese wealth is financing a hunger for ivory that threatens to bring an end to wild elephants within our lifetime. </p> <p>There has never been a more dangerous time to be an elephant. Not during the industrial pillaging of the colonial era, nor the chaotic African and Asian independence movements that sparked a 1970s poaching boom, has an elephant been more likely to fall to a gun.</p> <p>In spite of the global ban on international trade (overseen by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Cites</a>) the illegal ivory trade has exploded. <a href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/stiles/\">Some believe</a> large amounts of ivory has also been bought and stored in secret warehouses by investors needing somewhere to hide money from the global downturn. Criminal gangs bribe officials to ship huge quantities of ivory through the ports to illicit factories and markets of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand in particular. In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.asianscientist.com/2012/01/topnews/malaysia-customs-ivory-traffic-southeast-asia-012012/\">seizures hit a peak of 23 metric tonnes</a> \u2013 2,500 elephants. But that is only a fraction of what makes it through undisturbed.</p> <h2>What should we do with ivory stockpiles?</h2> <p>Some African states - including Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana - are arguing for the right to sell off their ever-growing stockpiles, fed by both seizures and natural deaths, in order to help fund conservation work. <br></p> <p>But ivory sell-offs - such as the two in 1999 and 2008 - have been also criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/legal-ivory-sale-drove-dramatic-increase-in-elephant-poaching-study-shows\">for increasing demand</a>, although there are some <a href=\"http://www.fmunderwood.com/2016/06/20/critique-of-hsiang-and-sekar-paper-linking-legal-ivory-sale-to-an-increase-in-illegal-killing-of-elephants/\">who dispute these findings</a>.

Poaching exists on the continent, but it is a lesser threat compared to the destruction of their homes. Unlike their African cousins, only Asian bull elephants have tusks. Elephant protection relies on the defence of reserve land from legal and illegal encroachment, logging, roads and other developments. Innovative solutions can help, such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/indian-conservationist-wins-whitley-award-for-saving-elephants-via-sms\">project in the tea fields of India</a> which uses an SMS warning system so that humans can coexist safely with elephants. </p> <h2><strong>2) Reduce demand</strong></h2> <p>In the markets of Asia where the majority of the poached African ivory ends up, the holy grail of elephant conservation remains the abolition of demand for ivory. This has worked in Japan \u2013 what was one of the biggest markets for ivory at the turn of this century is now a minor player. </p> <p>In China, <a href=\"http://wildaid.org/news/yao-ming-urges-china-%E2%80%98say-no-ivory-and-rhino-horn%E2%80%99-new-film\">advertising campaigns featuring local and foreign celebrities</a> are having an effect. The proportion of Chinese who believe elephant poaching is a problem <a href=\"http://wildaid.org/news/consumer-awareness-ivory-and-rhino-horn-trade%E2%80%99s-impact-grows-rapidly-china\">grew from 47% to 71%</a> between 2012 and 2014. This awareness also appears to be having an effect on policy. The Chinese and US governments have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/26/china-and-us-agree-on-ivory-ban-in-bid-to-end-illegal-trade-globally\">agreed to work together to end the global illegal ivory trade</a>. Last year, China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/29/china-agrees-to-phase-out-its-ivory-industry-to-combat-elephant-poaching\">began to phase out</a> its domestic manufacture and sale of ivory and the US cracked down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/us-adopts-near-total-ban-on-commercial-ivory-trade\">its own internal market</a>, which was the second largest in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c154ab80ddec96a0a85cb91b91221151fc0a07d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c154ab80ddec96a0a85cb91b91221151fc0a07d2/0_192_5756_3453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seized ivory products in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seized ivory products in China</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile the Europeans \u2013 historically responsible for a great part of the decline of elephants during colonial-era craze for big game hunting \u2013 have drawn criticism for refusing to back a long-term end to all trade in ivory. Some observers argue that the only way to save elephants is to give them economic value. That can mean emphasising the <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/10/17/report-estimates-enormous-economic-value-of-living-elephants/\">value to tourism</a>, but the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-437-EN-F1-1-ANNEX-2.PDF\">EU has raised</a> the possibility of allowing states where populations are stable to harvest ivory and sell it to China legally.</p> <h2>3) Support the frontline defenders</h2> <p>The link between poaching and poverty is clear: rates of infant mortality and poaching activity correlate <a href=\"https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/african_elephant_summit_background_document_2013_en.pdf\">strongly</a>. In Kenya, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities\">a poacher makes $3 per kilo of ivory</a>, a princely sum compared to the daily earnings of many around them. But the gangs they sell it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/ivory-price-drop-in-china-signals-fall-in-demand-report-says\">get $1,100 per kilo</a> for the same tusk in China. Many elephants, particularly in the forests of central Africa, are not only targeted for their ivory. An enterprising hunter can <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/edocs/ssc-op-045.pdf\">make more</a> (pdf) money in the unregulated bushmeat markets from the smoked meat than from the tusks. So the development and prosperity of rural Africa is a vital aspect of elephant conservation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d57262a57351394311335531c91a9532c453d74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d57262a57351394311335531c91a9532c453d74/0_508_5171_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers carry elephant tusks to a burning site for a historic destruction of illegal ivory and rhino-horn confiscated mostly from poachers in Nairobi\u2019s national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers carry elephant tusks to a burning site for a historic destruction of illegal ivory and rhino-horn confiscated mostly from poachers in Nairobi\u2019s national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the face of this multitude of threats, inspirational work is being done by exceptionally brave people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/30/kenya-poaching-elephant-ivory-rhino-horn-future-communities\">In Kenya, former poachers are recruited</a> to be the world\u2019s first line of defence against the murder of elephants \u2013 the park rangers. All too frequently <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140627-congo-virunga-wildlife-rangers-elephants-rhinos-poaching/\">they lose their lives</a>. These people, the NGO community and the efforts of many governments are sources of hope. The defeat of greed and desperation may be hard to imagine.

Nadal, who won gold in Beijing, missed London - and almost missed Rio. The whippy left wrist that has been is six-gun all his career finally ran out of bullets at Roland Garros nearly 10 weeks ago, and not many expected him to make this gig. He led Spain in at the opening ceremony and who could doubt his commitment to the cause after entering the three disciplines? Unfortunately, the wretched intrusion of rain on Wednesday has forced fixtures pile-up that demands he play three matches on Thursday. He got the first out of the way with a bit of a struggle, taking just over two hours to get rid of the always combative Frenchman, Gilles Simon. The wrist looked strong.

After interminably refreshing the Olympic tickets page, I managed to get some early morning hockey tickets - with the added bonus of being able to stay in the Olympic Park for the full Saturday watching on the big screens. I also booked an evening slot to go up the Orbit tower, as a fun way to round off the day. I was totally unaware that you can see down into the stadium from the viewing platform, or that our slot coincided with Mo Farah going for gold. Only half the track was visible from where we were, so as the athletes disappeared down the back straight every lap we could only listen to the incredible noise coming from the stadium and cross our fingers! Even from several hundred metres away, the sound was thunderous. I can\u2019t imagine the atmosphere inside the stadium, but it was quite a special shared experience between the handful of us crowded onto that platform, as Mo came into view and stormed down the home straight to victory.\u201d</p> <p>For mine? I blagged into the photographers area - i.e. the best seats in the house. Then did it again for the 100m final a couple nights later. Probably would have been punted from my then-LOCOG job if caught.

  "<p>Large-scale seizures of ivory in Singapore over the last three years make the south-east Asian city-state one of the world\u2019s premier ivory smuggling hubs for organised crime, say conservation watchdogs. <br></p> <p>Data from seizures, collected by the UN\u2019s wildlife trade monitor Traffic and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and shared with the Guardian, reveals how the gangsters operate. Shipping containers carrying thousands of tusks are labelled as carrying anything from tea to waste paper or avocados. They leave Africa from a few ports well-known for high levels of corruption.</p> <p>Customs officials in China and Hong Kong \u2013 where most ivory ends up \u2013 target containers which have come from those ports. In order to get around this, according to EIA director of campaigns Julian Newman and traffic wildlife trade expert Tom Milliken, ivory shipments are being dropped off in transit ports, such as Singapore or Port Klang in Malaysia, where they can sit for months before being loaded on to a new vessel with paperwork listing a new port of origin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:14:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Over 41 tonnes of ivory was seized in China during the period 2012 to 2014\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:14:41/embed.html\">Over 41 tonnes of ivory was seized in China during the period 2012 to 2014</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably get a red flag if you were shipping dried fish from Africa to Hong Kong,\u201d said Newman. \u201cBut if it came from Malaysia then it wouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s lots of loopholes that people are able to exploit to try and get their stuff through customs control.\u201d</p> <p>Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia are the transit countries traditionally favoured by the gangs. Between 2010 and today, the EIA recorded these countries seizing a total of 32, 18 and 14 tonnes of ivory respectively.</p> <p>By comparison, there had been relatively few seizures in Singapore for more than a decade before 2013. Since then, authorities have made four large seizures of 1.8 tonnes, 1 tonne, 3.7 tonnes and 0.5 tonnes \u2013 all of which Singapore <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/singapore-crushes-illegal-ivory-worth-10-million/\">crushed</a> in a display of defiance against the trade.</p> <p>The speed at which the syndicates have established themselves in the city-state has caught the attention of wildlife trade experts such as Milliken. \u201cSingapore literally came out of nowhere and became a country of primary concern. It\u2019s not a lot of seizures but the ones that occurred were a large volume of ivory,\u201d he said. Amounts of half a tonne and above indicate the involvement of criminal gangs.</p> <p>Organised crime is a key threat to elephant survival, said Milliken, because of the huge volumes they are able to ship at once. The payoffs are huge and the consequences usually minimal. Traffic estimates that more than 95% of illegal shipments evade officials. Arrests are rare. As a result elephant poaching in Africa has exploded since 2008 with catastrophic results in countries such as Tanzania where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/tanzania-epicentre-of-elephant-poaching-census-reveals\">population dropped 60% from 2009 to 2014</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 95% of illegal shipments evade officials and arrests are rare</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Milliken has prepared <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/WorkingDocs/E-CoP17-57-06-R1.pdf\">a report</a> (pdf) for next month\u2019s critical wildlife summit \u2013 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) conference in South Africa \u2013 in which he names Singapore as \u201ca country of primary concern\u201d. The conference will consider whether to put Singapore on a list of worst offending countries that are required to submit a plan for controlling the trade and overseen by their peers. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Singaporean Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said the agency was reviewing the recommendation made to Cites and that Singapore used \u201ca multi-pronged approach to weed out illegal wildlife trade\u201d. They would not comment on the apparent renewed presence of criminal gangs.</p> <p>In June, when the country crushed its seized ivory, <a href=\"https://www.ava.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/press-release_singapore-crushed-7-9-tonnes-of-seized-ivory.pdf\">senior minister of state for national development and home affairs Desmond Lee said</a> (pdf): \u201cTackling this illicit trade requires close international cooperation, and also the assistance of the public and NGOs. We will continue our enforcement efforts, to prevent Singapore from being used as a transit point.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:16:33/embed.html\" data-alt=\"High proportions of ivory in large scale seizures indicates the involvement of organised crime\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-11T11:16:33/embed.html\">High proportions of ivory in large scale seizures indicates the involvement of organised crime</a> </figure>  <p>The Cites conference of parties (CoP) is the major global meeting on the wildlife trade. It occurs every three years, this year in Johannesburg. On the agenda are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/09/the-eu-is-right-to-oppose-a-global-ivory-ban\">controversial proposals</a> to allow some sales of ivory by some African countries. The international trade in ivory was banned by Cites in 1989.</p> <p>Like most aspects of the ivory trade, global data on seizures varies in quality from country to country. Traffic and the EIA maintain databases of seizures using police records, tips, leaks and media announcements.</p> <p>This is not the first time that ivory gangs have operated in Singapore. In 2002 a tip off to the EIA led to one of the <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/Back-in-Business-2002.pdf\">biggest ivory seizures of all time</a> (pdf) \u2013 6.2 tonnes. The only person arrested was Toh Yew Lye, a middleman who had signed the port documents in Singapore (he claimed to believe the shipments were sculptures). Documents captured in Africa suggested the syndicate had made as many as 18 shipments from Malawi between 1994 and 2002. Lye was fined just $3,000. But the crime itself was worth millions of dollars. One of the most lucrative smuggling routes of the 1990s was broken and Singapore remained quiet for a decade. </p> <p>Milliken believes the return of at least one smuggling ring to the world\u2019s second busiest port could be motivated by increasing pressure on the trade in Malaysia. At the last Cites CoP in 2013, Malaysia was named a country of primary concern and forced to submit a national ivory plan. While Malaysia remains a premier smuggling route, the humiliation has led to some progress, according to Milliken, which may have pushed the criminals back to Singapore.</p> <p>\u201cIf law enforcement gets tough in one place then of course the people behind these consignments will find another way. They are constantly looking for the path of least resistance,\u201d he said. Newman calls this interpretation \u201ccredible\u201d.</p> <p>In Hong Kong and China, ivory has taken on an increased level of political importance. The Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/29/china-agrees-to-phase-out-its-ivory-industry-to-combat-elephant-poaching\">announced last year</a>it would phase out the country\u2019s domestic ivory trade. As such, highly sophisticated systems have been developed to target shipments that fit certain profiles. </p> <p>Thirty million containers pass through Singapore\u2019s port every year. It is this volume that makes it attractive to gangs and a nightmare for customs trying to combat the illegal passage of everything from pangolins to rocket launchers.</p> <p>\u201cMost of their targeting and profiling, probably number one is looking for drugs and then perhaps armaments. Wildlife trade, ivory, it\u2019s probably somewhere there but it\u2019s certainly not a mega priority,\u201d said Milliken.</p>",
  "<p>If, just 800 generations ago, we took a summer holiday to Crete, Cyprus or Malta, we would have found familiar-looking islands, filled with the flowers and birds we can enjoy today. But bursting through the scrub would\u2019ve been one surprise: a pygmy elephant, one metre high, one of many different elephant species that once roamed every continent apart from Australia and Antarctica.</p> <p>The 20,000-year-old pygmy elephants of the Mediterranean islands may appear as fantastical as the woolly mammoths which still ambled across one Alaskan island just 5,600 years ago. But these animals\u2019 lives, and deaths, take on a new pertinence today. They lived a blink of an eye ago in evolutionary time and shared the planet with modern humans. And the fate of these lost elephants, warns <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/adrian-lister.html\">Prof Adrian Lister</a>, paleobiologist at the Natural History Museum, is analogous to the troubled future facing their close relatives, the African and Asian elephants threatened with obliteration today.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are more likely to drive things to extinction on islands than on the mainland,\u201d says Lister. \u201cOne of the problems with living elephants is not just that their numbers are going down and down but that their populations are very fragmented. We call it islandisation. National parks are islands today. If you\u2019re a population of 50 elephants on a national park in Nepal, surrounded by agricultural land, you may as well be on an oceanic island in terms of population size and genetic diversity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7031b0f015c67f59e806e997ea33d6a758dbe8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7031b0f015c67f59e806e997ea33d6a758dbe8e8/834_676_3076_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Platybelodon grangeri were shovel-tusked elephants that lived in China 15 to 11 million years ago.

Across the world, and not just in Asia and Africa, elephants are celebrated in culture, a staple of stories for children, a rich and mighty symbol.

As a scientist, I know that elephants come very, very close to us.\u201d</p> <p>What is less widely recognised in modern-day elephants is their talent for engineering or reshaping landscapes. Such mighty beasts always have: when the fruits of the Osage orange, a North American tree, drop to the ground, nothing eats them. <a href=\"https://www.americanforests.org/magazine/article/trees-that-miss-the-mammoths/ \">The tree</a> is one of many ecological anachronisms.

In Asia there is a long tradition of taking Asian elephants into captivity and training them. The elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesh is, appropriately enough, a remover of obstacles. Elephants are prayed to every day. \u201cIt is extraordinarily helpful that our grandmothers taught us to revere the elephant,\u201d says Menon. Despite elephants killing more than 400 people in India every year \u2013 \u201cthis is not badgers we\u2019re talking about,\u201d says Menon \u2013 here there are no suggestions it should be culled.

In addition, more thought must be devoted to tackling the European demand that partly fuels the trade.</p> <p>But most crucial of all is increased emphasis on strategic prevention at source, the absence of which has enabled the trade to boom over recent years.</p> <p>Prevention activity focused on Edo state, as Nigeria\u2019s key trafficking hub, must be a core focus of the government\u2019s new fund. I have visited the region on several occasions. Local leaders want to tackle the problem. <a href=\"http://www.uniben.edu/\">Academics</a> there have also completed work looking at the causes of the trafficking trade and protective factors that are likely to be effective.</p> <p>This work, combined with engagement with community leaders, faith groups, NGOs and government agencies, reveals three aspects of prevention on which the government should focus.</p> <p>The first is to work with local communities in an effort to challenge attitudes that have normalised payments to facilitators to transport young people into Europe. The focus here should be on communicating the realities of the trafficking experience. </p> <p>I met a mother in Edo who told me her eldest son was murdered by traffickers in Libya. She then had to sell all of her possessions to secure the release of her younger son. Her one wish was for others to know about the true dangers of the journey, in order to prevent more mothers experiencing such heartbreak.</p> <p>The second aspect is to work with <a href=\"http://www.naptip.gov.ng/\">Nigeria\u2019s anti-trafficking agency</a>, building their capacity to crack down on traffickers operating in Edo. These criminals often act with impunity, especially in remote rural regions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/07/nigeria-trafficking-women-prostitutes-italy\">Trafficked to Turin: the Nigerian women forced to work as prostitutes in Italy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Communities in Edo must also be supported to provide opportunities for young people that protect them from being enticed by traffickers. The third recommendation is therefore to work with the Nigerian government and businesses to identify and promote sustainable livelihood development that reduces vulnerability to trafficking.</p> <p>Anti-slavery prevention is smart development policy. Slavery is an impediment to development, and this is certainly the case in Edo, where trafficking has robbed communities of young people who could contribute most to local development.</p> <p>Effective prevention will always be the best long-term strategy, as it stops people from becoming victims in the first place. It is a smart investment for the UK. In 2013, human trafficking for sexual exploitation was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-organised-crime-estimating-the-scale-and-the-social-and-economic-costs\">estimated to cost the UK at least \u00a3890m</a>. Yes, working in Nigeria has it challenges, and of course there must be rigorous due diligence on use of UK funds. But this issue is simply too urgent to ignore.</p> <p>Failure to act will mean that thousands more victims are created, and Europe and the UK will be left to deal with the consequences. Addressing the root causes of the trafficking trade is the key to ending this decades old cycle of suffering.</p> <ul> <li><em>Kevin Hyland is the UK\u2019s first independent anti-slavery commissioner.

Tony Wilson, a former hospital director who now runs the organisation, had often noticed how men would take longer to recover from illness than women, and was inspired after discovering similar projects in Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"309124162dd8418292e43a08c05d8679d68506f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309124162dd8418292e43a08c05d8679d68506f5/578_436_3405_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At work in the Sansaw men\u2019s shed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At work in the Sansaw men\u2019s shed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019d tried various things to solve the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that men don\u2019t address problems directly and they have problems discussing their health. There\u2019s an expression that men don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder. So the idea is that while they\u2019re banging in nails, they\u2019re more likely to talk.\u201d</p> <p>There are now four sheds in the county, each with between 18 and 26 members. <a href=\"http://sansawmensshed.org/\">The Sansaw group</a> comprises former mechanics, optometrists and (cue laughter whenever it\u2019s mentioned), an artificial inseminator of cattle. They come from all social classes, some married, and some with disabilities or long-term illnesses that prevent them from working.</p> <p>Learning new skills is one reason why the men are attracted to the project. John Burgess, 81, a former engineer, is one of the oldest members and acts as secretary. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not lonely, but I gave it a go,\u201d he says. \u201cI do one day a week and like it. I\u2019ve learned a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Gerard Neville, 67, has been a member for 18 months. He says: \u201cI found it hard to retire. I come because it gets you out really. You get up at seven and there\u2019s a long time till bed. You\u2019ve got to fill it. My wife is pleased because it gets me out from under her feet.\u201d</p> <p>Neville\u2019s experience isn\u2019t unusual, according to Prof Steve Robertson, the co-director of the Centre for Men\u2019s Health at Leeds Beckett University. \u201cMen often lose identity when they stop working and have a bit of an existential crisis. They think: \u2018If I\u2019m not working, what is my role as a man?\u2019 It\u2019s why the sheds have been so important. They\u2019ve given them a renewed sense of purpose, with the wellbeing and friendships that go with it.\u201d </p> <p>It is far from just being a chance to potter about: there\u2019s a real sense of being involved and, crucially, valued in the community. The Sansaw shed team are regularly asked to build things such as church noticeboards and bus shelters, which they do in exchange for donations to their charity. Some volunteer at the Shrewsbury Autism Hub, teaching woodwork to young people, and<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2016/02/19/tears-of-joy-as-shropshire-diy-sos-team-work-miracle/\"> recently took part in the BBC\u2019s DIY SOS: The Big Build</a>.</p> <p>It goes deeper than playing with tools and giving wives some quiet time.

In a fairly manly way, but we still dealt with it. We also have guys moaning about aches and pains, so we say: \u2018Well, go and see the bloody doctor then.\u2019\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s hard to feel alone inside a long and happy marriage. But it\u2019s easier than it looks, perhaps, to feel lonely. Last week, Italian police officers responding to reports of screaming and crying inside an apartment in Rome found something unexpected behind the door. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pasta-italian-police-elderly-couple-crying-neighbours-rome-a7178691.html\" title=\"\">Jole and Michele were a devoted elderly couple</a> who had ostensibly got themselves worked up over a sad story on the TV news, but some gentle questioning elicited the fact that both were struggling with terrible loneliness.

The story went viral because it\u2019s so heartwarming, and yet on second reading it\u2019s also rather unsettling. The lonely are not quite the&#xa0;people we think they are.</p> <p>It will be 20 years ago this summer that the first Bridget Jones novel was published, a timely reminder to ignore the spectacularly awful sequels and remember just how neatly the original skewered some of the myths about lonely singleton life.</p> <p>Bridget was famously terrified of dying alone and forgotten, but ironically&#xa0;the one thing she wasn\u2019t was lonely: she was riotously surrounded by friends and&#xa0;family, even if they did all keep harping on about her getting a proper boyfriend. It\u2019s smug marrieds who can all too easily collapse in on themselves, severing old friendships they will come to regret in the process. (Anyone who thinks that having a baby means you\u2019ll never feel alone again, meanwhile, has yet to find out how it feels to be home with a howling infant, desperately trying to engage the postman in conversation because he\u2019s the only sentient adult you\u2019ll see for hours.)</p> <p>It\u2019s all too easy to become consumed by family life and then wake up in middle age, ostensibly at the centre of a rich and busy life, struggling to remember your last meaningful conversation. That&#xa0;feeling may not be loneliness yet, but it\u2019s a first step on the road.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The blunt truth is that not all lonely people are lovable old grannies who tug at your heartstrings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For while the cavernously empty feeling endured by the bereaved or unwillingly single can indeed be a terrible thing, and life-shortening to boot, it\u2019s not the only kind of loneliness. A <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/06/12184/loneliness-linked-serious-health-problems-and-death-among-elderly\" title=\"\">recent University of California study</a> found that while almost half of its elderly subjects confessed to feeling lonely at times, only 18% of them actually lived alone.</p> <p>Unhappy marriages, atrophying into long silences and separate lives, might have something to do with that, but the story&#xa0;of Jole and Michele suggests something else: a distinct kind of loneliness stemming not from the absence of significant others but from a&#xa0;feeling of disconnection with the wider world, a sense that you\u2019re no longer part of something shared and human. Is it just a coincidence that the Italian couple\u2019s crisis seems to have been provoked by a run of news stories \u2013 violent attacks, abuse at a kindergarten \u2013 revealing human nature at its coldest?</p> <p>Fleeting loneliness comes to all of us occasionally, but it solidifies into something deeper and darker for those who start to perceive the world as a harsh and hostile place, one that wouldn\u2019t welcome efforts to connect even if you try. It\u2019s that nagging feeling of rejection, of not belonging or standing somehow apart from others, that is the true hallmark of feeling lonely in a crowd, and it\u2019s by no means the preserve of the old.</p> <p>Interestingly, a <a href=\"http://www.brunel.ac.uk/environment/themes/ageing-studies/research-projects/why-arent-all-old-people-lonely-a-comparative-analysis-of-european-union\" title=\"\">recent Brunel University study of over-50s</a> found more&#xa0;than half of those identifying themselves as lonely had been that way for over 10 years, suggesting the feeling had become part of the fabric of their lives.

Immense wealth can of course be isolating \u2013 although the money clearly didn\u2019t make the duke unhappy enough to get rid of it, or indeed to eschew the family tradition of minimising inheritance tax liabilities \u2013 but in Gerald Grosvenor\u2019s case something else seems to be going on. What emerges is a picture of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3734088/Racked-self-doubt-Duke-proved-money-t-buy-happiness.html\" title=\"\">a man struggling all his life with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety</a>, worried that he had done nothing to live up to the reputation of those ancestors who built his unearned fortune. Bullied at school, he reportedly left Harrow without one proper friend.</p> <p>And if you can\u2019t bring yourself to feel sorry for a billionaire, the blunt truth is that not all lonely people are lovable old grannies who tug at your heartstrings. An unhappy few have pushed others away with their self-destructive behaviour and are now paying a high price for it; some have struggled bitterly all their lives with the art of making friends, never quite mastering social norms. How much of the late-night bile spewed on social media simply reflects the envy and frustration of those who see other people happily connecting all around them and just don\u2019t quite know how to join in? Loneliness has its dark side, one not so easily solved by more visits from the grandchildren or well-meaning volunteer \u201cbefrienders\u201d popping in for chats over coffee.</p> <p>For Jole and Michele, at least, perhaps there will be a happy ending. Now their story has been made public, perhaps surviving relatives or old friends will rally round, and if nothing else the knowledge that strangers worldwide are&#xa0;now asking how they can send letters or visit must do something to restore their faith in human nature.</p> <p>Yet while a little kindness goes a very long way, it\u2019s too easy to pretend loneliness can all be solved by a few more companionable plates of spaghetti. It makes for a less heartwarming story but the truth is that, like the poor, the lonely may to some degree always be with us \u2013 even, perhaps, when they\u2019re ostensibly with someone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20a15f69c9963c6338dcc0937ab9c3397f07920a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20a15f69c9963c6338dcc0937ab9c3397f07920a/0_8_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italian police with a lonely older couple\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers serve pasta to Jole and Michele, a lonely older couple, in Rome, August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Italian police photo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Here\u2019s how they stack up.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s contained in the Nauru files and the accuracy of the reports</strong></h2> <p>Peter Dutton said: <em>There are some that are legitimate and there are others that aren\u2019t and others that have been found not to be substantiated. I think it is important to recognise of the 2,000 reports many could include a complaint about food or about kids not going to school, parent disciplining a child within the regional centre, that makes up the 2,000.</em></p> <p>The files published by the Guardian do contain a range of types of reports, but they are considerably more severe and significant than Dutton has suggested. Many of the files contain eyewitness testimony from the guards, caseworkers, child protection workers and teachers on the island. This primary evidence carries considerable weight, particularly when these staff members see first-hand instances of abuse or assaults. They are not historical, and date up to October 2015, well beyond the scope of successive Australian government inquiries into much earlier allegations.</p> <p>By way of example of the seriousness of incidents, there were 156 reports of threatened self-harm involving children. There were 59 reports of assault on a minor, and 170 reports of \u201cconcern for a minor\u201d \u2013 which includes everything from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca141033\">an uneven floor that might cause people to trip</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca140048\">alleged sexual assault</a> and <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdf/sca141120.pdf\">self-harm</a>.</p> <p>There are more than just those though. Mis-categorisation incidents is also a theme throughout the data \u2013 and we know that serious events are also simply not reported on Nauru \u2013 so even these counts are likely to be a conservative estimate. </p> <p>Even the less serious events contribute to a stressful environment of surveillance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/nauru-teachers-speak-out-for-children-we-dont-have-to-torture-them\">say former teachers who worked on the island.</a> Sometimes caseworkers will document an incident that could be considered less severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/from-pleas-to-threats-to-harm-files-reveal-escalation-of-trauma-on-nauru\">because they know that incidents can quickly escalate to self harms or other forms of serious incidents,</a> as the length of detention of asylum seekers steadily increases.</p> <h2><strong>The seriousness of incidents disclosed in the Nauru files</strong></h2> <p>Dutton: <em>Well, out of the 2,000 as I understand it, those analysed so far ... over 20 are critical, so you\u2019re talking about where there\u2019s been an allegation of sexual assault, so that might be a person within the regional processing centre that\u2019s alleged to have assaulted a female or male within the centre.</em></p> <p>Dutton\u2019s comments vastly underestimate of the seriousness of incidents. The security company Wilson Security <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-show-wilson-security-staff-regularly-downgraded-reports-of-abuse\">has regularly downgraded the seriousness of incident reports on the island</a>, among four descending categories of critical, major, minor and information. So a report of self-harm that should be critical could be downgraded to major. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime\">Psychologist and traumatologist Paul Stevenson</a>, who visited Nauru 12 times to counsel and support Wilson guards, said reports were regularly downgraded and there was a constant financial pressure to de-escalate the reported severity of fights or acts of self-harm.</p> <p>As a consequence of this dubious record-keeping there are far more reports of sexual assault and child abuse than Dutton has claimed.</p> <h2><strong>Australia\u2019s role on Nauru</strong></h2> <p>Dutton: <em>\u201cWe will work with the Nauruan authorities and police force to provide support to those people [who make allegations of abuse] ... Nauru is not part of Australia, so this is an issue for the Nauruan government.\u201d</em></p> <p>This perennial myth peddled by the Australian government doesn\u2019t stack up with a vast body of legal opinion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/high-court-upholds-australias-right-to-detain-asylum-seekers-offshore\">including from the high court of Australia</a> and the Australian Senate. Australia established the Nauru detention centre and maintains effective control over its operations. Serious allegations that occur at the centre are a matter for Australia both as a matter of domestic and international law.</p> <h2><strong>Investigating allegations of sexual abuse or assaults</strong></h2> <p>Dutton:<em> We\u2019ve been adamant we want to treat people rightly, we will investigate. I\u2019ve been clear from day one I won\u2019t tolerate one incidence of sexual abuse or any abuse, whether it\u2019s towards a child, female, or male, on Nauru, in Manus.</em></p> <p>Many concerns have been raised about the capacity of the Nauruan police force to investigate allegations of abuse and sexual assault. The internal investigations of the companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/09/asylum-seekers-abused-on-nauru-may-never-get-justice-says-former-adviser\">on the island has also been criticised</a>, because they essentially involve organisations investigating their own staff over allegations of assaults. As a consequence, there is doubt over the effectiveness of the investigating processes set up on Nauru in the absence of other independent oversight.</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether many of the allegations contained in the Nauru files have ever been appropriately dealt with. The reporting of serious allegations is flawed, and incidents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/nauru-files-show-wilson-security-staff-regularly-downgraded-reports-of-abuse\">are regularly downgraded in seriousness</a>. While the details of a number of cases of child abuse and sexual assault were put forward to the Australian parliament during a Senate inquiry in 2015, the Guardian\u2019s analysis has shown that a number of reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/nauru-files-reveal-cases-of-alleged-sexual-violence-and-child-abuse-not-disclosed-to-parliament\">contained in the Nauru files were not disclosed.<br></a></p> <p>While Dutton says he won\u2019t tolerate a single incident of sexual abuse, the Nauru files show that allegations continued to be levelled right up to the most recent reports published by the Guardian.</p>",

Recent modelling by Beyond Zero Emissions shows that to shift the entire Australian car passenger fleet to 100% electric in 10 years<em> </em>would cost only 25% more ($1,200bn) than replacing the same fleet with traditional internal combustion engine (Ice) vehicles at a cost of $1,000bn. </p> <p>This cost is highly dependent on assumptions related to the price of oil over that period, the price of batteries, and the price of EVs. If battery and EV prices fall more rapidly over the period, and the price of oil increases more rapidly, replacing the fleet with EVs could be cost-neutral. </p> <p>This also factors in the cost of public EV charging infrastructure (approximately $100bn) and the cost of charging the vehicles with 100% renewable electricity. Charging the vehicles with anything but renewable electricity means the full benefits of EVs will not be realised, which is the ability to have a pure zero carbon transport system. And as car sharing becomes mainstream, reducing car ownership and enhancing other forms of transport such as public transport will make transitioning the fleet to EVs even easier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/04/mining-town-coober-pedy-shows-the-rest-of-australiahow-to-turn-to-renewables\">Mining town Coober Pedy shows the rest of Australia how to turn to renewables</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Interestingly, Beyond Zero Emissions\u2019 <a href=\"http://bze.org.au/blog/electric-vehicle-report-release-date-august-12th-2016-160724\" rel=\"nofollow\">modelling</a> shows that it will be even more cost-effective to convert the entire Australian bus fleet to electric buses over 10 years. This could only cost 10% more ($7bn) than replacing Australia\u2019s bus fleet with traditional fossil-fuel-powered buses. With higher prices for oil, and lower prices for batteries and electric buses, the cost of moving the bus fleet to electric could be 12% less than continuing to operate ICE buses. </p> <p>Local governments can\u2019t wait to get in on the action. Many<em> </em>are said to be talking to Tesla about installing the energy storage company\u2019s supercharger stations in their area. But we need a suitable policy framework and incentives at all levels of government to get this moving. </p> <p>At the federal government level, we need a reduction in sales tax for EVs. This is already happening in France, Germany, Japan, Norway and the Netherlands. At the state or territory government level, we need low or no registration fees for EVs. And at the local government level, we need free parking for EVs and access to transit lanes in peak hour, as we have for motorbikes, buses, taxis and cars with more than one person, and as they do in cities such as Copenhagen, Oslo, Barcelona, London and Los Angeles.</p> <p>We also need a targeted education campaign from government highlighting the benefits of EVs, including lower pollution and <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/env/the-cost-of-air-pollution-9789264210448-en.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">pollution-related deaths</a>. </p> <p>And finally we need to break the relationship between the oil majors and motor vehicle companies that has impeded the development and penetration of EVs for so many decades. One way to do this would be to have proactive renewable electricity retailers supporting the shift to renewables and EVs as part of a zero emissions home energy package, just as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.esdnews.com.au/agl-announces-can-eat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AGL</a> has started to do.
