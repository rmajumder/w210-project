  "<p>A few weeks ago I got a message from a university friend in Ohio. He sent me a <a href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/01-the-lady-vanishes\">podcast interview</a> with Julia Gillard in which she detailed the misogyny she experienced as Australia\u2019s prime minister, and asked, \u201cIs it really like that over there?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Not always. But, unfortunately, yes.</p> <p>As Americans contemplate their first female president, they are curious about how a 21st century, first-world, English-speaking nation handles its first female leader. Understandably, America is looking to Australia\u2019s very recent experience with Gillard. Culturally, the two countries share much. Also, Gillard is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/julia-gillard-from-australias-first-female-prime-minister-to-international-superstar\">good friends</a> with Hillary Clinton and appears in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/julia-gillard-backs-hillary-clinton-us-presidential-campaign-video\">campaign material</a>. Furthermore, Gillard is also often in the US, speaking publicly, and is able to give the American media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/julia-gillard-urges-americans-of-all-parties-to-defend-hillary-clinton-against-sexism\">direct insight</a> into her time in office.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/593xf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836581\"            data-video-name=\"'Nasty women vote': Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e6205e4b0219a00d38178\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024warren_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024warren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024warren_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/24/elizabeth-warren-trump-clinton-nasty-women-video\">\u2018Nasty women vote\u2019: Elizabeth Warren takes a swipe at Trump</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This trend has picked up pace since Clinton was endorsed at the Democratic national convention in July.

She calculated that she didn\u2019t need to confront it because it would fade. Instead, the misogyny grew stronger, louder and uglier. </p> <p>Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, Gillard didn\u2019t recognise the environment around her was growing hotter until it boiled over. Neither did most of us \u2013 as Gillard points out now, no one was seriously calling out the insinuations, insults and jibes, and as a result the pattern of sexist attacks grew bolder and were adopted and legitimised by her political opponents. </p> <p>My university friend also asked if I, as first female premier of New South Wales, experienced the same kind of sexism that Gillard did. The answer is yes: it was different, but yes. </p> <p>For example, my Liberal opponent Barry O\u2019Farrell often described me as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-45695\">the Kim Kardashian of state politics</a>\u201d. Apparently my shared gender and initials with Ms Kardashian meant the TV reality star and I were one and the same, never mind what policies or experience or qualifications I brought to the job of MP, minister and premier. (Mr O\u2019Farrell also used parliament to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-46338\">compare</a> Carmel Tebbutt to a whining puppy and <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barry-ofarrell-accused-of-racial-slur-against-indigenous-labor-frontbencher-linda-burney-20130820-2s93s.html\">to tell Linda Burney</a> she hadn\u2019t achieved her positions on merit, that she could play a hooker on a rugby league team, and to describe her as \u201ccasting her spells\u201d.) </p> <p>When I finally stood up to his Kardashian bullying, the media \u2013 who had said almost nothing about his constant belittlement \u2013 went into <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/keneally-keeps-up-with-kardashians-by-turning-the-jibe-on-ofarrell-20120214-1t49p.html\">meltdown</a> about how I handed it back to him.</p> <p>But I tell you what, he never did it again.</p> <p>Frankly, Australia, that we didn\u2019t stand up for our first female prime minister when the ugly strain of sexism reared its head: that\u2019s on all of us. We deserve the reputation we are gaining in America.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihd7ofrwQX0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ihd7ofrwQX0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julia Gillard labels Tony Abbott a misogynist in 2012. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Weirdly, though, Clinton might be less likely to face Gillard\u2019s fate, because of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s public comments, tweets and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\">recorded private conversations</a> are so egregiously disrespecting of women that almost no one can overlook them.

She will also have Republican opponents who will find it politically necessary between now and the congressional mid-terms to convince voters, women and men alike, that they aren\u2019t all misogynistic thugs. In short, unlike Gillard, Clinton will be able to call out the sexism when it happens.

He missed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">4-0 defeat at Chelsea</a> on Sunday through injury and was left out of Southgate\u2019s starting XI for the World Cup qualifying draw in Slovenia this month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/25/england-spain-womens-international-friendly-match-report\">Steph Houghton\u2019s free-kick helps England to friendly win over Spain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England face a home World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 11 November before playing Spain in a friendly four days later at Wembley but Southgate, the interim manager whose four-match contract to replace Sam Allardyce expires after the Spain match, has hinted the record goalscorer will be a part of his squad.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the England captain and although he didn\u2019t start in Slovenia, to me he is a hugely influential person in that group and that won\u2019t change,\u201d Southgate said.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what that scenario is but I thought his leadership qualities in the 10 days with us shone through. I hadn\u2019t been able to see that first hand and it was hugely impressive. I could see how he\u2019s held in the eyes of the rest of the players and the positive influence he has in that environment. If that wasn\u2019t the case I wouldn\u2019t say those things. That\u2019s as it was.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him since the camp but I\u2019m always conscious players are back into a run of fixtures with their clubs, but I will pick up with him and the others later.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney has scored just four times in his last 32 appearances for United and England, although the 31-year-old has often featured in a deeper midfield role. He was brought on as a substitute against Slovenia but could not help Southgate\u2019s side find the breakthrough in a dour 0-0 draw.</p> <p>After being left out of Allardyce\u2019s first and only England squad for the qualifier against Slovakia in Trnava, Rooney\u2019s United team-mate Rashford came on as a substitute for Daniel Sturridge in Ljubljana. He turns 19 on Monday and would be eligible to play for England at the European Under-21 Championship next summer although United\u2019s manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, said last week that would make \u201cno sense\u201d if he is already established as a regular for the senior side.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a case of what\u2019s right for the individual player,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t make decisions on players at this stage of the season. You have an idea what you think is the ideal pathway for an international young player but you have to bear in mind the season they have and where they are in terms of being involved in the senior team.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scenario we went through two years ago but there is a point where young players are still viewed as being part of the development teams. There\u2019s also a point where we have to decide if they are still in development teams and is that going to benefit them or have they moved through it? As we have seen in the last couple of months Marcus is between the two. We have to wait and see what it looks like as we move forward. Everything I have seen Jos\u00e9 say is perfectly reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>Southampton\u2019s Charlie Austin and the Leicester City defender Danny Simpson are among those being tipped for a call\u2011up next month, and Southgate, who was talking during a visit to Sheffield for the Football Association\u2019s new Parklife scheme which is launched on Wednesday, admitted he was approaching the two matches with an open mind.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a pool of English-eligible players and we have to make sure we\u2019re up to speed on all of them, how they are playing, form and long-term potential as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we viewed it with the under-21s and the seniors are no different. You are always balancing those ideas in your mind.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\">Hinkley Point</a>, Heathrow, and next up High Speed 2. One by one, Theresa May\u2019s government is giving the go-ahead to major infrastructure projects that will cost taxpayers billions of pounds.<br></p> <p>But who was Chris Grayling kidding when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/25/heathrow-approval-business-political-environmental-issues\">said of Heathrow\u2019s third runway that the government had taken a \u201ctruly momentous\u201d decision and that he was \u201cproud\u201d?</a> It has taken 50 years for a decision about expanding airport capacity in the south-east to be made. That is laughable.</p> <p>The idea of building new runways in the south-east was first raised in 1968 by the Roskill Commission, set up by the Labour government of the day. It recommended building a new airport at Cublington in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>However, in 1971, the government accepted a rival proposal for a member of the committee to build an airport at Maplin Sands in the Thames estuary, a forerunner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/18/boris-island-airport-what-where\">Boris Island</a>. Neither project went ahead as costs mounted and the 1970s oil crisis gripped Britain. Instead, a redevelopment of Stansted airport \u2013 originally rejected by the commission \u2013 was approved.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Major infrastructure projects require planning, perseverance and patience to be successful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This fudging of the issue has basically been on a loop ever since. Successive governments have pushed backed the decision as business leaders have claimed Britain desperately needs to expand its airport capacity and residents close to Heathrow have said any new development at the airport would be damaging for the environment and their quality of life.</p> <p>The debate about airport capacity involves parties with a serious vested interest. The businesses that have opposed Boris Island and backed Heathrow include British Airways and property company Segro. BA owns more slots \u2013 daily takeoff and landing rights \u2013 than any other airline at Heathrow, while Segro\u2019s business is based on owning valuable warehouses around the airport.</p> <p>It is a government\u2019s job to put these interests to one side and make a decision in the long-term interests of the country. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>\u2019s move to kick the airport decision into the long-grass even after commissioning Sir Howard Davies to study the issue was shameful. Cameron allowed his own vested interests \u2013 Conservative party politics \u2013 to get in the way of Britain\u2019s long-term interests.</p> <p>It is important to go back over the sorry tale of how the government finally came to make a decision, because this is a vital time for Britain. With the country voting to leave the EU, interest rates low, and the economy set to stagnate according to forecasts, the government has an opportunity to use cheap debt to upgrade Britain\u2019s creaking infrastructure. Although these projects could cost billions of pounds, a lot of that cash could be pushed back into the British companies that build them. Around 98% of the companies who built the facilities and provided the materials for the 2012 London Olympics were based in Britain.</p> <p>Major infrastructure projects require planning, perseverance and patience to be successful. They should not simply be signed off willy-nilly. But this is not the same as indecision. </p> <p>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, can use the autumn statement to give the green light to a series of road, rail and telecommunications improvements in Britain. George Osborne, his predecessor, had a habit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/30/osborne-launches-national-infrastructure-commission\">reiterating his commitment to infrastructure without actually pushing projects to a position where construction could actually start</a>. Hammond can signal the start of a new era for British infrastructure projects and boost communities across the country.</p> <h2>John Lewis and gender</h2> <p>Another week, another report on shocking gender equality in business. The World Economic Forum \u2013 best known for organising a high-profile annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland \u2013 has warned it could take 170 years to eradicate the disparity in pay and employment opportunities between men and women.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nickolds has a rare and detailed appreciation of fashion trends and consumer behaviour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the context of this report, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/john-lewis-paula-nickolds-chief-executive-first-female\">appointment of Paula Nickolds as the new managing director of John Lewis stands out. </a></p> <p>Nickolds is the first woman to lead the department store chain in its 152-year history. But what particularly makes the appointment striking is that she has spent 22 years at the company after joining as a graduate trainee. In other words, she has climbed her way to the top. </p> <p>There is a significant difference between a business developing a woman into an executive role and hiring a woman from outside. Too many talented woman are forced to move businesses to climb the career ladder and too many FTSE 100 companies try to add a female voice to their board simply by bringing in a woman who has enjoyed success elsewhere as non-executive director. </p> <p>When you meet Nickolds, it is quickly clear that she has a rare and detailed appreciation of fashion trends and consumer behaviour, and she has long been highly regarded at John Lewis. Nonetheless, she and John Lewis deserve enormous credit for her success and appointment. Other British companies should take note.</p>",

In a year that seems ripe for third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks.</p> <p>Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents and a majority (54%) of Republicans took this position, while less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation across class or race.</p> <p>Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican standard bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump\u2019s low rating is more consistent with the Republican party\u2019s own favourability (36%).</p> <p>The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him.

In a hint of what might have been possible if he had avoided numerous scandals and feuds during his campaign, the research found that 46% of people, including 55% of Republicans, believe the US needs a leader willing to break some rules in order to set things right.</p> <p>There was a modest racial divide on the appeal of a strongman but a clear class divide. A majority (55%) of white working class Americans endorsed the idea whereas less than a third (29%) of those with college degrees agreed.</p> <p>Jones told an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PRRIpoll/videos/vb.38428034839/10154587865909840/?type=2&amp;theater\">audience at the Brookings Institution</a> thinktank in Washington on Tuesday: \u201cIt fits very well with this portrait of Americans who see a very non-responsive political system to their situation.

Only I can solve this problem\u2019 \u2013 I think it\u2019s appealing to this kind of sentiment. It\u2019s people who feel like the system\u2019s largely failed them.

  "<p>A third runway at Heathrow would cause real harm to people\u2019s lives, to wildlife and to the planet (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">Heathrow expansion gets government approval</a>, theguardian.com, 25 October). The third runway will require the demolition of almost 800 homes, result in nearly one million people living under the airport\u2019s flight paths, risk air pollution levels exceeding legal limits and mean Heathrow becomes the biggest single emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the country. The aviation sector is already set to exceed the government\u2019s own target to limit emissions in 2050 to no higher than 2005 levels. Any further runway expansion would break this target, put an unfair and potentially unachievable burden on the rest of the economy to decarbonise, and undermine the UK\u2019s international credibility on climate change. A new runway will also stoke growth in the south-east, leading to greater housing demand in a region that already has a housing crisis.</p> <p>Indeed, a third runway may be undeliverable. The cost to the public purse of the road and rail infrastructure will be colossal \u2013 with potentially huge implications for British taxpayers. The opposition to it ranges from cabinet ministers to campaigners sitting on runways. The prime minister has been forced to take the unusual and probably unprecedented step of allowing cabinet members to dissent on an issue that is not constitutional or a matter of conscience. Local authorities are planning legal action.</p> <p>The last Labour government tried and failed to build a third runway in the face of diverse opposition from local people, Conservative politicians \u2013 including members of the current government\u2019s own cabinet \u2013 environmental NGOs, local authorities, direct action activists and many in the business community and in the trade union movement. That coalition is as strong as ever.</p> <p>Some projects are opposed on simply parochial grounds. A third runway at Heathrow is very different.

The ideal site for this facility would be Thorne Waste near Goole, where massive air traffic would disturb comparatively few people. It would be connected by upgraded rail lines to make the major centres of population accessible within 90 minutes. It would be staffed by workers using fast shuttle services from Doncaster and Scunthorpe. The people of these two towns would jump at the chance of better-paid jobs.

All are low-income families, many with precarious housing, learning difficulties or a disability, many black or immigrant.

  "<p>It is a sign of the British political world\u2019s current priorities that Theresa May has finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\" title=\"\">made the decision to opt for a third runway at Heathrow</a>. She promised it was a decision for \u201c<a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/expansion-of-heathrow-airport-approved-by-ministers-a3377796.html\" title=\"\">jobs and growth</a>\u201d, both of which may be scarcer in the post-Brexit era in which the new runway will come into service. Pumping hope into the economy is now considered worth alienating every Conservative council and MP whose voters live under the flightpath of planes using the new runway, including Mrs May\u2019s own Maidenhead constituents. It is worth at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/zac-goldsmith-quits-as-mp-over-doomed-heathrow-expansion-decision\" title=\"\">one backbench resignation</a> (and maybe a lost byelection) and a novel reinterpretation of the convention about cabinet responsibility in order to accommodate public dissent from at least two ministers. It is worth what will probably be millions of pounds fighting legal challenges over air and noise pollution. Most of all, the decision puts old-fashioned economics firmly ahead of tackling climate change, which turned out not to be worth a single mention in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/airport-capacity\" title=\"\">transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s opening statement</a> to MPs.</p> <p>The decision, which has now to be incorporated into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/24/heathrow-third-runway-expected-to-get-may-cabinet-green-light\" title=\"\">a national policy statement on aviation</a> that MPs will vote on some time in the next 18 months, comes heavily gilded with incentives to local residents to take the money and keep quiet. About 750 homes will be subject to compulsory purchase: \u00a31.5bn has been set aside to pay compensation at the market rate for the unblighted value of each home and for the resettlement costs of the residents. At least another \u00a31bn will be paid out for noise insulation in schools and improvements in public facilities. There&#xa0;will be a new community resource fund. Mr&#xa0;Grayling promised MPs that there would be a 50% increase in travellers arriving at Heathrow by public transport, and the cost of improving road access would fall not to the taxpayer but to the developers. The&#xa0;\u00a317bn bill for development is to be picked up by the developers and not passed on to air passengers. A senior retired judge has been appointed to oversee the consultation period.&#xa0;\u201cThis is not expansion at any cost, but the right scheme at the right price,\u201d Mr&#xa0;Grayling declared.</p> <p>There are many flaws in the government case which a determined opposition will unpick between now and the next general election in 2020. Campaigners, including the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, already plan to make it a central issue. This is the decision of a government that is not prepared to think boldly about the implications of its commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 80% over the next 35 years. Instead, a huge investment will be made in promoting leisure travel (which already accounts for almost two-thirds of journeys in and out of Heathrow) in the name of facilitating business connections.</p> <p>Thousands of jobs will be created \u2013 but they will mainly be for baggage handlers and baristas. Mr Grayling made a commitment to at least six new domestic destinations to enhance UK-wide connectivity, a questionable decision if the government review of HS2, the high speed train that will one day link Glasgow and Edinburgh to London, gives the project the go-ahead. If, on the other hand, HS2 is vetoed, the pressure for more highly polluting short-haul flights will only grow. Expanding air travel will make it harder than ever to cut carbon emissions to meet the targets set out in the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\" title=\"\">newly ratified Paris agreement</a>. Air pollution has an even more immediate effect on the health of the local population. The area around Heathrow already regularly breaches safe levels of nitrogen dioxide and, with expansion, will continue to do so up until 2030. Local councils are threatening a legal challenge on those grounds alone. The lobbying organisation ClientEarth has just taken the government back to court for failing to obey an earlier injunction to produce a national plan for tackling pollution.</p> <p>The scale of an opposition that has been years in preparation may be enough to stall plans altogether. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park who has resigned over the go-ahead, warned Mr Grayling that his plan was doomed. He ought to be right. This is a short-sighted investment that may provide a boost to the economy \u2013 a&#xa0;mere \u00a360bn over 60 years \u2013 at the cost of long-term harm to globally critical climate change objectives. This is no way to run an economy that works for everyone: more flights and greater connectivity will benefit only those who can afford to travel. Those who can\u2019t will&#xa0;gain nothing, not so much as a&#xa0;single airline meal.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Preamble</strong></h2> <p><em>Final, Azteca Stadium, Mexico City, Mexico, Sunday 21 June 1970</em></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s beginning to look like Brazil will realise their dream of becoming the first country to win the World Cup three times, and take home the famous Jules Rimet Trophy for keeps.</strong> They\u2019re hot favourites to win this afternoon, and little wonder: en route to the final they\u2019ve scored 15 goals in five matches, beaten the reigning champions England, seen off the ghosts of 1950 by finally defeating Uruguay at a World Cup, and raised the bar to such an extent that their two most memorable moments are misses, for goodness sake, Pel\u00e9 nearly scoring from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia, and freezing the Uruguayan keeper in amber during the semi with an outrageous dummy, rounding him on one side while the ball went t\u2019other, before finally yanking a shot inches wide. Can anyone stop this famous forward five of Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, Tost\u00e3o, G\u00e9rson and Jairzinho?</p> <p><strong>If anyone can, Italy are your men, for the 1934 and 1938 champs are looking to bag Jules Rimet for good as well.</strong> The current European champions eased their way through qualification, with Luigi Riva, a newly crowned Serie A champion with Sardinian minnows Cagliari, scoring seven times. After a quiet start in the group stage, they\u2019ve reached the final after pelting four goals past hosts Mexico and the highly fancied West Germans. The only problem has been keeping midfield maestro Gianni Rivera happy. Coach Ferruccio Valcaregga doesn\u2019t much like the cut of the Milan star\u2019s jib, it would seem, preferring Sandro Mazzola of Internazionale, who it was thought had been brought to Mexico merely as cover for Rivera. When he replaced Rivera at the start of the tournament, so abrasive was the Golden Boy\u2019s response to being dropped that he was nearly sent home. But as things have panned out, Mazzola\u2019s been playing the first half of the knockout games, with Rivera coming on for the second. What a carry-on. And to think Valcaregga is paid to make decisions! It\u2019s a decision of sorts, I suppose, and eight goals in two games suggests it\u2019s working, but you have to wonder how this might pan out now we\u2019re down to the nitty gritty.</p> <p><strong>Whoever plays, this final is being viewed as a battle for the philosophical heart of soccer, the flair and panache of the south Americans versus the wily catenaccio of the Azzurri. </strong>Broad brush strokes, of course - Italy\u2019s eight in the last two matches, again - but it\u2019s not totally unfair. Either way, it\u2019s expected to be a close one, with Brazil fancied to edge it, much as they did against England. Though in fairness the contest would be a damn sight harder to call if it wasn\u2019t being played in this heat and altitude, especially as G\u00e9rson, the brains of Brazil, is on 40 gaspers a day.</p> <p><strong>Valcaregga has made another decision! And it\u2019s to keep that preposterous Mazzola-Rivera <em>staffetta</em></strong> <strong>(relay) policy going: </strong>Enrico Albertosi, Tarcisio Burgnich, Giacinto Facchetti, Mario Bertini, Roberto Rosato, Pierluigi Cera, Angelo Domenghini, Sandro Mazzola, Roberto Boninsegna, Giancarlo De Sisti, Luigi Riva.</p> <p><strong>Brazil, a teamsheet which conjures up so many vivid images it reads like a modernist poem: </strong>Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Clodoaldo, Brito, Piazza, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o, Pel\u00e9, Rivelino. So much depends on Brazil, glazed with rain water. It\u2019s a humid, oppressive afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>The highest of high noons: 12 midday.</p> <h2>Buildup</h2> <p><strong>A heady atmosphere in the Azteca, then, which is filled to the brim, 112,000 people. </strong>Sailing off into the ether are four humongous beachball-balloons, one bedecked in the blue-and-green of Brazil, another in the Italian tricolore and therefore totally out of sync with the national team strip, and a couple with huge Mexico 70 logos stamped on them. That brazen branding\u2019s going to give someone at Fifa ideas.</p> <p><strong>The players line up to get their photos taken, Brazil looking grim faced, the weight of expectation weighing heavily. </strong>The scene quickly descends into mayhem. Bedlam bedlam bedlam. The pitch fills with some official-looking folk, and very many unofficial-looking folk. An awful lot of photographers and assorted hangers-on. The World Cup final\u2019s going to kick off in less than 60 seconds, for goodness sake, will you all please bugger off!</p> <p><strong>Amid the madness, </strong><strong>Pel\u00e9</strong><strong> swooshes around warming up, completing several little circles to make one big, baroque, semi-circular swoop of the field, a one-man whirling waltzer.</strong> Attempt to avoid clich\u00e9s all you like, but just try watching him move without picking up a samba earworm. Speaking of resorting to stereotypes, up the other end of the field, the Italians are huddled around several severe gentlemen in trenchcoats, looking for all the world like they\u2019re striking an import-export agreement which won\u2019t necessarily involve passing through any of the major designated ports.</p> <h2>First half</h2> <p><strong>Handshakes between captains Giacinto Facchetti and Carlos Alberto, the latter winning the toss and insisting the teams switch direction. And with the field quickly swept of clingers-on, we\u2019re off!</strong> Boninsegna gets the ball rolling. It\u2019s not long before Italy lose the ball and Jairzinho is skittering down the right. Pel\u00e9 goes down looking for a free kick, but he\u2019s full of sauce.</p> <p><strong>2 min: </strong>Pel\u00e9\u2019s full of energy, too, and speedily exchanges passes with Tost\u00e3o down the inside-left channel. For a second it looks like he\u2019ll break clear, but Bertini is covering and passes back to the keeper. Italy waste no time in tearing down the right themselves, the ball eventually being shuttled inside to Riva, who unleashes a rising heatseeker towards goal. What a shot! Felix tips over magnificently. The corner is an easy one for the keeper. What a start, though.</p> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Bertini hacks down Pel\u00e9 as the latter chases after a sliderule Carlos Alberto pass down the right. What glorious hoodlummery. Free kick. G\u00e9rson looks to bend it, but slips as he takes, and his low left-to-right curler is easily gathered by Albertosi.</p> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Everaldo hares down the left and sends a daisycutter to the near post. Albertosi gathers, but looks to have carried the ball over the touchline for a corner. It\u2019s not given, though. This is a high-octane start, and Brazil are almost immediately coming back at Italy, down the middle at pace after Jairzinho picks up a loose Domenghini pass from the right wing. He\u2019s clattered to the floor on the edge of the D by Facchetti. Another free kick.</p> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Pel\u00e9 dummies. Rivelino blooters the set piece onto the roof. Haw.</p> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Mazzola exchanges passes with Riva to advance down the inside left, but his eventual shot is weak and wafts into the arms of Felix.</p> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Carlos Alberto floats a cross into the Italian area from the right. At the far post, Albertosi should let it fly out for a goal kick but panics and punches behind. He\u2019s not the only one not quite on his game; Rivelino, after that free kick, now hits a corner miles into the sky and straight out of play on the other side.</p> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Rivelino slips on the turf and skitters across it on his arse. An undignified climax to an undistinguished start.</p> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> A bit of space for Riva down the left, but with men in the middle he has a rush of blood and shoots speculatively from the corner of the box. That\u2019s not beating Felix from there.</p> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Italy have settled into this a little bit now. Domenghini tries to score from the best part of 40 yards while out on the touchline, some respect please for the love of god. The shot pings off poor Wilson Piazza\u2019s coupon and out for a corner on the left.</p> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Mazzola slides the corner back to Facchetti, who floats the ball into the box. It\u2019s punched clear by a jabbering Felix, but only to Mazzola, whose first-time shot is blocked and balloons out towards De Sisti, who is clattered by Pel\u00e9. Free kick, 35 yards out, just to the left of goal. Brazil line up a wall, but there\u2019s a laughably large gap in their defence to its right. Mazzola floats the ball over the head of the lurking Boninsegna, and right onto the forehead of the onrushing Riva, who really should score from a slight angle, 12 yards out. Instead his effort loops over the bar. That\u2019s an appalling miss, really, and nearly as bad as Brazil\u2019s defending.</p> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Clodoaldo misjudges a high pass down the right, allowing Domenghini to make good down the wing. He rolls the ball inside to Boninsegna, the Italians three on three. But with Riva to his left, he decides to tiptoe through two challenges on the edge of the box and his glory run is halted by Piazza, who tackles him with his big arse.</p> <p><strong>18 min: GOAL!!! Brazil 1-0 Italy</strong> Tost\u00e3o drops a shoulder down the left and whips a cross in towards Pel\u00e9, but it\u2019s headed back and out for a throw by the stooping Facchetti. The Italians do not heed the warning. Receiving Tost\u00e3o\u2019s throw, Rivelino leans back and loops a high cross into the box, Pel\u00e9 getting the jump on Burgnich and clattering a majestic header into the bottom right, Albertosi late to react. That\u2019s Brazil\u2019s 100th goal in World Cups. Not bad timing, eh? Pel\u00e9 is lifted into the air by Jairzinho\u2019s bearhug, and punches the sky three times. You\u2019ll see that celebration again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7dce70daa325bf087ee988e7195c9fb9fbfb715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7dce70daa325bf087ee988e7195c9fb9fbfb715/0_25_5322_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pel\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9, right, leaps above Tarcisio Burgnich to head Brazil in front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b13be83f4a5942126434836d4b3ed33396d9c1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b13be83f4a5942126434836d4b3ed33396d9c1c5/18_0_1386_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pel\u00e9 celebrates Brazil\u2019s opener.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9 celebrates Brazil\u2019s opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Hilariously, and preposterously, Brazil make no effort whatsoever to regroup for the kick off, and are all buggering around deep in their own half when Italy get the ball moving again. The ball\u2019s flicked out to Domenghini, who powers down the wing, cuts inside, and hammers a low shot towards the bottom right, Felix doing well to claim. That was staggeringly inept.</p> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> G\u00e9rson sends a crossfield ball to the right for Carlos Alberto, who ten yards from the touchline and with the angle preposterous, decides to go for the spectacular. He achieves it: a spectacularly awful slice off the side of his boot straight behind and into the crowd. He has the chutzpah to look down and blame his footwear. At least there\u2019s plenty of time left in which to showcase better technique, Carlos.</p> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> After a period of sterile Brazilian possession, a cock-up. Everaldo passes back down the left wing to Piazza, who sidefoots inside to Brito. Brito attempts to flick a casual one back to the left for Clodoaldo, but Riva nips in to block the lazy pass and hare after it down the middle. Felix comes out of his box, wallops clear, and waves angrily at his defence. Don\u2019t. Do. That. Again. Or else!</p> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> It\u2019s raining, the sun\u2019s gone, it\u2019s humid. Bah. Domenghini embarks on a Power Run down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s upended by Jair, but the referee waves play on, perhaps thinking the Italian had slipped over on the greasy turf. Then Mazzola, from the left, lifts a diagonal ball towards Riva at the far post, but Piazza is ahead of the striker, rises to head, dummies, and lets the ball bounce out of play. Italy have finally woken up.</p> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Free kick to Brazil, 20 yards out on the left, level with the left-hand side of the area, after Bertini scythes through the back of Rivelino. The Italians line up a five-man wall. Rivelino shapes to have a shot, but sprints straight past the ball. Pel\u00e9 rushes in and chips a perfectly weighted ball after Rivelino. The five Italians spin and turn then crash to the floor like pissed-up circus performers. Rivelino, on the run, shapes to whip a cross into the middle, where G\u00e9rson, Jairzinho and Tost\u00e3o are lining up to belt home from six yards. But he hesitates for a fatal microsecond, allowing the ball to skid off the turf and out for a goal kick, despite a desperate late lunge. Such a clever pass from Pel\u00e9, though, threaded along a route to the left of the wall and the right of Rivelino, inviting the cross.</p> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Italy so nearly cleave Brazil in two. From the centre circle, Domenghini slides the ball forward to Riva, who with his back to goal 30 yards out plays a first-time flick onward to Mazzola, and gets clattered by Piazza for his trouble. The referee waves play on, as Mazzola is clear of the backtracking Tost\u00e3o and advances towards the area, but on the edge of the D, Brito slides in majestically. He\u2019s not letting that ball get past.</p> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Pel\u00e9 goes on a meander down the inside-right channel, and is upended by Burgnich. He rolls over on his side once, then executes two head-first roly-polies, all in one smooth Olympic-gymnast-standard movement, a technique that comes with a difficulty tariff of 6.0. Applause. The Italian is shown the yellow card, and doesn\u2019t seem to care very much. Brazil\u2019s trainer trots on with bucket and sponge to attend to Pel\u00e9, but is angrily told to chip off by the referee, who furiously flaps his hands in the dismissive style. Pel\u00e9 is still on the floor moaning, but there\u2019s naff all wrong with him, the big gurner.</p> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Rivelino\u2019s resulting free kick finds the top-left corner. Of the stand behind the goal. That\u2019s the worst free kick ever taken in a World Cup final, surely. Rivelino looks down at his wet boot, and the soft turf, but is fooling nobody.</p> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Mazzola sends a long, speculative ball towards the Brazilian box from the halfway line. Riva, his back to goal, is tugged back by Piazza on the edge of the area. Free kick to Italy, on the right-hand edge of the D.</p> <p><strong>30 min: </strong>Bertini knocks it left to Riva, who skelps it straight at the Brazilian wall, and makes a desperate claim for a handball penalty. No dice. The ball comes back to Bertini, who lifts a fairly aimless snapshot high and wide right.</p> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Italy are snapping away at the heels of the Brazilians. Boninsegna slides in on G\u00e9rson and offers him his hand by way of apology, but the Brazilian\u2019s not having it. Brazil look slightly shaken, though. Boninsegna turns Piazza 25 yards out then fizzes a low ball just right of goal. The not-always-dependable Felix had it covered all the way.</p> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> From the restart Felix reverts to type, throwing an awkward ball out wide to Carlos Alberto, who sees it balloon over his head for a throw to Italy. As the sun comes out, Mazzola takes up possession from the throw and slides the ball left to De Sisti, who draws three men before twinkletoeing the ball back inside to Mazzola. From a standing start, Mazzola turns on the burners and dances past three challenges, flicks a quick one-two off De Sisti to his left, then powers into the box and takes a shot from a tight angle. But Brito and G\u00e9rson have crowded round him, and the ball\u2019s blocked out for a corner. From the set piece, Felix, mopping up his own mess, sends a punch almost to the halfway line.</p> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Some space for Clodoaldo down the right. He whips a cross into the box and finds Pel\u00e9, eight yards out, but O Rei heads over, and he\u2019s offside anyway. The king\u2019s crown slips.</p> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> A mad scramble on the edge of the Italian area. Jairzinho bombs down the middle and attempts a one-two with Tost\u00e3o. On receiving the return, he\u2019s stopped mid-flight by Burgnich\u2019s sliding tackle, but still manages to nick the ball down the inside-left for Pel\u00e9, who immediately flicks one back into the middle for Tost\u00e3o. The forward breaks into the box before hitting a weak cross-cum-shot in the general direction of the left-hand corner and the onrushing Jairzinho. Italy hack clear.</p> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Rivelino drops a shoulder to glide past Bertini down the inside right. As he cuts inside, Bertini is so wrongfooted he inadvertently performs the splits across the skiddy turf. That might make a couple of bobbles on the pitch. Rivelino pokes an awful effort miles left of the target, and as high as a house to boot. He gets pelters from the bench. A full and frank exchange of views ensues. His shooting has been hilariously poor so far.</p> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Riva sends a weak daisycutter a couple of yards wide right. For all Italy\u2019s intricate build-up play, Felix hasn\u2019t had much to do.</p> <p><strong>37 min: FARCICAL GOAL!!! Brazil 1-1 Italy.</strong> Pel\u00e9 looks to turn Burgnich in the Italian area, but the defender\u2019s having none of it, banging an interception upfield with no little authority. Everaldo chases back down the Italian right flank to collect, turning the ball inside to Piazza, who floats a needlessly dangerous chip across his back line. It drops towards Brito, who has Riva nearby but still enough time to deal with the problem. He doesn\u2019t, though. He heads inside to Clodoaldo who, unaware Boninsegna is lurking, attempts an adventurous blind backflick out towards Piazza, still on the Brazil left. Boninsegna intercepts and, though never quite in control, barrels clear down the inside right. Brito is coming over to meet him from the middle, while Felix races rashly out of his box. Cue komik kutz on the edge of the D, and proof that Brazil really did learn nothing from all that fannying around on 23 minutes. Brito\u2019s sliding challenge, coming in towards Boninsegna from the left, is weak and mistimed, the ball clattering off his heel and into the middle. His useless contribution has also had the effect of taking Felix out of the game, the keeper having turned up to the melee a millisecond too late. Felix puts the brakes on and attempts to change direction, but he knows the game is up. Boninsegna scampers after the ball and, although Riva gets in the way with a view to nabbing the goal himself, wraps his left leg around his cheeky team-mate to hook the ball into the bottom right of the empty net. He races off with arms out wide before being smothered by Domenghini and Mazzola. Riva doesn\u2019t join in, the mardy get.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e85853ffc8241bc38a0e9e1535618ad54aa77c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e85853ffc8241bc38a0e9e1535618ad54aa77c91/0_359_5390_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Boninsegna, centre, hunts down the loose ball after the Brazil goalkeeper Felix\u2019s challenge, before equalising for Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Boninsegna, centre, hunts down the loose ball after the Brazil goalkeeper Felix\u2019s challenge, before equalising for Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario De Biasi/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Brazil try to respond immediately, Rivelino bursting down the left and winning a free kick, then swinging a dangerous-looking ball down the corridor of uncertainty before Albertosi punches clear.</p> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> The sun is shimmering now. Mazzola instigates a gorgeous sweeping Italian move from deep, jigging his way out of trouble near his own area down the left before clipping a ball out to Facchetti, who shuttles the ball up the flank to Boninsegna. Facing back down the pitch, he draws two Brazilian players and, with the full knowledge he\u2019s going to be cleaned out by Carlos Alberto, plays a reverse ball down the wing to Riva, who makes good for the box and wins a corner off Brito, the defender doing well to stop the striker taking a shot. Back upfield, Carlos Alberto and Boninsegna are both receiving treatment, the former having been clocked in the coupon upon clattering the latter. The pair respectfully apologise to each other like adults, proving that this game really can be beautiful even when the participants are wantonly fouling each other.</p> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Nothing comes of the corner, despite Mazzola\u2019s promptings. Brazil flood upfield, Rivelino threatening to break clear down the right. Now it\u2019s Pel\u00e9\u2019s turn to prompt, and he sets up the onrushing G\u00e9rson, who screws a poor effort wide left.</p> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Domenghini launches a low, rising shot straight at Felix, who nearly dives all around it, but eventually gathers midway through the pudding course.</p> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Rivelino is booked for a petulant backflick on Bertini, who has come from behind to whip the ball off his toe. Bertini holds his thigh. For a second, it looks like the referee is going to show the Brazilian a red \u2013 the card\u2019s in his hand, visible to all \u2013 but he ostentatiously flashes yellow to all four stands. But then lhe ets Rivelino see the red card, pointing to the bench as if to say: \u201cOne more like that, son, and you\u2019ll see this one too.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Brazil 1-1 Italy, though it probably should be Brazil 2-1 Italy!</strong> So how\u2019s this for a farcical end to the half? Despite Rivelino\u2019s booking for retaliation, the referee has awarded a free kick to Brazil for the original Bertini challenge. Very strange. From the left touchline, G\u00e9rson loops a high ball into the area. It drops over the head of an out-of-position Burgnich, who falls backwards as the ball lands at Pel\u00e9\u2019s feet, ten yards out, level with the far post and with only the keeper to beat. But instead of playing on, Pel\u00e9 throws his hands up in disgust. Why\u2019s he pausing?! It\u2019s half-time, that\u2019s why! The referee\u2019s blown his whistle early \u2013 45 minutes aren\u2019t quite up \u2013 and Pel\u00e9 is understandably beside himself with the rage! He still manages to convert, despite the red mist, flicking the ball into the bottom-left corner and clattering Cera, coming across to cover, on the shoe while he\u2019s at it. Cera gets right up in Pel\u00e9\u2019s grille to remonstrate, pointing at his instep, and Pel\u00e9\u2019s suddenly surrounded by a raging sea of blue shirts. Nobody\u2019s got a clue what\u2019s going on, until the referee, ball wedged under his armpit, strides through the melee and wanders off the pitch for a fag and a cup of tea.</p> <h2>Second half</h2> <p><strong>And we\u2019re off again! </strong>No changes, which is something of a surprise as Valcareggi was expected to continue with this <em>staffetta</em> malarkey, and replace Mazzola with Rivera at the break. Understandable, perhaps, because Mazzola had an excellent first half, but remember this policy saw Italy score four times in both quarters and semis, so it\u2019s a brave decision. Brazil set us in motion again.</p> <p><strong>46 min: </strong>Valcareggi\u2019s nearly vindicated from the off, as Mazzola picks the ball up deep and flicks the ball to Domenghini, who slides a long pass up the inside-left channel for Boninsegna. The forward shuttles it on immediately, into the path of Mazzola who has kept surging forward. Everaldo steps in to poke back to Felix, just as it looked like Mazzola would break into the box.</p> <p><strong>47 min: </strong>Carlos Alberto is sent striding clear on the overlap. He fires a ball straight through the six-yard box. Pel\u00e9 slides in at the far post, but misses the ball and clatters his wrist on the post.</p> <p><strong>50 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson clips a high ball down the middle, into the Italian area. Pel\u00e9 stumbles as he tussles with Facchetti, then races off after the referee, miming a tug on his sleeve. The big man\u2019s bopping around with the heat on. It really wasn\u2019t much of a challenge.</p> <p><strong>52 min: </strong>Burgnich upends Pel\u00e9 in the roughhouse fashion, 30 yards out on the right. Rivelino takes what Hugh Johns on ITV calls a \u201cfast-bowler\u2019s run-up\u201d and batters a rising, swerving shot towards the right of goal. Albertosi parries it with strong arms, and Italy hack clear. Brazil come straight back at them. G\u00e9rson goes on a Power Jog down the inside right. His one-two with Tost\u00e3o on the edge of the box doesn\u2019t quite come off, but the ball loops towards Pel\u00e9, who is obstructed by Burgnich as the Italian attempts an overhead clearance. Indirect free kick! Or, as the caption has it: <em>tiro indirecto</em>!</p> <p><strong>53 min: </strong>On ITV, Bobby Moore thinks it should be a penalty for dangerous play. But t<em>iro indirecto</em> it is. Pel\u00e9 feathers the ball to the right for G\u00e9rson, who blooters hopelessly into the Italian wall. Insult is nearly added to injury as Facchetti breaks upfield along the left. The ball\u2019s funnelled inside and across the pitch to Domenghini, bombing in acres down the right. He hammers a shot towards the bottom-left corner. Everaldo comes across, sticks a boot out, and nearly deflects the thing into the bottom right. That was inches away. Domenghini waves both of his fists, then pumps them, in frustration. Rosato heads a weak effort over the bar from the resulting corner.</p> <p><strong>55 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson is looking increasingly dangerous, a testament to his daily multipack cheroot regime. Again he bursts down the inside right, again a one-two with Tost\u00e3o doesn\u2019t quite come off. He was very nearly clean through on goal there.</p> <p><strong>56 min: </strong>Rivelino twists on the ball through 360 degrees, takes a couple of steps down the inside right channel, drifts inside, then hoicks an effort over the bar. Italy go up the other end through the increasingly attack-minded Mazzola, who has a sortie down the inside-right flank himself and shovels a poor shot miles over from distance. This is good to-and-fro stuff, and not wholly predictable, even if Brazil are gaining a little momentum.</p> <p><strong>58 min: </strong>Rivelino begins a determined sashay towards the Italian box, drifting in from the left. He\u2019s scythed down by Bertini, who cuts his feet off with one cynical swish from behind. Pel\u00e9\u2019s free kick from a central position 25 yards out is a new Worst Of All Time, some going given Rivelino\u2019s attempt half an hour earlier, shooting off at a 45-degree angle towards the top-right corner of the stand behind the goal. A place-kicker in rugby would struggle to set a ball off along that flight. Ee, he\u2019s a poor lad.</p> <p><strong>59 min: RIVELINO HITS THE BAR! </strong>Another free kick for Brazil, just outside the area, after Facchetti linked arms to do-se-do Jairzinho out of a one-two with Tost\u00e3o. <em>Tiro indirecto!</em> From the edge of the D, G\u00e9rson knocks the ball to the right for Rivelino, who twangs the crossbar with a rising thunderer. Goal kick. Bobby Moore reckons it\u2019s the first time Rivelino has used his right foot all tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t use it more often!\u201d Especially the way he\u2019d been shooting up to this point.</p> <p><strong>61 min: </strong>Brazil are becoming the dominant force now. Pel\u00e9 looks to dance round Burgnich down the right and into the area, but he\u2019s barged off the ball and is appealing to the referee by waving his hands in the air as he falls backwards. <em>Tiro directo!</em> Rivelino batters it over the bar and is battered himself by Riva as he\u2019s taking it. Another <em>tiro directo!</em> Riva looks astonished and disgusted at the same time, an Italian speciality. Rivelino skelps the second effort into the wall, a trick G\u00e9rson repeats with the loose ball.</p> <p><strong>63 min: </strong>An increasingly rare sojourn upfield for Italy as Boninsegna finds space down the left and loops a cross to the far post for Riva, who bangs a header into Everaldo\u2019s back from a tight angle, a couple of yards out. The corner\u2019s met by Mazzola, whose header sails along a gentle parabola towards Felix. The keeper skips into the air in the style of a morris dancer after one mead too many, and punches a feeble effort a couple of yards to his right. Fortunately Carlos Alberto is on hand to sweep up. \u201cWhat an incredible man to have behind you if you\u2019re a defender in this brilliant Brazilian side,\u201d notes a tinder-dry Hugh Johns.</p> <p><strong>65 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson has the run of the middle of the park. He\u2019s been running the show since half time, only moving upfield since the restart, after which the Italians have had no time to formulate one of their trademark defensive lockdowns. Clever G\u00e9rson. Clever Brazil. He sets a move in motion down the right, Clodoaldo feeding Carlos Alberto, who whips a cross towards Tost\u00e3o at the far post. The forward can\u2019t control his header, which screws well wide left.</p> <p><strong>66 min: THIS HAS BEEN COMING!!! Brazil 2-1 Italy. </strong>G\u00e9rson has the run of the park all right. His beautiful reverse ball sets Everaldo on a probe down the inside left. Jairzinho takes up possession and makes for the edge of the D. He\u2019s tracked by Facchetti, who sticks a toe in. The ball breaks to G\u00e9rson, who has been loitering in the middle. He takes two little taps to the left, before twisting and walloping a mid-height cross-shot into the right-hand side of the net. Boninsegna slid in with a tackle, while Albertosi flung himself across goal, but neither made it in time. G\u00e9rson races off with arms aloft, a cheesy grin across his boat. Reserve keeper Ado leads a delegation off the bench to celebrate the achievement. Brazil are 24 minutes away from becoming world football\u2019s first three-time champions!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e9e69a16fdc0e2269863c37955432dfcbb03b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e9e69a16fdc0e2269863c37955432dfcbb03b42/0_286_2080_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rivelino (11) embraces goalscorer G\u00e9rson celebrate after Brazil\u2019s second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rivelino (11) embraces goalscorer G\u00e9rson celebrate after Brazil\u2019s second goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PLP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>67 min: </strong>Straight from kick off, Domenghini is brought down by Everaldo along the right touchline, 12 yards from the byline. The Italian gets up and attempts to beat Felix at his near post with an outrageous attempt. The effort\u2019s outrageous all right, sliced straight out of play, ten yards to the right of goal. He walks back upfield with his head hung low, abjectly defeated and humiliated. Pel\u00e9\u2019s reign as taker of Worst Free Kick Of All Time has lasted all of nine minutes.</p> <p><strong>68 min: </strong>The stunning G\u00e9rson eats up most of the pitch as he scampers down the inside right. He rolls a pass inside to Tost\u00e3o, who attempts to turn Facchetti but fails and executes a rather embarrassing dive instead. Italy move upfield through Domenghini, who is checked by Pel\u00e9. He responds by shoving the Brazilian in the chest. Pel\u00e9 falls backwards like he\u2019s catching a cannonball, then rather absurdly grabs his left shin as he hits the ground. The ref clearly considers this a whole load of nonsense, and ostentatiously refuses to allow Pel\u00e9 to receive any treatment, ordering the bald guy with the bucket and sponge back off the field for the second time. And just like before, Pel\u00e9\u2019s soon back on his feet again. Good old ref.</p> <p><strong>69 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson has been brilliant since the restart, having kept his cards close to his chest for so long, though whether he\u2019s within his rights to attempt to score from 40 yards now is a moot point.</p> <p><strong>70 min: </strong>Domenghini leaves a leg in as Pel\u00e9 glides past. Pel\u00e9 flips himself miles into the air, a triple pike with salchow and a difficulty tariff of 34. This is gloriously petulant behaviour all round. The referee can\u2019t be bothered with any of it, and simply gestures that they\u2019re to get up and stop behaving like a couple of spoilt brats.</p> <p><strong>71 min: SURELY THE CLINCHER!!! Brazil 3-1 Italy. </strong>From the resulting free kick, just to the left of the centre circle, G\u00e9rson left-foot-wands a raking crossfield ball into the area towards Pel\u00e9, level with the right-hand post. Burgnich is completely lost. And beaten. He turns around to see Pel\u00e9 rise above him. Pel\u00e9 plants a header down and across the face of the six-yard box. Jairzinho races in and thighs the ball into the bottom-left corner, evading the desperate lunges of Cera and Albertosi. He tries to finish with a flourish, but his wild hoof becomes a fresh-air swipe, and the ball makes its own way in, almost apologetically. That\u2019s a goal in every game of the finals for the Botafogo striker, who races off in the arms-aloft G\u00e9rsonian style, before sinking to his knees in prayer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9566c004e9186709fc47242e525fe7c3dc2f5561\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9566c004e9186709fc47242e525fe7c3dc2f5561/0_0_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairzinho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairzinho celebrates after walking the ball into the net for his side\u2019s third goal, making him the first player to score a goal in every game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolls Press/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2345620fc4bc5e0c7434d9182139b79f11304fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2345620fc4bc5e0c7434d9182139b79f11304fe/0_0_4159_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairzinho slides on to his knees as his team-mates rush to join him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairzinho slides on to his knees as his team-mates rush to join him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>72 min: </strong>To illustrate the ragged mental state of the normally impervious Italians, as they kick off, six of them are loitering around the centre spot, like folk waiting for the bus home. Perhaps they want to get on the bus home. They look broken. This has been a G\u00e9rson masterclass. He attempts to replicate his goal by launching another left-footed stinger from the edge of the area, but it\u2019s straight at Albertosi.</p> <p><strong>74 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson walks through the centre circle with the ball at his feet. We\u2019ve got to the stage where nobody even bothers to challenge him.</p> <p><strong>75 min: </strong>Rivelino is checked by De Sisti on the left-hand edge of the area. Free kick. Before it can be taken, a limping Bertini falls in the centre circle and is replaced by Juliano, the first substitution in any World Cup final. G\u00e9rson taps the free kick to the right for Pel\u00e9 to embarrass himself with a witless blooter that\u2019s high and miles wide right.</p> <p><strong>76 min: </strong>Mazzola, so quiet this half, turns on the burners down the inside left, and attempts a one-two on the edge of the area with Riva, but the striker can\u2019t control. Mazzola\u2019s hands rise towards his temples in impotent frustration, though his irritation surely isn\u2019t anything on that of Rivera, still tethered to the bench.</p> <p><strong>78 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson slides Rivelino clear into the left-hand side of the area. He takes a first-time hack at the ball, screwing it well left of the target.</p> <p><strong>79 min: </strong>Mazzola cuts in from the right and feeds Boninsegna, who turns and looks for the bottom left from the edge of the D. It\u2019s accurate, but without power. Felix saves comfortably, which is a phrase for the ages. Brazil break upfield. Tost\u00e3o pokes Pel\u00e9 clear into the area. Pel\u00e9 should score, but his sidefoot towards the right-hand side of the net is smothered brilliantly by the desperate Albertosi. The flag\u2019s up, so none of this counts, a real shame for the keeper, who\u2019d just won a personal showdown with the best player in the world.</p> <p><strong>80 min: </strong>The last chance for Italy to get back into this match, perhaps, is squandered. Juliano, from a position down the inside right, scoops a clever pass forward towards Mazzola, who is screaming for the ball in space, 25 yards from goal in the centre. He turns, and has time to shoot, but takes a second too long and is forced to drift to the right and clip a cross into the mix instead. There\u2019s a brief stramash involving Riva and Boninsegna, the latter eventually thrashing a wild effort miles over from the left-hand side of the box, but by then the Brazilians were swarming around and the door of opportunity which had opened momentarily for Mazzola had long been slammed shut.</p> <p><strong>83 min: </strong>A few passes in the Brazilian half for Italy, but Riva and Boninsegna are far too ponderous. Brazil show them how it\u2019s done, Everaldo springing forward on a no-nonsense run and nearly getting in a shot on goal from a tight angle down the left. He wins a corner, planting his studs into the keeper\u2019s nut as he does so.</p> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> As Albertosi receives a wet sponge to the head, Boninsegna is replaced by Rivera. So much for the half-time <em>staffetta</em>.</p> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Rivera gets his first meaningful touch, 25 yards from goal. He drops a shoulder past G\u00e9rson, but Everaldo is quickly across to get a foot in. Six minutes for the European Player of the Year with his side two down, what chance does he have?</p> <p><strong>86 min: THE ICING ON THE CAKE, THE BOW ON THE BOX, THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT! Brazil 4-1 Italy.</strong> What a thing of beauty this is, nothing short of a masterclass, football\u2019s pinnacle finally reached, Brazil planting the flag. The Italian substitute Juliano hares down the right, but Tost\u00e3o takes the ball off him like candy from a baby suffering from heat exhaustion and altitude sickness despite only being in the pram for 11 minutes. Tost\u00e3o dispatches the ball back to Brito, who rolls it forward to Clodoaldo. The ball\u2019s clipped in a short-range triangle, first Pel\u00e9, then G\u00e9rson, then back to Clodoaldo \u2013 cue TV caption \u2019<strong>41</strong> - who drops and raises his shoulders like a laughing policeman, tying Rivera, Domenghini, De Sisti and Juliano up in knots. He strokes the ball wide left to Rivelino who, inside his own half, curls a pinpoint pass down the line to Jairzinho. Just ahead of the box, the striker cuts inside past Italian captain Facchetti, then clips the ball across Cera to Pel\u00e9, facing goal in front of the D. Burgnich closes him down, but Tost\u00e3o \u2013 who\u2019s made it all the way upfield after starting the move and is now behind Burgnich, also facing Pel\u00e9 \u2013 gives the King the eyebrows to the Brazilian right. Pel\u00e9 takes the hint and rolls a perfect ball out wide; it sits up, allowing Carlos Alberto to evade the despairing lunge of Rosato, who has fruitlessly attempted to come across and block, and skelp it into the bottom corner past Albertosi. Only two outfield Brazilians were not involved in that move \u2013 Everaldo and Piazza. With a beautiful symmetry, only two Italians, Mazzola and Riva, were completely out of the picture and can therefore wash their hands of it. God almighty, what a move, what a strike, what a final statement to make in a World Cup!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28a229511dae33f7c415e50156f5a889b0809583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28a229511dae33f7c415e50156f5a889b0809583/99_0_2801_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Alberto, right, scores Brazil\u2019s fourth goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Alberto, right, scores Brazil\u2019s fourth goal at the end of a wonderful team move.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7754866fdcb82fb8dd0118a9eb1a884b235da640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7754866fdcb82fb8dd0118a9eb1a884b235da640/0_141_2848_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Alberto celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Alberto celebrates his strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ce6d3597640b78f88020973ed205a9a7171d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ce6d3597640b78f88020973ed205a9a7171d98/0_413_2320_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian players celebrate after the goal which finished Italy off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>87 min: </strong>As the Brazilians cavort behind Italy\u2019s goal, the Mexican television caption \u2013 <strong>ANOTADOR! SCORER! *4 CARLOS ALBERTO</strong> \u2013 washes out the entire picture. It\u2019s almost as though we\u2019ve reached the end of the reel, this is the end, we can go no further, Brazil have finished off football as well as Italy. Where else can the story be taken from there?</p> <p><strong>88 min: </strong>Carlos Alberto is surrounded by photographers \u2013 on the pitch! Finally they bugger off and we restart. Rivera has a resigned shot which Felix swallows up without fuss. Pel\u00e9 sends another ball goalwards from the halfway line, but this time it\u2019s a gentle backpass. Rivelino goes on a determined run down the inside-left channel and is upended when he makes the box by Juliano. If this was 0-0, that\u2019d be a penalty, but the referee decides to show Italy some mercy. Brazil deserve to win, and have been so good during the second half that the three-goal margin doesn\u2019t particularly flatter them. And yet this excellent Italian side doesn\u2019t deserve to be spanked in the biggest match of all by a margin of four.</p> <p><strong>90 min: </strong>There\u2019s been plenty of bloody awful shooting in this match, and perhaps the most egregious hack has been saved for last, a Domenghini shank which nestles in row Z, but only after rebounding from the seats behind. The crowd refuse to give the souvenir back. Time\u2019s up, but the referee refuses to blow until a ball\u2019s on the pitch. This is farcical. Eventually a new orb is presented to him. He hands it to Rivelino to give to Felix.</p> <p><strong>90 min +2: </strong>This is bedlam. Now the original ball has been dispatched back onto the field of play! One fan pops out of the stand and goes on a speedy skitter down the Brazilian right, which is better than some of the Italians have managed. Felix restarts the game and Rivera nearly takes his ankles out with a petulant lunge. The ball\u2019s hoicked upfield, in the general environs of another encroaching punter who\u2019s sporting a sombrero and poncho. \u00a1Arriba! At which point referee Rudi Glockner raises both arms ...</p> <p><strong>IT\u2019S OVER!!! BRAZIL ARE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND WILL GET TO KEEP THE JULES RIMET TROPHY!!! Brazil 4-1 Italy. </strong>Within seconds of the final whistle, Pel\u00e9 is mobbed. Hundreds of fans are on the field. Firecrackers crack their fire. Pel\u00e9 is lifted shoulder high. He\u2019s already been divested of his shirt. But someone does give him one of those sombreros to wedge onto his noggin, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts when it comes to wardrobe inventory. This has quickly descended into a rare old brouhaha. But there\u2019s Carlos Alberto lifting the glistening Jules Rimet trophy to the sky.

But during the mid-1970s, when Latvia was a Soviet republic, the skyline was blighted by a multi-storey concrete shell that became, after many delays, the <a href=\"http://guide.rietumu.ru/en/list/1/67\" title=\"\">Intourist hotel</a>.</p> <p>This eyesore was the subject of a local joke: a tour guide is showing a group of westerners around the city. One asks about the monstrosity looming over the city and is told the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s a hotel that they\u2019ve been building for years.\u201d This being the USSR, there is a KGB informant in the group. He upbraids the guide: \u201cComrade, you have cast aspersions on the efficiency of Soviet industry. Don\u2019t let it happen again!\u201d Sure enough, on the next tour, the same question comes up. \u201cWhat is that concrete tower?\u201d asks one of the tourists. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d replies the guide. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>The story captures the way communist central planning combined ineffectiveness and insensitivity to the environment. The Soviet Union was covered in monstrosities that took years to build and then looked so incongruous they might have landed from outer space. Authoritarian regimes can build capriciously. In democracies it is harder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If built, this will be the most-scrutinised strip of tarmac in the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>British politicians might be forgiven for wishing that, where infrastructure is concerned, the dial could be turned a notch away from electoral accountability. The two existing runways at Heathrow were imposed using executive powers drafted for wartime expediency. Different governments have wanted to add a third one for 70 years and been thwarted by peacetime politics. On Tuesday, Theresa May\u2019s government declared that it, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/zac-goldsmith-to-resign-as-tory-mp-after-heathrow-go-ahead\" title=\"\">intends to expand Heathrow</a>, but there will be more consultation, more process.</p> <p>The underlying tensions have not changed. There are good economic arguments for boosting capacity at an aviation hub near the capital. There are compelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/climate-change-airport-expansion-heathrow\" title=\"\">environmental arguments</a> against belching more carbon into the stratosphere. There are local people who would be glad of the work involved in expanding an airport. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/we-feel-betrayed-harmondsworth-residents-furious-at-heathrow-decision\" title=\"\">residents</a> whose ears are assaulted enough already by screaming jets overhead. It is because those views are all represented in Westminster \u2013 by business lobbies, trade unions and MPs \u2013 that there is policy gridlock.</p> <p>One side will prevail and, although the defeated camp will denounce the outcome as a travesty, none could reasonably say it was perpetrated with undue haste. Heathrow\u2019s third runway, if built, will be the most democratically scrutinised strip of tarmac in the world. It will be a monument to the difficulty of balancing competing interests in an open society, for which no cheers will be raised.</p> <p>It should also stand as a rebuttal to the view of government as an elite conspiracy. Of course, it will be said that the business-lounge polluters got their way, but it is a weak plot that takes three generations to succeed and works its subterfuge by feeding submissions to endless rounds of public consultation. If the decision hinged on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/dec/18/illuminati-secret-society-conspiracy-jay-z\" title=\"\">global Illuminati</a> nobbling unprincipled politicians, Boris Johnson would have succumbed years ago.

It would not be the first time politicians have acquiesced to things they once opposed when, in power, they grasp that the available options are all imperfect. Government rarely affords the luxury of easy choices. More often the arguments are balanced and public opinion is no guide. Even in the subset of views confined to the environs of Heathrow there is conflict between job creation and clean air.

People can prefer the leader of party X to the economic policy of party Y, which they trust to run the NHS more than party Z, whose leader they like more than party X\u2019s. It is rock, paper, scissors \u2013 each beats one of the others but none is supreme.</p> <p>This is why election winners can only ever claim conditional mandates. They cross the finish line as the least worst option. It is why referendums that scrunch complex choices into binary propositions generate as much conflict as they resolve. A narrow majority vote to leave the EU does not become the indivisible \u201cwill of the people\u201d because there is no such thing. There are fluid wills of many people. As the tortuous Heathrow process demonstrates, representative democracy is messy. Sometimes governments have to upset people in the hope that the benefits of a decision will appear over time. MPs might be pulled in different directions by constituents, party members and conscience. There is no formula for balancing that equation.</p> <p>Yet there seems to be a growing impatience with this complexity, coupled with a tendency to imagine that a decision we don\u2019t like must contain an elemental injustice; that if our own opinion is overruled, somewhere down the line democracy has been subverted. This grievance expresses itself in contempt for the whole system, shading into paranoia \u2013 the idea that corrupt elites run everything for their own gain; that \u201cthey\u201d have rigged the rules against \u201cus\u201d. There is no template of them-and-us that can usefully describe the political dynamics in a pluralist system. It is a fiction and it nurtures an appetite that is inimical to democracy \u2013 a craving for politics without dissent, common to the nationalist right and the Marxist left, where the interests of \u201cthe people\u201d are neatly aligned and channelled through infallible leaders.</p> <p>Democracy is a process, not an event. It doesn\u2019t guarantee everyone protection against the construction of a&#xa0;runway they don\u2019t want. It offers them&#xa0;the right to object and \u2013 in the absence of Soviet-style demands to pretend otherwise \u2013 the freedom, when it is built, to say in public that the process took years and still could not satisfy everyone.</p>",

He warned: \u201cUncertainty is the enemy of commerce and legal uncertainty is even more the enemy of commerce.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between the British and Irish food processing industries was critical since it was so interconnected, Bruton said, pointing out that 30% of the milk produced in the north was processed south of the border while 40% of the chicken produced in the south was processed north of the border.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe supply chain of the food industry is exceptionally interconnected and, if we get into a situation where the common external tariff has to be imposed, that will require us to introduce customs controls of some kind to collect that tariff and, on the UK side of the border, people would have to certify the origins of the produce.\u201d</p> <p>Ahern pointed out that the Tesco supermarket chain took 60% of its cheese and 84% of its chicken from Ireland. The two-way trade of milk is worth \u00a31.5bn per year. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThe inter-relationships are enormous. Tariffs could cripple a huge amount of the food industry; the bureaucracy would be enormous \u2013 the amount of people involved, the add-on costs of running that kind of system. My concern is people would start going elsewhere for markets and it would really work totally against the entire industry and that would be a huge loss. </p> <p>\u201cGroups like the Kerry Group are 40 years in existence and they have built enormous connections between Ireland and the UK generally. To set up a whole bureaucratic system with high tariffs would cripple the industry and that would be devastating.\u201d</p> <p>Bruton added that \u201ca lot of busy lawyers\u201d were going to make money when different standards on the production of goods and services started to apply on either side of the border. Other areas of difficulty he highlighted included Ireland\u2019s integrated electricity market, fisheries policy, the EU open skies programme, cross-border university research and the disruption posed to EU institutions based in the UK.</p> <p>Ahern rejected the idea that the Irish border could act as the border for the whole of the UK to prevent EU citizens making their way into the UK over the Northern Ireland border. The two men suggested landlords and employers might have to undertake checks at the behest of the UK government to ensure EU citizens had not entered the UK illegally through Ireland.</p> <p> Ahern said it would be a huge concern for the Irish peace process if a border was established with customs posts. \u201cIt would have been easier if more thought had been given to this before the referendum had been initiated and during the referendum campaign itself,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Bruton warned that the UK debate on its Brexit negotiations might appeal to the people of Peterborough and Sunderland, but urged UK ministers to focus on what might be good for the whole of the UK. </p> <p>The committee also heard from Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, the Conservative former trade minister, who expressed fears that the economic and political ramifications of Brexit could be more serious for Ireland than for Scotland, adding that he did not believe there was any serious understanding of the scale of the problem in either France or Germany.</p> <p>In a sign of the potential tensions between Ireland and the UK, the Irish government announced it would bid to host the European Banking Authority which, it said, would have to leave its London location after Brexit.</p>",

Winter sea ice in the Bering and Okhotsk seas off Alaska and Russia is expected to decline by at least 40% by 2050, with summer ice forecasted to largely disappear. </p> <p>The ruling is the first to affirm the federal government\u2019s right to protect species because of climate models stretching until the end of the century. In 2008, the polar bear was listed as threatened based on loss of sea ice, although the forecast in that case will end in 2050. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a huge victory for bearded seals and shows the vital importance of the Endangered Species Act in protecting species threatened by climate change,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity who argued the case. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/22/climate-change-national-parks-threat\">Climate change will mean the end of national parks as we know them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis decision will give bearded seals a fighting chance while we work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions melting their sea-ice habitat and keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground.\u201d</p> <p>The decision may be challenged by Alaska, which said such listings could hinder economic development in the state for little environmental benefit.</p> <p>\u201cIf this opinion stands, the National Marine Fisheries Service would list a species that is abundant and in good health based on the claim that climate change will impact habitat over the next 100 years and may cause harm,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-species-climate-projections-20161024-snap-story.html\">said</a> Brad Meyen, senior assistant attorney general for Alaska.</p>",

That figure was used in the environmental impact statements used to get approval for the huge gas liquefaction plants recently built in Gladstone.</p> <p>But when the government reported to the UNFCCC on Australia\u2019s total emissions in 2014, it assumed fugitive emissions were five times higher than that suggested by the industry, at 0.5% of gas produced.</p> <p>However, studies of unconventional gas \u2013 shale and coal seam gas \u2013 in the US have found fugitive emissions are often as much as 17% of the gas produced.</p> <p>Since Australian coal seam gas is closer to the surface, the researchers said it was likely that Australian fugitive emissions are even higher. In one US region, fugitive emissions from coal seam gas were 30% \u2013 300 times that assumed by the industry in Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-25T02:51:33/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Methane emissions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-25T02:51:33/embed.html\">Methane emissions</a> </figure>  <p>If fugitive emissions in Australia were just 10% of the total gas produced, then in 2014, Australia\u2019s fugitive emissions would have amounted to twice the amount of greenhouse gases Australia has committed to cut from its emissions by 2030, or the equivalent of the whole transport sector.</p> <p>Moreover, that figure is set to grow significantly. Between 2013 and 2017, Australia is projected to triple its gas production in the eastern states, mostly in order to service the liquefied natural gas export industry. There are currently 6,000 wells in eastern Australia servicing that industry, a figure expected to grow to at least 20-fold in the next 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cMethane is a very powerful greenhouse gas, which means that controlling methane emissions is crucial to meeting climate targets and avoiding tipping points,\u201d said Forcey.</p> <p>For some aspects of gas production, emissions reported to the UNFCCC were said to be zero, despite there being a likelihood of very large leaks from those sources.</p> <p>The report said the government relied on one study to claim several processes had no fugitive emissions, despite that report explicitly acknowledging large leaks that it wasn\u2019t able to properly measure, because the measuring equipment was being overwhelmed by gas leaking from other sources \u2013 including sources assumed to have no emissions when Australia reports to the UNFCCC.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been like being in a hurricane and being asked to measure the water coming from a leaking tap,\u201d said Forcey.</p> <p>This year, the UNFCCC <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/arr/aus.pdf\">urged Australia</a> to improve its measuring of fugitive emissions.</p> <p>In light of the growing industry, the new report called for fugitive emissions to be independently verified by a regulatory body funded by a levy on the industry.</p> <p>And since one of the difficulties in measuring methane emissions was a lack of baseline studies, the report called for compulsory baseline methane measurements in any area being considered for oil and gas development.</p> <p>Within about five years, Australia is expected to overtake Qatar as the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, much of which will be produced from CSG wells in the eastern states. In 2021, both Qatar and Australia will export roughly the same amount of gas.

The UN plans to make cash payments from a proposed $400m (\u00a3328m) cholera response package, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/world/americas/haiti-united-nations-cholera.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0\">the New York Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Alston added that the OLA\u2019s approach \u201chas been cloaked in secrecy: there has been no satisfactory official explanation of the policy, no public attempt to justify it, and no known assessment of its consequences for future cases. This goes directly against the principles of accountability, transparency and the rule of law that the UN itself promotes globally.\u201d</p> <p>Peacekeepers who were relocated from Nepal to Haiti in 2010 in the wake of a major earthquake imported the deadly cholera bacterium with them. Studies have found that the UN troops could have been screened for the illness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/haiti-cholera-epidemic-un-prevention\">and the disaster averted, for as little as $2,000</a>.</p> <p>Alston said the UN\u2019s legal position appears to be largely explained by the approach of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/financing.shtml\">US, the main contributor to the UN\u2019s peacekeeping budget</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cDespite numerous requests to do so, the United States itself has never publicly stated its legal position on the responsibility of the UN for causing cholera in Haiti,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, it seems to have pressed the UN to adopt the position frequently taken by lawyers in the US that responsibility should never be accepted voluntarily, since it could complicate future litigation. But this rationale is completely inapplicable to the UN, which enjoys absolute immunity from suit in national courts and whose reputation depends almost entirely on being seen to act with integrity.\u201d</p> <p>The special rapporteur said that the current stance of the UN\u2019s lawyers ensures that it would never admit its responsibility for introducing cholera. \u201cAnd avoiding legal responsibility hinders the UN from learning lessons and making sure that the fatal mistakes made in Haiti are not repeated elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Ban\u2019s office said in a statement earlier this year that the organisation had decided to step up its efforts to fight cholera in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. A reference to the UN\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in the initial outbreak\u201d was greeted as a breakthrough by groups working with cholera victims.</p> <p>Ban appeared to have been bounced into making a clearer recognition of responsibility than ever before by the advent of a draft report by Alston into how the UN handled the crisis. Alston had also been one of five experts working for the UN who earlier this year wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/03/cholera-haiti-un-experts-chastise-ban-ki-moon\">heavily critical letter</a> to Ban in which the secretary general\u2019s resistance to accepting any responsibility was torn apart. </p>",

It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year.</p> <p>If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities.

Let\u2019s imagine these many obstacles are overcome. If that occurs, Heathrow must rise to a number of challenges.</p> <p>First it needs to set out in detail how it will tackle already illegal levels of air pollution. Only a congestion charge zone around the airport and billions of pounds devoted to improving public transport links provide even the remotest chance that this will actually occur.</p> <p>Heathrow also needs to provide binding assurances that it will tackle excessive levels of noise pollution. This will need to be in contrast to past assurances they have made which they have then ripped up. Already <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://%20http//www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/08/heathrow-airport-clear-winner-at-the-noise-olympics-for-the-largest-number-affected-by-plane-noise/\">28% of all people disturbed by aircraft noise</a> across the whole of Europe are under Heathrow flight paths.</p> <p>Finally, the owners of Heathrow need to start paying more corporation tax. As revealed earlier this year Heathrow handed its largely overseas owners \u00a32.1bn in dividends over the past four years but has paid only \u00a324m in corporation tax in almost a decade. </p> <p>This is an intolerable situation and cannot continue. Simply setting out these three conditions just confirms to me how foolish the announcement actually is. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e46fc53c2c4177bf4874b4711fba07c7a30bc706\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e46fc53c2c4177bf4874b4711fba07c7a30bc706/0_59_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Pidgeon joins protest against third runway at Heathrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is a chasm between Heathrow\u2019s rhetoric and reality.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liberal Democrat press office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can we really believe these conditions will be met? Just examining the first challenge I remain cynical. Heathrow claims that that its expansion plans are compatible with legal air quality limits. However, the fact that Heathrow has decided to not even <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.aef.org.uk/2016/10/06/%E2%80%8Bheathrow-air-pollution-research-challenged-by-aviation-environment-federation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">publish these plans</a> shows that there is a chasm between rhetoric and reality.</p> <p>A further issue far from resolved is just how the improvements in transport infrastructure to serve Heathrow will be funded. </p> <p>One of the many failings of the Airport Commission was its decision to overlook the real costs that will be involved. In its <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-response-to-airports-commissions-final-recommendation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">expert analysis</a> (pdf) of the commission\u2019s report ,Transport for London concluded that the Airport Commission had underplayed the need for spending on better transport access to Heathrow by an incredible margin of \u00a310bn-15bn. </p> <p>It clearly stated that the commission had underestimated demand and severely underplayed the infrastructure required and the associated cost. It went on to highlight that without better transport links there will be serious consequences for air quality.</p> <p>The announcement on Heathrow has been a long time coming and is certainly significant. However, one thing that has not changed is the challenges that must be met. I remain convinced that Heathrow cannot meet them.</p> <p><em>Caroline Pidgeon is a Liberal Democrat London Assembly member.</em></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p> <p><em><br></em></p>",

Idomeni and Calais \u2013 at the southern and northern edges of continental Europe \u2013 were by far the largest such camps, each home to 9,000 or more. But there are others: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/serbia-refugees-hungarian-border-macedonia-bulgaria\" title=\"\">in Serbia, for instance, on the border with Hungary</a> \u2013 one of the first frontiers in Europe to be fenced with razor wire.</p> <p>These places are grim, chaotic and threatening, especially for women and children, who often travel alone. In Idomeni, before it was cleared, I sat with a Syrian man who had that morning tried to hang himself, unable to bear watching his family suffer another day. I heard tales of nightly knife fights on the edges of the camp; of traffickers abducting children into slavery. When it rained, rivers of mud poured through the flimsy tents. But I also understand why some people prefer to stay in such camps than go to official centres, where conditions may be no better and the prospects for escape much worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9de96727af7791673c7c2557972487f92e8735b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de96727af7791673c7c2557972487f92e8735b0/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"food queue at the Idomeni camp, in Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A food queue at the Idomeni camp, in Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marko Djurica/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re here, by the border, there\u2019s hope,\u201d a young man in Idomeni said to me before it was razed. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving here until the border opens.\u201d</p> <p>He did leave, of course; there\u2019s nothing there now but green fields ruffled by wind. What\u2019s gone \u2013 destroyed almost without trace in just a few days \u2013 was, like Calais, becoming a small town, with shops and falafel stands and internet cafes, barber shops,&#xa0;language classes and even a TV station, sending stories from Idomeni out to the wider world. And as in Calais, hundreds of international volunteers \u2013 some from&#xa0;mainstream NGOs, but many self-organised \u2013 made life more bearable, providing everything from food and information to childcare, friendship and concern.</p> <p>The main reason for wanting to stay near the border, or the Channel, is obviously to cross it: the opportunities, and the traffickers, are there. But, without wanting to romanticise it, Idomeni, like Calais, was for some of its residents also a kind of home: a place where they had a little agency in their daily lives, and where despair was tempered by a sliver of hope that the border would open, or that they could somehow slip through and move on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The message to Europeans is: 'Look, we\u2019re taking control.' The message to refugees is: 'Don\u2019t come.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s that hope, above all, that the razing of of such camps shuts down. The existence of these squalid shanty towns is a symptom of Europe\u2019s failure to manage the refugee reception crisis, as well as migration more broadly; closing them does nothing for the underlying problem. In France, as in Greece, the process is driven by politics \u2013 the wish to clean the place up, disperse the people, make them less visible \u2013 rather than any plan for meeting the needs of refugees, or managing mass migration from the global south. The message to Europeans is: \u201cLook, we\u2019re taking control.\u201d The message to refugees is: \u201cDon\u2019t come.\u201d</p> <p>Dispersing people may reduce local resentment, but it also undermines empathy. Since Idomeni was cleared there\u2019s been far less media focus on the plight of the 60,000 people still stuck in Greece. But most of those evicted from the camp are still sheltering in derelict factories and warehouses, or tents pitched on hard gravel where snakes slither in and rainwater floods through.</p> <p>One family I know spent several weeks in hospital because their two small daughters developed blood poisoning from insect bites. Some prefer to sleep on the streets rather than live in Greece\u2019s derelict industrial infrastructure, out of sight and out of mind, cut off from volunteers and local populations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/29/calais-shelters-on-fire-refugees-police-clash-jungle-break-up-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4h6jj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2465281\"            data-video-name=\"Calais shelters set on fire as refugees clash with police over 'Jungle' break up \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56d477b6e4b0e3887170f3b2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11281581&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/29/calais-shelters-on-fire-refugees-police-clash-jungle-break-up-video\">Calais shelters set on fire as refugees clash with police - video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And though the closure of the camp was meant to undercut the people smugglers, they are, if anything, doing an even more thriving trade.

But if the experience of Idomeni is anything to go by, many will slip away from Calais rather than subject themselves to an uncertain asylum process, which is unlikely to send them where they want to go, and may well return them to danger or extreme poverty. Some will find their feet, legally or illegally, in French cities and towns. Some, including children, will fall victim to traffickers. And, unless Europe works to open safe routes for refugees, unofficial camps will continue to spring up across the continent, with all the risks and dangers of Idomeni or Calais.</p>",

That was a test ground for more winnable seats like Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith\u2019s constituency), party sources said. </p> <p>Recalling the byelection after the resignation of Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne, one senior Lib Dem source said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never mind Witney, this is going to be a bigger campaign than Eastleigh. In Witney we were going for a really strong second, which we achieved, this time we will be going to win.</p> </blockquote> <p>The party expects 4,000 of its members in Richmond and neighbouring seats to campaign in the west London seat if Goldsmith resigns later on Tuesday.<br></p> <p>If a byelection is triggered, the party will face an uphill battle for recognition in the seat. Vince Cable, the former business secretary who was rumoured to be standing in Richmond Park having lost the neighbouring seat of Twickenham, will not run in the byelection. <br></p> <p>Instead, the candidate is a relative unknown, local accountant Sarah Olney who only joined the party in May 2015.<br></p> <p>Olney told the Guardian she had initially expected just to be delivering a few leaflets, but now faces the prospect of fighting a tough by-election within months, having only been selected in July. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This has been a bit unexpected. But I\u2019m ready to go to the voters, and our activists are really fired up by the result in Witney, and want to get stuck in to another byelection.</p> </blockquote> <p>The party was united in opposition to Heathrow, unlike the Tories, Olney said. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A Conservative government has approved the expansion, and it shows how he has been ineffective in fighting it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brexit will be the party\u2019s other major talking point in west London too, with high numbers of EU citizens living in Richmond Park. Olney said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a strongly remain area and Zac has let down a lot of his constituents in supporting the leave campaign.

The UK government must ensure that when this does eventually get approval Scotland gets a fair deal from the process. We should see a commitment on route investment, guarantees to Scottish cities and an equitable share of any public spending that might be accrued coming to Scotland.</p> <p>For the wider benefit they must also make a proper commitment to supporting new airspace plans, bio fuels for aircraft and the use of carbon reduction technology.</p> </blockquote> <p>But his counterpart for the Scottish Greens, John Finnie MSP, criticised the SNP\u2019s support for today\u2019s decision, insisting that \u201cit does nothing to advance social justice\u201d.<br></p> <p>Finnie said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wealthy frequent fliers will benefit, as they will from Scottish Mmnisters\u2019 desire to cut air passenger duty.

But he criticised the government for releasing the original proposals during the summer recess and publishing the climbdown alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">the Heathrow decision</a>.</p> <p>Lammy said: \u201cToday\u2019s U-turn shows that the government has begun to listen to the further education sector and to the strong opposition from the Labour party, particularly when it comes to protecting funding for 16-18 year olds and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. </p> <p>\u201cIf this government is serious about social mobility they must stop damaging the life chances of working class kids by slashing support for apprenticeships and skills training.\u201d<br></p> <p>As part of a push to raise productivity and address skills shortages, ministers have set targets to increase apprenticeship numbers and are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/12/apprenticeships-levy-will-go-ahead-next-year-uk-government-confirms\">introducing a levy on larger employers from April</a> to help to fund new placements.

The analysis also found that funding for many apprentices aged 24 and over would rise, particularly for those living in affluent areas outside the south-east and working for large employers.</p> <p>Greening and Theresa May were questioned in parliament last month about the cuts by Labour MPs. Greening said she was working to get the plans right during a consultation period <a href=\"http://feweek.co.uk/2016/09/14/theresa-may-does-not-recognise-30-50-potential-apprenticeship-funding-cuts/\">but May said she did not recognise the potential cuts identified by campaigners</a>.</p> <p>Announcing the changes, Greening said: \u201cAfter extensive discussions with employers and training providers we are today publishing the final funding policy \u2026 The adjustments we have made to the funding policy since our proposals in August will help ensure that the reforms benefit more employers, providers and apprentices.\u201d<br></p> <p>Lammy said the backbench debate, supported by six political parties, would go ahead as planned.</p>",

  "<p></p> <p>The plane turns and banks as it comes into land; the island below is a lush deep green. Fingers of rock - the now solidified cores of ancient volcanoes \u2013 emerge from patches of forest, themselves set amidst a sea of sugar cane that almost encircles the land between the coast and the villages of the central plateau. I catch a glimpse of the south coast and the scattered developments of hotels and resorts with their white sands, calm lagoons and coconut palms, before the view returns to houses and cane once more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7585fcf7192b8f2351f8962861ed60db97ca1250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7585fcf7192b8f2351f8962861ed60db97ca1250/0_0_750_1000/750.jpg\" alt=\"The real Mauritius, almost as it would have looked like before humans arrived, though the palm-like and non-native Traveller\u2019s Tree can be seen close to the centre of the image.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Mauritius, almost as it would have looked like before humans arrived, though the palm-like and non-native Traveller\u2019s Tree can be seen close to the centre of the image.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Travellers\u2019 guides to the island talk of the warm welcome, the \u201cmixing pot of cultures\u201d and the waves of colonisation and immigration that have created one of the most harmonious, and apparently friendly populations on the planet. Former slaves from the sugar plantations, immigrants from India and Madagascar, China and Europe have made the island their own, each bringing their own culture and cuisine. </p> <p>As a biologist and aspiring wildlife photographer, I\u2019ve wanted to visit Mauritius for as long as I can remember. At university, I read about the various creatures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/17/conservationists-urge-mauritius-to-halt-cull-of-threatened-fruit-bat\">pushed to the very brink of extinction</a>, including, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/dec/02/extinct-thinking-was-the-hapless-dodo-really-destined-to-die-out\">the dodo</a>. It was the wildlife that was calling me now.</p> <p>I was staying at a hotel that tells the tale of Mauritius. Built in the colonial style of the 1800s, the grand old place illustrates several chapters of the Island\u2019s story. As sugar prices have fallen (one of the Island\u2019s main exports for decades), the large estates - the Domaines, have invested in tourism. Former chateaux have become restaurants and marginal land close to the coast or amidst the hills has been given over to golf courses and hunting reserves and a few areas remain as nature reserves. </p> <p></p> <p>My first visit was to the Black River Gorges Reserve, in search of one of the island\u2019s best known survivors, the pink pigeon. When I meet one, this curious and bemused-looking bird eyes me with a blank expression that (unsurprisingly for a bird!) holds no hint of awareness of its status as a global rarity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07a8040fa05ad7cfd6439b84cbe80336186bc28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07a8040fa05ad7cfd6439b84cbe80336186bc28/0_62_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pink pigeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pink pigeon, one of the island\u2019s best-known survivors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My guide from the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation tells me of the utter devastation wrought on the island\u2019s wildlife. \u201cOnly 2% of the island is covered with native forest,\u201d he explained, \u201cThe rest is farmland or village and what woodland remains outside the reserves is a mix of foreign interlopers like cinnamon, Chinese guava and traveller\u2019s tree.\u201d Despite it all he manages to smile as he describes the challenges he faces and offers me fragrant leaves to smell.</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1fb97f03af7ccf9f852cd130367ae0e0c257047f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fb97f03af7ccf9f852cd130367ae0e0c257047f/0_0_667_1000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Echo parakeets are back from the brink of extinction.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Echo parakeets are back from the brink of extinction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we emerge into a clearing we find abandoned cages, where in the 1980s the last remaining pigeons and vivid green echo parakeets were bred to save them from extinction. The cages now stand empty, the birds are back from the brink, but without the forest cover they will always be vulnerable.</p> <p></p> <p>To the east of the island I enjoyed a very different tourism experience. Coastal resorts here are set amidst mangrove-fringed inlets in the largest lagoon system on the island, and I was able to visit the tiny speck in the ocean known as Ile aux Aigrettes. Here I got my first sense of what those sixteenth century sailors must have witnessed when setting foot on Mauritian soil for the first time: I was on land that was 100% authentic Mauritian forest. Here, black Ebony trees, corkscrew palms and olivewoods formed a low, cyclone-resistant canopy. This resilient forest provides shelter for the Telfair skink, a rather bold and curious lizard the size of a squirrel, and the exceptionally rare Mauritius fody, a red-headed finch that is for some reason known locally as \u201cColins\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>My guide showed me a modest tree nursery and some giant tortoises, which seemed indignant at being encouraged to pose for photos. The Mauritian giant tortoises are extinct; these leathery animals have been introduced from the Seychelles to spread seeds and \u201cgarden\u201d the native forest with their constant grazing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f68f43effeb03e9aeb6af1ae44028245bfb832e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f68f43effeb03e9aeb6af1ae44028245bfb832e9/0_8_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ile aux Aigrettes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ile aux Aigrettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next morning, I drove to the nearby Le Domaine de l\u2019Etoile, again another fragment of natural forest with trees rare enough to stop a motorway construction. The leaf-strewn forest of sturdy buttresses again includes black ebony - so nearly eradicated. On some of the trunks, I could still the motorway route daubed in red paint. A few of the tarmac-stoppers exist as only a handful of specimens. Sadly, some of these groups are all-male and thus presumably doomed.</p> <p>Like most of the reserves on the island, hunting brings in significant income; something I\u2019m ambivalent about. I feel uncomfortable at the thought of killing for pleasure, yet left unchecked, the introduced deer and boar would do further damage the forests. Careful management brings much-needed income to add to that from horseback and quad bike safaris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d62daff462357a129cf6f3cfcbe550d0e085cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d62daff462357a129cf6f3cfcbe550d0e085cdd/0_115_667_885/377.jpg\" alt=\"The Mauritian Kestrel, arguably, once the world\u2019s rarest bird of prey.

This \u2018island\u2019 amidst the cane has been protected by geography: in this case, the modest yet still impressive hills of granite that form the Bambous Mountains and hint at the island\u2019s distant volcanic past. With luck, I\u2019m here to photograph one of the rarest birds of prey on the planet: the Mauritian kestrel<em>.</em> The dainty bird, slightly smaller than our familiar European bird, relies on small birds and geckos for prey. In the 1970s, the Mauritian kestrel\u2019s number was reduced to just four individuals as a result of habitat loss and use of chemicals such as DDT. Increased protection and the work of the the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and international conservation agencies means there are now over 400 \u2013 a rare success story.</p> <p>As we trekked up the hillside, every movement over the canopy had me lifting my camera to my eye. Mainly, though, I just saw mynah birds (introduced from India) and fruit bats, until a flash of russet caught my eye. There was a kestrel looking down from a large makak tree \u2013 clearly a well-used vantage point. We watched each other for ten minutes before it soared effortlessly away and I lost it against the patchwork of trees in the distance. </p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9e5a719d224d5a24093891c1e0ab3ff68b969a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9e5a719d224d5a24093891c1e0ab3ff68b969a/0_31_667_645/500.jpg\" alt=\"One of the rarest birds of prey on the planet, the Mauritian kestrel, relies on geckoes and small birds for prey.\" width=\"500\" height=\"484\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the rarest birds of prey on the planet, the Mauritian kestrel, relies on geckoes and small birds for prey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p></p> <p>Out of sight of the tourist destinations is a country that has begun a very important national conversation about its future and the kind of society and land it wishes to be. Twenty years ago most of the cane was cut by hand and standards of living were poor for the majority. Now, after a brief boom in the textile industry, most young people want to work in the emerging IT sector and look back on toiling in the fields as the old Mauritius - the \u201cthird world Mauritius\u201d - that it plainly no longer is. At over 1.3 million, the island\u2019s population is now stable, but it still ranks as one of the most densely populated countries on the planet, given its forty-odd-mile size from top to toe. As the country emerges from dependency on fluctuating sugar prices it will be very interesting to see the direction it takes and whether tourist development is shunned for a more cautious and ecologically-sensitive model.</p>",

However, in poorer nations the batteries are often opened with axes or hammers and the melting of the recovered lead takes places in homes. </p> <p>As a result, lead is spread throughout homes and communities and the dumping of battery remnants pollutes local soil and water supplies. Children are particularly vulnerable to the lead pollution, which can profoundly affect their development. South-east Asia is a hotspot for informal lead-acid battery recycling, but it also occurs in Africa and Central and South America.</p> <p>Richard Fuller, president of Pure Earth, said chemical pollution is a growing and under-reported problem: \u201cPollution and the diseases that it causes have become a massive and extremely costly global problem.\u201d He said the pollution can be tackled but poorer nations can lack the resources to do so, meaning those people most in need end up further marginalised.</p> <p>David Hanrahan, a senior adviser at Pure Earth, said: \u201cLarge as these numbers [of people at risk] are, they are almost certainly underestimates. In its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/deaths-attributable-to-unhealthy-environments/en/\">most current figures, the World Health Organisation reports</a> that an estimated 23% of all deaths in 2012 - representing 12.6 million people - were attributable to environmental risk factors, including pollution.\u201d He said the WHO estimated 20% of all cancers resulted from pollution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f977625306a81a1571fcb59161ae6b0b74a3724e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f977625306a81a1571fcb59161ae6b0b74a3724e/0_0_4608_3303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A miner and his daughter in Pagangbila, Sulawesi, Indonesia.

Price/Pure Earth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another industry highlighted in the new report is small-scale artisanal gold mining, where individuals digs for gold and use highly toxic mercury to collect the precious metal. This activity produces 20% of the world\u2019s gold production but releases more mercury into the environment than any other sector worldwide. It is estimated that artisanal gold mining occurs in up to 55 countries and employs between 10-15 million miners. </p> <p>The report estimated that up to 1.6m \u201cdisability adjusted life years\u201d (Dalys) are lost each year as a result of artisanal gold mining. A Daly is a year of healthy living lost by a person as a result of harm to their health. Informal lead-acid battery recycling is responsible for up to 4.8m lost Dalys each year, the report said.</p>",

I was reading a book by Isabel Allende, travelling around Argentina - I'm so sorry I've forgotten it - and it talked about it in depth. And it led to me doing other bits of research when I was in America. It's the sort of film you want Ang Lee to make. </p> <p>I've always been interested in Chinese culture as well - it's extraordinary history, really. We've got a really gorgeous Chinese actor in the cast of Oil, and she makes these jokes about how innovative the Chinese are but how bloody minded they are within that. I love that - I find it fascinating. It feels like there's an infinite past to Chinese culture - I suppose because it's so other to my own life and personal experience.

I'm very strict with myself about being as honest as I can be in my acting which sounds very self-aggrandising, I don't mean it to be, but people pay a lot of money to see your work so I feel duty bound. And that can mean sometimes your heart breaks a wee bit, but you recover as with all heartbreak. </p> <p>I think by the end of the run, you just feel you can't go there again, you can't go there any more. Most of the characters I play are up against it in some way or another, but that's nothing compared with what people cope with on a daily basis, being homeless on the streets of London or whatever. So you crack on. It's hard to constantly receive news of someone's death, or that your child is in danger... sometimes you're having to tell the story of your worst nightmares. And you have to go there. But remain a level of mental health - it's a funny old business.

  "<p>If, per Theresa May, being a citizen of the world is being a citizen of nowhere, what does that mean for music, which is more globally interconnected than ever? Artists collaborate via email, rack up the air miles, and can be heavily influenced by a tiny scene on the other side of the world. At the same time, you can never rip up your roots entirely.

The overarching theme is Dislocation, whether it\u2019s artists \u201cdislocated\u201d from their homes and scenes, or \u2013 come Monday morning, after four days and nights of cutting-edge electronics \u2013 punters dislocated from the very fabric of reality.</p> <p>One of the most brilliantly dislocated performances comes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/02/pc-music-dance-music-collective\">PC Music</a> crew member <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/felicita\">Felicita</a>, commissioned to collaborate with the traditional Polish dance company \u015al\u0105sk. Folk dances, involving lots of twirling around and dramatised romance, are paired with plangent piano melodies, scorched ambient noise and, most incongruously, wild synthetic pop. Despite (or rather because of) the aesthetic clashes, it hangs together in a supremely atmospheric whole. Devised in the wake of Brexit, it\u2019s a stirring affirmation of how cultures can coexist while retaining their own voices. They\u2019re followed by an equally impressive collaboration between Amnesia Scanner and <a href=\"http://delinear.p-a-n.org/\">Pan label</a> head Bill Kouligas, where giant projected images morph over electronic noise of overwhelming intensity, building to a strident rave climax. The apparently random images \u2013 of wading birds, or lads in Less Than Jake T-shirts \u2013 become terrifying in their dislocated meaninglessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b58e04f803dd152b2da839ac828ad117647f9d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b58e04f803dd152b2da839ac828ad117647f9d6/0_57_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Death Grips at Unsound.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Causing wild moshing \u2026 Death Grips at Unsound.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Spysz/Unsound festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another good commission is that of British producer Helm, working with Greek visual artists <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DisplacedEmbassy/\">Embassy for the Displaced</a> and Moscow producer Moa Pillar. Backed with footage of Siberia, their quivering electronics begin with a soft alarm sound that ebbs away as they head deeper into the almost monochrome wilderness. Their awe at nature is moving, but later footage, shot in a Siberian city, awkwardly exoticises its people \u2013 perhaps intentionally underlining the fact that it takes more than a visit to understand a culture. </p> <p>Unsound also brings together Krak\u00f3w\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SinfoniettaCracovia\">Sinfonietta Cracovia</a> and a supergroup of bleak Scandinavian talent from the <a href=\"https://northernelectronics.bandcamp.com/\">Northern Electronics</a> and <a href=\"http://poshisolation.net/\">Posh Isolation</a> labels. The Sinfonietta\u2019s previous festival collaborations have often been staid or twee, but this is a killer performance, with panicked electronics and Loke Rahbek\u2019s digital-soothsayer vocals punctuated with stabs of violin and alarmed brass, animatedly marshalled by their conductor. There is a note of beautiful hope at the end, brought to life on a vast art deco organ by Kara-Lis Coverdale, who also performs an excellent solo set backed by melting geometries from visual artist MFO.</p> <p>Unsound doesn\u2019t really do headliners, but there are populist bookings. Matmos\u2019s performance of Robert Ashley\u2019s bonkers spoken-word opera Perfect Lives is indeed perfection: a workaday tale of Hopper-style nighthawks that draws in astrophysics, child development theories and boogie woogie, whipping it all into absurdly slippery kitsch. The narrator considers a sunset in terms of pure maths in the third act, backed with lap steel and tabla, and its blend of sentiment and reason is truly beautiful. Death Grips have Krak\u00f3w\u2019s teenagers moshing wildly with their industrial rap, sitting somewhere between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/25/1\">Albert Ayler</a> and Limp Bizkit, while Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein perform their soundtrack to Netflix watercooler smash Stranger Things.

In previous years, this venue has been where Unsound\u2019s thematic concepts can drown in a sea of \u017bywiec lager, but there are plenty of smart and energetic dislocations. The debut of Uruguayan band F5 is a wild wedding disco full of poppy Afro-Latin rhythms played on live percussion, while new material from Liverpudlian producer Forest Swords is excellent, as rap production meets desert blues in a duet with the hotel\u2019s rattling ceiling panels \u2013 hopefully perfect fodder for MC-laden remixes in future. </p> <p>The arrival of Babyfather \u2013 the hip-hop group fronted by Dean Blunt \u2013 heralds what is probably the first ever utterance of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=paigon\">paigon</a>\u201d on Polish soil, and their set, built from grime slang, dub rhythm, industrial noise and Kate Bush samples, is hyper-British, even as it jabs the establishment. Two icons are born in Gaika and Yves Tumor, who each deliver apocalyptic punk-dancehall sermons, the former with giant anthemic melodies, the latter howling into the void dressed in bondage gear on the speaker stacks. </p> <p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/errorsmith\">Errorsmith</a> has the crowd barking in rapture like seals as he turns a deceptively minimal and mathematical sound palette into sheer funk.

Paired here with Lebanese techno producer <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/rabih\">Rabih Beaini</a>, their national cultural differences are tangible and celebrated. A kind of beige global monoculture where local particularities are ironed out would be no kind of culture at all \u2013 but what Unsound does so well is to acknowledge locality and marry it to the universal. </p> <p>What May fails to grasp \u2013 or doesn\u2019t find politically expedient \u2013 is that for so many people now, identity is no longer about nationhood. You need only look at the clothing of the vast majority of both artists and audiences here \u2013 clean lines, near-fanatical blackness \u2013 to see that this is an intercontinental tribe who define themselves not by national borders or even local customs. Instead, there\u2019s a shared spirit of adventure; the artists may have been dislocated physically, but they have an emotional common ground, all revelling in dread, joy, abandon, in uncompromised feeling of any kind. This festival was a reminder that, as cultural insularity grows, there are still global citizens who reject it absolutely.</p>",
  "<p>The banana is the world\u2019s most popular fruit crop, with over 100m metric tons produced annually in over 130 tropical and subtropical countries. Edible bananas are the result of a genetic accident in nature that created the seedless fruit we enjoy today. Virtually all the bananas sold across the western world belong to the <a href=\"http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/251899/Banana-growing-guide-cavendish-bananas-1.pdf\">so-called Cavendish subgroup</a> of the species and are genetically nearly identical.

The vast worldwide monoculture of genetically identical plants leaves the Cavendish intensely vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Fungal diseases severely devastated the banana industry once in history and it could soon happen again if we do not resolve the cause of these problems. Plant scientists, including us, are working out the genetics of wild banana varieties and banana pathogens as we try to prevent a Cavendish crash.</p> <p>One of the most prominent examples of genetic vulnerability comes from the banana itself. Up until the 1960s, Gros Michel, or \u201cBig Mike,\u201d was the prime banana variety grown in commercial plantations. Big Mike was so popular with consumers in the west that the banana industry established ever larger monocultures of this variety. Thousands of hectares of tropical forests in Latin America were converted into vast Gros Michel plantations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/12/what-cane-toads-taught-queenslands-banana-growers-about-defeating-a-deadly-fungus\">On the brink: Queensland\u2019s banana growers live in fear of a deadly fungus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Big Mike\u2019s popularity led to its doom, when a pandemic whipped through these plantations during the 1950s and \u201860\u2019s.

A soil-borne pathogen was to blame: the fungus infected the plants\u2019 root and vascular system.

Moreover, the fungus can persist in the soil for several decades, thus prohibiting replanting of susceptible banana plants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yearly, it can take 50 or more applications of chemicals to control the disease</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cavendish bananas are resistant to those devastating Fusarium wilt strains, so were able to replace the Gros Michel when it fell to the disease. Despite being less rich in taste, and despite the logistical challenges involved with merchandising this fruit to international markets at an acceptable quality, Cavendish eventually replaced Gros Michel in commercial banana plantations. The <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/est/COMM_MARKETS_MONITORING/Bananas/Documents/Banana_Information_Note_2014-_rev.pdf\">entire banana industry</a> was restructured, and to date, Cavendish accounts for <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5102e/y5102e04.htm\">47% of the bananas grown worldwide</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/10/we-have-no-bananas\">99% of all bananas sold commercially for export</a> to developed countries.</p> <p>But the Cavendish unfortunately has its own weaknesses \u2013 most prominently susceptibility to a disease called Black Sigatoka. The fungus <em>Pseudocercospora fijiensis</em> attacks the plants\u2019 leaves, causing cell death that affects photosynthesis and leads to a reduction in fruit production and quality. If Black Sigatoka is left uncontrolled, banana yields can decline by <a href=\"http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/ascomycetes/Pages/BlackSigatoka.aspx\">35-50%</a>.</p> <p>Cavendish growers currently manage Black Sigatoka through a combination of pruning infected leaves and applying fungicides. Yearly, it can take 50 or more applications of chemicals to control the disease. Such heavy use of fungicides has negative impacts on the environment and the occupational health of the banana workers, and increases the costs of production. It also helps select for survival the strains of the fungus with higher levels of resistance to these chemicals: as the resistant strains become more prevalent, the disease gets harder to control over time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46c135c137d451e594c499add2c86b27b2c6a4cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c135c137d451e594c499add2c86b27b2c6a4cc/0_52_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crop duster plane sprays fungicide over a banana plantation in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crop duster plane sprays fungicide over a banana plantation in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To further aggravate the situation, Cavendish is also now under attack from a recently emerged strain of Fusarium oxysporum, known as Tropical race 4 (TR4). First identified in the early 1990s in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia, TR4 has since spread to many south-east Asian countries and on into the Middle East and Africa. If TR4 makes it to Latin America and the Caribbean region, the export banana industry in that part of the world could be in big trouble.</p> <p>Cavendish varieties have shown little if any resistance against TR4. Growers are relying on temporary solutions \u2013 trying to <a href=\"http://www.promusa.org/Fusarium+wilt\">prevent it</a> from entering new regions, using clean planting materials and limiting the transfer of potentially infected soil between farms.</p> <p>Black Sigatoka and Panama disease both cause serious production losses and are difficult to control. With the right monitoring in place to rapidly intervene and halt their spread, the risks and damage imposed by these diseases can be considerably reduced, as has been <a href=\"http://www.musalit.org/seeMore.php?id=14394\">recently shown in Australia</a>. But current practices don\u2019t provide the durable solution that\u2019s urgently needed.</p> <p>If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from the sad history of Gros Michel, it\u2019s that reliance on a large and genetically uniform monoculture is a risky strategy that is prone to failure. To reduce the vulnerability to diseases, we need more genetic diversity in our cultivated bananas.</p> <p>Over a thousand species of banana have been recorded in the wild. Although most do not have the desired agronomic characteristics \u2013 such as high yields of seedless, non-acidic fruits with long shelf life \u2013 that would make them a direct substitute for the Cavendish, they are an untapped genetic resource. Scientists could search within them for resistance genes and other desirable traits to use in engineering and breeding programs.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned, it\u2019s that reliance on a large and genetically uniform monoculture is a risky strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To date, though, there\u2019s been little effort and insufficient funding for collecting, protecting, characterizing and utilizing wild banana genetic material. Consequently, while almost every other crop used for food production has been significantly improved through plant breeding over the last century, the banana industry has yet to benefit from genetics and plant breeding.</p> <p>But we have started taking the first steps. We now know the <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11241\">genome sequences of the banana</a> and the fungi that cause Fusarium wilt and Sigatoka. These studies helped illuminate some of the molecular mechanisms by which these fungal pathogens cause disease in the banana. That knowledge provides a basis for identifying disease-resistant genes in wild and cultivated bananas.</p> <p>Researchers now have the tools to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/patents/WO2011005090A1?cl=en\">identify resistance genes</a> in wild bananas or other plant species. Then they can use classical plant breeding or genetic engineering to transfer those genes into desired cultivars. Scientists can also use these tools to further study the dynamics and evolution of banana pathogens in the field, and monitor changes in their resistance to fungicides.</p> <p>Availability of the latest tools and detailed genome sequences, coupled with long-term visionary research in genetics, engineering and plant breeding, can help us keep abreast of the pathogens that are currently menacing the Cavendish banana. Ultimately we need to increase the pool of genetic diversity in cultivated bananas so we\u2019re not dependent on single clones such as the Cavendish or the Gros Michel before it.

To take just one example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2013/dec/16/uk-runways-business-flights-interactive\">business flights are in decline</a>. They\u2019ve been in decline for years. And yet the debate is conducted as though they were not only increasing, but increasing at a rate that our current infrastructure is unable to cater for, and our economy is suffering as a result. But they\u2019re not, they\u2019re declining.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another. Heathrow can\u2019t afford to expand with its own money. Surface access costs for Heathrow are only affordable with a huge subsidy from the taxpayer. Heathrow will only pay \u00a31bn for the additional road and rail links required to get the extra passengers to and from Heathrow. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/24/heathrow-runway-will-create-16bn-burden-for-transport-for-london/\">Transport for London say it will cost \u00a318bn</a>.

We privatised the decision. By turning it into a competition between Heathrow and Gatwick lobbyists, we allowed the debate to be conducted by two parties that both firmly agreed that building a new runway in the south-east should be the nation\u2019s top priority.</p> <p>They were both happy to point out the relative flaws in their rival\u2019s plans, but are equally content to ignore any flaws which affect both. The media accepted the framing, and so despite extensive coverage, the biggest, most important flaw has been missing from the debate. The BBC has covered Heathrow on all of its flagship news and politics shows \u2013 Newsnight, the Daily Politics, the Today Programme \u2013 without even touching on the main issue.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to miss something that\u2019s invisible, silent, odourless and tasteless. Particularly when you have a strong financial incentive to do so. And the entire aviation industry has a very strong financial incentive to ignore CO<sub>2</sub>. They\u2019ve been successfully ignoring it for decades, and last month\u2019s UN-affiliated <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj66OTJ3PXPAhWL2ywKHeQwBroQFgg2MAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wai.org%2F16conference%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHuouCDiTeMbx8ubSVyxNlSDI01sw&amp;sig2=GNXzr3IPawyHqU3YT2sKtg\">international aviation conference</a> made it abundantly clear that it is content to continue with its current approach.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are no imminent technologies that, in the short to medium term, will make aviation a low-carbon industry. The only feasible way to significantly reduce aviation\u2019s impact on the climate is to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231014004889\">significantly reduce aviation</a>.</p> <p>The Climate Change Act requires the UK economy to reduce its emissions by 80% from 1990 levels, by 2050. Aviation is allowed to increase its emissions by 120% from 1990 levels. They are on course to exceed that 120% without any new runways. So how will building a new runway in the south-east reduce the number of flights down to a level consistent with that target? Unsurprisingly, it won\u2019t. In fact, entirely predictably, it will hugely increase flights and emissions.</p> <p>Or so a naive observer might think. The serious players in this debate have a different answer to that question. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission\">The Davies commission</a>, that entirely independent and impartial inquiry into what colour Heathrow\u2019s third runway should be, has said that it will fit within the UK\u2019s carbon budget. So that\u2019s that, issue resolved. Except, it won\u2019t explain how. This reluctance encompasses the majority who don\u2019t understand how <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjds_K43fXPAhXHBiwKHSUIAjoQqQIIHzAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2016%2Foct%2F23%2Foverwhelming-case-for-heathrow-expansion-says-commission-chair&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQ9h8IXZqqHsxcCpWTTqkONaIYqw&amp;sig2=3wyykt_k-PLIdBtRKtjmxQ\">Sir Howard Davies</a> came to such a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/airports-commission-case-for-heathrow-expansion-opaque\">counterintuitive conclusion</a>, and the small minority who understand all too well.</p> <p>Davies\u2019 \u201csolution\u201d exists as fragments scattered through his 600-page multi-volume report in an as obscure and obfuscatory manner as he could manage. It\u2019s designed, very effectively, not to be understood. It consists primarily of demand-control measures, primarily carbon taxes. Davies is saying (or rather whispering in pig Latin with a paper bag on his head) that we can build a new runway that has the specific purpose of increasing flights so long as we increase the price of those flights so much that demand drops to a level that reduces the number of flights overall. There are two ways to interpret this \u201csolution\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/local-residents-on-heathrows-third-runway-kids-love-the-planes\">Local residents on Heathrow's third runway: 'I would lose my house, community and friends'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One is to accept that everyone is on the level. The new runway will be built, flights will increase, the emissions from aviation will soar ever higher above their target level, and then the government will introduce a carbon tax or similar instrument which will be so punitive, adding hundreds of pounds to every ticket, that demand will drop dramatically back to levels not seen for 40 years. The consequence would be a severe scaling back, or perhaps even closure of airports, in poorer regions of Britain, but not, perhaps, in west London. According to this interpretation, the new runway is not an attempt to increase capacity at all, but to move existing capacity south. And this is in some way a good and useful thing that we should spend billions of public money to support.</p> <p>The other plausible interpretation is that Davies\u2019 plan for hitting aviation\u2019s carbon targets isn\u2019t really serious. So, the plan for demand-control measures was seen as a necessary thing to have for legal purposes, in order to get the runway built, but was always known to be just as daft as it sounds, and that\u2019s why it was effectively hidden from view.</p> <p>I\u2019m not certain which is more cynical, the idea that the government is willing to spend taxpayers\u2019 money to redistribute mobility from the poor to the rich, or the idea that Davies\u2019 report is designed to be a black box that allows aviation to expand so long as no one looks inside, an invisible solution to an invisible problem.

Defeated Gatwick has said it will stand by in the expectation that any decision for Heathrow will be eventually reversed. </p> <h2>So what is the earliest a runway could be built?</h2> <p>It could be done by 2025, reckons Heathrow. Ministers had previously been more cautious in their timetable, eyeing 2029, but are understood to be keen to speed up development <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/hard-brexit-reduce-need-airport-expansion-heathrow\">post-Brexit</a>, with Heathrow pledging to find ways to add 25,000 extra flights a year before new infrastructure is completed if planners lift the legal cap.</p> <h2>What benefits will a third runway bring?</h2> <p>According to the Airports Commission, the economic boost could be worth up to \u00a3151bn; the government has quoted a more modest \u00a361bn. Both think up to 77,000 additional local jobs will be created over the next 14 years. The number of planes taking off will go up by about 50%, to 740,000 annually. Some believe fares will rise but the government made it clear on Tuesday that the new runway must not make air travel more expensive for passengers. EasyJet has said it will look to operate at Heathrow, bringing low-fare competition to British Airways. </p> <h2>What about the noise and pollution?</h2> <p>Good question. Heathrow\u2019s claims that noise from the airport will affect fewer people rely on technical definitions of disturbance as well as the promise of quieter planes. But locals are not convinced that planes such as the A380 really disturb them much less \u2013 and cumulatively, hundreds of thousands of new planes can only add to the noise. New communities will be under the flight path \u2013 up to 200,000 more people will be overflown. Air quality around Heathrow, which has broken legal limits, may be mitigated by plans for congestion charging and better public transport, but it will be difficult to improve with tens of millions more passengers a year travelling via the airport. </p>",

The Government\u2019s directive to cap customer charges at today\u2019s level is fundamental. Heathrow want it, argued for it and now must ensure it\u2019s the UK and the travelling public who get the benefits from the runway not the airport\u2019s owners.</p> <p> He added: \u201cWe will be vigilant in ensuring that Heathrow does not raise charges to benefit its shareholders to the detriment of the travelling public.\u201d</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s is owned by a range of sovereign investment funds, including Qatar, Singapore and China\u2019s, a consortium led by Spanish firm Ferrovial, and Canadian pension funds.</p> <p>Business leaders welcomed the decision. The president of the CBI, Paul Drechsler, said it was \u201can enormous relief to firms in every corner of the country\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will create the air links that will do so much to drive jobs and unlock growth across the UK. With contracts to tender for, apprentices to recruit and supply chains to build, this decision must be taken forward swiftly, giving businesses the confidence to invest.\u201d</p> <p>The chair of the transport select committee, Louise Ellman MP, said: \u201cThis decision will boost business, create training opportunities and new jobs and open the UK to new markets.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have had to wait a long time for this. We recognise it won\u2019t be an easy journey. We urge the government to have the courage of their convictions and press ahead so that the timetable to deliver the additional capacity by 2030 can be delivered.\u201d</p> <p>But Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green party, said: \u201cThe decision to expand Heathrow tramples over the concerns of local people and puts a wrecking ball through the government\u2019s claim to be concerned about climate change. The truth is that the government went into this process with their eyes shut to the only sensible option: stopping airport expansion.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Campaign to Protect Rural England said it was \u201cmadness\u201d. Ralph Smyth of the CPRE said: \u201cThe north-south divide has been increasing: by giving the go ahead to yet another runway in the south the Prime Minister has effectively pulled the rug on her own flagship policy of rebalancing our nation\u2019s economy. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s madness to be promoting domestic flights at the same time as investing in alternatives like high speed rail.\u201d <br></p> <p><br></p>",

Part of the plan involved \u201cpublic shaming\u201d of Murdoch so that his children, who have more progressive views on climate change, would have \u201cleverage with their father\u201d.</p> <p>On 19 February 2015, David Fenton thanked Clinton\u2019s chairman, John Podesta, for a meeting earlier that day, and sent him two emails.

In fact, a global protest was called for in solidarity with Aleppo in all the world capitals for the first weekend of October, but the message didn\u2019t reach enough people. The protests need to continue until the bombing of innocent people in Aleppo is stopped.</p> <p>In Poland recently thousands of people mobilised for abortion rights. The new labour reforms in France outraged masses of people enough to take to the streets, and 40,000 people bothered to demonstrate against a new airport in Nantes that would destroy rural land. Have we really become so selfish that we only react when we are personally affected? Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin need to be stopped, and the least we can do is to show the people of Aleppo that we will not sit placidly by.</p> <p>Whoever is to blame, whether or not we can stop the bombing, we should be demonstrating in our thousands to show the Syrian people that we care. Or have we become so desensitised that we consider genocide acceptable?<br><strong>Belinda Smith</strong><br>Rostrenen, France</p> <p>\u2022 The Guardian Weekly has been publishing stories about the sheer horror of the bombing of Aleppo by the Syrian-Russia alliance. There are many who say that this alliance is committing war crimes, and Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de wonders why there are no huge demonstrations.</p> <p>We know that the west won\u2019t play the role of global policeman this time, because the global nuclear powers are on either side of the divide. There is little that can militarily be done in such a situation.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, I really don\u2019t understand why there are still so-called rebels in Syria. What do they hope?

But I can\u2019t help but wonder how much we, as individuals, could help reduce pollution and emissions. I think back to what I\u2019ve read about the second world war, where every citizen was expected to do their bit to contribute to the cause. Here where I live many drivers leave their cars running when they stop to let their passengers run into a store, or to check their email or just to listen to their radios. I\u2019ve witnessed many incidents of up to half an hour with engines running. And, of course, many of these cars are huge SUVs or enormous pickup trucks. Walking behind them is an invitation to uncontrolled coughing from the pollution.</p> <p>I can think of dozens of other aspects of our lifestyles that could be curtailed to help the effort.

  "<h2><strong>The business case</strong></h2> <p>The independent commission charged with deciding whether a new runway should be built in the UK started a report last year by declaring that air links were vital for the economy, trade and investment. It went on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heathrow-third-runway-recommended-in-davies-report-on-airport-capacity\">select Heathrow as the best site</a>. After 15 months of deliberation, on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">the government backed this verdict</a>.<br></p> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest airport has long since reached capacity, turning away airlines that would like to operate there. An enormous amount of high-value exports go through Heathrow, which carries more cargo than all other UK airports put together. Businesses have clustered around the airport and the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, estimated that a third runway would provide up to 77,000 more local jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/oct/25/heathrow-gatwick-airport-expansion-decision-day-politics-live\">Heathrow expansion decision condemned by senior Tories - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would also stimulate economic growth throughout Britain, the commission said. More long-haul routes to emerging markets had been a mantra even before the UK voted for Brexit and a potential separation from its European trading partners. Heathrow has argued that only a hub airport with sufficient connections to other cities makes these routes viable. Almost three-quarters of long-haul flights out of Britain depart from Heathrow. An enlarged Heathrow could provide more connecting flights to the rest of the UK \u2013 allowing, for example, Scottish salmon fisheries to swiftly fly their produce around the world. </p> <p>How true this turns out to be remains to be seen. Regional flights have a poor record at the west London hub, and airlines that pay a premium for Heathrow slots have preferred more lucrative routes than trying to grow new markets. Witness British Airways\u2019 recent decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/ba-scraps-service-chinese-city-airport-expansion-heathrow-chengdu-decision-runway\">ditch Chengdu in favour of New Orleans.</a> But the overwhelming view of business groups, looking at a share of the \u00a3211bn in extra economic growth and 180,000 jobs promised by the commission, is that a third runway is long overdue. <strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></p> <h2><strong>The environmental cost</strong></h2> <p>Speaking in 2008, Theresa May said: \u201cThe third runway at Heathrow would undermine our national [climate change] targets.\u201d The prime minister, having backed a third runway, might have changed her mind, but the move remains a giant leap of faith \u2013 without a parachute.</p> <p>The truth is that sharp cuts in global emissions are urgently required and one-quarter of Britain\u2019s carbon budget will need to be splurged on aviation by 2050, according to the Committee on Climate Change.</p> <p>Even keeping aviation emissions to this level requires increasingly efficient planes, biofuels and carbon taxes running into the hundreds of pounds per ticket. The committee has asked the government to come up with a strategy to show how these actions can be implemented. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/local-residents-on-heathrows-third-runway-kids-love-the-planes\">Local residents on Heathrow's third runway: 'Kids love the planes'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The response <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467819/DECC_CCC_Mitigation.pdf\">has been to pass the buck</a>. \u201cThe government believes that action at the global level is the most effective means of tackling aviation emissions,\u201d the government said in October 2015.</p> <p>But global leaders are also passing the buck. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\">international aviation deal reached this month</a> does not cut aircraft emissions. Instead, it offsets aviation emissions growth by paying other sectors to curb their emissions and is voluntary until 2027.</p> <p>If the climate friendliness of the third runway depends on huge, politically unimaginable tax rises on flights by the UK government and an end to international buck passing, what is to be done?</p> <p>Identifying the real reason for increased flights is key: it is not business, whatever proponents of runway expansion tell you. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/546899/avi0108.ods\">proportion of flights taken for work</a> is small and has been flat or falling for a decade, according to government data. <strong>Damian Carrington</strong></p> <h2><strong><br></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e477ea2ac2115ca2fa4014da908cbe2665a66111\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e477ea2ac2115ca2fa4014da908cbe2665a66111/0_137_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson once pledged to \u2018lie down in front of the bulldozers\u2019 if Heathrow\u2019s third runway was approved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The political fallout </strong></h2> <p>The wise politician avoids saying never. David Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.no-ifs-no-buts.com/\">\u201cNo ifs, no buts, no third runway\u201d</a> quote was catchy and memorable. Three years later, he set up the Airports Commission. It was merely a way of backfilling evidence behind a decision already taken, some observers believed. </p> <p>Cameron has gone. May, whose anti-third runway Maidenhead constituents will liven up her surgeries over the coming years, will grow tired of being reminded that she condemned Labour\u2019s decision to authorise the third runway in 2009 on environmental grounds.</p> <p>Approving the third runway now, like Hinkley, is part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/theresa-may-prime-minister-prepared-to-risk-it-all\">May\u2019s determination to invest in infrastructure</a>. But she faces a torrid time from her party. The prime minister has set up some canny and innovative political arrangements to head off cabinet resignations. The decision on Heathrow was taken in a cabinet sub-committee, but the convention of collective responsibility ties all her senior ministers to the move.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2016/oct/25/layers-of-london-air-traffic-build-up-over-24-hours-video-animation\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59552\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2838134\"            data-video-name=\"Layers of London air traffic build up over 24 hours \u2013\u00a0video animation\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580f2b70e4b08d944ba4a467\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/25/161025airtraffic_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/25/161025airtraffic.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/25/161025airtraffic_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2016/oct/25/layers-of-london-air-traffic-build-up-over-24-hours-video-animation\">Layers of London air traffic build up over 24 hours \u2013 video animation</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In a highly unusual manoeuvre, they are licensed to dissent, but not campaign against the decision. That may be a tough line to police, given the verbal dexterity of her chief opponent, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The education secretary, Justine Greening, already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">unhappy over the grammar school decision</a>, is another leading opponent and previously threatened to resign over the issue. </p> <p>Zac Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond Park, could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/zac-goldsmith-heathrow-third-runway-vows-quit-mp\">announce that he is standing down</a> in protest. This would trigger a byelection in which he will almost certainly stand as an independent.</p> <p>Away from Westminster, Conservative councillors are manning the barricades. West and south-west London boroughs including Hillingdon, Richmond and Wandsworth are strongly opposed. So are Labour-controlled neighbours such as Hounslow. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, could fund a legal challenge. </p> <p>Theresa May will also have to face down criticism from as many as 60 hostile Tory backbenchers. But even if there is a majority against Heathrow expansion at Westminster, it is unlikely to delay the project. The only vote in the Commons, it seems, would be on the national policy statement for aviation, expected sometime in the next 18 months.</p> <p>However, protests against the decision are likely to be the most committed and politically challenging since the poll tax in 1990. <strong>Anne Perkins</strong> </p>",

  "<p>The students gathered on a three-hour \u201cfive ways to improve your wellbeing\u201d course in south London are about to have a powerful realisation. </p> <p>One of the group is asked to think about how many hours a week she spends seeing healthcare professionals, such as health visitors or psychiatrists, about her mental health condition. </p> <p>She tots up the amount of hours each week and multiplies it by 52. It comes to just under two full days. Stella Williams, the course\u2019s peer trainer, points out that for 363 days she has managed her condition all by herself.</p> <p>For the group of students, who are all either current or former patients at the South West London and St George\u2019s mental health NHS trust and now taking courses at the onsite Recovery College, this realisation that they look after themselves for such a large part of the year, makes them smile with pride. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t talk to my son or husband because they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about but people here do</p> <footer> <cite>Clara Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Launched in 2010, there are now over 50 courses in the shiny prospectus belonging to the Recovery College situated in the grounds of Springfield University hospital that are attended by around 150 people a week. They range from providing information about specific diagnoses (for example, understanding personality disorder), to teaching coping tools such as journaling or mindfulness. There are also courses specifically for carers, families and friends.</p> <p>Clara Jones, a mother of one, has severe anxiety and depression and admits that being at the college is the very last place she really wants to be. \u201cIf I had my way, I\u2019d be at home in my bedroom with the curtains drawn and the door closed. But I make myself come because it gives me the feeling of not being alone and that helps. It took a lot of courage for me to come to the first class,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Each course is co-produced and co-facilitated by a peer trainer who is someone with lived experience of a mental health issue, and a practitioner trainer, who is a mental health professional. </p> <p>For Jones, who is one of the 2,700 people to have attended since the Recovery College opened, one of the best things about coming to the college, is knowing she isn\u2019t alone. \u201cPeople say wise things without even knowing and no one cares if I\u2019m not saying anything. I can\u2019t talk to my son or husband because they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, but people here do.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/21/debt-homelessness-domestic-violence-gp-practice-acting-one-stop-shop\">Debt, homelessness, domestic violence: the GP practice acting as a one-stop shop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the students learned about how staying active can improve their mental health. One student, Steph Bates, an artist who has obsessive compulsive disorder, tells the group about how she had braved going swimming for the first time in years and how much it had lifted her mood. </p> <p>Peer trainer Peter Wilson says watching his students build confidence like this is the best thing about his job. \u201cWe were running a course about being assertive and in the second week a girl had had a conversation with her partner that she\u2019d wanted to have for years but hadn\u2019t been able to. It\u2019s the nature of the college.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson has been a peer trainer for a year. \u201cI was sitting on the other side of the table just two years ago, that\u2019s how recent it is. I had my own business but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I lost it all. I then went through the learning curve and it took a while to get to where I am now.</p> <p>\u201cIn class, I draw on my raw experiences of bipolar and how I manage it. I bring that to the room so hopefully students will be inspired.\u201d </p> <p>One of his colleagues is Kevin Howell, a practitioner trainer, whose background is in psychiatric nursing. Working so closely with peer trainers is one of the most unique things about his role. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I was nervous about what experience they\u2019d have in a classroom environment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was quite daunting being involved in a new concept and realising that I couldn\u2019t make any assumptions about my co-trainer\u2019s experience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe had some teething problems at first, one of which was realising we needed a formal process to bring peer trainers on board so that we had confidence in their training and ability.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/oct/05/westminster-wealth-opulence-isolated-mothers-mental-health\">Westminster: wealth, opulence and socially isolated new mothers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A trainee peer trainer programme was developed. Now, Howell says he knows that his co-trainers have both the training and the experience to be a true partner in the classroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful about working with a peer trainer is that student can relate directly to them, and this brings out information in the class that I would never hear otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Howell believes the college is so successful because they put participants at the centre of what they do. He says: \u201cStudents don\u2019t feel they\u2019re on a conveyor belt and are valued for the whole person they are. When the focus is on the individual as a whole rather than their diagnosis you see a much fuller picture.\u201d </p> <p>For Bates, who enrolled just two weeks ago, the course is already helping her manage her OCD while she waits for a bed in a residential unit. She says: \u201cIt\u2019s helpful in so many ways. For me it\u2019s like a float in the sea of being alone.\u201d </p> <p><em>* Some names have been changed.</em><br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>We think rather smugly of ourselves in the UK, and in the west as a whole, as charitable souls. So it can come as something of a shock to learn that the world\u2019s most generous folk are in Myanmar, that Iraqis are those most likely to help a stranger and that volunteering is most common in Turkmenistan.</p> <p>These are the findings of the <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2016-publications/caf-world-giving-index-2016\">latest world giving index</a>, compiled annually by the Charities Aid Foundation (Caf) from survey data drawn up across the globe by Gallup. And while Caf puts a positive spin on it \u2013 \u201cUK most generous in Europe\u201d \u2013 the harsh truth is that Brits are not getting noticeably more selfless.</p> <p>In fact, the UK is this year down two places to eighth in Caf\u2019s overall generosity league table, which combines cash giving, volunteering and helping strangers. It\u2019s seventh on donations alone, but doesn\u2019t make the top 10 on either of the other two yardsticks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/gallery/2015/nov/10/the-10-most-generous-nations-in-the-world-in-pictures\">The 10 most generous nations in the world \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy to make light of such findings: the Gallup data is based on much more wide-ranging surveys, usually of 1,000 people a time, in more than 140 countries. There are no doubt methodological uncertainties in comparing directly a telephone-based survey in the UK with face-to-face interviews in Turkmenistan or Sri Lanka (fourth on volunteering, fifth overall).</p> <p>But these results do chime with other evidence suggesting that the UK is, at best, holding its own on giving and helping. Economic recovery since the crash of 2008 has certainly not brought any explosion of magnanimity.</p> <p>According to the most recent version of Caf\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2016-publications/uk-giving-report-2015\">own UK Giving survey</a>, the number of people donating to charity is dropping: whereas in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/about-us-publications/caf-ukgiving2014.pdf\">44% said they had given in the previous four weeks and 70% in the previous 12 months</a>, the corresponding proportions in 2015 were 42% and 67%.</p> <p>In its latest <a href=\"https://data.ncvo.org.uk/category/almanac/\">Civil Society Almanac</a>, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) notes that charities\u2019 income from individuals \u2013 which includes legacies, membership fees and takings at charity shops \u2013 rose 7.7% in 2013-14 compared to the previous financial year. But the total was still below the peak of 2010-11.</p> <p>On volunteering, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/539105/2015_16_community_life_survey_data.csv/preview\">the Cabinet Office\u2019s Community Life Survey</a> for 2015-16 indicates that 41% of people volunteer \u201cformally\u201d, through groups, clubs or other organisations in the course of a year - down from 42% in 2014-15.</p> <p>Taking account of \u201cinformal\u201d volunteering, defined as providing help to someone who is not a relative, the 2015-16 figure looks better, at 70%, and is indeed up from 69% in 2014-15. But this is hardly an increase to dine out on.</p> <p>Nick Ockenden, NCVO\u2019s head of research, thinks we should look at the positives. \u201cI would call it a stable picture rather than flatlining,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a bad thing.\u201d</p> <p>He concedes, though, that charities have come to rely much more on individual giving and volunteering since government funding \u2013 particularly grants \u2013 nosedived when austerity followed the 2008 crash. His team is currently crunching the 2014-15 numbers for the next edition of NCVO\u2019s almanac, anxious to establish if the sector\u2019s overall income rise registered in 2013-14, the first for four years, was continued.<br></p> <p>One intriguing aspect of the picture is that the huge growth in opportunities to give, whether online or at bank cashpoints, does not appear to have generated any significant net growth in donations.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople are still going to chuck a pound in the bucket or buy raffle tickets,\u201d says Ockenden. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s a tendency to think that technology replaces everything that came before, but it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s just about giving people, especially young people, other mechanisms to do so.\u201d<br></p> <p>While the UK and the rest of Europe tread water in Caf\u2019s global giving index, Africa emerges this year as the continent showing the biggest increase in generosity. Disasters and adversity appear to have spurred good deeds, with Nepal and Libya featuring strongly as well as Iraq.<br></p> <p>John Low, Caf chief executive, says such selflessness is humbling and reflects an in-built human desire to give and help others. \u201cGovernments should encourage that spirit of generosity and create the environment in which a strong civil society can flourish, allowing people to reach out to those less fortunate than themselves.</p> <p>\u201cUnconditional gifts of time and money are a life-changing force for good in the world. As people become more prosperous and economies grow stronger, we have an opportunity to build an ever stronger culture of giving right across the world.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector/\">join our community - it\u2019s free</a>.</strong></p>",

  "<h2>I\u2019m most looking forward to watching ...</h2> <p>How teams deal with the Warriors. Or how the Warriors deal with themselves. I\u2019ll go with both. Seeing teams try to defend a lineup that has Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green will be fascinating. As will seeing how the Warriors keep everyone happy in an offense that features Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Last year injuries kept the Utah Jazz from making the playoffs but by January they should be completely healthy. Utah might not be the most exciting team but they are deep, good defensively and well coached. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>How the Golden State Warriors are going to integrate Kevin Durant into their already historic offense. If anyone answers this differently they\u2019re lying. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>The most significant move of the NBA off-season is about to become the biggest story of the regular season. Just how might free agent signing Kevin Durant change the dynamic at Golden State? If he gels as quickly as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBA/status/789919289344008192\">pre-season suggests</a>, the Warriors could push for 70 wins again. If not, there\u2019s the potential for the drama of disharmony. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>I\u2019m least looking forward to watching ...</h2> <p>The inevitable demise of Russell Westbrook. The (lone remaining) Thunder star plays with an edge and tenacity like no other athlete in sports and this season he\u2019ll be more motivated than ever. But without Durant around anymore to help, the Thunder don\u2019t have a real shot no matter how well or angry Westbrook plays. And that\u2019s pretty depressing. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>While most people will be excited to see how Golden State will fit all their stars into one lineup, there are enough players without big egos to make this work seamlessly. Perfection might actually make the Warriors more boring than people expect. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The New York Knicks, on and off the court. It\u2019s almost depressing to realize that Kristaps Porzingis is tied to this horrifically dysfunctional franchise. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>The Houston Rockets. The NBA\u2019s most uninspiring team undermined my efforts to stay awake for last season\u2019s midweek west coast games. Beyond the strange fascination with James Harden\u2019s beard, I\u2019ve no idea why they\u2019re on TV so much. CS</p> <h2>The biggest surprise will be ...</h2> <p>The Timberwolves grabbing a playoff spot in the West. A team featuring Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine (reportedly now armed with an NBA-quality jumper) nabbing a playoff spot in the West with 40-45 wins may not shock avid NBA watchers. But the Timberwolves have missed the postseason 12 years in a row. Basketball being played in Minnesota in late April would be news. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves showed signs of growth last year with the growth of Karl-Anthony Townes and Andrew Wiggins. Now they have added the promising Kris Dunn to a backcourt with Zach LaVine. By season\u2019s end they should be playing excellent defense. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The Eastern Conference will be more competitive and more entertaining than the Western Conference (Warriors excluded obviously). <strong>HF</strong><br></p> <p>Will this be the year the Clippers finally put it all together? Nope. Rather, it\u2019ll finally sink that in Griffin, Jordan and Paul won\u2019t bring a Championship to LA. The Clips will lose in the first round of the play-offs and Paul will take a giant deal elsewhere next July. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2><strong>The biggest disappointment will be \u2026</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f10d1a08ef6dec2c56ae9f21177a1e63a30604\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15f10d1a08ef6dec2c56ae9f21177a1e63a30604/0_97_2268_1361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will the Nets fail again this year?

Yes, they probably will.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah K Murray/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Brooklyn Nets. The Nets are expected to be awful and will likely have the worst record in the NBA. So where does the disappointment come in, you ask? It\u2019s because the franchise and their fans will get almost nothing out of suffering through this season. Thanks to the Paul Pierce-Kevin Garnett trade with the Celtics in 2013, Boston has the right to swap their first-round pick with Brooklyn\u2019s in the 2017 draft. So the Nets are going to lose most of their games AND lose out on the opportunity to bring in a franchise savior. Let\u2019s hope that 2014 trip to the Eastern Conference semis was worth it. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>New Orleans tumbled last year, but really should be a better team than their record showed. They have the talent to be a playoff team just as they were two seasons ago but it seems like the mix still isn\u2019t there in a deep Western Conference. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The Chicago Bulls are going to drop off despite the addition-by-subtraction of losing Derrick Rose and bringing in a motivated Dwyane Wade. The pieces won\u2019t fit. <strong>HF</strong><br></p> <p>Having offloaded injury-prone Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, the Chicago Bulls snubbed a refresh and a chance to hand the reins to Jimmy Butler. Instead it signed Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade, who have beef going back to the Celtics-Heat wars and will both want the limelight. On the Chicago sports scale, the Bulls will be far more Bears than Cubs. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>LeBron James is \u2026</h2> <p>Durable. James has now played 1,186 NBA games in his career between the regular season and playoffs. That\u2019s already 77 more than Michael Jordan logged in his career (not including his two forgettable seasons in a Wizards jersey). There\u2019s a lot of mileage on LeBron\u2019s legs, but other than a slight reduction in minutes from his early twenties, there are no signs of slowing down. We are all witnesses to a man who has only aged along his hairline. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Not going to be able to pull the Cavs over the Warriors this time. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Already, at the very least, the second greatest basketball player who has ever lived. And he\u2019s not close to finished. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>The man. Regardless of who performs miracles during regular season play, can we please refrain from proclaiming Curry or Westbrook or Durant has usurped him as the game\u2019s best player? They won\u2019t have. Games 5-7 of the Finals \u2013 where it James played-out the longest con in the history of sports - put that debate to bed until the post-season. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Steph Curry is \u2026</h2> <p>Now a full-on villain. If Kevin Durant is a bad guy for joining Golden State, Curry looks even worse for needing another superstar to get back on top. A fresh-faced NBA superstar everyone was rooting for two years ago today is today the face of a team many want to see crash and burn. Every behind-the-back pass Curry chucks out of bounds this season will be a moment of viral glee. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>A player too unselfish for his own good. His need to please others sometimes destroys his focus. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The most embattled \u201creigning MVP for two years running\u201d in NBA history, or at least among those who\u2019ve won a ring. <strong>HF</strong> <br></p> <p>A man with something to prove once again. Although an ill-timed knee injury may be mitigating, the undisputed league MVP had a Finals series to forget. LeBron made him look like a pretender again, now we\u2019ll see what Curry\u2019s really made of. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>One change to improve the NBA ...</h2> <p>This will never happen because it would be a significant change to the entire sport of basketball \u2026 but, hey, if the floor is mine: get rid of the free throw and penalize players who commit a foul by removing them from the floor for 30 seconds, hockey-style. This ends the awful free throw-fests that mar the end of so many basketball games and we also get some fun 5-on-4 action. I await your call, Adam Silver. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Revive the draft lottery reform that owners rejected two years ago that would havegiven all seven of the worst teams a better shot at the No1 pick thus reducing the incentive to tank. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s no reason that the NBA season should be 82 games long other than money. Unfortunately, that\u2019s more than reason enough for owners to continue with it. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Two free throws plus the ball if deliberate \u201cHack-A\u201d fouls are committed more than three times a game on poor FT shooters like DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard. There\u2019s no channel-turner in basketball like a Hackathon. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>One bold prediction ...</h2> <p>Joel Embiid will win rookie of the year. Picking a 7ft 0in center who can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/REVERSEMAGAZINE/status/786814456776892416\">do this</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1iunhwzTG0\">this</a> might not seem incredibly bold, but injuries have kept Embiid from playing in a single NBA game since he was drafted No3 overall in 2014. Predicting he stays healthy and plays well and that something good happens for the Sixers is as bold as bold can be. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Luke Walton\u2019s Lakers will have surpassed his entire 2015-16 loss total (four) by the time they face the Warriors for the first time (in their sixth game). <strong>LC</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31c7eb06e455d484870460d7657c5f53b1593a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31c7eb06e455d484870460d7657c5f53b1593a66/0_15_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LeBron James will have a tough time leading the Cavaliers to another title\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LeBron James will have a tough time leading the Cavaliers to another title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m going to keep predicting that the Minnesota Timberwolves to end the season over .500 every single season until it actually happens. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Miami\u2019s resigned center Hassan Whiteside will win Defensive Player of the Year. The $98 million man, who finished third in voting last season becomes the focal point of a Heat team minus superstars. If pre-season is anything to go by, he looks ready for the responsibility. He\u2019s also a triple double machine in the making and, as he likes to say; \u201cain\u2019t nobody doin\u2019 it with blocks\u201d either. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Which rookie will impress the most?</h2> <p>When Ben Simmons returns from injury - hopefully by mid-season - he\u2019ll quickly add footage to his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxrBAm9NzI\">passing highlight reel</a>. (And many of those passes will go to Embiid, my bold Rookie of the Year pick. Hey, great choice!) <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Kris Dunn, the Timberwolves point guard from Providence, looked fantastic in the Summer League and might be the most polished rookie in the league. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>If Joel Embiid, who finally will be making his NBA debut with the Philadelphia 76ers, counts as a rookie, then it will be him. The 76ers will still be awful, though. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>With Ben Simmons out until January, this is more open. Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown \u2013 drafted third out of Berkeley \u2013 will have plenty of opportunities to shine in a big market team that\u2019s primed to contend. While the short forward might struggle for ROTY-worthy minutes/numbers behind Jae Crowder, he could be the most impressive. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Who\u2019ll win the MVP award?</h2> <p>Russell Westbrook\u2019s consolation prize in losing Kevin Durant might just be the MVP. If he can keep the Thunder above .500 and reach the playoffs, he\u2019ll win the award and he surely won\u2019t thank Kevin Durant or Kevin Durant\u2019s mother. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>While I would be tempted to pick Russell Westbrook who could run free to as many points as he wants in the Thunder\u2019s offense, the smart pick here is LeBron James. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Russell Westbrook. If he remains healthy, the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard is going to have a monster year now that he doesn\u2019t have to share his the ball with Durant. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Steph Curry will split the limelight with Kevin Durant, while LeBron James saves his absolute best for the postseason and hasn\u2019t won the award since 2013. Russell Westbrook\u2019s numbers will explode without Durant and there\u2019s a legit chance he can smash last year\u2019s tally of 18 triple doubles. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Atlantic winner</h2> <p>Toronto Raptors. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Boston Celtics<strong>. LC</strong></p> <p>Boston Celtics. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m going with the C\u2019s. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Central winner</h2> <p>Cleveland Cavaliers. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Cleveland. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Cleveland Cavaliers. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>The Cavs will take this. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Southeast winner</h2> <p>Atlanta Hawks. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Atlanta Hawks. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Orlando Magic. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Close. Atlanta is the favourite, but Charlotte or Washington could easily take this one. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Northwest winner</h2> <p>Portland Trail Blazers. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Utah Jazz. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Oklahoma City. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Utah and Portland look strong, but OKC will win it. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Pacific winner</h2> <p>Golden State Warriors. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Golden State Warriors. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Can\u2019t see anyone but Golden State. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Although last year\u2019s regular season dominance could be beyond the Warriors, they\u2019ll win this division by at least 10 games. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Southwest winner</h2> <p>San Antonio Spurs. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>San Antonio. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>San Antonio. <strong>HF</strong></p> <p>Business as usual for the Spurs. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>Eastern Conference Finals prediction</h2> <p>Cleveland over Indiana. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Cleveland over Boston. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Cleveland Cavaliers over literally any opponent they could face. Let\u2019s say the Boston Celtics<strong>. HF</strong></p> <p>A comfortable series for the Cavs, who\u2019ll win in five.<strong> CS<br></strong></p> <h2>Western Conference Finals prediction</h2> <p>Golden State over LA Clippers. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Golden State over Utah. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Go for the Golden State Warriors over the San Antonio Spurs<strong>. HF</strong></p> <p>Warriors in seven in an all-time classic. <strong>CS</strong></p> <h2>NBA championship winner</h2> <p>Everyone knows the <a href=\"http://www.gwoltal.myfastmail.com/files/Tie%20Down\">classic scene</a> in Gulliver\u2019s Travels where the resting giant is overrun by tiny Lilliputians and secured to the ground by strings. That\u2019s kind of how I see this NBA season. LeBron is the giant of the sport and no other player is close to matching him, but in adding Kevin Durant the Warriors now have enough to take down even the biggest star in all the game. Now I should probably note that Gulliver broke out of those strings in the story and that LeBron never rests. But I\u2019ll still give the Warriors 3-1 odds. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Last spring Golden State appeared certain to win their second-straight NBA title against Cleveland. But Draymond Green was suspended for a game, Steph Curry lost his focus and the Warriors were outplayed by the Cavs and LeBron James. They signed Kevin Durant to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again. The same two teams are destined to meet once more but this time Golden State will have too many elite players to slump again. Expect a more locked-in Curry, a motivated Durant and enough contributions from Green and Klay Thompson to go the distance next June. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The Golden State Warriors, taking out the Cleveland Cavaliers. Yes, I know, this would be the third straight Warriors-Cavaliers finals, but it\u2019s hard to imagine this season going any other way barring injuries that are too depressing to contemplate. The funniest possible result would be for the Cavaliers to take a 3-1 series lead this time around, only to lose to the Warriors. Call them the <a href=\"http://waitingfornextyear.com/2016/09/warriors-3-1-lead-nba-finals/\">meme busters</a>. <strong>HF</strong><br></p> <p>The Dubs will have learned a lot from last summer\u2019s humbling loss to Cleveland and it\u2019s all the motivation they\u2019ll need to put it right. Should the NBA Finals be a three-peat, I\u2019m picking Golden State to take a 2-1 lead over the Cavs in Finals match-ups. Warriors in six. <strong>CS</strong></p>",

  "<p>Green energy accounted for more than half of net electricity generation capacity added around the world last year for the first time, leading energy experts have found.<br></p> <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the milestone was evidence of a rapid transformation in energy taking place, and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years.</p> <p>But the analysts said the outlook in the UK has deteriorated since the Conservative government took power last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\">cut support for wind and solar</a> power. The agency\u2019s chief said Britain had huge renewable energy potential and ministers needed to design stronger policies to exploit it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I see is we are witnessing the transformation of energy system markets led by renewables and this is happening very quickly,\u201d said Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA. \u201cThis transformation and the growth of renewables is led by the emerging countries in the years to come, rather than the industrialised countries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-21T13:42:29/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Renewable energy growth by country\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-21T13:42:29/embed.html\">Renewable energy growth by country</a> </figure>  <p>China will lead the world for growth in renewable power, followed by the US and Europe, a new report by the agency found. The IEA said the EU was relinquishing its position as a renewable energy pioneer due to weak electricity demand and policy uncertainty, which Birol warned could see European renewable energy manufacturers lose out to international rivals.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think of running a marathon, Europe started with a big advance, more than half of the marathon they are leading by far. They are now getting a bit tired, and some others are overtaking Europe slowly but surely,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The IEA said Asia will be the \u201cengine of growth\u201d, led by China and India. \u201cChina is a completely separate chapter,\u201d said Birol. \u201cChina alone is responsible for about 40% of growth in the next five years. When people talk about China, they think about coal, but it is changing.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 153GW of net renewable electricity capacity was installed globally in 2015, a record high, equivalent to Canada\u2019s capacity and up 15% on the year before. Net capacity is new capacity minus retired capacity, such as old hydro being taken offline. China is expected to add a further 305GW over the next five years, followed by India with 76GW.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-24T17:56:50/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Renewable electricity capacity additions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-24T17:56:50/embed.html\">Renewable electricity capacity additions</a> </figure>  <p>Onshore windfarms and solar power led the charge last year, with 63GW and 49GW of new global capacity respectively.

  "<p>Hydrogen is regarded by many as the fuel of the future. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are emissions free, can match the performance of regular cars and are set to become increasingly available to consumers. Nonetheless, they have their critics. There\u2019s still division on whether electric vehicles should be powered by hydrogen or with a battery. Makers of battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), most notably Tesla Cars CEO Elon Musk, dismiss FCEVs as expensive and inefficient. There is also a lack of infrastructure to support them. </p> <p>But the world is crying out for cleaner transport and British entrepreneurs are making strides in this nascent industry.</p> <p>A lack of infrastructure is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/nov/04/hydrogen-fuelled-car-hyundai-ix35-video\"> one of the main problems preventing the adoption of FCEVs</a>. There are very few hydrogen refuelling stations across the UK, with 12 expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, and consumers are unlikely to buy a car unless they are sure they can fill its tank. </p> <p>Hydrogen itself also comes with some challenges. It does not exist independently and needs to be extracted from other chemical compounds such as water. This is called electrolysis, an energy intensive process which risks undermining the environmental benefits of using hydrogen. Also, hydrogen isn\u2019t the easiest substance to transport. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/nov/04/hydrogen-fuelled-car-hyundai-ix35-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4dq5p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2400757\"            data-video-name=\"Are hydrogen cars the answer to our pollution woes? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/3/1446581878576/KP_584951_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56391681e4b0880ce1fba458\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/3/1446581878576/KP_584951_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/03/151103_Environment_Hyundai_Hydrogen_Car_2_desk.mp4\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/03/151103_Environment_Hyundai_Hydrogen_Car_2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/03/151103_Environment_Hyundai_Hydrogen_Car_2_small.3gp\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/03/151103_Environment_Hyundai_Hydrogen_Car_2_large.3gp\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/03/151103_Environment_Hyundai_Hydrogen_Car_2.m3u8\"> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/nov/04/hydrogen-fuelled-car-hyundai-ix35-video\">Are hydrogen cars the answer to our pollution woes?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One UK company which believes it has overcome these issues is Sheffield-based <a href=\"http://www.itm-power.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ITM Power</a>. The business, founded in 2001, has built three hydrogen refuelling stations in the UK and exports to California, France, Norway and Germany. ITM\u2019s stations perform electrolysis at the forecourt, avoiding transportation problems. <br><br>Furthermore, it avoids high energy bills by taking the excess energy produced from renewable sources. CEO Graham Cooley says that because renewable energy sources tend to outstrip supply (on very windy or sunny days), producers are left with surplus energy. \u201cRenewable energy supplies are regularly turned off when they exceed demand, it\u2019s called \u2018curtailment\u2019. But ITM\u2019s systems can harness and fully utilise this surplus renewable energy to create hydrogen,\u201d says Cooley. \u201cThis can be done anywhere there is an electricity and water supply, eliminating the need for deliveries by road and using electricity at times when the price is lowest.\u201d</p> <p>Cooley says hydrogen is poised for take-off as the major problems have been overcome. FCEVs can match the performance of petrol-powered cars and can be refuelled in three minutes at the pump. Much of the engineering of FCEVs is the same as other hybrid and electric cars. Cooley says drivers can therefore expect an experience comparable to what they\u2019re used to, with the big exception being that FCEVs emit only water vapour from their exhausts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8326e9f05d806210cba8db5c6018e82f3338fbd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8326e9f05d806210cba8db5c6018e82f3338fbd6/0_92_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Toyota Mirai\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Toyota Mirai</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alister Thorpe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ITM plans to have 10 stations in the UK by the end of 2017 and expects the number of FCEVs to increase soon, too. It also has a fuel supply agreement with Toyota for its FCEV saloon, the Mirai, of which there are about a dozen on UK roads. \u201cThe industry is about to finally take off for hydrogen and transport. There is a demand for clean emission transport, given the urgent need to improve air quality and FCEVs tick the right boxes,\u201d says Cooley.</p> <p>There is also backing from governments for the hydrogen industry. ITM receives funding from the UK\u2019s Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV), Innovate UK and, for the time being, a number of European Union funds. During the summer, OLEV <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-2-million-competition-to-promote-roll-out-of-hydrogen-fuelled-fleet-vehicles\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched a \u00a32m competition</a> encouraging businesses to switch to hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. The money covers 75% of purchase price and running costs of FCEVs such Toyota Mirai or Hyundai ix35.</p> <p>Also, OLEV has recently announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/4-million-boost-to-help-businesses-switch-vans-and-trucks-to-electric\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u00a34m of grant funding for businesses that want to convert their commercial fleets</a> (vans and HGVs) to electric vehicles. Indeed, the government seems keen to court Japanese carmakers that are both making strides in clean vehicles and which have manufacturing operations in the UK.</p> <p>FCEVs are still expensive, and prices will only fall once the car industry\u2019s economies of scale take effect. But new entrants are moving into FCEVs. One of them is Welsh carmaker <a href=\"http://www.riversimple.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riversimple</a>. Its CEO Hugo Spowers believes new makers have advantages in creating entirely new vehicles as they are unencumbered by the legacy of big companies. </p> <p>Riversimple has created the Rasa \u2013 derived from the Latin for \u201cclean slate\u201d \u2013 a two-seater FCEV capable of 60mph which does \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of 250 miles per gallon. \u201cThe industry has engineering challenges that we don\u2019t have because we have started from a clean sheet of paper \u2013 we began with a hydrogen fuel cell, a manifesto for sustainable design and a blank sheet of paper,\u201d says Spowers.</p> <p>The business has already been through a lengthy period of R&amp;D and has been the recipient of a \u00a32m grant from the Welsh government to build the prototype, as well as smaller grants from Innovate UK, and the small car manufacturers\u2019 group the <a href=\"http://www.nichevehiclenetwork.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Niche Vehicle Network</a>. A further \u20ac2m grant from the EU is in the offing to help fund a partnership agreement with Monmouthshire county council, where Riversimple will run a 12-month trial of 20 hand-built hydrogen cell cars. If all goes to plan, the Rasa will come to market in late 2018, in time for what could be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/future-of-hydrogen-powered-cars-mapped-out\" rel=\"nofollow\">a full-scale hydrogen revolution</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe UK government predicts that there will be more than one and a half million FCEVs the roads by 2030. Riversimple wants to play a big part of this, ensuring that its clean vehicles are affordable and attractive to consumers interested in clean transportation,\u201d says Spowers.</p> <p>Public transport could also be in store for an overhaul. Liverpool-based <a href=\"http://ulemco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULEMCo</a> has developed technology to convert diesel vehicles such as large vans and HGVs to run as dual fuel engines using hydrogen. It has already converted just over 50 vehicles on behalf of public sector clients and transport companies and expects the market to increase. \u201cAs hydrogen refuelling infrastructure develops, we expect to sell more conversions,\u201d says CEO Amanda Lyne.</p> <p>However, she admits there are a lot of risks to investing in hydrogen, as it is a \u201cdisruptive technology\u201d, attempting to unseat \u201can entrenched, powerful, incumbent industry\u201d in the form of the oil industry. The UK market has been slow so far, and the company is more likely to make deals in overseas markets. \u201cWe are very close to a deal in North America that could result in hundreds of very large trucks being powered by hydrogen. Other countries are doing a lot more to get at the opportunity of hydrogen,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>Guardian Small Business Network here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

How do you measure quality of teaching in a way that isn\u2019t challengeable in the courts? You use the Teaching Excellence Framework. But some of the Russell Group do very badly on the TEF.

This last measure is likely to hit some members of the Russell Group hard, because they have not scored well in the NSS in the past. This year the LSE, which consistently ranks highly in other league tables, dropped six percentage points in the NSS and was the lowest-performing major university, excluding small and specialist institutions. Any move to restrict LSE\u2019s international recruitment could have a huge effect, as overseas students make up <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/world-ranked-universities-most-international-students\">70%</a> of its student body.</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says the Home Office probably thinks using the TEF to judge quality is a \u201cno-brainer\u201d. Hillman, who negotiated with the Home Office about the importance of international students during his time as special adviser to former higher education minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidwilletts\">David Willetts</a>, says: \u201cThey know very little about universities. So piggybacking on an existing education department measure would seem to make sense.\u201d He says the Home Office is rigidly elitist about higher education, and likely to be unaware of the potential impact of such a policy on some of Britain\u2019s most famous institutions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/29/english-universities-ranked-gold-silver-and-bronze\">English universities to be ranked gold, silver and bronze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her speech, Rudd insisted she was \u201cpassionately committed to making sure our world-leading institutions can attract the brightest and best\u201d, but added that \u201ca student immigration system that treats every student and university as equal only punishes those we should want to help\u201d. Hillman, however, comments: \u201cThe \u201cbrightest and best language is really pernicious. They mean: \u2018We don\u2019t mind future world leaders like Bill Clinton coming here but we really don\u2019t want anyone else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Valerie Amos, director of Soas University of London, which is also expected to come some way down the TEF rankings because of its NSS results, says that although Soas is committed to the student experience and teaching quality, \u201cI worry the TEF is a rather blunt instrument\u201d. She adds: \u201cI worry about the concept of differentiation. We are a diverse sector. Soas is a specialist, niche university. We don\u2019t teach science and engineering. That means we don\u2019t feature in certain rankings because of our size.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office told Education Guardian: \u201cWe will be consulting on what more we can do to strengthen the system to support the best universities, and those that stick to the rules, to attract the best talent. The consultation will invite views on how courses and institutions could be differentiated and we will use the feedback to inform our decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Battle lines may be drawn next week when the issue is due to be debated by vice-chancellors at a board meeting of Universities UK. There is likely to be little schadenfreude. Vice-chancellors fear that if one institution suffers big cuts it could harm the reputation of the whole sector abroad, especially if that institution is one of the UK\u2019s big hitters.</p> <p>Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University, who has tweeted under the hashtag #loveinternational since the EU referendum, called a staff meeting after Rudd\u2019s speech to denounce the \u201cdisturbing intolerance\u201d coming from the Home Office. He warned that relationships were already being soured abroad, telling staff that the university\u2019s India office had sent him a local news article with the headline \u201cFive reasons to revisit your UK college plan\u201d.</p> <p>Shellard said: \u201cLast week the Turner prize winning artist and De Montfort University graduate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/17/david-shrigley-life-lessons-really-good\">David Shrigley</a> unveiled his new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/29/david-shrigley-really-good-fourth-plinth-trafalgar-square\">sculpture on Trafalgar Square\u2019s fourth plinth</a>: it was a giant thumbs up.

  "<p>When undertaker John Harris was tasked with the reburial of the <a href=\"http://www.crossrail.co.uk/sustainability/archaeology/liverpool-street/\">3,300 skeletons that were discovered in 2015</a> by the Crossrail tunnellers under the site of the infamous Bedlam hospital at Liverpool Street station, he found there was no room left in London\u2019s cemeteries.

The plot he found for the Bedlam skeletons was in Willow cemetery on Canvey Island, reclaimed land in the Thames estuary. \u201cIn Essex, it gets cheaper to bury people, the same way it gets cheaper to buy a house.\u201d </p> <p>When Crossrail opens it will further solidify Essex\u2019s role as a commuter haven for London \u2013 the Oyster card\u2019s zone of use has moved further east, now stretching to the hubs of Shenfield and Brentwood. But just as London\u2019s reach has spread east, so too has the passage of London\u2019s dead into Essex been a tradition since the dawn of the steam engine. \u201cSince the very first railway lines were built in London, pretty much all of them have required various cemeteries to be removed,\u201d says Crossrail\u2019s chief archaeologist, Jay Carver. \u201cCrossrail is following that tradition: where graveyards need to be cleared, they\u2019re reburied, generally on the outskirts of London.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, for centuries, Essex has been London\u2019s dumping ground \u2013 and not just for bones. The fate of the Bedlam skeletons is just the most recent in a wider tale of the effect of London\u2019s relentless growth on its long-suffering neighbour. From gargantuan landfills to oil refineries, it sometimes seems as though the entire county of Essex has acted as a receptacle for what is deemed too dirty for the city itself.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/mar/10/bedlam-plague-pit-skeletons-london-liverpool-street-station-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/46fbm\"                        data-video-id=\"2255116\"            data-video-name=\"Bedlam plague pit skeletons removed from London's Liverpool Street station \u2013 video report\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/10/1425979753116/crop_KP_116206_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455831978\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/10/1425979753116/crop_KP_116206_640x360.jpeg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/03/10/150310Crossrail_KP-23676864_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/03/10/150310Crossrail_KP-23676864_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10140111&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/03/10/150310Crossrail_KP-23676864_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/03/10/150310Crossrail_KP-23676864.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2015/mar/10/bedlam-plague-pit-skeletons-london-liverpool-street-station-video\">Bedlam plague pit skeletons removed from London\u2019s Liverpool Street station</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When, in 1979, conservative England\u2019s reactionary nimby-in-chief James Wentworth Day wrote in The Book of Essex that \u201cEssex is becoming the dustbin of London\u201d, he was referring to housing. \u201cEndless acres of featureless bungalows, jerry-built houses,\u201d is how he described the homes built to accommodate the spread of Londoners into the county.

From train carriages to old doors and sheds, East Enders used bits of London to build homes from Canvey Island to Clacton \u2013 a tangible representation of the leakage of the overpopulated city into the vacant countryside. Sometimes the dismantling of the establishment was literal. One Canvey development was built from the remnants of a Georgian home in Battersea <a href=\"http://www.canveyisland.org/page_id__1591.aspx\">that had been used by William Wilberforce</a> and his fellow slave-trade abolitionists.

As in many other cities in industrial-age Europe, the prevailing westerly wind dictated that only the less solvent pitched up in the east of the city. Essex\u2019s undesirable combination of industrial wasteland and weekend getaway for London\u2019s underclass disturbed genteel onlookers. In a book on the home counties, published in tandem with the 1951 Festival of Britain, writer RSR Fitter lambasted the \u201cindustrial development along the Thames estuary, the many holiday towns, and such unplanned calamities as Canvey Island\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The practice of using the land east of Tower Bridge to dump noxious industry and waste management is a long one. \u201cBovril\u201d boats \u2013 so-called due to the rich, brown hue of their pungent cargo brought from the sewerage works of east London and dumped at the mouth of the Thames \u2013 were an Estuary tradition for more than 110 years, until the practice of sloshing the capital\u2019s excrement into the brine was phased out in 1998. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>At around the same time as the Bovril boats first started their trade, east London vestries such as Mile End bought up land in Essex with the intention of using barges and steam tugs to shift the rubbish they didn\u2019t have space for. In 1889, Kensington began sending its rubbish to Purfleet, in what is now the unitary borough of Thurrock. As Lee Jackson recounts in his history of the filthy capital, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/01/dirty-old-london-fight-filth-lee-jackson-review\">Dirty Old London</a>, an LCC official cut to the chase when describing the reason for using Essex as a place to dump waste: \u201cThe natural solution is to shoot it in some sparsely inhabited district, where public opinion is not strong enough to effectually resent it being deposited.\u201d Essex was out of the way \u2013 an extremely convenient place for London\u2019s political class to shift the stuff the powerful did not want in their backyard. </p> <p>The practice continues to this day. Last summer, five men from different London locations, including a dentist and a pharmacist, were sentenced after their waste was dumped by unlicensed disposal companies in what became a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-33107726\">mile-long fly-tipping site at Purfleet</a>.

Last year, London councils paid private landlords to house more than 80 homeless families in Thurrock, which put a strain on the borough\u2019s already precarious homeless problem. \u201cThey just pay more than we can here,\u201d said John Kent, Labour leader of Thurrock council <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/30/london-homelessness-crisis-home-counties-councils\">in September 2015</a>. \u201cWhich has a knock-on effect.

For years, the pollution and loss of manufacturing kept house prices down, though there was recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/30/property-prices-skyrocket-towns-near-london\">a 17% surge in property values</a> after Thurrock found itself one of the only places many Londoners could afford to buy a home.<br></p> <p>Mucking Marsh in Thurrock was one of the largest landfills in western Europe, taking on 660,000 tonnes of rubbish from the dustbins of west London each year, brought downriver on barges every day before dawn. \u201cIt could be seen from space,\u201d says Graham Harwood, a Goldsmiths academic and artist based in Southend. He and his wife, Matsuko Yokokoji, run the art initiative YoHa, whose recent project <a href=\"http://www.artscatalyst.org/wrecked-intertidal-zone\">Wrecked in the Intertidal Zone</a> unpicked the Essex estuary\u2019s hidden past. \u201cUp until about 1994, they didn\u2019t record what went in the landfill \u2013 there were a lot of toxic cocktails.\u201d<br></p> <p>Harwood says he has been told by some former drivers at Mucking they would lock themselves in their cab to avoid the stench of gases that came out of the ground. \u201cThere was no protection for the drivers, nothing. Sometimes they would see tyres melting.\u201d <br></p> <p>In 2012, Mucking Marsh stopped taking rubbish, and has been named a site of special scientific interest due to its complex toxicity. Yet it was also recently converted into a nature reserve \u2013 by DP World, the company behind the new London Gateway port. Similarly, the landfill Two Tree Island, downriver from Mucking, was converted back into public land in the 1970s, even though some areas are still deemed too dangerous for the public. Evidence of its past is pushing through nonetheless: blackberries, apples, pears, damsons, plums and cherries now all grow from the former dump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad88ffd6bb5aedf6352adfd3b3bd2e478f19b46f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad88ffd6bb5aedf6352adfd3b3bd2e478f19b46f/0_0_1728_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The landfill site in Mucking, pictured in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The landfill site in Mucking, pictured in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another large landfill site at Pitsea is earmarked to be transformed by the RSPB in the next decade.

Look, a single grain of salt is not going to do anything, OK? One grain of salt is completely useless, trust me (worst margarita ever). I propose we replace it with: \u201cTake it with a swig of Pepto.\u201d<strong> </strong>That pink stuff is magical, calming down any stomach ailment, and also makes a pretty good drinks mixer (consult with your doctor or bartender first).

This needs to stop. I recommend \u201cdrive it to the next truck stop,\u201d which recalls a horrifying bathroom I encountered on a road trip once. It was basically the  seventh level of hell. We drove to the next truck stop. \u201cOK, I know I just joined the team as the development director. But I want to drive our gala to the next truck stop: staff/board musical numbers!\u201d (If you don\u2019t like that, NextDoorInc recommends \u201cToss it to the next pterodactyl,\u201d which is also great).</p> <p>9 <strong>Pain point</strong>.

This one hearkens back to bullfighting, where a red flag is waved to enrage the bull so that it would charge. Well, whether you are against bullfighting or not, this expression needs to be retired. I recommend \u201chang nail\u201d. Sure, it starts small, but then it peels down just a little bit more, and then it\u2019s painful as hell. \u201cThe discussion with our marketing consultant raised a few hang nails for me.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>13 <strong>Value proposition</strong>. Another pretentious tech term. They\u2019ve been invading our sector lately. Let\u2019s replace this with \u201cfluffy bunny\u201d because we need more expressions that involve bunnies. \u201cWe need a fluffier bunny if we want to convince our lapsed donors to come back.\u201d</p> <p>14<strong> ROI</strong>. Speaking of value propositions, ROI, which stands for return on investment, is getting to be tiresome. I prefer BFV, which stands for \u201cbag of frozen veggies,\u201d because frozen vegetables actually have really high ROIs, usually containing as much or even more nutrients than fresh veggies. \u201cWe should update our financial software. The BFV would be tremendous.\u201d</p> <p>15<strong> Cherry</strong><strong>pick</strong>. At a speech I gave recently on <a href=\"http://nonprofitwithballs.com/2015/05/weaponized-data-how-the-obsession-with-data-has-been-hurting-marginalized-communities/\">Weaponised Data</a>, I said, \u201cWe often cherrypick the data that aligns with our beliefs and ignore everything else. There is a lot of data cherrypicking going on.\u201d Time for a better cliche. Colleague ScarlettB recommends \u201cartisanally curate\u201d. For example: \u201cI don\u2019t care that we have limited resources. Artisanally curating the ideas from that community feedback session that already align with our strategies just makes us <a href=\"http://nonprofitwithballs.com/2015/01/are-you-or-your-nonprofit-or-foundation-being-an-askhole/\">askholes</a>!\u201d</p> <p>16 <strong>Pivot</strong>. Colleague Diana Fox asks: \u201cHow did we ever change direction on anything before the tech sector taught us how to pivot?\u201d Well, pivot is getting irritating and always reminds me of Ross, the most annoying character on Friends, so I recommend we go <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjIvu7e6Wq8\">Missy Elliott</a> on it and replace it with \u201cFlip it and reverse it.\u201d For example: \u201cOur strategy for earned income is not leading to a high BFV, so let\u2019s flip it and reverse it. Is it worth it? I\u2019m not sure, but I think we should work it.\u201d</p> <p><em>This blogpost originally appeared at <a href=\"http://nonprofitwithballs.com/2016/09/17-irritating-jargon-phrases-and-awesome-new-sayings-we-should-use-instead/#more-3750\">Nonprofit with balls</a> </em><br></p>",

Contracted to collect and remove materials from refurbishment or \u201cstrip out\u201d projects, it falls to them to dispose of this waste as they see fit. The most forward-thinking firms push clients to segregate waste on site, before its sold to recycling firms.</p> <p>MCS <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/environment/recycling\" rel=\"nofollow\">Recycling</a>, a family-owned waste management firm based in Chatham, Kent, is rare in sending nothing to landfill. To maximise the value of the office waste it collects, the firm endeavours to find bespoke buyers in addition to recycling wholesalers. It recently advertised a skip-full of maple flooring on eBay; the waste ended up with a nearby flooring manufacturer.</p> <p>Not all sales require such networking. MCS Recycling works closely with Armstrong Ceiling Solutions, a manufacturer of suspended ceiling tiles. Since 2009, Armstrong has developed a policy of actively seeking out discarded tiles from refurb projects. It then transports them to its manufacturing facility in Newcastle, where the materials are incorporated into its production process. Last year, Armstrong diverted 495 tonnes of unwanted ceiling tiles from landfill, saving almost \u00a3100,000 in landfill taxes.</p> <p>\u201cIt works out about cost neutral because of the transport and logistics costs, but the use of recycled content in our tiles is definitely a selling point for us. Architects and developers are increasingly asking for greener products,\u201d says Roy Smith, Armstrong\u2019s recycling sales development manager.</p> <p>Such \u201cclosed-loop\u201d systems are not without their hurdles. Legislation can be one of them. Armstrong, for instance, is prohibited from reusing tiles manufactured before 1 January 2000 because they contain soluble (as opposed to the safer, bio-soluble) mineral wool.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/21/rotterdam-couple-house-made-from-waste-stonecycling-bricks-netherlands\">The Rotterdam couple that will live in a house made from waste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time, government policy could help drive the reuse market, says Joe Croft, head of sustainability at the design and construction firm Morgan Lovell. His suggestions include tax breaks or making re-use of materials part of green certification schemes such as SKA and BREEAM.</p> <p>Such measures could bring about a similar shift in mentality within the industry as has been witnessed in relation to health and safety, he argues: \u201cTime is a real pressure when it comes to taking materials down to reuse them, but it\u2019s interesting that time is never an issue for health and safety these days.\u201d</p> <p>Others, such as David Cheshire, author of <a href=\"http://www.ribabookshops.com/item/building-revolutions-applying-the-circular-economy-to-the-built-environment/86743/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Building Revolutions</a>, a recent book on the circular economy in the construction industry, advocate the use of leasing models, which allow office components to be upgraded or remanufactured once they become outdated.

  "<p>The Kenyan Ministry of Transport has announced that it is moving forward with its plans to build a standard gauge railway (SGR), linking Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa, that will cut through <a href=\"http://www.kws.go.ke/parks/nairobi-national-park\">Nairobi National Park</a>. </p> <p>Nairobi is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities. It is also unique in encompassing, within its precincts, a major national park that supports lions, rhinos, and other large wild animals. Despite its modest size, the biological diversity of Nairobi National Park is greater than that of some entire countries. It is also a sanctuary of global significance for some endangered species, notably the black rhinoceros. </p> <p>These wonders lie within easy reach of millions of Nairobi residents, as well as tourists and business visitors from all over the world. The co-existence, side by side, of bustling metropolis and natural wildlife paradise sets Nairobi apart from every other capital city on earth.</p> <p>The proposal to construct a railway through the park has led to a major conflict between conservation and development interests, and a heightened level of public concern about environmental compliance in the implementation of large-scale development projects. It has also divided the conservation community in Kenya. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff3a84e8d2bee0d391ad636c8908fa28c2cf09cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3a84e8d2bee0d391ad636c8908fa28c2cf09cb/0_17_4793_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Environmental and wildlife campaigners protest against plans to build a railway through Nairobi National Park.

Nairobi, Kenya Monday, 17 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most Kenyan conservationists are resolutely opposed to the proposal. However, one our most famous and respected colleagues, Richard Leakey, has been at the forefront in supporting the proposed project. In my many conversations with him, it is clear that he is convinced that, like it or not, Kenya will continue to develop and therefore change is inevitable, especially in one of Africa\u2019s fastest growing cities. <br></p> <p>He thinks that the only way to save the park is to raise the railway on pillars like a viaduct 18 m above the park. He is convinced that this will not harm the wildlife, but may in fact become recognized as a wonder of technology, like the Forth Railway Bridge in Scotland, Cikurutug Bridge in Indonesia which soars above a rainforest, and the Landwasser Viaduct in Switzerland to name a few. <br></p> <p>Richard Leakey believes Africa should not be afraid to aspire to greatness in construction, but most of all, he is so confident that it will work in Nairobi Park that he believes it will be a model for other African countries facing similar challenges, such as the Tanzanian plan to put a road across the Serengeti.</p> <p>The Government of Kenya\u2019s argument in favour of the route through the park is more straightforward: it is the cheapest and, technically, the easiest option available. But most conservationists in Kenya, and many people around the world, would say that it is madness to take a decision like this based purely on economic and technical criteria. <br></p> <p>New Yorkers would never fill their Central Park with more office buildings, even though they would generate tremendous profit. Central Park is the soul-restoring asset of New York City. Like Central Park, Nairobi National Park is irreplaceable. But it is quintessentially Kenyan, and immeasurably grander and greater than anything in New York City. </p> <p>Surely, this argument goes, the park is a priceless asset. No amount of money can buy the feeling of awe and wonder at meeting 4-metre tall giraffes for the first time, or the sound of the galloping hooves of thousands of zebras. No economic benefits are sufficient to compensate for the loss of the peace and tranquillity, the feeling of being at one with nature that the park provides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba8657fbe35e0a3a6c6881ef32b9a05fd764c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba8657fbe35e0a3a6c6881ef32b9a05fd764c90/0_174_5230_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of female impala stand in grass made long and lush by seasonal rains in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, 17 May 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of female impala stand in grass made long and lush by seasonal rains in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, 17 May 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GRAYLING KENYA PHOTO / STUART PRICE/MEAACT Kenya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A further concern of environmental experts is that, if the railway crosses Nairobi Park, it will set a very dangerous precedent. National parks in Kenya face multiple threats, including from poaching, illegal grazing, mining, and unregulated urban and agricultural expansion. At root, all these threats arise from conflicts\u2014real or perceived\u2014between economic and environmental conservation goals. <br></p> <p>By allowing economic interests to trump environmental ones in this case, the government and Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) will lose the moral authority to protect other parks facing comparable threats. This will damage Kenya\u2019s reputation and, potentially, roll back decades of conservation successes. </p> <p>I appreciate all these arguments. To understand them better, I have spoken to engineers, land owners, communities, children, politicians, wildlife managers, and conservationists. I have visited the site of the massive new railway terminal under construction in Nairobi. <br></p> <p>I have been criticized by conservationists for considering all options and discussing the matter with the railway engineers themselves. But I needed to do this in order to understand the different issues and develop my own position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3c05eeff6734f2a4710f6633d4904bc0005e13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3c05eeff6734f2a4710f6633d4904bc0005e13/0_199_5293_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giraffe grazing in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, with the city skyline in the background on 17 May 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giraffe grazing in Nairobi National Park, Kenya, with the city skyline in the background on 17 May 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GRAYLING KENYA PHOTO / STUART PRICE/MEAACT Kenya</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have come to two conclusions. Firstly, we should apply the precautionary principle. Richard Leakey and Kenya Railways have assured President Kenyatta that the railway will not damage the park or the wildlife, a view he has repeated in speeches. They may be right, but hundreds of experts think otherwise, and we will not know who is right until it is done. In my view this is simply too risky an experiment for us to test.</p> <p>But secondly, I recognize that I have no right to expect that my opinion will prevail. There is a need for dialogue. By bringing as many people involved together to discuss the proposal, we may be able to mitigate some of the negative effects and reduce the uncertainty regarding its consequences. It could give democratic legitimacy\u2014that is currently sorely lacking\u2014to the final decision that is taken. <br></p> <p>Last but not least, it will provide the opportunity to initiate an ongoing national conversation around the wider issues raised by this case\u2014issues that go to the heart of our vision for the future of Kenya and the African continent.</p> <p>Like many people in this largely Catholic country, I have been inspired by the wisdom of Pope Francis in his Encyclical on Nature, where he urgently appeals for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all \u2026 Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity \u2026 All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents. </p> </blockquote> <p>When I first mooted the idea of a dialogue a few weeks ago, I had no idea what the response would be. I have been heartened by the widespread and generous support the idea has received. This has enabled my organization WidlifeDirect, together with other conservation organizations, Kenya Railways, KWS and three research institutions to convene a meeting between government and other stakeholders that will take placin Nairobi on 27th October. </p> <p>Even though the Phase 2 of the railway was formally launched last week, our hope is that there is still time to achieve a negotiated consensus on the best outcome for conservation and development. If successful, this dialogue will not only help secure the future of Nairobi National Park. It can also be the start of a process, building bridges between politicians, planners, engineers and the conservationists to improve decision making for future development projects. <br></p>",

  "<p>In the summer of 2005, Jeffrey Karp, a bioengineer at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (BWH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was working late one night when he spotted a journal article on a colleague\u2019s desk. What caught his eye was not the text itself, but the full-page colour illustration of Spider-Man that accompanied it. Intrigued, Karp sat down and started reading.</p> <p>The article detailed how a group of researchers had created a new synthetic material by mimicking the properties of gecko feet \u2013 whose tiny, hair-like pillars allow the lizard to stick to and detach from apparently sheer surfaces with ease. Imagined uses for the material included gloves that would allow military personnel to climb up the sides of buildings, just like Spider-Man.</p> <p>\u201cThe wheels in my head started turning,\u201d Karp told me recently. His first thought was to use the material to create a new type of medical tape that could replace sutures and staples, which can damage sensitive tissue surrounding wounds. Karp was working alongside the world-renowned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/17/robert-langer-nanotechnology-pioneer-willy-wonka-revolutionising-medicine\">bioengineer Robert Langer</a> at the time, studying ways to create biodegradable materials that could seal wounds inside the human body. The tape could even go a step further than sutures or surgical staples, he thought, and be used in particularly intricate surgical procedures \u2013 for instance, tying together the small intestine during gastric bypass surgery.</p> <p>The next morning, Karp stopped by Langer\u2019s office and convinced him that he had come up with the perfect idea to win a prestigious research grant. But as he began his research, Karp found that it wasn\u2019t enough to simply rely on friction between the hair-like pillars to make the tape stick. That may be how geckos\u2019 feet work, but he was going to need something much stronger if he hoped to bind human tissue inside the body.</p> <p>When he tried coating the surface of the tape with a glue, Karp found that it seeped in between the pillars, like honey drizzled on to a hair brush. Next, he played around with the position of the pillars on the surface of the tape, placing them closer together. That didn\u2019t work either \u2013 when the pillars were too close together, there wasn\u2019t enough friction with the surface of the tissue. So he moved them apart again, and then tried coating each individual pillar with the glue, instead of simply brushing it over the top. Now, whenever the tissue came into contact with a pillar, it stuck in place. Finally, Karp had his solution.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a great example of a holistic approach to problem-solving,\u201d David Kaplan, chair of the biomedical engineering department at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told me. In 2008, MIT\u2019s Technology Review magazine named <a href=\"http://hsci.harvard.edu/people/jeffrey-karp-phd\">Karp one of the top innovators in the world</a> under the age of 35.</p> <p>Karp, who is now 40 and runs his own lab at BWH, is what is known in the business as a bioinspirationalist \u2013 a person who looks to nature for solutions to scientific problems. The gecko tape was Karp\u2019s first bioinspired invention; these days he is regarded as a leading figure in the field. (He often tells people that he owes his success to Spider-Man \u2013 there\u2019s a large drawing of the Marvel superhero in his office, and he once wore a Spider-Man T-shirt during a TEDMed talk.) Karp\u2019s current projects include surgical staples inspired by porcupine quills, which create smaller punctures in the skin and prevent bacteria from entering wounds, and a new kind of surgical glue inspired by the sticky secretions of marine worms, which is strong enough to bind moving tissue inside major organs, such as the heart.</p> <p>This last invention has helped to cement Karp\u2019s reputation as a rising star in the world of bioengineering. Because he doesn\u2019t just invent cool stuff \u2013 he turns his creations into actual products. \u201cWhen we look to solve problems, it\u2019s not so we can publish papers and get pats on the back from the academic community,\u201d said Nick Sherman, a research technician at Karp Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, \u2018Is this work going to help patients? If not, how do we make it help them?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, Karp\u2019s surgical glue began a human clinical trial in Paris. It is the first of Karp\u2019s innovations to advance this far. Unlike other surgical glues on the market, his actively repels blood, making it ideal for sealing holes in blood vessels, intestinal tissue, even bone. It is also much sturdier, meaning that surgeons could use it to fix cardiac defects without the need for open heart surgery. \u201cThis could completely transform how we perform surgery,\u201d said Jean-Marc Alsac, the cardiovascular surgeon at the Hospital European Georges-Pompidou in Paris who is overseeing the trial.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Karp Lab, which opened in July 2007, is hidden behind a heavy white door on the third floor of an office building in Cambridge, near Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Inside, a stockpile of white lab coats hangs near the entrance, and beyond lies a jigsaw puzzle of heavy machinery, vials, tubes and jars, sanitising stations and discarded rubber gloves. \u201cLots of labs are doing what appears to be similar work but, truly, they are not in [Karp\u2019s] league,\u201d Arnold Caplan, a professor in the department of biology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, told me.</p> <p>Every Wednesday at 8am, staff meet in a large conference room to discuss ideas. The lab employs around 25 staff, from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows, although its ethos is strictly non-hierarchical. One research trainee, Thomas Kuncewicz, joined Karp Lab just over a year ago, before finishing his undergraduate degree, and is now leading two projects. \u201cEveryone\u2019s experience is different \u2013 and that\u2019s what matters most here,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot some dumb pyramid scheme where we have to work our way up through the ranks.\u201d Lab employees are encouraged to email Karp whenever they have a question or idea. \u201cIf you ever email him, within five minutes you\u2019ll have a response,\u201d Kuncewicz said. \u201cIt can be 11pm or 3am, and he\u2019ll reply.\u201d (I have exchanged emails with Karp long past midnight. His average response time is about 10 minutes.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c5812ff035fefef652414bde6893430370de441d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5812ff035fefef652414bde6893430370de441d/0_103_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Karp in his MIT lab in Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Karp in his lab at BWH</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lab attracts the kind of budding scientist who won\u2019t turn up their nose at the occasional lab outing to the zoo or the aquarium. A couple of years ago, one of Karp\u2019s students returned from a field trip with a handful of porcupine quills. At the time, Karp was in the middle of designing a new type of surgical staple, which are most often used in surgery to close sensitive wounds that cannot be sutured by hand. Karp looked closely at the quills and noticed that each had multiple tiny barbs on the end of its tip, like a serrated knife. He took a few quills and stuck them in his chin to test how much force would be required to puncture the skin, and how much it would hurt. (\u201cSurprisingly little,\u201d he said later.)</p> <p>Over the next few months, Karp designed a surgical staple with serrated ends, like the quills. He tested it on raw chicken and found it slid in easily, and created small, clean holes that caused virtually no damage to the surrounding tissue. The staples that are currently in use cause large punctures in surrounding tissue \u2013 which allow more bacteria to enter the wound and cause infection. Karp Lab patented the staple and is working on getting it to market. Karp believes that the invention could significantly reduce post-surgery complications, which are often caused by current surgical staples.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Karp took a few porcupine quills and stuck them in his chin to test how much force it would take to puncture the skin</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Karp and others in his field, nature often holds the key to critical scientific and medical problems. This approach also gives scientists free access to a vast number of solutions that have already benefitted from millions of years of trial-and-error testing. The appeal of bioinspiration, for Karp, lies in the idea that \u201cevery living creature that exists today is here because it tackled a number of challenges. And those that haven\u2019t have quickly become extinct,\u201d he said. \u201cIn essence, we are surrounded by solutions. Evolution is truly the best problem-solver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA distinct advantage of the bioinspiration route is that pre-existing solutions are somewhat handed to us,\u201d Leif Ristroph, an assistant professor of mathematics at New York University\u2019s Courant Institute, told me. \u201cOf course we have to figure out the mechanisms behind the solution, and determine which parts we care to mimic and which do not carry over to our problem of interest. The leaf as nature\u2019s solar panel is a great example: scientists have been trying to better understand photosynthesis for a long time, even well before we wanted to collect and store solar energy ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In recent decades, advances in technology, engineering, and robotics have made it easier to observe nature and borrow from it with more precision than ever before. In the early 2000s, Japan Railways Group, which operates the Shinkansen bullet train, asked one of its engineers, Eiji Nakatsu, to come up with a way to fix a longstanding problem. Whenever the train went through a narrow tunnel at high speed, the atmospheric pressure created low-frequency waves that spread out from the tunnel and created vibrations in the air. These vibrations were so powerful that residents 400 metres away from the railway line wrote in to complain about the noise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"370ac867a69c77b4218b41c1e2c284b3ae15827b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/370ac867a69c77b4218b41c1e2c284b3ae15827b/0_514_3126_4194/745.jpg\" alt=\"Karp has developed a new type of surgical staple inspired by porcupine quills.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karp has developed a new type of surgical staple inspired by porcupine quills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Humpata/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nakatsu, who is a keen birdwatcher, wondered if his weekend hobby might provide him with ideas for how to deal with sudden changes in air resistance. His mind turned to the kingfisher, a bird whose long and flat beak allows it to dive from the air (low resistance) into water (high resistance), with a minimal amount of disturbance so as not to alert its prey. Nakatsu redesigned the nose of the Shinkansen 500-Series, making it longer and flatter. The new design successfully reduced air pressure by 30%.</p> <p>The story of Nakatsu and the Shinkansen is a favourite among advocates of bioinspiration. Many of the world\u2019s top academic institutions \u2013 Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, and Columbia \u2013 now offer courses in bioinspired engineering, while organisations such as the World Biomimetic Foundation and the Biomimicry Institute have been established specifically to help spread the word by highlighting the work of companies who dabble in bioinspired design \u2013 an electricity-free ventilation system modelled on termite mounds, for instance, or wind turbines with aerodynamic bumps similar to those found on a humpback whale\u2019s flippers.</p> <p>Still, even those who believe that bioinspiration may hold the key to solving humanity\u2019s most urgent problems \u2013 water scarcity, overpopulation, climate change \u2013 are careful to point out that the field is still in its infancy. Beth Rattner, the executive director of the Biomimicry Institute, told me: \u201cWe can observe and make mathematical replications of a kingfisher beak on the nose of a train, but we\u2019re still unable to fully emulate or replicate a lot of biological phenomena, either at all or to the point where it\u2019s commercially viable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBiomimicry should be considered as a means to understand nature and conceive engineering design, but not as a dogma,\u201d says Maurizio Porfiri, a professor at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering. In other words, while evolution has pursued an optimal path \u2013 from swimming to flight \u2013 this happened in a specific context, with specific constraints. Even Leif Ristroph concedes that he would not, for example, \u201cslavishly copy a bird or insect\u201d in order to design a robot. \u201cClearly, birds inspired the basic design of aeroplanes, but the early designs with flapping wings did not win out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still, Karp is not suggesting that scientists copy nature directly. Instead, he wants to look at what works and improve on it. \u201cThe key is to analyse the solution evolution has converged on, and then take advantage of those principles in an engineering context,\u201d Adrian Thomas, professor of biomechanics in the zoology department at Oxford University told me. \u201cThe obvious mistake is to copy nature \u2013 it is possible to do much better than nature by exploiting the best engineering materials.\u201d</p> <p>While research labs dedicated entirely to bioinspiration are rare, Karp\u2019s is not the only one. Don Ingber\u2019s Wyss Institute at Harvard University, which has been running since 2009, is a bioinspiration factory. There are some 375 full-time staff, who together enjoy more than $600m in grants and philanthropic funding. The lab has co-founded 15 startups in the last three years, and has more than 15,000 patents out for a range of bioinspired technology and designs across a range of disciplines, from medicine to robotics. They include a self-organising swarm of tiny robots that can be used for tasks such as surveillance, traffic monitoring and crop pollination, and a mattress that senses the cardio-respiratory functions of infants and can help detect when they are having trouble breathing. \u201cJeff has done amazing stuff in his lab,\u201d Ingber told me. \u201cBut we can do it much faster. We\u2019re able to take much bigger risks here, and we\u2019re more likely to succeed, both technically and commercially.\u201d</p> <p>But sheer volume is not Karp\u2019s aim. When the lab first opened, Karp thought he might use bioinspiration to tackle problems around cell migration, the process whereby cells move around an organism to aid in tissue formation, wound healing and immune response. That same year, after speaking at a biomedical conference to drum up support for the lab, someone approached Karp and told him bluntly that the only interesting thing about his talk was the gecko tape. \u201cThat\u2019s all people asked me about,\u201d Karp told me. \u201cSo that got me thinking, maybe I should just focus on medical devices. It seemed to be the thing that got people excited.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One evening in August 2009, Karp received an email from Pedro J del Nido, a specialist in cardiac surgery at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. Del Nido was having difficulty sealing holes in the hearts of young patients suffering from congenital heart defects. Whenever Del Nido tried to suture a hole, the surrounding tissue would tear. He had read Karp\u2019s paper on the gecko tape, and wondered if Karp could help him design something similar to help treat his young patients.</p> <p>This presented a new challenge for Karp. While the gecko tape can seal things like tissue and gastrointestinal tracts, the heart is not stationary. It moves very fast and violently, as blood constantly gushes in and out. Any adhesive would have to be strong enough to resist being washed away in the deluge. Karp wondered if a surgical glue might help solve Del Nido\u2019s problem. Gluing internal surgical wounds is quicker and sometimes more effective than stitches, particularly around sensitive areas where any rip or tear in the skin will damage surrounding tissue. But Karp did not know any surgical glues that could work successfully in the presence of a lot of blood, and none that are strong enough to actually bind moving tissue. What\u2019s more, surgical glues sometimes have harmful side-effects (such as releasing formaldehyde inside the body) and can take as long as 30 minutes to set. As any surgeon will attest, the less time a patient lies on the operating table with their insides exposed, the better.</p> <p>Karp told Del Nido that he would try to come up with something. Except, he didn\u2019t really know how. The gecko tape had been an academic invention. There had been one animal trial \u2013 on mice. Del Nido needed something practical that he and his surgeons could actually use when operating on children. Karp realised that if he was going to help Del Nido, he had to talk to some people who had experience turning inventions into products. \u201cOne of the reasons most medical devices invented in an academic environment never make it to patients is because they\u2019re so complex and you can\u2019t manufacture them at the right scale, or at the right price,\u201d Karp told me. \u201cThe lab is really just the first step.\u201d</p> <p>Karp decided that he would need to build his own network of contacts: entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, patent attorneys, regulatory body contacts, consultants, and business managers, who would be familiar with his methods and guide him on every step of the process. He spent the next two years meeting with venture capitalists around Boston, attending networking events sponsored by local law firms, consulates and biotech companies. He flew around the country presenting his work to various companies. \u201cI wanted to make it in such a way that as soon I came up with an idea, all I\u2019d have to do is just fire off an email to the right person and that would be it,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fad3c021e8c68605539da6bce6cfb38ae870b773\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad3c021e8c68605539da6bce6cfb38ae870b773/0_602_2880_3598/800.jpg\" alt=\"Karp looks at some glue inspired by the secrations of marine worms.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karp looks at some glue inspired by the secretions of marine worms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One morning in late June, I accompanied Karp on a visit to the New England Aquarium in Boston. Scientists have a reputation for being slightly awkward, but Karp is at ease in his own skin. Tall, with a lean build and slight stubble, he peppers lengthy scientific explanations with jokes, usually at his own expense. \u201cStop me if I get too boring,\u201d is something he says often. He is fond of drawing diagrams to explain what he is talking about. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those very rare scientists who can talk to everyone at their level,\u201d Sherman, the Karp Lab research technician, told me. \u201cHow he talks to high-schoolers is different from how he talks to PhD fellows, and that\u2019s different to how he talks to physicians. But it\u2019s always at the same level of excitement.\u201d</p> <p>Karp grew up in Peterborough, a rural county in Ontario in a Frank Gehry-designed house that his parents bought from a local builder. The family moved in when Karp was eight; it was his first time living outside the city. There was a buffalo farm across the road, and a sheep farm next door. There was a creek running through the backyard, and the property backed on to a forest. \u201cI would wake in the middle of the night,\u201d said Karp, \u201cand there would be a pack of wolves on my front lawn \u2013 headed to the sheep farm for a snack!\u201d</p> <p>Karp began taking trips into the woods, looking for snakes. Later, he would mount expeditions to trap frogs and snapping turtles by the creek. He got used to seeing foxes on the driveway at dusk and listened out for the hoots of the great grey owls nesting nearby. \u201cFor a kid with no appreciation of nature, this was a really big turning point for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, here was this whole new world I never even knew existed.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the aquarium, Karp led me to a large, fluorescent tank filled with lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, one of the largest species, with a bell-shaped hood that can reach eight feet in diameter and tentacles that can stretch over 100 feet. \u201cThe key thing to remember is that the problem comes first, not the solution,\u201d Karp said, peering inside the tank. \u201cWe don\u2019t sit in front of the jellyfish tank and think, \u2018How can we design a medical device that does what these jellyfish do?\u2019 It\u2019s more like, we have a problem we need to solve, and these floating piles of jelly might be able to help us.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, Karp began looking at jellyfish to try and improve the design of a blood analysis device that can detect whether a cancer has metastasised after the removal of a tumour. Devices like this already exist: they resemble a small, rectangular chip roughly the size of a sim card. The blood flows through the top part of the device, while the bottom is lined with antibodies, which attach to any cancerous cells present in the sample. By looking inside the chip under a microscope, it is possible to determine if any cells have been \u201ccaptured\u201d \u2013 and therefore if the blood sample contains cancerous cells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d23fac295552dc7122960e97d29f82054d3168a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d23fac295552dc7122960e97d29f82054d3168a/0_0_3467_5200/667.jpg\" alt=\"A Lion\u2019s mane jellyfish.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lion\u2019s mane jellyfish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cultura RM Exclusive/Alexander Semenov/Getty Images/Cultura Exclusive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An early problem with these devices was that the blood sample flowed too fast and too far above the antibodies, which meant that even when cancerous cells were present, they were not always detected. Later versions of the device shortened the distance between the top and bottom, but this meant that the blood sample had to be smaller, which in turn meant the results were less accurate. (The bigger the sample size, the more accurate the results.)</p> <p>Karp wanted to know if there was a way to force the cancerous cells to slow down and better attach to the antibodies. So, instead of lining the bottom of the device with antibodies, Karp created synthetic jellyfish-like tentacles made out of DNA. The tentacles, which are roughly one-tenth the width of a human hair, are imbibed with a capturing agent that targets circulating tumour cells, and can extend to \u201cgrab\u201d them. In tests of an early prototype, Karp found that his new design could increase the flow of blood by 10 times, making it far more likely that cancerous cells would be accurately detected.</p> <p>We had moved downstairs to the aquarium\u2019s cafe by the time Karp had finished laying all this out, and when I expressed some confusion about some of the details, Karp grabbed a napkin from a nearby table and retrieved a pen from his bag. It was in the shape of a bright orange crab claw. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said, in reference to my amused expression. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny. I got it from a souvenir shop.\u201d He then proceeded to draw a diagram of his device on the napkin. (Karp\u2019s business card features a very similar drawing of the tentacles, and a picture of jellyfish on the back, to show the process from inspiration to creation.)</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d Karp said, leaning in conspiratorially. \u201cYou want to touch a stingray?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In early 2011, Karp asked one of his graduate students, Maria Pereira, to help find a solution to the challenge that Pedro del Nido had set him: namely, how to seal holes in children\u2019s hearts. \u201cWe tried to define the key criteria for the problem: a material that couldn\u2019t be washed away by blood, was easy to deliver and minimally invasive,\u201d Pereira told me. \u201cSomething that a surgeon could control.\u201d</p> <p>Following Karp\u2019s example, Pereira looked to the natural world for solutions. She held lab meetings and asked everyone to email her ideas or pictures of creatures that live in especially wet environments. People circulated photos of slugs and snails. \u201cWe began thinking, how do snails stay attached to leaves when it\u2019s raining?\u201d Karp told me. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the trails they leave behind washed away by the rain? What are those secretions made of?\u201d</p> <p>One day, someone emailed Karp and Pereira a link to a research paper on sandcastle worms, which live in shallow water on the Californian coast. The worms secrete a sticky, viscous goo that they use to build underwater shelters by gluing together bits of shells and sand grains. The goo is also hydrophobic \u2013 meaning it repels water \u2013 to ensure the shelter withstands the force of waves.</p> <p>Slowly, Karp and Pereira began to imagine a product that would not only be used to treat small internal wounds in children, but that would have wider applications. They now envisioned a liquid surgical glue, strong enough to work in any major organ. It would be both biodegradable and capable of repelling blood and water.</p> <p>In 2013, Karp co-founded Gecko Biomedical in Paris with the help of Bernard Gilly, the chairman of a group of small French biotech companies. Pereira later moved to Paris to join the company as its head of research.</p> <p>Over the next few years, she and Karp tested different versions of the glue, each with a slight variation in viscosity or adhesive properties. Some versions were too runny and not sticky enough; other prototypes were so sticky they would not spread easily on to tissue. It was not enough to have the glue sit on top of the tissue \u2013 it needed to infiltrate it, in order to create a perfect seal that would prevent air or blood from seeping through. Karp thought about how ivy attaches to the sides of buildings \u2013 the plant\u2019s \u201croot hairs\u201d seek out crevices and cracks, then secrete a glue that spreads the hairs in different directions. The hairs then shrivel up and dry in a spiral shape, which anchors the plant to its location. \u201cMany of the glue formulations did not work, but the ones that did worked very similarly to ivy, because they were able to burrow into the tissue,\u201d Karp said.</p> <p>Karp and Pereira also developed a device in the shape of a pen, which emits a visible LED ray of light that reacts to the glue, so a surgeon can set the glue once it is applied. (The process takes five seconds.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/24/biomimicry-nature-environment-design-engineering-energy-efficiency\">Mushrooms, whales and hurricanes: how bio-inspiration boosts energy efficiency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each version of the glue was tested first in animal or human tissue inside the lab, and then inside a living organism, usually a rat or pig. The \u201cright\u201d version presented itself entirely by accident. Karp and Pereira set up an animal trial at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital to test a new iteration of the glue: a small, circular patch rather than a liquid version. They created a hole inside the heart of a living rat, and were just about to seal it with the patch when it slipped off. They put it back on top of the hole, but by that point there was so much blood that the patch would not stay in place long enough for Karp to cure it with the light pen.</p> <p>Scrambling for a solution, Karp asked Pereira to scrounge up as much of the most recent batch of liquid glue as she could. Pereira then spread the glue on to a spatula, and applied it to the leak in the rat\u2019s heart. Karp followed with the light, and the glue set. \u201cIt did exactly what it was supposed to \u2013 it repelled the blood and it remained in place,\u201d Karp said. \u201cWe ended up with a perfect seal. This was a massive hole, so showing that we can seal it without sutures or staples was a big deal to us.\u201d (When Karp and Pereira checked up on the same rat six months later, they found no signs of disability or stress. The glue on the animal\u2019s heart had gradually biodegraded as tissue had grown over the patched up hole.)</p> <p>Last spring, Karp showed off the glue during a talk at Zoobiquity, a semi-regular conference that brings physicians and veterinary surgeons together to swap notes. The event took place at the New England Aquarium, and Karp spoke from a semi-raised platform in front of the penguin pool. After the talk, a dental surgeon named William Rosenblad approached Karp to ask if he would be willing to give him some of the glue to use on one of his canine patients, a bulldog named Little Papi. Rosenblad had carried out three unsuccessful procedures to treat an oronasal fistula, a common problem in dogs and cats that results in a large hole in the mouth leading to the nasal cavity. \u201cHe looked pretty desperate,\u201d Karp said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Get it to me as fast as you can.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A week later, Rosenblad sealed the hole in Little Papi\u2019s mouth using Karp\u2019s glue. \u201cI knew the real test would come when everything had healed,\u201d Rosenblad told me. Karp was present at the follow-up appointment two weeks later. Little Papi sat patiently while Rosenblad checked inside his mouth, finally declaring that the glue had worked \u2013 the hole was sealed. \u201cWe all got a bit emotional,\u201d Rosenblad told me. Little Papi\u2019s owner walked up to Karp and shook his hand. \u201cHe kept repeating, \u2018You changed my life,\u2019\u201d Karp said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March this year, after successfully raising 22.5m euros, Gecko began a trial of the surgical glue at four hospitals in Paris. The glue was tested on 36 patients, most of whom underwent vascular reconstruction surgery, in which blood vessels are either cut open to remove plaque or enlarged to enable better flow. Jean Marc Alsac, the surgeon overseeing the trial, said that it tested two things: one, how quickly the bleeding stopped when the glue was applied, and two, that there were no adverse effects in patients in the three months after surgery. \u201cIt worked immediately,\u201d Alsac told me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for the surgery to be over that quickly. It was astonishing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The glue worked immediately. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the surgery to be over that quickly. It was astonishing</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Marc Alsac</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A human trial of the glue is planned for next year in the US. Karp hopes the glue will become part of the surgical armamentarium \u2013 available in all hospitals throughout the world \u2013 to reduce surgical times and complications of current procedures. He also wants to see it used in surgeries where there are currently no suitable methods to close tissues, such as in minimally invasive procedures where it is difficult to tie knots in small spaces, or where bulky stapling devices cannot fit. \u201cCurrently, many surgical procedures are much more invasive than they need to be,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut with better ways of sealing tissues in small spaces, this can drastically be reduced.\u201d</p> <p>Making the glue indispensable to surgeons could also help boost bioinspiration\u2019s profile, particularly in medicine. \u201cI think as others see successful examples, they will be more inclined to give it a try,\u201d Karp said. \u201cWhen I first started out, I didn\u2019t really see bioinspiration as a tool or platform \u2013 merely a project. I certainly didn\u2019t realise how powerful it could be.\u201d</p> <p>When I visited Gecko\u2019s headquarters in Paris this summer, I asked Pereira to show me how the glue works. She filled a small syringe with 0.2ml of the glue, which is yellow and gloopy. She took a piece of clear rubber and pressed a small dot of glue on to its surface. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend this is a ruptured vessel inside the body,\u201d she said. She took a thin metal rod and spread the glue around on the rubber surface. She then took the pen light and held it over the rubber for five seconds. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, pushing the rubber into my hands. \u201cFeel it.\u201d</p> <p>The glue had set into a shiny, flexible coating on top of the rubber. I played around with it for a few minutes, then asked Pereira if I could try applying the glue myself. She shook her head, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait your turn like everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2016.

The fact is if we stopped all of our coal exports tomorrow you would simply have more coal exported from other countries, like Indonesia, like Colombia, like China, that would be filling the gap,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to strangle the Australian coal industry is not going to do anything to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d </p> <p>Federal cabinet was meeting in Brisbane on Tuesday.</p> <p>Turnbull was asked during a press conference how it felt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/25/malcolm-turnbulls-support-lower-than-tony-abbotts-before-ousting-newspoll-shows\">be a more unpopular prime minister than Tony Abbott</a> after the latest Newspoll indicated his voter support had dropped below Abbott\u2019s last \u200breading before he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/14/australian-leader-tony-abbott-ousted-by-malcolm-turnbull-after-mps-vote\">ousted as prime minister</a> in September last year.</p> <p>\u201cThank you very much,\u201d the prime minister said in response to the question.</p> <p>He got a follow-up question on voter approval.

That\u2019s in the nature of politics. But we will govern, we will lead, and we will deliver.\u201d</p>"
