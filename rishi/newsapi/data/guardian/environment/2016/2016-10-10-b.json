  "<p>Last week the treasurer Scott Morrison <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/speech/019-2016/\">told an audience</a> in the USA that not only would interest rate cuts no longer have any impact in Australia, but neither would any fiscal stimulus. It was an extraordinary statement at a time when the outlook is for below average growth. </p> <p>The treasurer has resorted to faith in the private sector to solve our problems while at the same time saying the private sector is not investing. </p> <p>It\u2019s almost become a clich\u00e9 to talk about the new normal of low economic growth since the GFC, but we shouldn\u2019t become accepting of it. </p> <p>The reality is, what we are experiencing now is abnormal growth compared to what we have experienced at any time since the second world war. </p> <p>This week US economist Narayana Kocherlakota <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-04/why-americans-feel-poor-in-one-chart\">posted an interesting graph</a> trying to explain why so many Americans feel poor.</p> <p>He looked at the 10 yearly change in GDP per capita since the second world war. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/30/scott-morrison-warns-resentment-to-free-trade-and-immigration-threatens-economy\">Scott Morrison warns resentment to free trade and immigration threatens economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now I am perhaps the number one ticket holder of the \u201cGDP does not tell us everything club\u201d, but the growth of American GDP per capita over the past decade is quite stunning.</p> <p>When GDP is growing well, there can still be larger sections of the economy doing badly, but when it is growing slowly there is rarely any hidden \u201cgood news\u201d \u2013 and certainly none relating to the poor sections of society. And GDP per capita is a good rough guide for national living standards. </p> <p>Kocherlakota found that since the second world war, American GDP per capita had never grown by less than 10% in any 10 year period. And yet since 2009, 10 year growth has never been above that rate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in USA GDP per capita compared to a decade earlier\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1h3zS/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is a dramatic display of what the IMF talks about when it suggests advanced economies in the world are experiencing subdued growth. </p> <p>The ABS doesn\u2019t have quarterly GDP per capita data before 1973 so we can\u2019t do the same times series for Australia, but we can compare the 10 year growth since 1983:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in GDP per capita compared to a decade earlier\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7KMap/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While living standards here have not slowed as fast as in the USA, it is worth noting that the current 10 year growth in GDP per capita is slower than any time since the horror recession in 1982-83.</p> <p>Now of course looking at 10 year intervals can also hide a lot \u2013 in 2006 our economy was booming. So a look at five year intervals might reveal a bit more:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in GDP per capita compared to 5yrs earlier\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qNURG/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This measure certainly shows the depth of the USA recession, and how Australia missed out on those horrors. But even still, the past five years has seen our living standards grow at a level more associated with a recession than either an average or strongly growing economy. </p> <p>More surprisingly, in the past five years, Australian and USA GDP per capita has grown by the same amount. That is because while currently our GDP per capita is growing faster, for most of the past three years, and even going back to 2010, that has not been the case:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"GDP per capita - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2pKDf/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other than being a nice little history lesson, that would be interesting, but when we look at where the IMF has us projected to be up to 2021, it looks like the past five and 10 years are not an aberration, but the start of a trend:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia's annual GDP per capita growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Lb6eG/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The IMF would have Australia\u2019s GDP per capita not growing above 2% in any one calendar year in the next five years \u2013 a stretch we haven\u2019t experienced any time since the second world war.</p> <p>So what is our treasurer\u2019s response?</p> <p>Well it is clear from the speech Scott Morrison gave he wants to get investment going \u2013 his speech was essentially an advert to foreign investors. </p> <p>But the speech also touched on specific ways to get growth going. He made a good point \u2013 namely that with interest rates so low, monetary policy is basically done. </p> <p>The RBA has been saying this for a long while now (and so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/may/02/inflation-is-scarily-low-but-its-morrison-who-needs-to-act-not-the-rba\">have I</a>). But Morrison then went further. He argued that \u201cwhile so much of the global economic discussion focuses on monetary and fiscal stimulus, we believe that these options have largely exhausted their effectiveness, at least from an Australian perspective. </p> <p>Astonishingly our treasurer is telling the world that the two biggest tools available to spur growth no longer work. </p> <p>How\u2019s that for an invitation to come invest? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/25/the-new-normal-why-we-need-to-shake-up-economic-policy\">The new normal: why we need to shake up economic policy | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead he believes private investment (despite also admitting investment is not responding in this environment) will do the trick and so too will \u201ctrade\u201d.</p> <p>Now trade is certainly good for economic growth, but anyone believing the Trans Pacific Partnership (which is now unlikely to go forward) or our free trade agreements will do much (if anything) to <em>improve</em> growth are really off with the fairies. </p> <p>At best (the very best) the impact will be marginal. </p> <p>Morrison also suggests that his \u201c<a href=\"http://budget.gov.au/2016-17/content/glossies/tax_super/html/tax_super-04.htm\">10-year enterprise tax plan</a>\u201d will help work wonders. Except his own treasury modelling suggests the majority of the benefits will only come once the full cut to 25% occurs for big businesses \u2013 and that isn\u2019t scheduled to occur until 2026-27.</p> <p>It\u2019s all pretty lame, and fairly despairing if you were hoping that the new normal might be abnormal. </p>",

  "<p>Cuts to legal aid are far worse than anticipated and are creating a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system which denies the poorest people access to justice, warns a critical report by Amnesty International.</p> <p>The government should conduct an urgent review of the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act, which came into effect in 2013 and has severely restricted funding, the study says. A review has been promised within three to five years but ministers have delayed.</p> <p>The year before the act was introduced, legal aid was granted in 925,000 cases, Amnesty points out. The year after, assistance was given in 497,000 cases, a drop of 46%.</p> <p>The report calls for all children to be granted entitlement to legal aid regardless of the issues at stake. Some teenagers, it says, are at risk of having to represent themselves in immigration cases where they may face deportation.</p> <p>The report highlights the emergence of \u201cadvice deserts\u201d across England and Wales where the provision of free legal advice is disappearing. Worst affected are said to be the south-west, parts of the Midlands and the north of England. <br></p> <p>The Legal Aid Agency\u2019s exceptional case funding system, which was supposed to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable claimants, is said to be inadequate and flawed. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Laspo has been blamed for a surge in the number of litigants in person, slowing court processes. Legal aid is no longer available in the family courts unless one partner can prove he or she was a victim of domestic violence.</p> <p>One consequence has been that separating couples are not evenly represented. One woman told Amnesty: \u201cWhen I go to court I have to cross-examine my ex. That terrifies me. I have so many sleepless nights. If I lose I know I will blame myself \u2013 it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t good enough. But then I think, how can I be good enough when I\u2019m up against a barrister?\u201d</p> <p>Legal aid for immigration cases has also been cut, exposing unaccompanied or separated children to having to make applications to stay in the UK on their own, unrepresented. The report says up to 2,500 children a year are claimants in their own right in such cases, according to MoJ figures.</p> <p>Children are at an \u201cautomatic disadvantage as the laws, processes and systems governing their circumstances are profoundly complex\u201d, the report states. \u201cThey require specialist advisers that are experienced not just in immigration law, but also with working with children.\u201d</p> <p> One lawyer told Amnesty: \u201cThe idea that children and young people can represent themselves just does not work. This is such a vulnerable group. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t understand legal processes and legal concepts, which they don\u2019t, but it\u2019s also that they have no idea how to fill forms out properly, what to write, where to send paperwork, where to get advice and who to speak to.\u201d</p> <p>A youth worker told Amnesty: \u201cI had one young person I was working with who had to self-represent at the lower asylum and immigration tribunal. He had a good case, but no access to legal aid \u2026 I accompanied him to court, explaining that I wouldn\u2019t be able to help him as I\u2019m not qualified but could give him moral support. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cHe was vulnerable, he didn\u2019t know what to expect. I had to explain everything: what the court looks like, what the environment will be. He didn\u2019t know, he hadn\u2019t seen any of it before. All he could do was tell his story to the judge, he couldn\u2019t argue the case law \u2026 We asked for an adjournment but the court said no. In the end his appeal was refused.\u201d </p> <p>Alice Wyss, Amnesty International\u2019s UK researcher, said: \u201cCuts to legal aid imposed by this government have decimated access to justice and left thousands of the most vulnerable without essential legal advice and support. We are in danger of creating a two-tier civil justice system, open to those who can afford it, but increasingly closed to the poorest and most in need of its protection.</p> <p>\u201cIf Theresa May is really determined to deliver a country that works for all then there needs to be a justice system for everyone, not just those who can afford it.The government must start by protecting the most vulnerable and launching a review of this failing system immediately.\u201d</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a generous legal aid system - last year spending more than \u00a31.5bn on legal aid. We must ensure legal aid is sustainable and fair - both for those who need it and the taxpayer who pays for it. That is why we have made sure support remains available to the most vulnerable and in the most serious cases, and are taking action to ensure people can access the help they need.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The UK has recorded its biggest-ever month for tourist visits after the referendum-related slump in the pound lured 3.8 million people to British shores in July.</p> <p>In the highest month ever for inbound tourism, overseas visitors spent \u00a32.5bn \u2013 4% more than last year, according to new figures from the tourism agency VisitBritain. </p> <p>The sudden currency depreciation triggered by the result of the June referendum vote has left sterling hovering at its lowest level against the dollar for more than 30 years. This has turned the UK into a relatively cheaper destination for millions of foreign travellers wanting to shop for luxury goods or visit attractions such as the Lake District or Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>Announcing the figures at the the launch of the agency\u2019s 2015-16 annual review, VisitBritain said the July boost was continuing a long-term pattern of growth which in 2015 saw a record 36.1m inbound visits to Britain and triggered total spending of \u00a322.1bn. July was also a record month for inbound visits from EU countries \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest source of visitors \u2013 with 2.3m visits, 3% up on last year as European tourists took advantage of the pound\u2019s decline against the euro in the wake of the referendum. The pound is trading at its lowest against the euro for nearly seven years. </p> <p>\u201cTourism is a shining star in an uncertain world,\u201d said Christopher Rodrigues, VisitBritain\u2019s chair. \u201cAs our fourth-biggest service export, and one of our fastest growing sectors, tourism\u2019s importance as a key economic driver and job creator is clear. While the talk is of trade deals with new markets, tourism is already leading the way, competing strongly in our most valuable source markets such as the US and in markets that are crucial for our future, including China.\u201d </p> <p>Last year visitors from the USA \u2013 Britain\u2019s most lucrative foreign market \u2013 spent \u00a33bn in Britain for the first time, while visits from China, the world\u2019s largest outbound market, increased by 46%, with spending up 18%. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This meant China leapfrogged into Britain\u2019s top 10 most valuable markets, while bookings from China to the UK are up by nearly a quarter between October and December this year. </p> <p>VisitBritain is also launching a new marketing push in the US, as well as France and Germany, Britain\u2019s three largest and most valuable inbound visitors markets, through a partnership with online travel firm Expedia. </p> <p>Domestic visitors attracted by affordable staycations also spent more in England last year than ever before, splashing out \u00a319.6bn on overnight trips, up 8% on 2014. This was \u00a397.2m more than the previous year, which tourism chiefs said was down to the success of initiatives such as a major VisitEngland marketing campaign. </p> <p>Inbound tourism is worth more than \u00a326bn to the UK economy.

I brought him a salamander in a case,\u201d Kennedy recalled, adding that the chlorinated water he used to hold the critter probably led to its demise. (\u201cI was in denial about that.\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cWe spent a lot of the meeting talking about the health of the salamander, and he said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t look well to me\u2019,\u201d Kennedy said, to chuckles from the audience.</p> <p>Throughout his talk, Kennedy reinforced the notion that fighting for clean water and air isn\u2019t about pitting environmentalists against capitalists. He also criticized the government for putting corporate interest ahead of public interest. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t consider ourselves environmentalists but free marketeers. We catch the cheaters, the polluters, and we force you to internalize your costs, the same way you internalize your profits,\u201d said Kennedy, who took night classes on environmental law at Pace University in the 1980s, at a time when law schools rarely offered environmental courses, in order to work for Riverkeeper. Riverkeeper was founded to fight polluters on the Hudson and later became part of Waterkeeper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/07/microfiber-pollution-ocean-advocacy-groups-alliance\">Leading ocean advocacy groups join forces to tackle microfiber pollution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His talk also highlighted some of the ongoing major clean air and water battles within the US, such as the oil pipeline project in North Dakota, and worries about a rollback of major environmental laws should Donald Trump become president. Trump supports the coal industry and vows to axe programs such as the Clean Power Plan, which forces electricity producers to cut emissions and is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/clean-power-plan-court-obama-climate-change\">being contested in court</a>.</p> <p>The North Dakota pipeline project, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe contends will pollute their water supply and decimate their cultural heritage, exemplifies the effort by big business and investors to make it difficult for America to move away from fossil fuels, Kennedy said.</p> <p>\u201cThey lock our nation into a dinosaur form of fuel that stops us from transitioning into a more efficient form of energy,\u201d he said, calling low-carbon energy like solar and wind \u201ccheap, green, patriotic fuel from heaven\u201d.</p> <p>One of the most poignant points made by Kennedy was that poor communities often suffer the most from environmental devastation, yet they are least equipped to fight it. This point has also been made by developing countries as they seek funding from first-world nations to address climate change.</p> <p>\u201cPolluters always choose the soft target of poverty,\u201d said Kennedy, who noted, as an example, that the highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America resides in the south side of Chicago.</p>",

Regrettably you leave unexplored the question of why the Conservative government \u2013 who presumably possess the wherewithal to inform themselves \u2013 are so set on a course which peer-reviewed scientific literature over the last few years so decisively rejects, which the local democratic process has overwhelmingly opposed, and which will make it impossible for the UK to fulfil its climate commitments.<br><strong>David Cragg-James</strong><br><em>Stonegrave, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The anti-frackers take a high moral stance but, leaving aside the nimbyism, they do not explain how they think that we will continue to heat our/their homes. Non-fossil methods generate electricity but not gas; to convert our mostly gas-heated homes to electric heating would have an enormous ecological and cost impact, and the super-pylons required to carry the increased electricity load would have a far greater visual impact than the scattered fracking well sites. Talk of substantially reducing our energy usage by better insulation is no doubt academically sound but very much a pipe dream \u2013 even in my relatively well-insulated house I need to use my gas heating, sometimes even on a cool summer evening \u2013 and to upgrade the insulation of our whole housing stock by even a few percentage points is probably beyond the means of the country, quite apart again from the ecological impact of the production, transport and application of the materials involved.</p> <p>Protest is no doubt good for the psyche but an ideal world too often comes up against the physical stuff of reality.<br><strong>Malcolm Cohen</strong><br><em>Stockport</em></p> <p>\u2022 One of Brexit\u2019s implications is that our country becomes more independent. This must be true of energy supplies. Should we frack for gas, or import it? We don\u2019t just burn gas. The ethane component of North Sea gas has, for many years, been converted into ethylene, which is used in the production of a range of plastic products, solvents and antifreezes. To counter the drop-off in our North Sea production, ethane is now being imported from North America into Grangemouth refinery in Scotland. We can frack gas in this country. But the people protesting against fracking at the Grangemouth gate have a banner made of plastic. At the very least, opponents of fracking have to develop a case for a society without plastic.

  "<p>When William Hill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/william-hill-rejects-888-rank-revised-takeover-approach\">threw out</a> a cheeky three-way merger proposal from the Rank Group and 888 Holdings a couple of months ago, its chairman, Gareth Davis, explained robustly that the bookmaker would not be doing a deal based on \u201crisk, debt and hope\u201d. </p> <p>Quite right, too. Life has become tougher for William Hill over the past year, and it has lost its chief executive on the way, but there was no reason to panic.</p> <p>But now comes a deal the board wants to look at \u2013 a potential \u201cmerger of equals\u201d with Amaya, the Canadian company whose PokerStars website dominates the world of online poker. But, using Davis\u2019s own yardsticks, the appeal looks wobbly at best.</p> <p>On risk, Amaya brings at least two big ones. The more obvious is a $870m (\u00a3704m) penalty in the US state of Kentucky. Amaya is probably correct in thinking it will not end up paying anything like that sum, but one can never be sure given US authorities\u2019 past (baffling) attempts to combat online poker.</p> <p>The other risk is that William Hill ends up with too much exposure to unregulated markets, meaning those where gambling is either banned or the rules are so unclear that your local operation can legislated out of existence. At the moment, William Hill\u2019s exposure to unregulated territories is an admirably low 5%. After a merger with Amaya, the ratio would rise to about a quarter of the business. Big difference.</p> <p>On debt, Amaya would bring a bundle. The combined group\u2019s borrowings would be about 3.5 times the top-line profits. Historically, William Hill has aimed for under two times. If high levels of debt are not your bag, Amaya is a strange choice of partner.</p> <p>The hope element is that cross-selling will do wonders for both companies \u2013 that Amaya\u2019s poker players will want to bet on sport with William Hill, and vice versa. That seems plausible, but the degree is untested.</p> <p>Add it up and we can agree that Amaya looks a better gamble than the complex Rank/888 proposal, where the debt ratios would have been even higher. The Canadian company is a fearsome generator of cash and it is digital and international \u2013 qualities prized by William Hill. All the same, there\u2019s a whiff of desperation in the idea that an overdose of online poker, a game that\u2019s barely growing these days, is the thing to fire up William Hill.</p> <p>Note the limp reaction in the share price, up just 3%. In poker terms, Amaya is offering a marginal hand. William Hill\u2019s investors may fairly feel the self-help cards are stronger.</p> <h2>Clock ticking on RBS inquiry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc59042ef519029528a08c955eb3f98d72b8b4bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc59042ef519029528a08c955eb3f98d72b8b4bf/0_0_4092_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RBS cash machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RBS has admitted it did not always meet its own standards when dealing with small business customers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bad smell around Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s global restructuring group (GRG) refuses to go away. Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to then-business secretary Sir Vince Cable, was the first to allege that the unit routinely ripped off small business customers, forced healthy companies into insolvency and then bought their assets for a song. That was back in 2013.</p> <p>RBS has admitted it \u201cdid not always meet our own high standards\u201d when dealing with small business customers but it has always vehemently denied (and did so again on Monday) the ugly charge of crashing viable businesses for its own gain. The bank has also commissioned two inquiries, both of which cleared the bank on the central allegations. And yet material keeps coming. Witness Buzzfeed and BBC Newsnight\u2019s coverage of documents in which an RBS official wrote about a \u201cdash for cash\u201d.</p> <p>In the end, it is only the Financial Conduct Authority, armed with powers of investigation, that can make sense of the tale. Its inquiry was launched in January 2014 after Tomlinson\u2019s report and was initially promised by the end of 2015. That deadline came and went. This month\u2019s update from the regulator said its review has been \u201ccomplex and lengthy\u201d and that it was therefore \u201cimportant that we do not rush the final stages of this process\u201d.</p> <p>Well, yes, it\u2019s better to be accurate than to be quick. But the FCA is still pushing the limits of acceptability on timing. Andrew Bailey, the organisation\u2019s new boss, has hinted that he is aiming for publication by the end of this year. Better to make that a firm commitment and work some overtime. Delay has not helped small firms that may or may not be due compensation \u2013 and it\u2019s not doing much for RBS either.</p> <h2>Mitie lessons to learn from \u2018prickly peer\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3d52643f2087b52852f2bbb0299490d0a15580f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d52643f2087b52852f2bbb0299490d0a15580f/26_76_1959_1175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby McGregor-Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruby McGregor-Smith is stepping down as Mitie CEO.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mitie Group wants you to know that Ruby McGregor-Smith is leaving of her own volition. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/mitie-outsourcing-chief-executive-ruby-mcgregor-smith-steps-down\">News of her departure</a> after 10 years at the helm was presented as an \u201cupdate on CEO succession plans\u201d.

The delay in approving the \u20ac1.7bn was \u201ca secondary issue\u201d, he said, as Greece did not have any imminent debt repayments.</p> <p>Both sides said the delay was unavoidable, because Greek officials have not finished collecting debt arrears data for September, a necessary step for unlocking the money.</p> <p>The eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is expected to approve the release of the \u20ac1.7bn at a board meeting at the end of October.</p> <p>More than a year since it teetered on the brink of financial meltdown, Athens and its creditors are in regular talks over its compliance with the bailout terms.</p> <p>The reforms, known as milestones in eurozone jargon, include very precise changes to pensions, energy markets and the running of Greece\u2019s central bank and tax-collection agency.

Miliband said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is clearly a mandate for Brexit from this referendum but there is no mandate for the particular form of Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Clegg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the basis of what constitutional principle do you believe that the prime minister can now arrogate to herself the exclusive right to interpret what Brexit means, impose it upon the country, rather than protect the rightful role of scrutiny and approval of this House?</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Tory MPs made the same point. But Davis argued that those arguing for the Commons to decide negotiating terms \u201ccannot tell the difference between accountability and micro-management\u201d. He said that MPs would get plenty of chances to debate the issue. But, dismissing calls for MPs to be given a binding vote on the Brexit negotiations, he said that it was important for the government to be able to negotiate what it thought was in the national interest without being constrained by having to declare full details of its negotiating position to MPs. Speaking for Labour, the shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer </strong>said MPs should get a vote \u201con the basic terms\u201d of the renegotiation.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to commit the government to publishing a white paper on the Brexit negotiations.</strong> He proposed one in an article he wrote as a backbencher in July, shortly before he was appointed to the cabinet, but, despite being asked repeatedly, refused to commit the government to publishing such document.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the terms \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit were \u201cdesigned to deceive\u201d and \u201cnot meaningful in any way\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He hinted that the government might accept a transitional trade deal with the EU if it could not agree a final one within two years. </strong>Labour\u2019s <strong>Hilary Benn</strong> said a transitional deal might be necessary to stop the UK having to trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms if, after two years, a permanent trade deal has not been finalised. Benn asked if Davis agreed. Davis said he did not expect this to happen. But he went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not going to offer a view. I will just simply say this; we are going to do everything possible to protect, enhance and maximise the opportunities for British business. And he can draw his conclusion. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the government could not stop the pound going up and down during the Brexit process. </strong>In response to a question from Labour\u2019s <strong>Emma Reynolds</strong> about why the pound dropped to a 30-year low after the Conservative conference, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recommend you read a book called Flash Boys because part of that fall, the major part of that fall was the flash crash as a result of that. Otherwise, there are lots and lots of speculative comments that will drive the pound down and up and down and up in the next two-and-a-half years and there\u2019s little we can do about that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said there would be no downside to Brexit and only \u201cconsiderable upsides\u201d if the government got what it wanted. </strong>The government had four goals, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One is to regain control of our borders. Another is to get back control of our laws. The one I did not list was our aim to keep our justice and security arrangements at least as strong as they are. Finally, and most importantly in this context, the United Kingdom must aim to maintain the best possible open access to European markets and vice versa. If we can achieve all that, there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he expected EU leaders to compromise during the Brexit talks.</strong> What they were saying now was not what they would be saying in the future, he said.

Earlier,<strong> Ed Miliband,</strong> the former Labour leader, told BBC News that MPs should vote on the Brexit strategy, not least to give the government a mandate. The government could publish a white paper on its plans and put it to a vote, he said. He said he was not trying to enable MPs to reverse the referendum result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am saying we are going to be leaving the European Union. That\u2019s what the British people voted for. But we\u2019ve got to get those negotiations right. It was Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who said last week the British people did not vote to make themselves poorer. And he\u2019s right about that. And what worried me about some of what we heard at the Conservative conference was - I understand the concerns about immigration - but what I felt was our whole economy was in danger of being thrown off a cliff ...</p> <p>We need to be knowing now what the government will be negotiating for. And I believe they need to get the consent of MPs. Because there is no other mandate here. The Conservative manifesto said that the Conservative party was determined to stay in the single market. Now, it sounded from what Theresa May and some of her ministers were saying that we were going to leave the single market, contrary to the mandate. So there is no mandate for a hard Brexit. That is why parliament has got to be consulted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One <strong>Dominic Grieve</strong>, the Conservative former attorney general, said MPs should be given the chance to vote on triggering article 50, the move that will start the formal EU withdrawal process. And <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong>, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, told the same programme that he thought MPs should debate the government\u2019s negotiating position.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to me British interests will be best served by an early and full and detailed explanation from the government of what its negotiating position is before it embarks on those discussions ...</p> <p>What has never been discussed in any depth is what we arrive at.

It gives them a 17-point lead.</p> <p>Here are the new figures, and how they compare to the previous Guardian/ICM polling figures from early September, before the conference season started.</p> <p>Conservatives: 43% (up 2)<br></p> <p>Labour: 26% (down 2)</p> <p>Ukip: 11% (down 2)</p> <p>Lib Dems: 8% (down 1)</p> <p>Greens: 6% (up 2)</p> <p>The fieldwork was carried out from Friday to Sunday.</p> <p>The 17-point lead is the joint second highest ever recorded for the Conservatives by ICM in its polling series going back to 1992. They only once got a higher lead (20 points in June 2008, when Gordon Brown was at his most unpopular) although in September and October 2009 they also had a 17-point lead in ICM polls. But Labour did have larger polling leads at various points in the Blair era.</p> <p>At 26%, the Labour figure is only one point higher than their lowest rating in ICM polling - the 25% they hit in June 2008 and August 2009.</p> <p>The Conservative conference was dominated by news about Theresa May hardening up her stance on Brexit and the ICM figures suggest this has gone down well with voters. Although the proposal to force firms to reveal what proportion of their workforce is foreign has now been dropped, following a backlash from business,<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/public-backs-plans-make-companies-say-how-many-for/\"> a YouGov poll at the end of last week suggested voters backed the idea by two to one.</a></p> <p>The Tories may also have benefited from the fall in the Ukip share of the vote. At 11% Ukip are on their lowest level in an ICM poll since the 2015 general election, and this may reflect the damage done to the party\u2019s reputation by the fight in the European parliament on Thursday that left Steven Woolfe MEP hospitalised.</p> <p><em> ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,017 adults aged 18+ on 7-9<sup>th</sup> October 2016, and the data has been weighted to the profile of all adults.

  "<p>It will be two months on Wednesday since Heather Stanning and Helen Glover won their second Olympic rowing title in the women\u2019s pair as they matched their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/london-2012-glover-stanning-gb-gold\">London 2012 triumph</a> with another commanding performance in Rio. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/helen-glover-heather-stanning-rio-2016-olympics-rowing\">defending their Olympic title</a> they sealed an imperious unbeaten run which stretches across the past five years and 39 races.</p> <p>Such authority brings demanding expectations and, as Stanning says now: \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come away with gold in Rio it would have been a massive disappointment. London meant the world to me but I almost did it too quickly. At that stage I hadn\u2019t been a world champion at senior level. I had loads to learn. Since then we\u2019ve become world champions and defended that title, become European champions and set the world record. It meant I was much more emotional and aware of everything I was doing in Rio.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning, who is a major in the British Army, speaks with such quiet conviction it sounds as if even a silver medal in Rio would have felt disastrous. \u201cAbsolutely. We put an awful lot of pressure on ourselves and defending the title meant much more than winning it the first time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/pep-guardiola-exclusive-interview-johan-cruyff-unique\">Pep Guardiola: \u2018I would not be here without Johan Cruyff. He was unique\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The depth of that meaning becomes obvious when Stanning relives the surprisingly tumultuous period that tested her, Glover and their coach Robin Williams. War in Afghanistan, cancer, stress and doubt are not the usual markers of sporting domination.</p> <p>Soon after London 2012 Stanning was preparing for a year away from rowing and six months in Helmand province in Afghanistan. In her understated way she says: \u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of \u2013 athletes taking a year out \u2013 but people were shocked because me and Helen had only been in the boat two years. They said: \u2018You need a break already?\u2019 But if I didn\u2019t return to work then I would\u2019ve been out of touch with the military for too long.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no pressure from the army but I needed to do an operational tour. All through my training at Sandhurst it was about operations and gearing up towards that job on tour. It felt like being part of a sports team but never getting out on the pitch. Within a month of London I was at work again. It was also an escape from a world where I wasn\u2019t really comfortable \u2026 this media world where I was in the spotlight. It was good going back to a job where people had known me since long before I became an Olympic champion. I felt normal again.\u201d</p> <p>Was Helmand as she had expected? \u201cYeah, pretty much. For me it was quite an uneventful time. I was sat at a desk and spent four months doing night shifts.\u201d</p> <p>Did it feel like a war zone? \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be vigilant and there were plenty of reminders as I was there for six months. People would be coming back into camp after being out on an exercise or after a long night. Their way of destressing from the environment, and switching off, was watching sport. It was a really successful sporting summer in 2013 \u2013 and watching the Tour de France, the Lions tour in Australia and the Ashes really lifted morale.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning\u2019s Olympic victory the previous summer had thrilled her fellow soldiers. But she must have been aware that further success for Glover and her new partner, Polly Swann, who became 2013 world champions, undermined her own rowing future?</p> <p>\u201cI was genuinely pleased Polly did so well,\u201d Stanning says. \u201cI knew she was a great athlete and we\u2019re friends. I was also really pleased Helen could forge a winning partnership with someone else \u2013 just to prove she\u2019s an amazing individual athlete.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning is warm and generous but, surely, she must have been worried about her own position? \u201cNot really. I was genuinely happy for them. But, yes, I did think: \u2018If I want to get back in that boat with Helen I need to beat a world champion.\u2019 So it spurred me on massively. I did weights and cross\u2011fit work. Running at 40C heat in the desert is slightly different.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after returning from Afghanistan, Stanning took to the water on a cold afternoon in December 2013. \u201cI went down to the training centre after everyone else had left for the day \u2013 just in case I fell into the water and embarrassed myself. Robin hung around and we had a session together. I knew I was fit compared to the general public. But coming back into the national programme the fitness you need is phenomenal. I was thinking: \u2018Oh my God, how am I going to do this tomorrow and the next day and the next?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Stanning realised how far she had fallen when she took part in a trial in Lincolnshire. She smiles wryly at the memory of finishing in 22nd place. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my finest moment.\u201d</p> <p>Real life soon overshadowed mere sporting worries. \u201cRobin had felt unwell for most of the summer of 2013 but hadn\u2019t worked out what it was,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen I came back from Helmand he wasn\u2019t himself and by Christmas he had been diagnosed with cancer [of the bladder]. Very quickly, in January, he had surgery. He\u2019s relatively young, fit and healthy and all the signs were positive. But you still have to go through this very traumatic surgery and recovery. It was about six weeks before he was allowed to be out walking again.

He\u2019s got kids \u2013 Lizzie is about 25 and Matthew is coming to the end of his school years. So he wanted to get well for them. But, yeah, it was such a turbulent time.

It\u2019s tricky. After Christmas [2013] I struggled but my focus was the Matrix [the qualifying test] in March where me and Polly were racing each other to see who came out on top. At that stage it looked as if Polly was going to win.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning clawed her way back and, by May 2014, she seemed to have won the struggle with Swann. \u201cI won the Matrix so I was back in the boat with Helen and we won the trials and all our times were really good. But one day I felt great and the next day I didn\u2019t. In the trials we had back-to-back racing and two or three races a day took everything out of me. By the time we got to the final I just didn\u2019t have the juice over the last 500m. Helen was like: \u2018Er \u2026 come on!\u2019 We should have won by a lot more than we did but I was absolutely spent.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning took a break and Swann stepped back in to win at the 2014 European championships with Glover. \u201cThe medical team decided I needed to take a step back. I was getting migraines and my body was trying to cope with the stress of working at 100% every day, every week. On days that were meant to be 70% days I was still working at 100% just to keep up. It was definitely the most turbulent season.\u201d</p> <p>The next two years were very different. With Stanning restored to full health she and Glover became crushingly dominant. They produced <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rowing/34163092\">almost the perfect race at the world championships in 2015</a> and were faintly bemused anyone might doubt them. \u201cWe had this amazing season and raced incredibly well. But there had been lots of chat about this young Kiwi pair. They were being bigged up \u2013 not only by their own team but by the media. And we were like \u2018Uh \u2026 really?\u2019 We had raced them and beaten them. We got a huge margin ahead and we kept expecting the Americans and Kiwis to come back at us \u2013 but they didn\u2019t. We cruised home and felt really contained.\u201d</p> <p>Such controlled improvement defines their success and Stanning explains their winning mentality. \u201cWe had won by such a big margin in 2012 \u2013 but we knew if we raced as we had done in London we would be beaten in Rio. Before the [2016] final I was really confident even if I knew we still had to go out and deliver. We had learnt a lesson at Bled [in Slovenia] in 2011 which was the last time we lost \u2013 we were leading until the very last stroke of the race and what we didn\u2019t have in our bag of tricks back then was a sprint finish. We do now. We knew if people were still close to us near the end we could just change gear and go.\u201d</p> <p>Glover and Stanning, aged 30 and 31, were not stretched as they won their second gold medal. The intriguing question now is whether they will keep rowing towards the next Olympics. \u201cWe both want a year similar to my 2012 \u2013 when I focused on my career. Helen also needs a break after six years of continuous rowing for her. It\u2019s healthy for us to both step away.\u201d</p> <p>Stanning reveals with some amusement that <a href=\"http://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2016082433197/helen-glover-steve-backshall-talk-wedding-post-olympics/\">she was in Hello magazine last month</a>, as maid of honour to Glover at her wedding to Steve Backshall, the naturalist and television presenter. Their lives are very different \u2013 with Glover having the opportunity to move into television work while Stanning gets used to her new role in the army.</p> <p>Apart from beginning a nine-month course, as a newly appointed major, Stanning has been working with Royal British Legion Industries on a campaign called <a href=\"https://www.bebravewithme.org.uk/\">Be Brave With Me</a> \u2013 raising awareness and funds on behalf of military veterans struggling to find work or manage their transition back into the civilian world. Last month she helped 15 veterans overcome a fear of heights with a roof walk over London\u2019s O<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the guys were really impressive when you consider their injuries,\u201d Stanning says. \u201cThey were looking up, thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do this again\u2019\u2026 but then saying: \u2018You know what? I can.\u2019 The campaign is really important and shows we\u2019re getting better at talking about these issues. People are being more open and I\u2019m proud to be part of it.\u201d</p> <p>A year from now does Stanning expect she and Glover will be back on the water \u2013 in pursuit of a third gold medal in Tokyo? \u201cI keep flipping back and forth. After London I had a clear image of what I wanted to do. Now I am not so clear but the army have said they will support me if I want to go to Tokyo. Helen and I are still undecided but we don\u2019t really have a deadline. I\u2019ve proved to myself that I can come back and do it. Neither of us is battling injury and we\u2019re doing something fun and special in the boat. So the temptation is definitely there.\u201d</p>",

the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia event in Canberra on Monday.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief bureaucrat said the future of the country will be determined \u201cby the resourcefulness of its people, not the resources lying under it\u201d. </p> <p>Parkinson noted that in advanced countries, including Australia, growth in incomes has \u201cslowed markedly, with impacts on living standards and fiscal positions\u201d.</p> <p>By looking at multi-factor productivity, we can measure the rate of innovation in products and the processes for making them, he

On Friday, a few hours before the first of three baby-boomer bucket-list double headers \u2013 Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, Neil Young and Paul McCartney, the Who and Roger Waters \u2013 a 2005 video recording leaked of Donald Trump\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\"> lewd conversation with a TV host</a> and left the world speechless. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca16a27c45d95bb883491663199b71f7725cc31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca16a27c45d95bb883491663199b71f7725cc31/0_0_4168_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An inflatable pig carrying political slogans flies above the crowd at Empire Polo Club during Roger Waters\u2019 closing set on 9 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An inflatable pig carrying political slogans flies above the crowd during Roger Waters\u2019 closing set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By Sunday night, the audience were preparing to return to the national nightmare via the second debate, but for a trio of blissful days, it was an opportunity to travel back to simpler, pre-Reagan years. Wealthy and abashed GOP-ers gulped $29 glasses of Silver Oak cabernet and sidled up next to self-righteous silver-haired Democrat hippies to ask sheepishly for a toke off their joints, and we all, CEOs and chakra readers, dads and daughters, young and old, disappeared into the music.</p> <p>When golden gods of rock are your escorts, of course, that escape comes at a price: tickets alone already generated a cool $160m from the estimated 75,000 attendees. A general admission weekend pass to the fest cost $399, but to stand in line for overpriced wine with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/oct/10/great-barrier-reef-legacy-invites-leonardo-dicaprio-to-join-its-campaign-video\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> or Tommy Lee, both of whom were spotted at the festival, you had to pony up $1,599 for tickets in the pit.

At 73, Mick Jagger strutted down the catwalk better than Cara Delevingne, who was watching the Rolling Stones\u2019 ecstatic set of nonstop hits. Dangling a cigarette from one hand and grinning crookedly, Keith Richards played with obvious joy. Neil Young delivered the best line of the festival (\u201cCome back tomorrow night \u2013 Roger\u2019s gonna build a wall and make Mexico great again\u201d) and ripped into a 20-plus-minute rendition of Down by the River. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a> stayed on stage for almost three hours, the Who roared what seemed to be the loudest set of the festival and Waters saved the whole thing from being stuck in the past by using the stage as a political platform. Dylan elicited some grumbles by not saying a word to the audience or allowing his face to be shown on the big screens, but a fan plugging up his phone to a charging station shrugged and said he\u2019d been the same way when he saw him play in 1978.</p> <p>When news of Desert Trip\u2019s two-show-per-night lineup and cushy seating options broke in mid-April, it coincided with Coachella, the sweaty, frantic festival that squeezes in nearly 60 shows and 100,000 partiers per day.

Ben Carson, a former primary season rival of the Republican nominee, insisted that when Trump made those remarks \u201cthat was a very different time in his life and at that time he was a billionaire playboy and the language that he used was consistent with that\u201d.</p> <p>Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani also dismissed the wave of Republicans who had announced in the past 48 hours that they were no longer voting for Trump. \u201cSometimes Republicans get a little weak-kneed,\u201d said Giuliani. \u201cI happen to be a Republican with very strong knees.\u201d</p> <p>Only two Republican officials were in the spin room to praise Trump\u2019s performance: longtime Trump ally Senator Jeff Sessions and congressman Jason Smith of Missouri.

Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton, which he has denied.

  "<p>Bill Mollison, who has died aged 88, was one of the co-creators of permaculture, an agricultural system that works with, rather than against, nature, on the basis that the natural world holds the key to stable and productive systems. Having developed the concept, he then travelled from his native Tasmania for 30 years to embed his approach worldwide. His ideas have spread widely \u2013 permaculture is practised in more than 140 countries and by more than 3 million people \u2013 even though in the 1970s the idea was considered, in Mollison\u2019s words, \u201cthe highest form of sedition\u201d.</p> <p>Much of what he espoused was based on his great respect for the wisdom of subsistence farmers around the world, who have long used sustainable methods to grow their crops. In agricultural terms, this means planting diverse sets of crops, using perennial species to form productive stable systems, and ensuring the conditions for soils to be regenerated.</p> <p>Other characteristics that he observed in the Tasmanian wilderness informed permaculture, for instance that the interfaces between different habitats are the most productive and that elements such as plants and animals need to be placed together so they are mutually beneficial \u2013 as once when he pointed out: \u201cYou don\u2019t have a slug problem, you have a duck deficiency!\u201d</p> <p>Mollison pointed to further beneficial ecological consequences: \u201cThe only safe energy systems are those derived from biological systems. A New Guinea gardener can walk through the gates of his garden taking one unit of energy and hand out 70. A modern farmer who drives a tractor through the gate takes 1,000 units of energy in and gives one back. Who is the most sophisticated agriculturalist?\u201d He held that \u201calthough the problems of the world are increasingly complex, the solutions remain embarrassingly simple\u201d. Ecological systems would enable people to meet their own needs, take back control of their lives and reinforce nature rather than deplete it.</p> <p>Born in the fishing village of Stanley, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Bill (whose given name was actually Bruce), was the son of Roland Mollison and his wife, Amy (nee Harmon). His parents ran a butter factory, and later built the village bakehouse that Bill took over at the age of 14 when his father died, delivering bread with a horse called Topsy.</p> <p>In his 20s, he worked as a fisherman, forester and trapper. He understood and celebrated the self-reliance of rural life in the 1930s and 40s, and his love of the natural world led him to join the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 1954, working in agricultural research for 10 years before leaving to study <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/biogeography\">biogeography</a>, the study of the distribution of plants and animals, at Hobart University.</p> <p>He was appointed a lecturer at Hobart in 1968, and some years later developed a new discipline, environmental psychology. At this stage he could have settled into a comfortable academic life. However, he felt increasingly trapped by traditional academia and sought instead to marry his studies in psychology with the natural world, seeking an elusive operating system that would inspire people through a systematic design process to build abundant and resilient lifestyles.</p> <p>At the age of 50, after his university peers had roundly rejected his plea for a cross-disciplinary holistic approach to their work, he turned his back on formal education. Joined by an environmental design student, David Holmgren, Mollison started to sketch out the origins of what we now know as permaculture. Nobody had put together the architecture for a regenerative design approach that drew on knowledge of traditional cultures while adapting to the opportunities of new technologies and systems thinking. It simply did not exist.</p> <p>Into this framework they introduced concepts from other ecological pioneers, indigenous cultures and peasant farmers, combining them with a keen observation of the natural world. In 1978 Mollison and Holmgren published Permaculture One, the precursor of Mollison\u2019s more detailed Permaculture \u2013 A Designers\u2019 Manual (1988). This was to become the \u201cpermaculture bible\u201d, and is still used as a reference text for teachers. It expands the concepts at the heart of agroecology, agroforestry, carbon farming, regenerative agriculture, sustainable architecture and local money systems, providing the intellectual framework that supports the continuing evolution of his ideas.</p> <p>Thereafter Mollison wanted to spread his ideas, and decided to teach an informal two-week course in permaculture, operating from what he dubbed \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of Strickland Avenue\u201d, the street in Hobart where he and Holmgren lived. He devised a curriculum and shared it with anyone who might turn up \u2013 a move so audacious that it was laughable. As his students grew in confidence they taught similar 72-hour courses, and after 10 years of continuous touring and teaching, Mollison \u2013 with the help of his network of loosely affiliated teachers \u2013 had spread his ideas across five continents. In 1981 he received the <a href=\"http://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/\">Right Livelihood award</a>.</p> <p>Although his original principles remain in place, the courses have evolved to expand beyond agriculture and into areas such as design, engineering, construction and architecture, all based on an ecological approach, and his ideas have been taken up by the international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/15/transition-towns-way-forward\">Transition Town</a> movement.</p> <p>Mollison had a brilliant mind. He observed, he catalogued, and his systematic approach helped him to weave seemingly disparate ideas into the most detailed tapestry. In this sense he was a true visionary. He was also challenging, angry, driven by a deep sense of injustice, and merciless if crossed. He used to say: \u201cFirst feel fear, then get angry. Then go with your life into the fight.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his fifth wife, Lisa, four daughters and two sons.</p> <p>\u2022 Bill (Bruce Charles) Mollison, ecologist, born 4 May 1928; died 24 September 2016</p>",

  "<p>Governments will address the law of unintended consequences when they meet this week to revise a global treaty and try to eliminate the use of a group of greenhouse gases used in fridges, inhalers and air conditioners.<br></p> <p>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were hailed as the answer to the hole in the ozone layer which appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols which depleted the thin layer of ozone which protects the Earth from harmful rays of the sun. </p> <p>One hundred and ninety-seven countries signed the historic 1987 agreement which phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and similar hydrochlorofluoro carbons (HCFCs) and has seen gradual closure of the two polar ozone holes. </p> <p>But concern has been mounting at how their substitute is undermining the landmark Paris climate agreement and could hamper attempts to keep global warming below dangerous levels.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe use of hydrofluorocarbons is growing. Already, the HFCs used in refrigerators, air conditioners, inhalers ... are emitting a gigaton of CO2-equivalent pollution into the atmosphere annually. If that sounds like a lot; it is. It\u2019s equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants every single year,\u201d the US secretary of state, John Kerry, told <a href=\"http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/07/22/john-kerry-hfcs-are-a-critical-piece-of-the-climate-puzzle/\">a UN meeting on the Montreal protocol </a> earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cAn HFC phasedown amendment is a critical piece of the climate puzzle,\u201d he added.</p> <p>HFC use is increasing rapidly, driven by sales of fridges and air conditioning especially in fast-growing developing countries. </p> <p>Researchers at the <a href=\"http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/article/55587/berkeley-lab-study-shows-significant-potential-for-deployment-of-superefficient-a\">US government\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory </a>have calculated that 700m air-conditioning units, all using HFCs, are likely to be installed worldwide by 2030 and 1.6bn by 2050, it says. </p> <p>The UN\u2019s climate change body, the IPCC, has projected that <a href=\"http://www.rehva.eu/publications-and-resources/rehva-journal/2015/042015/air-conditioning-environmental-challenges.html\">global air-conditioning energy demand will grow</a> 33-fold from 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2000 to more than 10,000TWh in 2100, with most of the growth coming in developing economies.</p> <p>Countries meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, this week will be asked to approve an amendment to the Montreal protocol. This would cover HFCs and, over time, eliminate the manufacture of the chemicals and, potentially reduce global temperatures by an around 0.5C by 2100. </p> <p>A fast phasedown of the factory-made HFCs could avoid the equivalent of as much as 200bn tonnes of CO2<sub> </sub> by 2050, according <a href=\"http://www.igsd.org/fast-hfc-phase-down-could-avoid-200-billion-tonnes-of-co2-eq-by-2050/\">to a study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics</a>.</p> <p>But negotiations will be tough. Rich countries want the chemicals phased out within 5-10 years, but developing countries led by China and India have argued for a date closer to 2031 which, they say, will give their chemical industries time to adapt. </p> <p>But because HFC alternatives, including natural refrigerants such as CO2, and hydrocarbons, already exist, there is no technical reason why HFC reductions cannot be achieved quickly and inexpensively, say scientists and environmentalists.</p> <p>G7 countries have committed to provide additional funding to help developing countries implement an HFC amendment and last month a group of philanthropists <a href=\"http://oneworld.org/2016/09/22/philanthropists-53m-fund-aims-to-aid-fight-against-climate-change/\">pledged $53m</a> to help.</p> <p>\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interests to phase out HFCs as soon as possible,\u201d said Gaby Drinkwater, Christian Aid\u2019s policy officer. \u201cAs people in developing countries seek more air conditioners and refrigerators, a heavy expansion of HFCs could deal a significant blow to the ambition of the Paris agreement and set back any progress made on keeping global warming to 2C.\u201d</p> <p>However, environmentalists with a long memory say that governments could have easily avoided the release of tens of billions of tons of HFC chemicals if they had listened to scientists in the 1980s. </p> <p>\u201cHFCs were always known to have the potential to increase global warming. We solved the ozone problem of ozone but governments chose not to address the climate-changing potential of their substitutes even though they knew about it,\u201d said Dr Robin Russell-Jones, former director of the skin tumour unit at the St John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology in London.</p> <p>\u201cIf it takes over a quarter of a century to fix a simple technological problem, then what chance is there for the world community to solve global warming?\u201d he added.</p> <p>In 1989, he wrote in one of Britain\u2019s leading medical journals, the Lancet: \u201cMost scientists want to see the Montreal protocol widened to include substitutes like HCFC22.

  "<p>Black communities in London are disproportionately more likely to breathe illegal levels of air pollution than white and Asian ones, new research seen exclusively by the Guardian shows.</p> <p>The study for the mayor of London shows black, African and Caribbean people account for 15.3% of all Londoners exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels that breach EU limits, but they account for just 13.3% of the city\u2019s population.</p> <p>The proportion of white and Asian individuals exposed to the dangerous NO2 levels is lower than the fraction of the population they account for, said Aether, the consultancy which produced the report.<br></p> <p>Southwark, Lambeth and Hackney were among the boroughs with an overlap of both a higher proportion of black residents and the higher pollution levels.</p> <p>Previous research has shown there is a clear link between economically deprived areas and greater exposure to polluted air. But the new work, which comes as Sadiq Khan launches <a href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/environment/air-quality-consultation-phase-2?cid=airquality-consultation\">a new consultation on charges to tackle London\u2019s polluted air</a>, is one of the first to suggest there is a related race dimension too. </p> <p>\u201cPeople living in places with high proportions of black, mixed or \u2018other\u2019 ethnic groups are more likely to be exposed to above EU NO2 limit value concentrations than those in areas with a high proportion of white people,\u201d said the Aether study. \u201cThis effect is not seen for areas with a high proportion of Asian groups.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-10T13:31:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"pollution graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-10T13:31:08/embed.html\">pollution graphic</a> </figure>  <p>But because of the \u201cvery mixed ethnic geography of London\u201d, the pattern is less strong between ethnicity and exposure than the one between deprivation and exposure, Aether found. In areas with poor air quality, 32% of people living there were from the most deprived groups, versus 7% from the least deprived.</p> <p>\u201cThis research shows the disproportionate impact air pollution has on deprived communities in London,\u201d said Aether\u2019s director, Katie King.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have known for some time now that poor families end up living in cheaper housing which is often in close proximity to busy roads,\u201d said a spokesman for the air quality unit at King\u2019s College London.</p> <p>However, he said the new study\u2019s use of proportionate data was misleading, as in absolute terms there are more Asian and white people exposed to high NO2 levels.<br></p> <p>Last month, the Black Lives Matter UK group linked ethnicity and environmental issues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-occupy-london-city-airport-runway\">during a protest at London City airport</a> - although the protestors were also criticised for their largely white membership.</p> <p>The study compiled King\u2019s data on NO2 concentrations in 2013 \u2013 the most recent available \u2013 census results, official statistics on deprivation and ethnic profiles of small areas in London. In total, 1.9 million people in London were exposed to NO2 concentrations above the EU\u2019s annual average limit.<br></p> <p>The work is an update of a report which the former mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/boris-johnson-accused-of-burying-study-linking-pollution-and-deprived-schools\">Boris Johnson was accused of burying when Khan took office</a>. That earlier report showed 433 primary schools were exposed to NO2 above the limits in 2010, with that number falling to 360 by 2013 in today\u2019s study, showing some areas have got cleaner.</p> <p>Transport for London (TfL) published a consultation on Monday seeking Londoners\u2019 views on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/13/sadiq-khan-to-double-size-londons-clean-air-zone-pollution\">Khan\u2019s new measures to tackle the problem</a>. They include whether to introduce a \u00a310 emissions surcharge in October 2017, the so-called T-charge, which will mostly apply to pre-2005 diesel cars.</p> <p>Khan and TfL are also consulting on whether to bring in an enlarged \u201cultra low emissions zone\u201d (Ulez) in 2019 rather than 2020 as previously planned, charging owners of dirtier cars \u00a312.50 to enter. Both charges will be in addition to the existing \u00a311.50 congestion charge.</p> <p>\u201cToxic air in London is a health emergency that requires bold action, including introducing charges for older polluting vehicles and expanding the Ulez,\u201d said Khan.</p> <p>Environmental groups and thinktanks welcomed the proposals, but Friends of the Earth said the mayor needed to go further.</p> <p>\u201cTo bring down London\u2019s air pollution as quickly as possible, Sadiq Khan must extend the Ulez for all vehicles across the whole of London; and create a plan for phasing out diesel on London\u2019s roads altogether,\u201d said Sophie Neuburg, a campaigner at the green group.</p> <p>Next week the government faces a court case brought by environmental law firm ClientEarth over what it says is an inadequate plan to reduce NO2 pollution.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement sends a clear message to the government that it needs to get a grip with this public health crisis. This is a national problem that needs a national solution. That is why we are taking them back to court next week,\u201d said Alan Andrews, a ClientEarth lawyer.</p>",
  "<p>It was the dog, or fox, that didn\u2019t bark.

It\u2019s not country v city, either: 82% of rural voters oppose hunting.</p> <p>Conservative MPs with slender majorities ignore these figures at their peril.

  "<p>Eleven days after becoming a father, Jeroen Ensink stepped out of his London flat to post cards to friends, proudly announcing the birth of his daughter, Fleur. \u201cHe left at 1.45pm. He was dead at 1.50pm,\u201d said his widow, Nadja Ensink-Teich, 37. \u201cAnd from that moment, my life stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Ensink, 41, an internationally renowned water engineer and academic, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/man-admits-killing-academic-jeroen-ensink-islington-doorstep-stabbing\">killed on his Islington doorstep</a> in a random attack by a stranger, Timchang Nandap, who was known to police and had a mental illness. </p> <p>On Monday, Nandap was given an indefinite hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of suffering a mental abnormality. The 23-year-old student stabbed Ensink repeatedly in the chest and back until an off-duty special constable intervened.</p> <p>Nandap, who was suffering psychosis at the time of the killing, had been arrested seven months previously for allegedly possessing a knife and assaulting a police officer. Those charges were dropped six days before Ensink, an acclaimed researcher and senior lecturer in public health engineering at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was killed. </p> <p>Ensink-Teich, who was in court for the sentencing, is now calling for a full independent investigation into the circumstances that led to her husband\u2019s death, believing the tragedy highlights failures in the health and judicial system.</p> <p>\u201cHow could this even happen? That is my biggest question,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cKnowing that it might have been prevented is a hard fact to live with.\u201d Speaking publicly for the first time, she added: \u201cKnowing those charges were dropped six days before. That is very hard. That is unbearable.\u201d</p> <p>When he was killed, Ensink, who had travelled the world to improve clean water access and basic sanitation in sub-Saharan African and Asian communities, was moments from their front door. Ensink-Teich, an events manager, was inside, caring for their newborn.</p> <p>She knew nothing of what happened outside as she could not see the street from the flat. At 2pm, a friend who was due to visit called to say the road was cordoned off. Wondering where her husband was and believing him to have been caught up by the cordon, she went down with Fleur to ask police if she could look for him. She remembers noticing a tent just to the left.<br></p> <p>Officers asked for a description of her husband. \u201cTall and good looking,\u201d she replied. \u201cI felt silly the moment I said that.\u201d The officers told her she should return to her flat and that they would keep her updated. </p> <p>She recalled: \u201cNot long afterwards, there was a knock at the door. And there were three police officers. And I just knew. It is like the floor opens, and you just fall and fall and fall. I knew the instant I opened the door. I didn\u2019t know exactly what, but I knew it was the worst thing ever.\u201d</p> <p>Now, almost 10 months since Ensink\u2019s death, the flat is sold because she could not stop looking at the spot where he died, and Ensink-Teich has moved back to the Netherlands, where both were originally from, to live with her parents.<br></p> <p>Referring to a photograph showing the couple on holiday last year on a deserted beach in the Netherlands, she said: \u201cI was five months pregnant.

She said: \u201cI miss the life that I was supposed to have. I miss the anniversaries that I will never have with him. I miss the children we will never have. I miss the inside jokes. I miss hearing about his day at work. I miss the twinkle of his eyes. I miss his touch and the sound of his voice when he\u2019d tell me he loved me.\u201d</p> <p>The Old Bailey heard that Nandap, a Nigerian-born student who lived in Woolwich, south London, had heard voices urging him to \u201csacrifice\u201d a man. Nandap, who also uses the name Femi, believed he was \u201cthe chosen one\u201d or the \u201cblack Messiah\u201d.</p> <p>On the day of the killing, he was visiting his sister, who lived in the same road as Ensink and his family. Ensink was chased around a car by Nandap before stumbling and falling to the ground. He was heard shouting for help while Nandap knifed him repeatedly.</p> <p>The attack only stopped when an off-duty special constable intervened. As she administered CPR, Nandap shouted: \u201cLeave him, he\u2019s dead.\u201d He tried to clean the knife before entering his sister\u2019s house.</p> <p>Described as an intelligent young man who did well at school, Nandap became mentally unwell while studying accountancy in Boston, US, in 2012, where he started to use cannabis heavily. Nandap told psychiatrists after the killing: \u201cThat morning a new voice came \u2026 it was a very scary male asking me to kill someone \u2026 telling me that I was the Messiah. I was told it was some form of sacrifice, it was part of my job.\u201d </p> <p>Ensink, originally from the city of Zwolle, lived and worked in countries including Pakistan, India, Tanzania and Malawi, driven by what he saw as a fundamental injustice that people lacked access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.</p> <p>At the time of his death he was working on a large study into improving water supplies in urban areas in Democratic Republic of the Congo. More than 400 people, travelling from more than 40 countries, attended a memorial service in London in February, which Ensink-Teich organised with meticulous attention to detail.</p> <p>Oliver Cumming, assistant professor at London School of Health and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), a close friend and professional colleague, said Ensink had a rare quality. \u201cThere are few people who manage to build up credibility and to be influential in so many parts of the world.

  "<p>The saga of the exploding Galaxy Note 7s has turned into a fully-fledged crisis for Samsung.</p> <p>First released in August, the phone initially <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/\">received rave reviews</a> for the extent to which it pushed the envelope on what a phablet-sized smartphone could do. It shipped with wireless charging, a battery that lasted well over a day and charged to 70% in less than an hour, and a USB-C connector \u2013 Samsung\u2019s first phone to use the next-generation port.</p> <p>Then it started exploding.</p> <p>Sporadic reports came in over early September suggesting that the phone\u2019s battery became unstable when fully charged, and could overheat and explode. Samsung issued a global replacement programme, but steered clear of using the language of a \u201crecall\u201d \u2013 until the US consumer product safety commission <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/\">stepped in</a> and told it that it couldn\u2019t bypass procedure.</p> <p>Once the recall was announced, Samsung also issued a software update to earlier versions, capping the charge at 60% and displaying a warning as the devices were powered on. For the most part, the problems were limited to North America and South Korea, the two markets where the majority of the devices had been sold, and it looked like Samsung could begin to fix the problem.</p> <p>Then, in early October, replacement Note 7s began to explode or catch fire as well. As of 10 October, eight have hit the press: five in the US, including one on a flight; one in Taiwan; and two in South Korea. Overnight, Samsung announced that it was \u201ctemporarily adjusting the Galaxy Note 7 production schedule\u201d. The announcement apparently buried the news twice over: not only was it released immediately after the US presidential debate, it appears that the \u201cadjustment\u201d is down to zero. Korean news agency Yonhap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/10/samsung-halts-production-galaxy-note-7-phone-battery-fires\">reported that production</a> was stopped entirely.</p> <p>The issue appears endemic to the Note 7, and could be a direct result of the same envelope-pushing that earned the phone praise at its launch. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-18/samsung-crisis-began-in-rush-to-capitalize-on-uninspiring-iphone\">According to Bloomberg</a>, Samsung expressly tried to rush a number of new features into the Note 7 all at once. The company had taken heed of rumours, proven correct, that the iPhone 7, released in September, would be an incremental update to the the earlier iPhone 6s, and wanted to capitalise on the \u201cboring\u201d release by dropping an exciting phone of its own a few days before.</p> <p>The Note 7 was certainly exciting. If Samsung is lucky, the damage to the brand will be limited to one phone. But there\u2019s a risk, as is so often the case, that the perception of a cover-up may prove to be worse than the issue.</p> <p>That perception began almost the same time reports of exploding phones began trickling. Samsung\u2019s decision to bypass official recall procedures was odd, and it <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/9/9/12866952/samsung-cpsc-galaxy-note-7\">took days</a> for the company to work with the authorities and issue a strongly worded statement \u201casking users to power down their Galaxy Note 7s and exchange them now\u201d.</p> <p>When the replacement phones began exploding, it again took the company almost a week to take action. Worse, some customers reported what looked like attempts to keep them quiet. A Kentucky man whose phone caught fire on 4 October told his local news station that he\u2019d felt like Samsung were helping him, until he received what he said was a misdirected text from a Samsung rep: \u201cJust now got this. I can try and slow him down if we think it will matter, or we just let him do what he keeps threatening to do and see if he does it.\u201d The company was so slow taking action that many US carriers decided to act unilaterally. Both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile stopped selling the phone, based on the reports.</p> <p>Worst of all, the crisis is threatening to engulf other areas of the Korean giant\u2019s business. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/09/29/samsung-washing-machines-are-also-exploding/\">A lawsuit in the US</a> alleges that washing machines sold in the US are also dodgy, prompting a CPSC intervention to \u201caddress safety issues\u201d. Worse, the suit claims another cover-up: that Samsung \u201cmoved aggressively to collect and destroy all evidence of the defective machines\u201d after they exploded.</p> <p>It may be unfair, but Samsung is no longer fighting to defend the Note 7. The company says it \u201cunderstands the concern our carriers and consumers must be feeling after recent reports have raised questions about our newly released replacement Note7 devices\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to reassure our customers that we take every report seriously and we appreciate their patience as we work diligently through this process.\u201d </p> <p>Its task now is to prevent the perception spreading that it\u2019s a company that cares more for PR wins than customer safety.</p>",
  "<p>In the early 1950s, when <a href=\"http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/\">photographer Chris Steele-Perkins</a> was growing up in Burnham-on-Sea, a seaside resort in Somerset, teddy boys were the only other outsiders. \u201cI was born in Burma \u2013 so, there weren\u2019t many people who looked like me. Teds were hanging on the street corners, posturing, standing out. Perhaps that\u2019s why I was drawn to them.\u201d</p> <p>Steele-Perkins travelled to Afghanistan, embedding himself with the Taliban four times, and spent time in Northern Ireland in the early 1980s, but his 1979 book <a href=\"http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/books/the-teds.html\">The Teds</a> became one of the most-referenced fashion anthologies in Britain. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e97d75b214951f1d9b702b3a1de52fdad027b8c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e97d75b214951f1d9b702b3a1de52fdad027b8c4/0_0_3543_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradford, England 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradford, England 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Chris Steele-Perkins/ Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These photographs are now being <a href=\"http://www.bjp-online.com/2016/08/chris-steele-perkins-teds-gets-new-release-for-first-time-in-40-years/\">exhibited in the UK for the first time in nearly 40 years in London</a> but their success stand as testament to the Britishness of this subculture. In these sharp monochrome images, you see dark regional pubs, street corners, faces and cigarettes \u2013 all signifiers of the teds\u2019 social life, their slang, and esoteric lifestyle.</p> <p>The teddy appeal was twofold. Aesthetically, it rejected the 1950s post-war blandness while also focusing on particular pieces previously unattainable to the wearers because of the class system. There was the drape jacket, with collar, cuff and pocket detail; slim, tapered trousers, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukka_boot\">chukka boots</a> or brogues; and a hairstyle defined by a heavily greased quiff at the front, and a \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck%27s_ass\">duck\u2019s arse</a>\u201d at the back. </p> <p>It was meticulous and elegant and, like the Teds themselves, had a certain glamour attached to it, \u201ceven if it was violent,\u201d says Steele-Perkins. \u201cThe whole mythology, the extravagant way they styled themselves, and lived their lives. People wanted to be part of it. And looking aesthetically, if it goes back to the dandyism inspired by that Edwardian style [hence ted] of dress, it was also about class.\u201d Or rather a rejection of it; the drape jacket became symbolic of a pan-class aspirationalism: \u201cDandys wore it, but the butcher boy wanted to, and could, wear it too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aa5c881f403efc0b5d80fd71bbeca2a05a2cedb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aa5c881f403efc0b5d80fd71bbeca2a05a2cedb/0_0_3355_5000/671.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Ransome in the Castle, Old Kent Road, London, England 1976.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barry Ransome in the Castle, Old Kent Road, London, England 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Chris Steele-Perkins/ Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steele-Perkins spent his childhood observing teds, and a large chunk of his early career documenting what would become the next generation of this subculture between 1975 and 1977. He doesn\u2019t know why this second-wave came along, but says the media were pivotal in their rise: \u201cBack in the 1950s, you would read this stuff in the newspaper and, well, my dad thought it sounded awful.\u201d In June 1955, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Dispatch\">Sunday Dispatch</a> headline ran \u201cWar on teddy boys: menace in the streets of Britain\u2019s cities is being cleaned up at last\u201d. \u201cBut the point is,\u201d says Steele-Perkins, \u201cthey were in the papers.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d51c6f98901643bc92b37a8156b57b7c5201637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d51c6f98901643bc92b37a8156b57b7c5201637/0_0_3543_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam and Eve pub, Hackney, London, England 1976\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam and Eve pub, Hackney, London, England 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Chris Steele-Perkins/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhibition comes 60 years after 1956, a watershed year for the teds.

Naturally, this gave them a weight that other youth tribes would not get, until the punks came along. Which is not to do a disservice to the mods or rockers, explains Steele-Perkins, but rather to show how important the teds were to British subcultures reacting to the environment, culture and politics provided by society. \u201cIn many ways, they came along because they were postwar teenagers, and teenagers were, I suppose, a postwar invention.\u201d As he adds: \u201cTeenagers often need some sort of community.\u201d</p> <p>Steele-Perkins was far from a ted himself \u2013 \u201cI had a beard and long hair at the time\u201d \u2013 but hung around long enough for them to start to talk to him, trust him and let them photograph them. The main issue was not the photography, rather it was capturing them with candour: \u201cThey were getting dressed up because they wanted to be seen. So the struggle was getting them to not pose, to get something more real.\u201d The trick, he says, was patience: \u201cIf you spent long enough, they got too tired to pose.\u201d <br></p> <p><em>A new edition of<a href=\"http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/books/the-teds.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.dewilewis.com/products/the-teds\">The Teds by Chris Steele-Perkins</a> is published by Dewi Lewis.

  "<p>A single day of fighting in June 1859, among the vineyards and villages near Lake Garda, left 40,000 Italian, French and Austrian soldiers dead or wounded. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino\">The Battle of Solferino</a> might have been remembered simply for its carnage, but for the presence of Henry Dunant. Dunant, a Swiss traveller, spent days tending the wounded and wrote a memoir that <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Museum-and-archives/Historical-factsheets/The-Battle-of-Solferino\">led to the founding of the Red Cross and to the first Geneva convention</a>, signed by Europe\u2019s great powers in 1864.</p> <p>Solferino inspired the principle that hospitals and army medical personnel are not a legitimate target in war. Today, with the bombing of hospitals by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\">Russians in Syria</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">Saudis in Yemen</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/msf-hospital-us-condemned-over-horrific-bombing-in-afghanistan\">Americans in Afghanistan</a>, those who provide medical aid in war believe that principle is in ruins.</p> <p>So far this year,<strong> </strong>according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), 21 of their supported medical facilities in Yemen and Syria have been attacked. Last year an MSF hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan was destroyed by a US attack, in which <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-releases-internal-review-kunduz-hospital-attack\">those fleeing the building were reportedly gunned down from the air</a>, and 42 patients and staff died.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12347.doc.htm\">A UN resolution in May</a> urged combatants to refrain from bombing medical facilities. MSF says that the resolution \u201chas made no difference on the ground\u201d. Four out of the five permanent members of the UN security council, it says, are actively involved in coalitions whose troops have attacked hospitals.</p> <p>To understand the renewed popularity of killing sick people in hospital beds, it\u2019s not enough to point \u2013 as MSF does \u2013 to the new techniques of war, such as drones and special forces. Something has been eroded about our perception of humanitarian principles.</p> <p>The Red Cross was, at its inception, both a global humanitarian movement and an alliance of national, military-aligned volunteer units. The two did not seem contradictory. As long as a nation\u2019s army\u2019s hospitals obeyed the Geneva strictures \u2013 separating themselves from defensive military positions \u2013 civilian medics could volunteer on the understanding they would not be deliberately harmed.</p> <p>That could not be further from the ideological framework under which modern wars are fought. Since the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, and with the fragmentation of numerous states along religious or ethnic lines, the essential story of modern conflict has become \u201cwe, the normal folk, against an inhuman, alien and irrational foe\u201d.</p> <p>Though this meme was there in the wars of the Solferino era, it was also tempered by the desire to establish international law, and by the existence of labour movements capable of issuing cross-border appeals for \u201cpeace between brothers\u201d \u2013 as both the French and Germans did during the Franco-Prussian war.</p> <p>Once you understand that the enemy soldier lying on the operating table is someone\u2019s son, and that your own son might be lying on the same kind of table across the lines, there is a logic to the principles of the Geneva conventions. But it is currently being trashed. If you want to point the finger, you could start with George W Bush. His administration\u2019s refusal to treat al-Qaida detainees in Afghanistan as combatants, and its institutional tolerance of torture, sexual violence and extra-judicial killing set a baseline for the crimes currently being perpetrated by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia and the Syrian regime.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org\">\u201ccollateral murder\u201d video</a>, among evidence alleged to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/chelsea-manning-six-years-prison-whistleblowing\">released by Chelsea Manning</a>, showed a US Apache helicopter obliterating an ambulance in Baghdad as it collected the wounded. This was done by sticking to the US military\u2019s rules of engagement, not breaking them.<br></p> <p>Since Iraq, state-sanctioned barbarity has of course been ruthlessly mirrored and bettered by the war criminals of Isis, for whom the Geneva conventions\u2019 prohibitions read like a to-do list.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something deeper at work, eroding in our attitudes to mercy. The men and women Dunant inspired had a horror of war born of their experience of it: the more total it became, the more interest the population had in moderating military behaviour.</p> <p>Modern media coverage sanitises war. Broadcasting rules in the UK, for example, place strict limits on showing death, mutilated bodies and the agony of wounded people \u2013 all the things that inspired Dunant to change the world.</p> <p>Our grandfathers\u2019 generation were surprised and shocked by the ways in which the Nazis broke the Geneva conventions. We have come to expect they will be broken in all wars.</p> <p>Though the US has apologised for the Kunduz attack, and disciplined 12 people in the military for the errors that caused it, initial coverage in the US media actually <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/the-radically-changing-story-of-the-u-s-airstrike-on-afghan-hospital-from-mistake-to-justification/ \">justified the attack on the hospital</a> because it was said to be treating al-Qaida fighters.</p> <p> Now, as the Russian airstrikes against hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria reach a crescendo, there is a campaign of justification centred around the accusation that the Syrian White Helmets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-nobel-peace-prize-give-it-to-syrias-white-helmets\">a medical relief group funded by both the US and EU</a> \u2013 is \u201cnot neutral\u201d. Regardless of the White Helmets\u2019 funding by western powers, the issue of its neutrality is secondary to the fact that it is a medical organisation. It runs ambulances rescue services \u2013 and both are entitled to protection under the Geneva conventions, just as a British military hospital would be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/oct/03/the-white-helmets-leader-we-can-anticipate-the-scale-of-destruction-based-on-the-sound-of-the-plane\">The White Helmets leader: \u2018We can anticipate the scale of destruction based on the sound of the plane\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The danger should be obvious.

Guernica showed a generation what the second world war would be like; Aleppo shows you what any future conventional conflict will descend to, if we don\u2019t act.<br></p> <p>Marine Buissonniere, MSF\u2019s senior co-ordinator, believes that, at the bare minimum, the UN secretary general needs to appoint a special representative mandated to investigate military attacks on hospitals.</p> <p>But we need more than words around the UN table. We need a movement from below, such as the one that created the Red Cross, and which built MSF in the 1970s.</p> <p>We need to understand \u2013 as the pioneering trauma medics of the 19th century understood \u2013 that if you tolerate inhumanity in war elsewhere, it can easily arrive on your own doorstep. </p>",
  "<p>The brazen attempt by Houthi rebels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/two-missiles-fired-us-navy-destroyer-from-rebel-held-yemen\">to sink a US warship patrolling off Yemen</a> marks a potentially significant escalation of a conflict that has been alternately fuelled and ignored by the western powers. The attack by the Houthis, whose main backer is Iran, coincides with an unprecedented ballistic missile strike 325 miles inside Saudi territory and suggests a spreading, region-wide conflagration could be nearer at hand than previously thought. </p> <p>Insurrection and revolt have been endemic in Yemen since the early part of this century.

This diffidence stems from Barack Obama\u2019s fear of the US being sucked into more Middle East wars. It is also the byproduct of his controversial attempt to mend fences with Iran through last year\u2019s landmark nuclear deal. </p> <p>The Syrian war has monopolised Washington\u2019s diplomatic energy to the disadvantage of Yemen and other regional conflicts, such as Israel-Palestine. The unintentional message to Tehran and the Houthis has been that Yemen is not a priority.

He said an expanded Heathrow would create up to 16,000 jobs in Scotland. </p> <p>\u201cIt would facilitate more airlines flying routes to Scottish airports, meaning more flights, more competition and choice for families and businesses across the nation. That also means more visitors to Scotland, more destinations for Scottish tourists and more opportunity for Scottish businesses to reach new export markets,\u201d Holland-Kaye said.</p> <p>Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, questioned the job creation figure, saying: \u201cEvery time there is discussion about airport expansion of any kind, it is accompanied by ridiculous jobs figures, but it is difficult to see how 16,000 new jobs could materialise with just a bit more direct traffic.\u201d</p> <p>Dixon said it was self-evident that any increase in flights would equally take people and money out of Scotland: \u201cIf it is easier to fly somewhere else then people will do their business elsewhere so that takes business out of Scotland too, and balances out any increase.\u201d</p> <p>He said his biggest concern was the impact on the environment. \u201cThe biggest disappointment is that the Scottish government talks a good game about climate change and here they are backing the expansion of one of our biggest airports, which will result in 70% more traffic and emissions. If we\u2019re concerned about climate change we can\u2019t possibly expand aviation even more.\u201d </p> <p>Throughout the Scottish National party\u2019s conference, which begins in Glasgow on Thursday, Heathrow will operate a \u201cprivate, airport-style lounge\u201d with a free bar to promote the benefits of the expansion to Scotland, as it did at last year\u2019s event in Aberdeen. </p> <p> There have been complaints that the SNP has priced non-corporate campaigners out of the event, with the cost of the cheapest, single stall for a charity this year rising to nearly \u00a33,000.

His asinine attempts to dismiss his piggish behavior by distracting viewers with talk of Bill Clinton and Isis were a failure.</p> <p>But the real losers in tonight\u2019s debate, and in this election, are the American people. When Donald Trump answers a serious question about his (lack of) healthcare proposals, he says simply, \u201cThe plans are going to be so good.\u201d When asked about his (lack of) morals, he says randomly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna knock the hell out of Isis.\u201d He won\u2019t answer questions.</p> <p>Part of that is a deliberate diversion strategy. To avoid talking about the video clip where he appears to condone sexual assault, he slams Bill Clinton or resorts to fear-mongering. But most of Trump\u2019s answers lack depth because he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. When Anderson Cooper pressed him on how he could possibly reconcile his policy on preconditions with a repeal of Obamacare, he had absolutely nothing to say. He just doesn\u2019t know.</p> <p>When it comes to the Syrian civil war and the millions of victims it\u2019s claimed, his policy also remains to be seen. This is a man who decides consequential policy positions on the stage because he hasn\u2019t thought of them ahead of time. When he threw Mike Pence under the bus on Syria, it appeared to be the first time he\u2019d even considered the question at hand.</p> <p>Sadly, his lack of depth means our country has lost a valuable opportunity to engage in a desperately needed public discussion about the differing viewpoints in America on consequential issues. America needs Hillary Clinton to face off with an opponent who will challenge her viewpoints, not a hollow-headed clown with zero depth.</p> <p>How can we fight climate change, raise incomes for the middle class, reform our ailing democracy, educate our children or champion world peace without serious and deep debate?

If found guilty, he would hang, and his defence rested heavily on the ideas of being \u201cinnocent by reason of insanity\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?div=t18400706-1877\" title=\"\">The Old Bailey records</a> of the trial are as full of intrigue and early Victorian melodrama as one could wish for, including the reading out of his notebooks, which exposed Uncle Ed\u2019s pseudo-military fantasy society, Young England.</p> <p>Reading through the statements and the endless legal ramblings, I find nuggets that allow me to unravel a sense of young Uncle Ed\u2019s wayward personality. I follow a repeating echo, as I realise the case for his defence depends on making sure that he is insane. The records swiftly become a sensational feast of detail, especially where Edward\u2019s father and grandfather are concerned. Both were known alcoholics. His grandad, John Oxford, described in one press report as a \u201cblack sailor of obscure origin\u201d, died in Greenwich Naval hospital.

This was a time when pressure was growing for the proper care for the mentally ill, with supporters committed to the genuine idea of asylum and a removal of those individuals from prisons and the workhouse.

But Hoodfar \u2013 well known for her work on culture and gender in the Middle East \u2013 saw a way to take back some of the freedom that had been seized from her. \u201cI decided, I\u2019m an anthropologist and I\u2019m here, so I can use this as a method of doing anthropological fieldwork,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fieldwork that I had chosen, it was not a project I wanted to write, but there I was.\u201d</p> <p>The research recast the 30 interrogations she was put through while imprisoned. As she sat facing a wall or a one-way mirror while her interrogators screamed and yelled at her, Hoodfar analysed their choice of words. When they hurled threats at her \u2013 \u201cThey were telling me, \u2018You\u2019ll get 15 years here and we\u2019ll send your dead body back to Canada\u2019\u201d \u2013 she contemplated the power dynamics at play. </p> <p>Interrogators intensified their efforts. A particularly tough moment came after they found a video of her husband\u2019s 2014 funeral on her iPad. \u201cThey actually played the music that was played at the funeral of my husband.\u201d It was a sign of the lengths they were willing to go in order to break her spirit, she said. </p> <p>Hoodfar\u2019s ordeal had begun months earlier, in March, when half a dozen or so members of Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guards raided the Tehran apartment where she was staying. She had been packing her suitcase to return to Canada when they confiscated her passports, computer and bags full of books and summoned her to a court date and what would be the first of many interrogations. </p> <p>She was charged, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/26/canadian-academic-jailed-in-iran-for-dabbling-in-feminism-security-family.html\">a state prosecutor later told media in Iran,</a> with \u201cdabbling in feminism and security matters\u201d. Released on bail, she was interrogated 12 times. In June, her bail increased fivefold. With little hope of making bail, she was sent to Evin prison. </p> <p>Hoodfar believes she was targeted as part of the power struggle at play between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/iran-elect-record-number-women-parliament-parvaneh-salahshori\">Iran\u2019s elected government, led by Hassan Rouhani,</a> and conservative factions in the country who retain control of the Revolutionary Guards, as well as police and the judiciary in the country. \u201cThere\u2019s almost two different states functioning at the same time,\u201d said Hoodfar. \u201cI was in many ways a pawn in this struggle.\u201d </p> <p>The conservatives were determined to show that Hoodfar had travelled to the country to meddle in the recently held election, pointing to a book she had co-authored on women in parliaments around the world. \u201cThey kept asking me if I was a feminist.

The two were placed together around the birthday of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s young daughter, said Hoodfar. \u201cShe was crying because she was obviously missing her daughter and was worried about her.\u201d </p> <p>The next morning, Hoodfar was moved again. Much of her time in prison was spent in the same bare cell, stripped of natural light. Artificial lights were left on day and night, said Hoodfar. Sleep came rarely. \u201cSometimes I would go for days without sleeping.\u201d </p> <p>After she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/canada-iran-professor-homa-hoodfar-hospitalized-detained\">was hospitalised for a lung infection</a>, prison staff showed some hints of humanity. At times they sent her fruit juice or brought her food. Eventually she was allowed access to a few books.</p> <p>One night following two days of gruelling interrogations, she was ordered to be ready at 8am the next day. Six guards escorted her to the apartment where she had been staying to collect her things and insisted she visit a salon to get her greying roots dyed before outfitting her in bright colours. \u201cThey wanted me to look good,\u201d said Hoodfar. </p> <p>It was then that she began to suspect that she was about to be released. After a 19-hour flight from Oman spent jotting down the notes she had memorised after painstakingly scratching them on to her cell walls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/iran-homa-hoodfar-returns-canada\">Hoodfar landed at Montreal\u2019s airport last week. </a></p> <p>She left behind several dual nationals from the US, UK, Canada and Britain who continue to face questioning or languish behind bars. On Friday, the UN <a href=\"http://freeassembly.net/news/iran-dual-nationals/\">repeated its call on Iran to free Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a> as well as two elderly dual nationals held at Evin who are in need of urgent medical attention.</p> <p>Their best hope for release, said Hoodfar, lies in the global campaigns and state-to-state relationships to pressure Iran.</p> <p>Her first days back in Canada were spent rejoicing in the mundane tasks of everyday life, from making a cup of tea in the morning to watering her plants. While much of the reality of her ordeal has yet to sink in, the experience has left her grappling with her identity as an Iranian-Canadian. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken. I know I\u2019m a Canadian as well and I lived most of my time outside, but I was born there and brought up there and I never felt I was an outsider,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they treated me like an enemy and that hurt more than the fact that I was in jail.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Towards the end of Sunday\u2019s second televised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential debate</a>, Hillary Clinton said something that political candidates often say, but which in 2016 is no longer the usual banality. \u201cThis is not an ordinary time,\u201d said Mrs Clinton. \u201cAnd this is not an ordinary election.\u201d If anything, this was an understatement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">The second debate</a> between her and Donald Trump, and the days running up to it, have been extraordinary living and livid proof of that.</p> <p>Rarely in any democratic country, never mind in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, can the substance and the temper of the debate have been so low, so dark, so personal and so damaging as it has now become in the US race. The responsibility for this cannot be dismissed as six of one and half a dozen of the other. The responsibility for it rests squarely with Mr Trump, his campaign and his personality. To take just one example: in most democracies, the tape that exploded into the public arena <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\" title=\"\">at the end of last week</a>, in which Mr Trump was heard boasting about his sexual aggression towards women, would have destroyed his candidacy. He would have been forced to quit, partly because of the offensiveness of his words and views, and partly so his party\u2019s other candidates can save their electoral skins.</p> <p>Yet not only did Mr Trump brazen the tape out at the weekend, but on Sunday night he deliberately went lower and darker still. Shortly before the debate, Mr Trump held a press conference championing women who claim to have been Bill Clinton\u2019s past sexual targets. This attempt to fan the stone-cold embers of arguments that distracted and demeaned America nearly 20 years ago was a clear signal. It showed that Mr Trump will fight as dirty as he can, all the way to November. It also suggested that his focus is on firing up the angriest and most paranoid parts of the Republican vote. This was confirmed once the debate was under way, when Mr Trump insulted, abused and patronised Mrs Clinton at every opportunity, both in his words and by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\" title=\"\">intimidatory platform manner</a> that his admirer Nigel Farage revealingly likened to the dominant behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-fights-donald-trumps-corner-in-post-debate-spin-room\" title=\"\">a silverback gorilla</a>.</p> <p>There have been other bitter presidential contests in the US. Yet this contest has become a break with the past that will not be easily repaired and for which America will pay a price at home and abroad, whatever the outcome next month. When before did one candidate say of another in debate that they have \u201ctremendous hate\u201d in their heart? Or refer to his opponent as the devil? And when before did one candidate say, as Mr Trump did, that, if elected, he would try to see his opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">prosecuted and put in jail</a>. That\u2019s what happens in autocracies and dictatorships. It\u2019s the way leaders behave in countries with no respect for the rule of law or the separation of powers. But it has not been the way, until now, in America.</p> <p>Mr Trump does all this partly because that is the kind of person he is: impulsive, rude, aggressive, extreme. He does it partly because there has always been something violent and vengeful about the white right in the US. And he does it partly because his rise has been one manifestation of a global anger against democracy\u2019s failures to control the rich and compensate the poor.</p> <p>But it is no accident that this is happening in the first US presidential race in which a woman may win. Of course, Mr Trump would behave aggressively if his Democratic opponent were a man too. He\u2019s that kind of bully. But his anger through the campaign, and in Sunday\u2019s debate, is the anger of a man who cannot treat women as equals. In another remark in the debate Mrs Clinton said her vision of America is of somewhere where everyone has a place.

For example, suppose the agent is a manager whose actions influence her own firm\u2019s share price, but not share prices of other firms. Does that mean that the manager\u2019s pay should depend only on her firm\u2019s share price?</p> <p>The answer is no. Since share prices reflect other factors in the economy \u2013 outside the manager\u2019s control \u2013 simply linking compensation to the firm\u2019s share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish her for bad luck. It is better to link the manager\u2019s pay to her firm\u2019s share price relative to those of other, similar firms (such as those in the same industry).</p> <p>A related result is that the harder it is to observe the manager\u2019s effort \u2013 perhaps due to many distorting factors blurring the relationship between her effort and the company\u2019s performance \u2013 the less the manager\u2019s pay should be based on performance. In industries with high risk, payment should thus be relatively more biased towards a fixed salary, while in more stable environments it should be more biased towards a performance measure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6fcbe4b03b4fd4fa5e8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:47:42.021Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Nobel prize winner shows failings of private prisons</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong>\u2019s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u2019s private prisons.</p> <p>He shows that the pressure to cut costs is too great, leading to unacceptable drops in quality. At the core is the issue of \u2018incomplete contracts\u2019 -- the fact that contracts aren\u2019t detailed enough to cover every nitty-gritty point.</p> <p>The Royal Swedish Academy say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another application of Hart\u2019s theory of incomplete contracts concerns the division between the private and public sectors. Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, be privately-owned or not? According to the theory, this depends on the nature of non-contractible investments. Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger. A 1997 article by Hart, together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, showed that incentives for cost reduction are typically too strong. The desirability of privatisation therefore depends on the trade-off between cost reduction and quality. In their article, Hart and his co-authors were particularly concerned about private prisons. Federal authorities in the United States are in fact ending the use of private prisons, partly because \u2013 according to a recently released U.S. Department of Justice report \u2013 conditions in privately-run prisons are worse than those in publicly-run prisons.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6e66e4b03258bcac636b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:34:07.404Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Official Announcement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The event in Stockholm has now wrapped up, so let\u2019s recap with the official announcement:</p> <h2>The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/press.html&amp;object=kva&amp;to=http://www.kva.se/en/\">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016 to<br></p> <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong><br>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m</strong><br>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p><em>\u201cfor their contributions to contract theory\u201d</em></p> <h2>The long and the short of contracts</h2> <p>Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts.

This year\u2019s laureates have developed <em>contract theory</em>, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m demonstrated how a <em>principal</em> (e.g., a company\u2019s shareholders) should design an optimal contract for an <em>agent</em> (the company\u2019s CEO), whose action is partly unobserved by the principal. Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s <em>informativeness principle</em> stated precisely how this contract should link the agent\u2019s pay to performance-relevant information. Using the basic principal-agent model, he showed how the optimal contract carefully weighs risks against incentives. In later work, Holmstr\u00f6m generalised these results to more realistic settings, namely: when employees are not only rewarded with pay, but also with potential promotion; when agents expend effort on many tasks, while principals observe only some dimensions of performance; and when individual members of a team can free-ride on the efforts of others.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, Oliver Hart made fundamental contri-butions to a new branch of contract theory that deals with the important case of <em>incomplete contracts</em>. Because it is impossible for a contract to specify every eventuality, this branch of the theory spells out optimal allocations of control rights: which party to the contract should be entitled to make decisions in which circumstances? Hart\u2019s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law. His research provides us with new theoretical tools for studying questions such as which kinds of companies should merge, the proper mix of debt and equity financing, and when institutions such as schools or prisons ought to be privately or publicly owned.</p> <p>Through their initial contributions, Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m launched contract theory as a fertile field of basic research. Over the last few decades, they have also explored many of its applications. Their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:34:17.838Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6da2e4b05c2f1e953eca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:30:33.828Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Contracts really, really matter, says one of our new Nobel laureates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785425730448523264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From interview today with Oliver Hart, 2016 Laureate in Economic Sci: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash\">#NobelPrize</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5W5TUM0hTZ\">pic.twitter.com/5W5TUM0hTZ</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785425730448523264\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6b2ce4b03258bcac635d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:20:26.974Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some practical examples of the issues which Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s work can help answer:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418644901728256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Contract theory: Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, or prisons, be publicly or privately owned? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash\">#NobelPrize</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418644901728256\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418698970525696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Contract theory: Should teachers, healthcare workers, and prison guards be paid fixed salaries or should their pay be performance-based?</p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418698970525696\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418772299612161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Contract theory: To what extent should managers be paid through bonus programmes or  stock options?  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash\">#NobelPrize</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418772299612161\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6a91e4b03258bcac635b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:17:57.800Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong> has revealed that he was lying in bed, wondering if his chance had gone, when the phone burst deliciously into life....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785419535755214848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI woke at about 4:40 and was wondering whether it was getting too late for it to be this year, but then fortunately the phone rang\u201d O.

  "<h2>Trump goes low while Clinton is subdued in debate </h2> <p>Donald Trump is waiting to learn this morning if he did enough in his debate performance last night to stabilize his floundering presidential campaign. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\">heated match-up</a> in St Louis that followed the release of a tape last week of him crudely bragging about groping women, the Republican nominee exceeded low expectations. The tone of the debate was bitter, with Trump at one point <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\">threatening </a>to \u201cjail\u201d Democratic rival Hillary Clinton while she accused him of trying to divert attention from the release of the lewd recordings.  Clinton accused the businessman of being in the pocket of Vladimir Putin, but looked rattled by the brutal onslaught over her record in office. Trump began the night by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">introducing three women</a> at a press conference who had accused the candidate\u2019s husband of rape or sexual assault in the 1990s, and one woman, raped as a child, whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended, as ordered by a judge, when she was a 27-year-old lawyer. They sat in the audience for the debate throughout the evening.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">Donald Trump threatens Hillary Clinton with jail in second presidential debate</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56nhb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2792540\"            data-video-name=\"Highlights from the second presidential debate: Trump fights dirty against Clinton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb22ade4b05c2f1e953d92\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010DebateSubs_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010DebateSubs.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010DebateSubs_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\">Highlights from the second presidential debate: Trump fights dirty against Clinton</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Our columnists react</h2> <p><strong>Richard Wolffe</strong>: \u201cThe nicest thing you could say about Trump\u2019s performance was that it was bonkers\u201d; <strong>Jessica Valenti</strong>: \u201cPeople will say that Trump won simply because he didn\u2019t spontaneously combust on stage\u201d; <strong>Kenneth Pennington</strong>: \u201cTrump is depriving Americans of robust national discourse\u201d; <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Christopher R Barron</strong>: \u2018Trump succeeded in recapturing the momentum.\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-fact-check-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">Here,</a> the candidates\u2019 claims are fact checked, while Adam Gabbatt meets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/trump-supporters-debate-clinton-critics-pennsylvania-bar\">pro-Trump voters</a> in Pennsylvania. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\">Trump or Clinton: who won the second presidential debate?</a></p> <h2>Facebook facing pornography test case</h2> <p>A legal case against Facebook, which will involve a 14-year-old taking the company to court in Belfast over naked images published on the social network, could open the floodgates for other civil claims, according to lawyers who work with victims of revenge pornography. The trial centers on a claim that Facebook is liable for the publication of a naked picture of the girl posted repeatedly on a \u201cshame page\u201d as an act of revenge.

Today, the US economy has seen the longest streak of job creation on record and the White House claims that the economic recovery is here. Yet many feel that financial insecurity remains high and job security low. We speak to five people about how they feel about the economy eight years after the start of the financial crisis. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/oct/08/great-recession-financial-crisis-recovery\">The Great Recession: the hollow recovery</a></p> <h2>Christians against climate change</h2> <p>John Abraham considers the growing movement among people of faith to bring more action to dealing with climate change.

The picture isn\u2019t pretty. We\u2019re spending 28 times as much on military security than climate security. A public sector investment of $55bn per year is required to meet the challenge, according to the study. As the IPS report points out, money lies untouched in the nation\u2019s bloated military budget and stopping the troubled F-35 fighter plane program would save enough to build wind farms to power 320,000 homes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/climate-change-defense-spending-fighter-plane-climate-change-defense-spending-fighter-plane-program\">We have money to fight climate change.

It leaked when it rained. This one is very good. We are now OK.\u201d</p> <p>The Bukenyas, who have no children, are among more than 150,000 Ugandans aged over 65 receiving cash grants from the government\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://socialprotection.go.ug/stephen-kasaija/\">expanding social protection programme (ESP)</a>. After a pilot deployment in 15 districts, the programme is being extended to include 40 districts over five years. </p> <p>When the project launched in 2010, many people were sceptical; the \u00a35.60 monthly grant per household was seen as too little. However, evidence suggests the small amounts are having a big impact. If stands up on a larger scale, the ESP could go a long way to answering questions about how to address extreme poverty and vulnerability, especially in rural Uganda.</p> <p>The challenge is enormous. According to official figures, barely <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Feature%20Story/Africa/Uganda/ug-economic-update-fact-sheet.pdf\">one in 10 Ugandans is covered by a formal pension</a>. The rest rely on their extended family in old age, but deaths from diseases are threatening this support system and leaving many older people with grandchildren to fend for.</p> <p>For decades, the case for cash handouts to mitigate vulnerability among older people was a difficult one to make as governments moved to cut spending by rolling back the remnants of the welfare state inherited at independence. </p> <p>But as extreme household poverty became a blemish on the record of a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/uganda/overview\">government that boasted of 7% annual growth rates</a>, the opposition took it up as a campaign issue, prompting President Yoweri Museveni to act.</p> <p>According to Stephen Kasaija, director of the ESP, the money is intended to help older people who are too vulnerable to benefit from existing programmes. Even if education is free, for example, a child will be unable to attend school if his family cannot provide clothing or the books he needs, he said.</p> <p>Kasaija said the pilot phase had demonstrated that social protection grants can reduce vulnerability. \u201cPeople who used to have one meal a day say they can have three meals a day \u2026 the quality of the food has improved, as they buy more nutritious foods.\u201d</p> <p>Bukenya\u2019s experience bears this out. He said that when the money started arriving, he bought food so he could eat at least two meals a day. Then he bought a shirt and trousers \u201cbecause I had hardly anything to wear\u201d.</p> <p>Some recipients have used the small amounts to invest, either by starting micro-businesses or by forming saving groups that enable members to access money for building, buying chickens, goats or cows, and opening up farm land.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/09/healthcare-innovations-wont-cure-global-health-inequality-political-action-will-world-health-summit-berlin\">Healthcare innovations won\u2019t cure global health inequality \u2013 political action will | Ben Ramalingam</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe experience on the ground is that, for those who have more income, 25,000 shillings means nothing. But for these people who have very little, 25,000 means a lot,\u201d Kasaija said.</p> <p>However, Fred Muhumuza, a Ugandan economist, said this positive appraisal tells us more about the extent of poverty than the value of the cash transfers.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you are giving it to very poor people, anything is welcome \u2026 and they will talk positively about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you compare [this] to where you would want them to be, they are still not there; you want that if that person falls sick, they should be able to go to a clinic and get treatment, be able to buy a shirt or other clothes, and live with dignity in old age.\u201d</p> <p>Uganda\u2019s experience is consistent with findings in other African countries that have rolled out pensions and other cash transfers. According to a 2013 World Bank report, <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/395991468007775257/Reducing-poverty-and-investing-in-people-the-new-role-of-safety-nets-in-Africa-experiences-from-22-countries\">Reducing Poverty and Investing in People: The New Role of Safety Nets in Africa</a>, in countries such as Swaziland, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Ghana, vulnerability grants targeting specific groups led to improved nutrition and use of social services such as education and health, as well as greater household productivity.</p> <p>\u201cIn Kenya and Malawi, cash transfers led to increased investment in agricultural assets, including crop implements and livestock,\u201d said the report. \u201cMoreover, both programmes fostered increased food consumption and improved dietary diversity, with greater share of household consumption acquired from own-farm production.\u201d<br></p> <p>As more evidence emerges that cash grants can make an impact, it is still not known how sustainable they are. South Africa, where everyone over 60 and below a certain income/asset threshold gets an old-age pension under a system inherited from the apartheid era is an exception. In most sub-Saharan African countries \u2013 such as Uganda \u2013 cash transfers have been entirely or in part funded by donors, prompting the question: what happens if the donors pull out?</p> <p>The World Bank estimates that social protection grants could cost as little as 2% or 3% of GDP of countries like Uganda. But some ask whether African governments are committed to social protection. Muhumuza points out the Ugandan government is already struggling to pay teachers and medical workers.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the donors pull out, [ESP] will be a shaky thing and will probably have to wind up, or it will begin to default. I don\u2019t see the government of Uganda [consistently] finding that much money,\u201d Muhumuza said.</p> <p>Pius Bigirimana, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, said in a recent interview that the government was committed to social protection as a broad empowerment strategy. He said senior citizens\u2019 grants had been budgeted for in the current financial year and would remain in the budget for years to come. </p>",

Here\u2019s what happened:</p> <ul> <li><strong>It was a nasty affair </strong>without perhaps being quite so sordid or raw as might have been expected, given Donald Trump\u2019s signal beforehand that he would attack Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husband\u2019s sins.</li> <li><strong>Challenged to defend his recently uncovered hot mic remarks </strong>about grabbing women, Trump said they amounted to \u201clocker room\u201d talk he was embarrassed by \u2013 but he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been \u201cso abusive to women.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Clinton did not respond to Trump\u2019s catalog </strong>of her husband\u2019s sins, apart to say it was inaccurate. \u201cWhen they go low, you go high,\u201d she said.</li> <li><strong>Clinton placed Trump\u2019s hot mic remarks in context</strong> with others \u2013 she listed his attack on the Khan family, his \u201cbirther\u201d attack on Obama, his attack on a disabled reporter and his attack on a federal judge of Mexican descent \u2013 to paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump \u201cowes the country an apology.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton</strong>. He repeatedly called her a liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career, loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members, and told her if he were president, \u201cyou\u2019d be in jail.\u201d He pointed at her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62\">said</a>, \u201cshe has tremendous hate in her heart.\u201d</li> <li><strong>\u201cI know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight,\u201d</strong> Clinton told Trump. \u201cAnything to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are leaving it.\u201d</li> <li><strong>More than one snap analyst \u2013 FWIW </strong>\u2013 thought Trump had \u201cshored up his base\u201d of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, Benghazi and other issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal.</li> <li><strong>Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence </strong>the election, and not on her behalf. </li> <li><strong>Trump said he disagreed with running mate</strong> Mike Pence\u2019s assertion that the United States should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after.<br></li> <li><strong>Trump also said there\u2019s no Muslim ban plan anymore:</strong> \u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.\u201d</li> <li><strong>A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. </strong>He said that Capt.

Several weeks after the invasion, Trump told the Washington Post: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/25/hollywood-partyers-soldiering-on/06327347-83d3-44c4-ab7b-dcd6fbda5437/?resType=accessibility\">The war\u2019s a mess</a>.\u201d In August 2004, he told <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">Esquire</a>: \u201cTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201d </p> <p>Even in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/a-guide-to-donald-trump-early-flip-flops-on-the-iraq-war?utm_term=.vq5VjeKwe#.uy2eDvV5v\">the interview</a> cited by the Trump campaign to explain his \u201copposition\u201d, Trump expressed impatience with Bush for not invading sooner. \u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Trump: Hillary Clinton wants to increase refugees by 550%</strong></p> <p>Trump is correct that Clinton has proposed a 550% increase in refugees, from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017.</p> <p>But this does not add up to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d, as he says. He appears to have borrowed this figure from an ally, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who <a href=\"http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/clinton-refugee-plan-could-bring-in-620-000-refugees-in-first-term-at-lifetime-cost-of-over-400-billion\">invented it. </a>Session falsely claims Clinton would continue to grant asylum to 55,000 Syrian refugees every year in addition to 100,000 refugees from the Middle East in general. Clinton has called for allowing 55,000 refugees from Syria for one year, and has not proposed yearly asylum for 155,000 Middle East refugees for her term.</p> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201c<strong>People are coming into our country, like, we have no idea who they are, where they\u2019re from, what their feelings about our country are \u2026 We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love of our country\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is false. The US has likely the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

His campaign cited <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html\">data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> (NLEOMF), which does show <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">a 56% increase</a> in officers killed by guns between 1 January and 16 July 2016 (28) compared with the same span in 2015 (18). But according to the nonprofit group, officer deaths overall, including from traffic accidents and job-related illnesses, are roughly on par with figures from this point in 2015: 60 deaths this year to 61 the year before.</p> <p>The nonprofit\u2019s data also shows that police fatalities overall <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">have declined</a> in the last 15 years: the last seven years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency saw an average of 135 police deaths, a 17% decline on the final seven years of George W Bush\u2019s administration, which saw an average of 162 a year. Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition. In the years between its enactment and repeal, from 1920 to 1933, an average of 250 officers were killed each year. Gun-related deaths were <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/research-bulletins/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">highest in 1973</a>, according to the NLEOMF figures, when 156 officers were killed.</p> <p>The FBI also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted\">reports</a> police deaths with information submitted to it from various law enforcement agencies, though its most recent figures date to 2014. According to such data, that year 96 law enforcement officers were killed, 51 by \u201cfelonious acts\u201d and 45 in accidents, and 48,315 officers were assaulted while on duty. Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 in accidental deaths died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet. The last four years of Bush\u2019s presidency and the first four of Obama\u2019s saw <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2014/tables/table_29_leos_fk_type_of_weapon_2005-2014.xls\">about the same number of gun-related police deaths</a>, according to this data, with about 46 a year.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI did not say that \u2026 it\u2019s locker room talk.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump did say that he would \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d, and was recorded saying so in 2005 in a video published by the Washington Post on Friday. </p> <p>Pressed by moderator Anderson Cooper, he did admit to having made the comment, though he then said he had never actually acted in the way.

The debate is to last 90 minutes with no commercial interruptions.</p> <p>The first question, the moderators have said, was to be about Trump\u2019s remarks caught by a hot mic that being a star meant he could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women for example \u201cgrab them by the pussy.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign called Trump\u2019s appearance with the Bill Clinton accusers a \u201cstunt\u201d in a statement that concluded, \u201cas always, she\u2019s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s own disparaging comments about one of the women he appeared with, Paula Jones, and other women linked to Bill Clinton have resurfaced this evening, as have reports about hostile working environments for women in Trump companies and on his reality show.</p> <p>Here\u2019s video of Trump\u2019s appearance with Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/regated/status/785264884267290625\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald Trump&#39;s Pre <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Debate?src=hash\">#Debate</a> Press Conference with Rape and Sexual Assault Victims of Bill Clinton. <a href=\"https://t.co/JPrYX88uoD\">https://t.co/JPrYX88uoD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/eFW5xuWAeU\">pic.twitter.com/eFW5xuWAeU</a></p>&mdash; REGATED (@regated) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/regated/status/785264884267290625\">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Thanks again for reading and please join us in the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:52:00.859Z\">at 1.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fae36ae4b03258bcac6119\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:41:47.447Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bill Clinton accusers are Trump's guests in debate hall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/785277458065006593\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump campaign has confirmed all four women, Paula Jones, Broaddrick, Wiley and Kathy Shelton will be guests of Trump in the hall tonight</p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/785277458065006593\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fae284e4b03258bcac6114\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:39:49.240Z\">1.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The \u201cBill Clinton raped\u201d strategy </strong>and its exponents have been competing for oxygen in the Trump campaign for months.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not.</strong></a></p> <p>To be clear, I\u2019ve always found Broaddrick\u2019s claims about Bill Clinton credible, though only the two of them know the truth. Five people say she told them about the assault right after it allegedly happened. She denied the rape in a 1997 affidavit filed with Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers but changed her story the next year, when she was interviewed by the FBI in the course of Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation. At the time, some Clinton defenders treated her changing story as evidence of her untrustworthiness, but it seems perfectly plausible that, as she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public but also felt she couldn\u2019t lie to federal investigators. In the 1990s, Clinton defenders sometimes pointed to the fact that Broaddrick attended a Clinton fundraiser three weeks after she says he raped her. But we know it\u2019s not uncommon for rape victims to blame themselves and continue to seek their rapists\u2019 favor. After all, I also believe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html\">Jill Harth</a>, who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape, even though later, reeling from a divorce, she became his girlfriend.</p> <p>Far less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence. </p> <p><strong>Click through above to read the full piece.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/trumps-lawsuits-include-20-involving-allegations-mistreating-women-president-republican/91832012/\"><strong>Trump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits</strong></a></p> <p>One woman sued Donald Trump\u2019s Miami resort saying she lost her job because she got pregnant.</p> <p>Two others claimed they were fired after complaining that co-workers sexually harassed them.</p> <p>And a number of women testified in a lawsuit that Trump himself repeatedly instructed managers to hire younger, prettier workers at his Los Angeles golf club.</p> <p>The release of a video Friday showing Trump\u2019s sexist remarks in 2005 has created a firestorm of controversy that threatens to derail his campaign.

  "<p>There is a football awakening in the Republic of Ireland and it has little to do with the national team and even less with the Football Association of Ireland. Instead the flagbearers are Dundalk FC and their manager, Stephen Kenny, who has led the team to unprecedented success by cultivating flair and technique, shattering stereotypes and redefining Irish players\u2019 potential. Now he is being acclaimed as an ideal future manager of a country whose football has not fully broken free of the mould imposed by Jack Charlton in the 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cThe next few weeks will determine whether this is the most successful season in the history of Irish football or we actually win nothing,\u201d Kenny tells the Guardian in advance of an intensive period during which Dundalk could win a third league title in a row, retain the FAI Cup and become the first Irish club to qualify from the Europa League\u2019s group stage, having already become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/29/dundalk-maccabi-tel-aviv-internazionale-europa-league\" title=\"\">the first to win a match</a> in it or even a point.</p> <p>It is an extraordinary turnaround for a club that finished bottom of the league and was on the brink of extinction before new owners arrived and hired Kenny four years ago. But it is not merely results that have led to the praise for Kenny, it is the style with which they have been achieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/13/dundalk-champions-league-qualifying-irish-champions-football\">Dundalk\u2019s part-timers ready to make Champions League history | Alan Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the same night that Feyenoord beat Manchester United last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/europa-league-roundup-dundalk-alkmaar\" title=\"\">Dundalk drew at AZ Alkmaar</a> with 10 men and the Dutch team\u2019s manager, John van den Brom, admitted that Dundalk \u201cwere better than us with their short combinations\u201d. The former Leeds United and Republic of Ireland midfielder Johnny Giles said last week that Kenny \u201chas tapped into the true traditions of Irish football\u201d by encouraging skill and wit rather than just brawn and guts.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to this view that being Irish it\u2019s in our DNA to play the direct physical route,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to have the mindset that because we\u2019re from this part of the world we\u2019re less skilful so we have to rely on physical attributes and determination and that\u2019s it. That mindset has existed for a long time. It certainly hasn\u2019t served our clubs well. There has to be another way. I do think we have very skilful players in Ireland and it\u2019s about trying to get them to absolutely believe in themselves.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has their own view but a lot of people who love the game want to come and watch teams play with flair, real composure and encouragement of individual skill, having players really express themselves. That excites people to see and if you\u2019re a skilful player, that\u2019s the environment you want to flourish in. You\u2019re excited about the fact that you\u2019re coming into train with, and play for, a team that has those values and helps you fulfil your potential.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s more important than winning to me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019re not adverse to winning, but I do feel that the way the team plays is hugely important to us. We want skill to overcome any other thing.\u201d</p> <p>It has suddenly become relevant for fans and media to compare and contrast every Republic of Ireland performance with those of Kenny\u2019s Dundalk. But Kenny is too smart and respectful to add his own voice to the suggestions that the national team would be better off in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cMartin O\u2019Neill is an inspirational Irish manager,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s an iconic figure, somebody who\u2019s won two European Cups as a player and then gone back and managed at the lowest level with Wycombe, then went on and had great success with Celtic and Leicester and brought Aston Villa to a top-six finish. He\u2019s got great pedigree and has just signed a new contract and is going to be there for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cMe, I\u2019m still learning. Every day I hope to get better. I\u2019m really hungry to do well, very focused on what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not saying: \u2018I\u2019m in the running to be an international manager\u2019 because that\u2019s a dangerous way to think. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having ambition but you have to go and make sure you do your task to hand extremely well. We have a very experienced international manager who has achieved a huge amount. For me, I have a lot to achieve myself and a lot to look forward to.\u201d</p> <p>His achievements so far suggest that he does indeed have a lot look forward to. The man who turns 45 later this month already has nearly two decades of mostly successful management under his belt, having become the youngest manager in League of Ireland history when he took charge of Longford Town at the age of 27.</p> <p>He took Longford to new heights before winning the league with Bohemians and reviving the fortunes of Derry City, whom he saved from relegation and took on a memorable Uefa Cup run that ended with a narrow defeat by Paris Saint-Germain. Those achievements attracted the interest of Dunfermline Athletic, who were then adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premier League table. Kenny led them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/27/match.celtic\" title=\"\">the 2007 Scottish Cup final</a> \u2013 beating Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian before losing 1-0 to Celtic \u2013 but he could not rescue them from relegation, nor prevent a slow start to the following season. He was sacked after a year.</p> <p>\u201cI was only 35 when I walked out alongside Gordon Strachan to 55,000 people at Hampden Park,\u201d Kenny recalls. \u201c[Managing in Scotland] was a great experience but it was nine years ago. I\u2019m a different person now. You learn from experiences, good and bad. I know my own mind now. I\u2019m very certain about what I want, the type of people and players I want to work with.\u201d</p> <p>He began demonstrating how much he had learned at Dunfermline when he returned to Derry City, who were beset by financial trouble and demoted to the second tier. Kenny won promotion by forming a skilful winning team with a tiny budget. Seven of the youngsters he signed went on to become senior internationals, including Niall McGinn and James McClean.</p> <p>His thesis for the Uefa Pro Licence, which he was awarded in 2011, was on \u201cbuilding a club from nothing\u201d. Dundalk\u2019s owners knew what they were doing when they turned to him in their hour of greatest need four years ago.</p> <p>Wins this season over teams such as Bate Borisov and Maccabi Tel Aviv have brought unprecedented attention to a domestic league that is often overlooked even by Irish football fans. \u201cWe\u2019re competing against the English Premier League and also Gaelic games and rugby, all of which have a high profile here,\u201d says Kenny.</p> <p>\u201cGoing for a double double would not in itself capture the wider public in the way you\u2019d hope but the European experience elevates it. Now everyone is rooting for us, even from different sporting codes. People keep saying, \u2018we\u2019re enjoying watching you play\u2019 and we get letters and emails from schoolboy coaches all over Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>While others trumpet his suitability for even grander roles, Kenny is concentrating on a task that has become more difficult due to an infernal run-in. The down side to Dundalk\u2019s success this season is a fixture pileup that is stretching the resources of a squad that features several players who combine football with day jobs.</p> <p>On Saturday they suffered their heaviest home league defeat of Kenny\u2019s reign, 3-0 to Sligo Rovers. That leaves them one point above Cork City at the top of the table with six league games to go \u2013 and they host Cork on Tuesday. That crunch match is the first of nine games in 27 days, including a Europa League double-header against Zenit St Petersburg. The run concludes with the FAI Cup final (also against Cork) three days after their assignment in Russia. Their last two Europa League group games are in what would normally be the off-season for Irish clubs.</p> <p>\u201cObviously this is a challenging time for us and we have to maximise every resting opportunity between games but it\u2019s been a brilliant experience so far,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cAnd we hope to get out of the group and extend our season into February.\u201d</p> <p>Kenny disagrees with suggestions that there is another potential down side to his team\u2019s European run: that the money the club has earned from it \u2013 in excess of \u00a36m so far, more than six times Dundalk\u2019s annual budget \u2013 will distort competition in the League of Ireland and enable them to dominate for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy to say but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate,\u201d says Kenny, whose team must stage their home European games in Dublin because their ground, Oriel Park, is ramshackle. \u201cOur facilities are poor, to say the least, so I would imagine the vast majority [of the money] is earmarked for facilities,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cAlso, several other teams are improving.

  "<p>After 25 years in salubrious California, Bonani and Prahlad Kakkar returned to Kolkata in the 1990s. \u201cThe Calcutta [they refuse to call it by the new name, Kolkata] we grew up in was a compact, organic city,\u201d says Bonani, a former public health specialist. \u201cOffices and homes were within walking distance and we had 625 parks in this city.\u201d</p> <p>They found the city of their childhood had changed dramatically.

Rovaniemi lies on the shores of the river Kemijoki, which is a popular destination for summer and winter swimmers alike, as well as a much loved ice-covered venue for winter sports and leisure. The riverside and its events in autumn, however, don\u2019t get much attention.<br></p> <p>Throughout autumn \u2013 starting with the <a href=\"http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/experience-rovaniemi/events/old-market-square-carnival-of-rovaniemi-old-market-square\">Rovaniemi Old Time Fair</a> (<em>Rovaniemen Wanhat Markkina</em><em>t</em>) on J\u00e4tk\u00e4npuisto strand in August \u2013 cultural events and harvest markets take place on the riverside.  In the beginning of November the Arctic fall is crowned by an annual bonfire art event, Riverlights (<em>Jokivalkeat</em>).</p> <p>If there are no special seasonal events on, I recommend opting for a calming river walk to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavvu\">laavu</a>, an open hut, and enjoy hot cocoa and snacks. The laavus are open and free for all the visitors and are found around riverbanks and forests.</p> <h2>Moment in history</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b20cd5bcf815f2fa7fb5ab795cf9b1a7851decfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b20cd5bcf815f2fa7fb5ab795cf9b1a7851decfc/126_126_4733_4644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Destruction in the centre of Rovaniemi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"981\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Destruction in the centre of Rovaniemi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vilho Uomala/SA-kuva</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most influential single event in the history of Rovaniemi is the <a href=\"http://barentsobserver.com/en/content/70-years-after-war-finland-looks-back\">near-total destruction</a> of the town in the second world war. The Moscow Armistice (September 1944) between the Soviet Union and Finland ended the four-year alliance between Nazi Germany and Finland, once united by their mutual enemy in war. As a result, German troops withdrew from Finnish Lapland and its capital Rovaniemi using a scorched earth policy. There\u2019s still debate on what happened next, but 90% of the buildings were destroyed, including homes and farms. Even the town\u2019s ski jump ramp was reduced to rubble and ashes.<br></p> <p>The blaze demolished everything familiar to the locals and today\u2019s rebuilt Rovaniemi is naturally something very different. Understandably some locals tend to criticise the modern blocks of flats of the centre, yearning for something \u201cold and authentic\u201d. On the other hand, Rovaniemi wouldn\u2019t be the same, original town of its own kind if it had not been forced to reinvent itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people choose to cycle to work, school and nightclubs all year around, whether it is 30C above or below zero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Best Instagram account</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/wmRIs2iYbW/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Antti Kertsi Ker\u00e4nen (@cvltfvck)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2014-12-14T18:54:49+00:00&quot;&gt;Dec 14, 2014 at 10:54am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Antti Ker\u00e4nen is a 22-year-old nature photographer whose eerie and gloomy Instagram feed tells otherworldly stories from the midst of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga\">taiga</a>.

  "<p>Most of you are aware of a growing movement amongst persons of faith to bring more action on dealing with climate change. The argument is powerful for the faithful \u2013 the Earth is God\u2019s gift to humanity. We should care for it accordingly.</p> <p>From within this movement, there are huge voices, widely respected by both the scientific and faith communities. Perhaps the best known is <a href=\"http://katharinehayhoe.com/\">Dr. Katherine Hayhoe</a>, a top climate scientist who is also an evangelist Christian. There are other persons and organizations who work similarly to connect these two world viewpoints in a powerful yet common-sense way.</p> <p>Recently a <a href=\"http://caringforcreationbook.com/\">book</a> has been published by a faith-science duo. That duo is Paul Douglas, respected meteorologist, entrepreneur, Republican, and Christian, and his writing partner Mitch Hescox who leads the Evangelical Environmental Network (the largest evangelical group devoted to creation care). Their book, entitled Caring for Creation, provides a masterful balance of science, faith, and personal journey. </p> <p>The style of the book is one I have not seen before. It is a side-by-side presentation of first science, then faith, then science, and back to faith. Interspersed within the main text are enlightening anecdotes mainly from weather forecasters across the country which show an informed lived experience of experts watching the climate change before their very eyes. Importantly the authors provide a list of concrete things that we all can do, starting right now to make a meaningful impact in reducing global warming.</p> <p>Within this book there is real science. Not just about what is happening now, but the history of climate science, how we\u2019ve known since the 1800s that human emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide can warm the atmosphere. We also hear from Douglas about observed changes to the weather we all experience. This isn\u2019t a problem for far-off times or far-away places. This is an issue that is being manifested now.</p> <p>Hescox articulates a message grounded in the proposition that the creation is a gift from God and there is a real responsibility to care for it. Not only for others distant in time and space that may suffer, but for our own good. In fact, he argues persuasively that caring for this creation can help strengthen one\u2019s faith. </p> <p>Hescox also argues from a pro-life position. Caring for creation is the ultimate pro-life stance. Squandering resources and gifts will not only cause real harm to people and our economy, but it will endanger the lives of many of the most vulnerable.</p> <p>Douglas provided a great summary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I am a scientist but I believe in absolutes \u2013 I believe in more than I can observe, measure and test. The book of Genesis tells us that God made us in his self image. He gave us big, beautiful brains and the ability to think, reason, solve problems, make smart decisions, and improve our lives. He also gave us the good sense not to foul our nest</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Both of these intertwined stories of faith and science are woven together in a way that is easily accessible for non-scientists and people who are not of faith. We don\u2019t need to be climate scientists or religious experts to get a lot out of the authors\u2019 perspective. <br></p> <p>There are a few quotes from the book that do a great job of encapsulating the central themes which I will share. <br></p> <p>With respect to the science, Douglas reminds us that \u201cno matter where you look \u2013 the oceans or atmosphere \u2013 the Earth is warming.\u201d He later adds, this means we \u201cembrace the reality of today and see the world, not as we think it should be, but as it really is \u2013 the world we\u2019ve influenced by releasing a trillion tons of carbon in the geological blink of an eye.\u201d</p> <p>Hescox states that, \u201cIt is almost incredulous that we meet God in creation but we haven\u2019t made the connection that caring for creation nurtures our relationship with him.\u201d </p> <p>He later includes this excellent statement from Jonathan Koomey from Stanford. \u201cWhat is conservative after all but one who conserves, one who is committed to protecting and holding close the things by which we live.\u201d <br></p> <p>And perhaps the best statement, which so clearly encapsulates this book and the movement, is provided in the text by Dr. Hayhoe. She states, \u201cChristian values demand we take action. Climate change disproportionally affects the poor and vulnerable \u2013 the very people that Christians are called to care for and love.\u201d</p> <p>I would only add this addendum. Climate change affects us all, wealthy or impoverished, Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern, young or old, peach or olive or brown skinned. Taking actions can be motivated just by pure selfishness, wanting to maintain a high standard of living, or by selflessness, or by faith. It doesn\u2019t matter what the motivation is but with groups such as scientists and evangelists working together, the possibility is limitless.</p>",

Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition.

Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet.

The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

It would increase tax revenue by $1.1tn over a decade, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">the Tax Policy Center estimated</a>, though much of that money would go into spending plans. The Committee for a Responsible Budget <a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">estimated</a> that Clinton\u2019s plan would add about $200bn to the debt, saying it would raise tax revenue by $191bn but decrease GDP by 1% \u201cover the long term due to slightly higher marginal tax rates on capital and labor\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. Another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018[The US is] just about the highest taxed country in the word\u2019</strong></h2> <p>For months, Trump falsely claimed that the US is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world; he later adjusted to a more specific and more correct claim, about corporate tax rates. The US corporate income tax rate does rank among the highest among industrialised nations, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\">according to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)</a>.

Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and Republican, led the effort in Congress and passed the CHIP healthcare program in a budget bill after the first lady\u2019s efforts to lead a broader healthcare reform bill failed.

We bump down a track in his van, through a gate and there it is \u2013 a one-room shed with an open lean-to and a vegetable patch, in an otherwise empty paddock. It\u2019s locked up now that he\u2019s moved out, but peering through the window you can see that the floor is concrete and the walls corrugated tin. There\u2019s a shower, he tells me, but only a composting toilet. It\u2019s hard to imagine why anyone might have chosen to live and work here, alone; even harder to reconcile such a spartan environment with the colour-saturated, joyously communicative and strikingly impressionistic pop music Perry makes as DD Dumbo.</p> <p>The singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist\u2019s solo debut album, Utopia Defeated, is not only luminous and uplifting, it also teems with bizarre life. But the screaming molluscs, UFOs on horses and frogs \u201cin a lonesome public sauna\u201d featured in his lyrics are Technicolor camouflage for a range of ecological, existential and moral concerns. However vividly surreal his imagery, it\u2019s obvious that Perry has serious issues on his mind: namely, animal rights and what he sees as our disregard both for them and the Earth\u2019s future. In Cortisol, he questions the wisdom of space exploration, while Oyster weighs up \u201cthe miracle of life\u201d against human greed, and the track Walrus takes direct issue with foie gras production.

He\u2019s earnest and slightly shy, but speaks with affable directness. \u201cIt\u2019s more a reaction to my confusion about lots of different things over the last eight years or so, learning about the way animals are treated. I read Peter Singer\u2019s book Animal Liberation when I was 20 and it was a bit of an eye-opener. It made me become a vegan pretty much overnight, but it was also a door that opened on to more philosophical questions about rationality and ethics in general \u2013 and that inevitably forces you to think about society as a whole. So the album is an accumulation of existential confusion and a lot of questions about the way we treat each other and other organisms.\u201d</p> <p>If Perry\u2019s veganism isn\u2019t that radical, nor his planned move into a new home where solar power will run his studio gear, then in other ways he certainly bucks expectations of a buzz artist. There can\u2019t be many late-twentysomethings with a cultishly acclaimed EP under their belt (2013\u2019s Tropical Oceans) who\u2019d quit a bustling metropolis to move back to their small home town, but Perry did, returning to Castlemaine after six years in Melbourne. \u201cI think it took me a while to realise that cities weren\u2019t for me,\u201d he says, jokily adding that his lack of interest in bright lights and wild nights might be \u201csome unintended result of low testosterone brought on by eating too many soy products\u201d. But then, he rarely drinks, either: \u201cIt just seems not that meaningful a lot of the time, and personally I don\u2019t gain much pleasure from the experience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9125fe85e0fd7389cc20fc467af325c2411d0123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9125fe85e0fd7389cc20fc467af325c2411d0123/0_251_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DD DUMBO.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DD DUMBO.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, his vice is occasional immersion in baths of iced water. \u201cSometimes I do that because it has all these health benefits, like reducing inflammation and increasing your body\u2019s ability to burn energy and deal with cold stress.\u201d Surely turning on the heating would deal with cold stress, or does that waste too much energy? \u201cNo, I\u2019m not that much of a puritan,\u201d Perry smiles. \u201cSome people suggest that, like other animals, our bodies benefit from mild stresses \u2013 exercise is the most obvious example \u2013 and this is the same logic. If the body is in too comfortable an environment, we become less resilient.\u201d</p> <p>Resilience and self-sufficiency are the drivers of Utopia Defeated, helping Perry to \u201creach the unattainable perfection in my head\u201d. But he never banked on a career in music. He played in a number of bands from his teens onward, including an angsty, post-punk outfit called Smurfinger and novelty band Pommes Frites, and had been working on a few songs of his own without any solo project in mind. But after those bands folded, Perry launched DD Dumbo, which he admits felt like \u201cmore of a true and less contrived attempt at expressing my actual self \u2013 whatever that is\u201d.</p> <p>Musically, he\u2019s powered by an obsession with Captain Beefheart, the discovery of Mongolian and African styles (Mali\u2019s Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and Tanzanian Hukwe Zawose made a lasting impression) and a deliberate attempt to make his instruments sound as unfamiliar as possible through the use of pitch-shifting and subtle digital manipulation. The results suggest a giddy union of Paul Simon, Yeasayer and Arthur Russell. But there\u2019s something else. While Utopia Denied might not shrink from realism \u2013 the lyrics are full of blood and guts \u2013 what it describes is a fabulous, seductively elusive otherworld. Perry agrees that his is music of escape: \u201cSometimes I do verge on that feeling of transcendence when I\u2019m playing, and I guess I\u2019m consciously trying to build some kind of an environment that allows that sensation and creates something otherworldly. I definitely see a lot of colours and textures when I\u2019m playing. I get the feeling I might have synaesthesia, to a degree.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9c21844fa342fb465b1919812dc208890137b39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9c21844fa342fb465b1919812dc208890137b39/0_324_3832_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DD Dumbo performs at the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire, London, in Oct 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DD Dumbo performs at the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire, London, in Oct 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paschal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He catches himself. \u201cThis is starting to sound a bit new age, but music seems like a good way to express the inexpressible, in a kind of therapeutic way.\u201d Perry says. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve suffered any terrible trauma, but there\u2019s an element of escapism or of reaching some ideal that I maybe have more than others.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this ideal that makes most contemporary pop unappealing to Perry.

  "<p>Last November, housing staff at one housing association were confronted with a tenant claiming to have a bomb in his bag; in another incident, an officer from another housing provider claimed to have been held hostage by a man who believed there was an alien outside his home. </p> <p> In both incidents, the tenants involved had mental health issues. Housing providers are concerned that growing numbers of tenants with mental health issues are ending up in general needs housing, where they do not receive the help provided in specialist supported housing. A recent survey by Inside Housing reveals a 14% fall in spending by councils on people with mental health issues in supported housing since 2011\u201312, based on 250 English councils that responded to Freedom of Information requests,</p> <p>Between 2011 and 2017 there will have been a drop of nearly \u00a37.3m in spend on people with mental health in supported housing by the 47 councils in England that responded fully to the survey. In 2011\u201312, those councils\u2019 combined budget, including both commissioned services and those they pay for directly, was \u00a350.9m; this year\u2019s budget is \u00a343.6m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/20/government-rethink-housing-policy-supported-housing\">The government needs to urgently rethink its supported housing policy | Dawn Foster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This squeeze on council spending has put pressure on other housing providers, including housing associations. \u201cWe have noticed councils are seeking to reduce the amount of specialist accommodation they procure for adults with mental illness,\u201d says Alex Reeve, regional director of London supported housing at housing association Family Mosaic. </p> <p> Supported housing has been operating within a constricted funding environment for years. Supporting People funding \u2013 a national programme for housing related support made available to councils in England \u2013 dropped from \u00a31.8bn when it started in 2003 to \u00a31.6bn in 2014\u201315. That equates to a 38% fall in real terms. </p> <p>Ministers have given supported housing a one-year exemption from the 1% rent reduction announced in last year\u2019s summer budget, while in September the government said it would transfer top-up money to councils for the service to counter its planned housing benefit cap. </p> <p>But supported housing providers say the threat of funding cuts has already affected business. Among the 250 councils that responded at least in part to Inside Housing\u2019s FOI requests, there is a wide range of provision for tenants with mental health conditions: some have specialist units, some do not; a handful have floating support for their general needs stock, most do not; others have budgets for specific conditions \u2013 such as hoarding \u2013 while others have no housing budget at all allocated to people with mental health needs</p> <p>Chris Hampson, chief executive of Look Ahead, which provides care, support and housing services across London and the south-east, says councils are cutting back on supporting those with less serious mental health issues to concentrate on those with more acute needs. \u201cA lot of the preventative services have been cut back,\u201d says Hampson, who believes further cuts are to come.</p> <p>This, he says, is short-sighted: \u201cIf you take money out of the lower-end preventative services, in the long run more money is spent because people end up back on the streets or in hospital.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-matters/2016/sep/21/social-supported-housing-benefits-cap-survival\">Social housing for those with extra needs is still under threat, say providers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Colwill, media manager at mental health charity Sane, says the FOI results show the budgetary crisis across the board for mental health provision, which is of deep concern for the charity. \u201cMental health has always been a \u2018Cinderella service\u2019,\u201d he explains, and cuts to services are a false economy: if what initially appears to be a tenancy problem is not addressed early, it can develop into a much more complex issue and they can find themselves supporting a customer experiencing mental health issues. \u201cCare in the community only works if there is provision for people in the community,\u201d he says. \u201cHousing is a really big issue for us. Losing a home or being in fear of losing your home can be a trigger to push someone into crisis.\u201d</p> <p>While most councils have cut spending on mental health in supported accommodation, the FOI responses reveal some exceptions. In 2016\u201317 Ealing spent \u00a31.6m on mental health in supported housing, up from \u00a31.2m in 2011\u201312. \u201cWe recognise the benefits of supported living in enabling people to live as independently as possible in the borough while getting appropriate care from professionals,\u201d a spokesperson for Ealing says. \u201cWe also find that supporting people to live in the local area near to family and friends can have a positive impact on their well-being.\u201d</p> <p>In Yorkshire, Wakefield council is another bucking the trend, with its supported housing mental health budget growing 15% in the past five years. It is also developing an innovative strategy to address the issue. Wakefield and District Housing has partnered with NHS Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group to employ mental health support workers to work with tenants. The council, which still manages the local housing register, can give applicants with mental health needs extra priority. Jon Feasey, a service manager for vulnerable adults at Wakefield Council, says the council sees tackling mental health as an important frontline service. \u201cIt has a preventative outcome that can create real efficiencies by preventing homelessness.\u201d</p> <p>Feasey believes the right place for people with mental health needs is in the community but that people need support in their homes \u2013 including those with less acute mental health needs who can slip through the net. As well as preventing homelessness, the support can also help reduce unplanned hospital admissions, he says. </p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/passing-the-buck/7016866.article\">an article originally published by Inside Housing </a> (\u00a3). </em></p> <p><em>World Mental Health Day on 10 October focuses this year on psychological first aid and providing support to those in distress</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\">Sign up</a> for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.

  "<p>Global demand for energy per capita will peak in 2030 thanks to new technology and stricter government policies, the <a href=\"http://www.worldenergy.org/\">World Energy Council</a> has predicted.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.worldenergy.org/news-and-media/press-releases/world-energy-scenarios-2016-report-global-energy-demand-growth-set-to-fall/\">a report on a range of scenarios for global energy use</a>, the group of academics, energy companies and public sector bodies outlined a \u201cfundamentally new world for the energy industry\u201d calling it the \u201cgrand transition\u201d.</p> <p>The report, launched before the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, forecast demand per person for energy \u2013 including transport fuels, heating and electricity \u2013 would begin to fall after 2030.</p> <p>Ged Davis, executive chair of scenarios at the World Energy Council, said: \u201cHistorically people have talked about peak oil but now disruptive trends are leading energy experts to consider the implications of peak demand.\u201d</p> <p>But while overall per capita energy demand would begin to fall, demand for electricity would double by 2060, the council said, requiring greater infrastructure investment in smart systems that promote energy efficiency.</p> <p>The \u201cphenomenal\u201d growth of solar and wind energy is predicted to continue, while coal and oil will fade from the energy mix. Solar and wind accounted for 4% of power generation in 2014 but could supply up to 39% by 2060, while hydroelectric power and nuclear are also expected to grow.</p> <p>But fossil fuels will remain the number one source of energy, having fallen just 5% since 1970 from 86% of energy supply to 81% in 2014.</p> <p>The council drew up three scenarios to assess different areas of energy use. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/World-Energy-Scenarios-2016_Executive-Summary.pdf\">range of outcomes</a> could see fossil fuels provide anything from 50% to 70% of energy by 2060, said the council, which is the UN-accredited global energy body.</p> <p>Under two of the scenarios, oil production will peak in 2030 at between 94m barrels per day (bpd) and 103 mb/d, although the third scenario would see it peak and plateau at 104 m/bpd for a decade from 2040.</p> <p>The council said moving from petrol cars to cheaper technologies such as electric vehicles would prove \u201cone of the hardest obstacles to overcome\u201d in efforts to decarbonise global energy use.</p> <p>Oil powered 92% of vehicles in 2014, but that is expected to fall to between 78% and 60% as electric vehicles become more popular.</p> <p>But the council warned that keeping global warming below 2Cwould require an \u201cexceptional and enduring effort, far beyond already pledged commitments and with very high carbon prices\u201d.</p> <p>Its predictions for carbon emissions vary wildly depending on the strength of efforts to tackle the problem, from a reduction of 61% by 2060 to a slight increase of 5%.</p> <p>Overall, the report\u2019s theme of a grand transition envisages lower population growth, radical new technologies, greater environmental challenges and a shift in economic and geopolitical power.</p> <p>The report was produced in partnership with consultancy Accenture Strategy and the Paul Scherrer Institute, a research centre in Switzerland.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/01/worlds-energy-systems-at-risk-from-global-warming-say-leading-firms\">Last year\u2019s report</a> warned of a threat to global energy networks caused by extreme weather events associated with global warming.</p>",

  "<p>Facebook\u2019s UK business generated an \u00a311.3m tax credit last year, despite the world\u2019s largest social network making a global profit of $6.19bn (\u00a34.97bn), according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06331310/filing-history/MzE1OTA5MTk5OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0\">the latest company accounts</a>.</p> <p>The credit at Facebook UK Ltd can be offset against future tax bills and is likely to raise further questions about whether the $370bn US company is paying its fair share towards Britain\u2019s public finances.</p> <p>Last week, the prime minister, Theresa May, told the Conservative party conference: \u201cIf you\u2019re ... an international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra \u2026 I\u2019m putting you on warning. This can\u2019t go on any more.\u201d</p> <p>Until April, all Facebook\u2019s UK advertising sales were routed through its operations in Dublin, reducing the UK tax bill. Activities at Facebook UK, meanwhile, were confined to selling \u201csales support, marketing services and engineering support\u201d to other companies within the Facebook group.</p> <p>But in that month, Facebook\u2019s UK sales activity was transferred from Dublin to London, following the then chancellor George Osborne\u2019s introduction of a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/18/osborne-targets-multinationals-and-tax-evaders-in-budget-crackdown\">punitive rate of tax</a> for multinationals deemed to be artificially shifting British sales overseas.</p> <p>Ahead of the change, turnover at Facebook UK Ltd doubled in 2015 to \u00a3210m, but this did not include a penny of the hundreds of millions of pounds in sales income that the wider group is estimated to have received from British advertisers.</p> <p>Losses for Facebook UK increased from \u00a328.5m to \u00a352.5m in 2015. As a result, the accounts showed that Facebook UK ended the year with a tax credit of \u00a311.3m, compared with a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/facebook-paid-4327-corporation-tax-despite-35-million-staff-bonuses\">tax bill of \u00a34,327</a> in 2014.</p> <p>The company reported a \u00a34.2m tax charge for 2015, as well as \u00a315.5m of deferred tax credits, linked to staff share awards. Last year, Facebook UK paid employees \u00a371m in share awards.</p> <p>The accounts show that Facebook UK expanded dramatically last year, doubling staff and turnover, in advance of the group <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/facebook-pay-millions-more-uk-tax-reports\">abandoning its controversial tax structure</a> for British advertising sales.</p> <p>The number of people working for the business grew from 362 to 682 in 2015, including the addition of 200 staff within its software engineering team. Since then, a spokesman for the company said headcount has grown further, with more than 1,000 people employed by Facebook in the UK.</p> <p>Staff have been taken on in part to help Facebook UK sell advertising directly to major clients, who had previously dealt with Facebook Ireland.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35724308\">memo to UK staff</a> in March, Facebook said: \u201cOn Monday, we will start notifying large UK customers that from the start of April, they will receive invoices from Facebook UK and not Facebook Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of changes to tax law in the UK, we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebook\u2019s operations in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cThe new structure is easier to understand and clearly recognises the value our UK organisation adds to our sales, through our highly skilled and growing UK sales team.\u201d</p> <p>As Facebook UK has taken greater control of sales to British customers, it has hired new staff, many of whom are expected to move into its new offices at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/11/facebook-move-uk-headquarters-london\">One Rathbone Square</a> in central London, when construction is finished next year.</p> <p>These changes mean that Facebook UK\u2019s next set of accounts are likely to show a more dramatic jump in revenues. There is also expected to be an impact on how much UK tax is paid, although a number of factors, including the \u00a311.3m tax credit, could mean that it is some time before Facebook\u2019s UK tax bill rises substantially.</p> <p>In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cWe are proud that in 2015 we have continued to grow our business in the UK and created over 300 new high-skilled jobs ...

  "<p>Today\u2019s publishers are no longer just producers of newspapers and magazines. Faced with dwindling circulation and subscriptions and combined with insufficient revenues from online advertising, many publishers have added other strings to their bows \u2013 from membership clubs to global events \u2013 in order to survive. <br></p> <p>One area many are investing in is e-commerce. Several years in the making, Cond\u00e9 Nast has just launched <a href=\"https://www.style.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Style.com</a>, an e-commerce business that\u2019s arguably one of its most significant ventures. Glossy-looking and featuring high-end designer products such as a Chloe zip-front leather jumpsuit and a Paul Smith bomber jacket, Cond\u00e9 Nast has reportedly pumped \u00a375m into the e-tail business and hired fashion heavyweight such as former Browns buying director Yasmin Sewell as fashion director and Galeries Lafayette former head of internet and e-commerce Franck Zayan as president. </p> <p>Fashion fans can shop across the site while those browsing Cond\u00e9 Nast properties such as Vogue.co.uk and GQ.co.uk will be directed to products they\u2019ve just read about. </p> <p>\u201cStyle.com brings added value by connecting the content with the product offer and providing other suggestions of products and brands when they read pieces on Vogue.co.uk or GQ.co.uk,\u201d says Zayan. He views it as an \u201cincredible\u201d new stream of revenue.</p> <p>Unlike many retailers, Cond\u00e9 Nast isn\u2019t holding any stock though \u2013 the fulfilment is handled by the individual brands \u2013 but they do, of course, take a cut of the transaction. </p> <h2>Launching in a competitive luxury market </h2> <p>But in a world where consumers might look for inspiration across magazines then buy via established retailers such as Net-a-Porter and Selfridges, how easy is it going to be to break into this already competitive market? \u201cAs we are going to target the same customers but in a space that is expanding, I\u2019m convinced that we will find our place more easily than any new player could,\u201d says Zayan. \u201cCond\u00e9 Nast already has a massive audience, so our customers are already readers of one or more of our on- and offline publications. They go there for inspiration before they purchase products. What we are doing is bringing all of that together in what I think is a really amazing offer.\u201d </p> <p>Admittedly, the launch of Style.com didn\u2019t get off to the best of starts. A Sunday Times Style magazine article reported that the launch of the Style.com had been delayed and highlighted the lack of top designers on the site. Zayan bats away this criticism. \u201cThe reality is that we are adding brands every single day, so if you come back tomorrow you\u2019ll see even more of both established and upcoming brands. All of that is a process that is built in a long-term perspective and vision.\u201d At the time of writing, the site stocked 170 brands but Cond\u00e9 Nast said it had signed up 350 brands which will drop in the coming weeks. </p> <p>Style.com isn\u2019t the first foray into ecommerce for a publisher, though many don\u2019t pump so much investment into it as Cond\u00e9 Nast has. Many publishers operate third-party stores on their sites and take a cut. Others have a different strategy. Take women\u2019s title Marie Claire, which has partnered with Ocado to launch <a href=\"https://fabled.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabled by Marie Claire</a>, a physical store located in central London and an e-tail offer selling over 12,000 beauty and wellness products from brands such as Chanel, Clinique and Yves Saint Laurent. </p> <h2>Giving readers what they want</h2> <p>Justine Southall, managing director fashion &amp; beauty at Marie Claire\u2019s parent company Time Inc UK, says the magazine and Fabled operate separately, with the store having a dedicated editor and team creating bespoke content. However, Southall says they do collaborate. \u201cThe uniqueness of this business model is that the access to content, shared opportunities, market knowledge and intelligence, is much more seamless, and yes the two teams do work closely together.\u201d For instance, if a product written about in the magazine is available in Fabled by Marie Claire then they may tag it as such.<br></p> <p>With these etail ventures, publishers must balance the need for building profits whilst also retaining the trust of their valued readers. For instance, will readers be more than a little skeptical when they discover that a product that\u2019s been raved about in a magazine is one they\u2019re also pushing through its e-commerce site?</p> <p>Zayan admits they need to be careful. \u201cWe will lose the advantage that we have, which is the influence and authority of those brands and we do not want to do that, it would be shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will always maintain a mix of retailers because it is important for variety and choice and of course our integrity,\u201d says Southall. <br></p> <p>Not all publishers\u2019 etail ventures have worked out as planned. In 2014, publisher Mondadori Group launched <a href=\"http://www.graziashop.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graziashop.com</a> as a marketplace with more than 20,000 designers. However, just over a year after launch several senior members including managing director Richard Hatfied exited the business. In July, the site switched from being a marketplace \u201cto a more sustainable affiliate model\u201d, according to Zeno Pellizzari, general manager of Mondadori International Business. They also licensed the brand to a third party. Pellizzari notes that they\u2019ve learnt some lessons along the way. \u201c[The fashion e-tail market] is highly competitive and requires significant investments to be able to scale.\u201d<br></p> <p>So why are publishers throwing serious bucks at e-tail? It comes at a time when newspapers and magazines are grappling to sustain themselves while simultaneously, the publishing business model is changing. \u201cThe rise of digital, mobile and social media have had two consequences,\u201d says Douglas McCabe, an analyst with Enders. \u201cOn the one hand they have disrupted the funnel as a whole, diluting the role of magazines; and on the other hand they have created opportunities for many organisations \u2013 including magazines \u2013 to occupy many different parts of the shopping funnel, from discovery through to transaction.\u201d He also points to the way retailers try to inspire customers through their magazines \u2013 take Net-a-Porter with Porter magazine.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo everyone is converging in the middle,\u201d says McCabe. \u201cInevitably, all companies underrate the complexity of each other\u2019s business models. Retail is a complex, low-margin business which publishers will find it challenging to thrive in.\u201d </p> <p>So will Style.com survive? Keely Stocker, editor of fashion trade magazine Drapers, says the launch of the store has been \u201cslightly underwhelming\u201d. She adds: \u201cIt launched with less brands than expected although there are still some good names on there.\u201d </p> <p>McCabe says the result looks high-end, well-curated and cleanly designed. \u201cBut competition from e-commerce specialists will remain brutally focused and the digital publishing and e-commerce landscape changes at an extraordinary pace, so the publisher should expect a tough marketplace for the foreseeable future.\u201d </p> <p>For Cond\u00e9 Nast, it\u2019s an investment that they\u2019ll hope will be in vogue for a very long time. </p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cBrought to you by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>As Romesh Ranganathan shows me into his mother\u2019s home, I make small talk by asking him if he lives nearby. \u201cJust 10 minutes,\u201d he replies. His mother, Shanthi, whips around. \u201cFifteen minutes,\u201d she says, accusingly. \u201cFifteen minutes ... by car.\u201d</p> <p>We are in Crawley, West Sussex, to discuss the new series of his BBC3 show, Asian Provocateur. Yet somehow, sitting on Shanthi\u2019s burgundy leather sofa, surrounded by small, white statues of Hindu deities, we keep coming back to how her son never visits her.</p> <p>\u201cI miss him,\u201d Shanthi says, mournfully. But haven\u2019t they just spent six weeks filming together? Two months, Romesh confirms, exasperated. \u201cShe told me she hadn\u2019t seen my kids for ages. It was three days.\u201d</p> <p>He slips into his mother\u2019s Sri Lankan accent: \u201cThey have grown up so much since I last saw them. This is my life. Next thing you know they will be at university. My life.\u201d</p> <p>Their squabbling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/oct/21/asian-provocateur-romesh-ranganathan-travel-tv-sri-lanka\">was at the heart of the first BBC series</a>, which followed the 38-year-old comedian as he tried \u2013 at his mother\u2019s instruction \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/30/asian-provocateur-romesh-ranganathan-in-sri-lanka\">to learn about his family and heritage in Sri Lanka</a> (or, as she put it: \u201cStop being a coconut\u201d). Shanthi stole every scene she was in, so it\u2019s no surprise to hear that, for the second series, the pair will cross the United States together in search of more relatives, and more laughs.</p> <p>Today, the post-office worker, with her hennaed hair and warm smile, is as funny and outspoken as she is on screen. Romesh, meanwhile, is more relaxed than the sardonic, grumpy front he presents on panel shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/11/what-we-learned-from-the-weekend-tv-hignfy-works-best-when-theres-news\">such as Have I Got News for You</a> and Jack Dee\u2019s HelpDesk.

So, he was surprised when \u201cafter the series came out, people would say: \u2018Oh, Jewish mothers are just like that,\u2019 or \u2018African mothers are like that,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s just like my mother.\u2019\u201d His reflex of regressing to a grumpy teenager under his mother\u2019s disappointed stare is pretty universal, too \u2013 even if he does have a wife and three children of his own.</p> <p>\u201cI have a friend who, when he talks to his mum, has a Maltese accent.

But Asian Provocateur has propelled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/15/romesh-ranganathan-funniest-thing\">bearded, bespectacled, former maths teacher to the mainstream</a>. Since it aired, he has fronted science show It\u2019s Not Rocket Science, been a team member on Play to the Whistle, done a Royal Variety Performance and signed a book deal. His third standup tour, Irrational, has been extended to 133 dates (many sold out) across the UK.</p> <p>Both Asian Provacateur and his standup mine a rich seam of second-generation angst. He says he was surprised it has taken so long for stories such as his to be explored. \u201cIf you are second generation, [you] can relate.

Growing up, the family would make a visit to his parents\u2019 friends every few weeks. This involved Romesh and his brother, Dinesh, sitting with the other kids (\u201cwho all spoke Tamil \u2013 so we would get that in the neck\u201d), while in another room: \u201cDad would get drunk. Mum would get embarrassed and then Dad would get a plastic bin and start ...\u201d He breaks off, picks up a box and bangs out a dhol beat. Then suddenly, he starts wailing: \u201cDhum-dhumma, dhum-dhumma dar-dar-dar.\u201d</p> <p>As Shanthi cries with laughter, Romesh continues. \u201cOne night, Mum and Dad invited all the Sri Lankans to our house.

There are also lavish complaints about his mother\u2019s sudden popularity, and jokes about his children (he calls his middle child \u201cferal\u201d and a \u201clittle arsehole\u201d). Doesn\u2019t Shanthi mind when he makes fun of her \u2013 or, worse, her beloved grandchildren?</p> <p>For once, she is placid. \u201cIf his children have a sense of humour, they will take it as a joke,\u201d she says. Then, with impeccable timing, she adds: \u201cI mean \u2013 instead of attacking somebody [else], why not use the family?\u201d</p> <p>Romesh grins. \u201cIt\u2019s an unexpected angle,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As a child, it was his father \u2013 a \u201cparty guy\u201d \u2013 that Romesh felt closer to. The pair would bond over comedy shows. \u201cOne day, I brought home Eddie Murphy\u2019s Raw, and Dad and I would watch that together.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just a sense of humour they shared. \u201cHe was incapable of keeping in touch with anybody, and could be accidentally inconsiderate. I think I have that lack of organisation. I don\u2019t call people for weeks. Mum and Dinesh want to see you a lot, but they will do anything for you. I expect very little and deliver very little.\u201d</p> <p>An accountant who moved to the UK to study, Ranga was an indulgent father, says Shanthi, someone who would give his two sons anything they asked for. \u201cThey just had to click their fingers and it would be here.\u201d</p> <p>Both were sent to private school (where Romesh was mocked for living in Crawley rather than the posher Reigate). But Ranga, says Romesh, was also a \u201cbit of a Del boy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven though he was in a well-paid job, he would think: \u2018If I just do this, we could be millionaires.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But there were disastrous consequences. When Romesh was 12, his father walked out of his accountancy job after a disagreement, and then struggled to find another position. The bills mounted up and he couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage. The family home was repossessed, Dinesh and Romesh had to leave their school, and the couple\u2019s marriage cracked under the pressure. Shanthi and her sons moved into a council-funded bed and breakfast, and she separated from her husband. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone,\u201d says Shanthi. \u201cI would cry to Romesh all the time, but how could he help me? I used to pray so hard \u2013 please get us out of this.

To protect my husband, I stayed at home, kept myself away. It was a mistake. I should have gone out and faced people.\u201d</p> <p>While he and his father \u201cdrifted apart\u201d, it was Shanthi, says Romesh, who held things together. \u201cShe dragged us through those years pretty much singlehandedly,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was fiercely independent.\u201d Having never worked before, she took jobs wherever she could \u2013 first, a cleaning job, and later, working in a shop. \u201cMy boys were everything to me,\u201d she explains. \u201cI thought: \u2018I will come out of this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Being given a council house proved a turning point, Shanthi says. \u201cThat house is like a temple for me. I started working, I got on better with Ranga.\u201d</p> <p>She continues: \u201cI don\u2019t know what power God had given me. Twice, I had lost my handbag and people brought it to my home.

I have to accept it, and enjoy the time we have been given to be together \u2013 with the boys.\u201d</p> <p>For Romesh, the loss of his father was compounded by his own money troubles. He and his brother struggled to settle his father\u2019s affairs at what should have been the start of his full-time comedy career. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get enough gigs in, we were trying to get [the probate] sorted.

A year later, Romesh was winning awards and doing stints on Mock the Week and Radio 4. Appearing on Live at the Apollo was bittersweet, because he wasn\u2019t able to share it with his father. He also can\u2019t help but wonder what it would have been like to have both parents on Asian Provocateur. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/17/romesh-ranganathan-grumpy-funny-edinburgh-festival-2014-review\">Is his prolific work rate \u2013 from his year-long tour</a> to onscreen ubiquity \u2013 fuelled by this bumpy start?</p> <p>\u201cI am not playing at it,\u201d he agrees.

I feel very lucky but ... next year I could be teaching again. I always think these things are temporary. Teaching is so solid and reliable, comedy is not.\u201d</p> <p>His mother, however, has no such insecurities about her new-found fame. \u201cSome people put their hood up and act coy,\u201d Romesh says. \u201cMum will deliberately pay by card, so they can see her surname \u2013 even if it\u2019s for a sandwich \u2013 so she can say: \u2018Yes, it\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One day, he says, \u201cwe were walking through Soho and someone in a van shouted to Mum: \u2018You need your own show, you are brilliant.\u2019\u201d He starts mimicking her reply: \u201cThank you dah-ling!\u201d</p> <p>Shanthi chips in. \u201cYou were pissed off.

She continued to work Saturdays without telling me.\u201d</p> <p>Shanthi laughs: \u201cBecause darling, I have expensive taste.

At the end, he took a few questions on marriage equality and the plebiscite. Labor is due to decide their final position on the plebiscite bill tomorrow morning.<br></p> <p>Birmingham threw out a bone \u2013 suggesting the Coalition could consider defunding the yes and no cases. Funding was one of the issues insisted on by the right wing of the Coalition party room.</p> <p>Speers asked, personally, would you be happy to see a plebiscite that doesn\u2019t fund the yes and no camps?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>I think that is a reasonable point of debate</strong>. I think we have worked very hard to keep the cost of the plebiscite as low as possible to make sure there are safeguards around any government-funded advertising that occurs so we can ensure it is respectful. Ultimately, if that is something the Labor party want to take out in return for support for a plebiscite, well they should say so and put it on the table. </p> </blockquote> <p> Q: It\u2019s a reasonable request, is what you are saying ...<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It would be a reasonable request and one we could consider ourselves.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Somewhere, <strong>Eric Abetz</strong> is exploding. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T06:14:03.761Z\">at 7.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fb2656e4b03258bcac622a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T05:35:31.914Z\">6.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are struggling with the <strong>Brandis-Gleeson</strong> matter, here are a few excerpts from Senate QT: <br></p> <p><strong>Labor to Brandis:</strong> I refer to the explanatory statement on the legal services amendment solicitor general opinions direction 2016, tabled by the attorney general, which states, \u2018The attorney-general has consulted the solicitor general.\u2019 The solicitor general has said, \u2018I wasn\u2019t consulted about the direction.\u2019 Is the solicitor general correct? <br></p> <p>Brandis in part:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> <strong>I consulted the solicitor general about the matter at a meeting in my office on 30 November 2015.</strong> I invited the solicitor general to put his ideas in writing, which he did, and I considered those as well.

I\u2019m thinking <strong>plebiscite</strong>. I\u2019m thinking <strong>banking behaviour</strong>. I\u2019m thinking <strong>tax threshold legislation</strong>.<br></p> <p>First up, <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> has told the ABC that she will support the respect for emergency services volunteers bill. This is the so-called CFA bill, which became an issue in the federal election because of a stoush between the Victorian professional firefighters and the volunteers over an enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA). The bill gives emergency service volunteers more power in any EBAs. The government needs nine votes and with four One Nation senators coming across the line, with three <strong>Nick Xenophons, Derryn Hinch </strong>and<strong> Bob Day, </strong>the Coalition appears to be in the clear. </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/09/labor-poised-to-kill-off-marriage-equality-plebiscite-when-parliament-resumes\">Katharine Murphy reported late yesterday</a>, after um-ing and ah-ing and foot shuffling while still pointing out their vehement opposition, Labor is finally going to decide what to do about the Coalition\u2019s plebiscite bill. This is the legislation which would create a plebiscite on marriage equality. The plebiscite would give an indication of the electorate\u2019s feelings, though its outcome would not bind the parliament or the Coalition to the outcome. At the last sitting, Labor announced it would undergo consultations and those meetings have included both the LGBTI community and church groups who oppose marriage equality. They will take the issue to Tuesday\u2019s party room meeting.</p> <p>While I was sitting in a quiet corner reading a book last week, the bank bosses appeared at the much-vaunted house economics committee hearings set up by the Turnbull government. There was a fair bit of squirming involved but it did not soften the resolve in Labor, the Greens and Independent <strong>Bob Katter</strong> among others for a royal commission. The Greens have already flagged they will be moving for a commission of inquiry this week. I reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/parliament-could-force-banking-inquiry-despite-hostile-coalition-says-senate-clerk\">this advice</a> from the clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing to Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson in August. Her letter then suggested the parliament could force an inquiry like the one into Lionel Murphy in the 80s. (That one was abandoned due to Murphy\u2019s illness.) The problem for those in favour of a banking royal commission is that it can only be established by executive government, that is the Turnbull government. But a commission of inquiry could be \u2013 according to Laing \u2013 forced by the parliament if their numbers in both houses were there. We shall await developments there.</p> <p>Also on the agenda are income tax cuts. Today, first thing we shall see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/bracket-creep-changes-in-budget-to-save-500000-from-second-top-marginal-tax-rate\">Scott Morrison\u2019s bracket creep bill</a> in the house again, which:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5683\">increase the third personal income tax threshold</a> so that the rate of tax payable on taxable incomes from $80,001 to $87,000 for individuals is 32.5%. The Greens are not having a bar of it but Labor supports it so it is done deal. </p> </blockquote> <p>Also around this morning, <strong>Gina Rinehart</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/australias-richest-woman-gina-rinehart-buys-two-cattle-stations-20160721-gqb0mh.html\">who has lately gone long in cattle</a>, has thrown her weight behind a $365m bid for the Kidman cattle company, confirmed last night. The Stock and Land has a <a href=\"http://www.stockandland.com.au/story/4216028/rinehart-bids-for-slice-of-kidman/?cs=4582\">version of this story here</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd, Shanghai CRED Real Estate Stock Co Ltd and S. Kidman &amp; Co Ltd (Kidman) have announced today that they have entered into a Bid Implementation Agreement (BIA) under which a joint venture company Australian Outback Beef Pty Ltd (AOB) owned 67 per cent by Hancock and 33pc by Shanghai CRED has committed to make a takeover offer to acquire the Kidman and Co. </p> <p>In a statement to the media issued by a public relations company acting on behalf of Kidman and Co and Hancock Prospecting, it was revealed the offer was conditional on approval from Australia\u2019s foreign investment regime and Chinese government approvals.</p> <p>It is also conditional on the completion of the divestment of the Anna Creek station and the Peake by Kidman to other Australian grazing interests.</p> </blockquote> <p>So you can see where this parliamentary week is going along at a clip already. And if you think this week is full, next week we have the house sitting and budget estimates \u2026</p> <p>Of course, it will be hard for even the most eventful Australian parliamentary day to compete with the second Clinton-Trump debate after the weekend\u2019s revelations of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">sordid little conversation</a> otherwise dismissed as \u201clocker-room banter\u201d. Get me a bucket. We will have live coverage of this elsewhere on the big G. Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tqxzWdKKu8\">duelling banjos</a>, the Australian and American political blogs will create (if not beautiful then) music of sorts. </p> <p>Join us in the thread or on the Twits @gabriellechan or @mpbowers.

  "<p>It was James Routledge\u2019s own battle with anxiety while winding down his first startup that led him to launch <a href=\"https://sanctus.io/\">Sanctus</a>. He was also experiencing stress, panic attacks and sleepless nights, but didn\u2019t feel he could confide in his new colleagues. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk about it, I didn\u2019t want to admit weakness or vulnerability,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Through Sanctus, Routledge offers coaching sessions to businesses to help them improve their approach to mental health. In a small business environment, he says it\u2019s the founders who must set the precedent. \u201cCreate a culture where vulnerability is accepted and it\u2019s OK for people to say: \u2018I\u2019m not feeling so good, this didn\u2019t go so well or I\u2019m feeling a little bit stressed.\u2019 Mental health is not only about the darkness and depression, that\u2019s like only talking about obesity and disease in physical health.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://wellbeing.bitc.org.uk/all-resources/research-articles/mental-health-work-report-2016\">report</a> from Business in the Community (BITC) found that mental health is still shrouded in a culture of silence and stigma in UK workplaces. Of the 20,000 people surveyed, three in four said they had experienced symptoms of poor mental health at some point in their lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only 11% of workers had recently discussed mental health with their line manager</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At that scale, the impact on business is, unsurprisingly, significant: the estimated total cost to employers is \u00a326bn per year, according to the <a href=\"https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/employment-the-economic-case\">Centre for Mental Health</a>. But its research shows that \u00a38bn of that could be saved by employers taking simple steps to manage mental health in the workplace.</p> <p>The BITC report reveals a clear discrepancy between how workers and business leaders think the issue is handled: 60% of board members felt their organisation dealt well with mental health, but only 11% of workers had recently discussed mental health with their line manager. So why are employees keeping their difficulties hidden?<br></p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a perception that someone with mental health issues is weak and that they will use it to not work,\u201d says Natalie Weaving, director at digital marketing agency, <a href=\"http://thetypefacegroup.co.uk/\">The Typeface Group</a>. Weaving heads up a small team of three employees and three contractors. Among them is copywriter Shannon Valentine, who is 20. Valentine has mental health conditions including anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), but, unlike many others, she regularly talks to her boss about her mental health.</p> <p>Valentine told Weaving about her mental health conditions after a few weeks in the job. Valentine was coming off antidepressants and was experiencing physical side effects. She says that Weaving noticed and guessed the cause. \u201cI have a tendency to worry about silly things, which she noticed too,\u201d Valentine says. Now she feels comfortable discussing it in the office and says practical changes, such as flexible hours, are a great help.<br></p> <p>Today, if Valentine is going through a rough patch, she and Weaving agree on one of her preferred coping mechanisms, whether that\u2019s taking the day off and making up the time at a later date, or simply going for a walk. \u201cWorking with Shannon has really opened our eyes,\u201d Weaving adds.<br></p> <p>It should be noted that under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\">Equality Act 2010</a>, employers can\u2019t ask a candidate about their health until they have offered them a job. However, managers need to be open about mental health if they are to effectively support staff, says Madeleine McGivern, head of workplace wellbeing programmes at mental health charity <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a>. \u201cWhen someone starts in a role [it\u2019s a good idea to have] a conversation about what keeps them well at work and what signs to look out for if they\u2019re doing less well, so that people can step in early [to help]\u201d.<br></p> <p>Encouraging all staff to talk about their mental health works well for Stuart Gray. He owns four small businesses based in Warwick, including <a href=\"http://www.portusconsulting.co.uk/\">Portus Consulting</a>, all of which are in the employee benefits industry. The number of staff in his businesses range from 12 to 45. During regular one-to-one meetings, line managers in Gray\u2019s businesses ask staff how stressed work is making them feel on a scale of one to 10. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to get them to open up,\u201d Gray adds. If a staff member feels stressed at a level of seven or above then the manager will try to get to the bottom of why that is and see if their workload needs to be lightened.<br></p> <p>Additionally, Gray\u2019s management team aims to pick up any clues that an employee might be experiencing mental health difficulties, from a lack of engagement to a long-term change in mood. His line managers have taken part in training to help them spot mental health conditions in staff.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/sep/10/business-owners-work-life-balance-wellbeing-risk\">Business owners' dangerous work-life balance puts wellbeing at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Developing this awareness helped Gray\u2019s managers identify that a senior member of staff had depression. \u201cThey were quite emotional on occasion, particularly if it was a really busy day and there was pressure on a deadline. My CEO explored the situation and it wasn\u2019t work that was the problem, it was stuff that was happening outside that was affecting their ability to work effectively and cope with that.\u201d Due to the size of the business, and an insurance policy that covers days lost to ill health, Gray was able to support the staff member with around three weeks of paid leave. He adds that all company projects are a team effort, and other staff were able to pick up the work that was left behind.</p> <p>McGivern says that providing support doesn\u2019t need to be costly. It\u2019s most important that there\u2019s a culture of communication, she says. She does suggest investing in training for staff, through programmes such as <a href=\"http://mhfaengland.org/\">Mental Health First Aid</a> (for which course costs can range from \u00a377 to \u00a3300 per person) to teach people how to identify, understand and help a person who may be developing a mental health issue.</p> <p>Simple adjustments to workplace culture such as approving flexible hours, making sure staff take their breaks and encouraging them to get involved in decision-making and planning their own workload as much as possible can all help better support the team, no matter the size of the organisation. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have an HR department to support someone with a mental health issue, but you do need to have line managers who are aware of mental health problems,\u201d McGivern adds.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a misnomer that people who have mental health problems can\u2019t function in fast-paced or stressful environments. In fact, a lot of people, with or without mental health problems, thrive in those environments because small amounts of stress can heighten our performance. It\u2019s just about giving people support.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

I wanted to go on a journey to find our more about indigenous cultures. I am staying with a tribe called Huni Kuin in the Carapan\u00e3 village, next to Tarauac\u00e1 river. To get here from Rio Branco, the capital of the Acre state, I travelled 12 hours by canoe.</p> <p>I want to find out more about the guardians of the forest, who were born and raised in this magnificent environment.

Most of the places I go to have no electricity and the generator only works two hours a day to cook dinner. <br></p> <p>But it\u2019s a small price to pay. I\u2019ve learned loads on my travels, including how to survive in the forest. I do plan on moving back, but if I end up thinking that I should travel for longer than a year then I will.

I was getting itchy feet. The lunches, the parties and the free pastries just weren\u2019t doing it for me any more.</p> <p>I always liked being outside and had dreams of travelling, so I decided to leave London office life and rough it for a bit.<br><br>I am now based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Just myself: no travel partners, no plan, no route, no end-goals. I packed my backpack and left with no return date in mind, very much to the disdain of my family. <br></p> <p>The main reason I wanted to go was to get away from the corporate life, to focus on my own mental wellbeing and start liking myself again. I wanted to give back, escape commercialism, materialism and get lost where no one would find me. There were rules: wherever I went I had to eat, sleep and speak like a local. I wanted to escape from my comfort zone and change who I was. <br></p> <p>I visited Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and various other places. My travels restored my faith in humanity, as I met real, kind and generous people from all over the world. I live in a quieter residential area in north London now.

I hope one day, if I settle down and have children, I can encourage my kids to get in touch with nature and to educate themselves like I did. </p> <h2>Leigh Sedgley, 53, Scotland: \u2018I am living the dream\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01bc1dd07d8b7a20431a366fdf1d5afdcb2624a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01bc1dd07d8b7a20431a366fdf1d5afdcb2624a8/102_0_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leigh Sedgley's tea van\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was working in the very corporate pharmaceutical industry and was lucky enough to be offered redundancy in 2010.

  "<h2>Ride a Snooc, Le Grand Bornand, France</h2> <p>Hiking off into the wilderness and finding peace away from the pistes is one of the most rewarding things to do in the mountains. But learning how to ski in backcountry takes years, and can involve a lot of swearing and slapstick mishap. Now, thanks to a new invention called the Snooc, even those who can\u2019t ski or snowboard can go snow-touring off the beaten track. It functions as a pair of easy-to-use skis for walking uphill, then when it\u2019s time to head down, it quickly transforms into a toboggan for riding safely and enjoyably back to the resort, perhaps even with a few powder turns along the way. Le Grand Bornand is one of the first resorts to offer Snooc rental. <br>\u2022<a href=\"http://snooc.ski/try-the-snooc/\"> <em>snooc.ski</em></a><em>, two-hour lesson \u00a326<br></em><strong>Book it: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.peakretreats.co.uk/winter/ski-resorts/aravis-lake-annecy/le-grand-bornand/le-village-de-lessy\"><strong>Peak Retreats</strong></a><strong> has a week in a four-star self-catering apartment, based on five sharing, including Eurotunnel crossing, for \u00a3214pp</strong></p> <h2>Baseboarding, Whistler, Canada </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19eb4b8bed3a0f6ded67d5adce53b0e6907e4cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19eb4b8bed3a0f6ded67d5adce53b0e6907e4cf9/0_662_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baseboarding, Whistler Olympic Park, Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given that snowboarding, which is essentially surfing on snow, was invented over 40 years ago, it\u2019s surprising that it\u2019s taken so long for someone to introduce front-lying bodyboarding to the slopes.

  "<p>It was a Sunday, so there was little to do but mark time and sniff glue. The shops were shut, the market half empty. With few people out and about, begging was unlikely to be a profitable enterprise.</p> <p>Instead, many of Eldoret\u2019s street children had retreated to its central rubbish dump.

It also offers a refuge, from society and from Eldoret\u2019s police, who can rarely stomach the stench.</p> <p>But not on that day, the penultimate Sunday of May. It was getting on for 4pm, the shadows lengthening on a chilly afternoon. Some of the children were asleep. Others sought solace in the cheap, hunger-suppressing fix of solvent abuse: boys inhaled glue from plastic containers clutched to their nostrils, girls in their early teens shared theirs with infants strapped to their backs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/kenya-dadaab-refugee-camp-what-happens-when-it-closes-asad-hussein\">I grew up in the world's biggest refugee camp \u2013 what happens when it closes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the warren of alleys above, the police advanced silently from three directions. Municipal officers, known as county askaris, carried cudgels and led the way; men from the Administrative Police, a feared state paramilitary unit, followed with rifles and teargas.</p> <p>The inhabitants of California Barracks have grown accustomed to police brutality. Many there that Sunday had experienced it, like Samuel Asacha. A decade ago, when he was 15, he had one of his eyes gouged out by a particularly notorious officer. Or Shereen, then 10, and Shelagh, 14, both badly disfigured in 2014 when the same man, they say, threw acid in their face.</p> <p>But the raid on California Barracks seemed different. This was not casual, workaday bullying but a carefully planned operation, systematic, meticulous \u2013 and one which city authorities have until now largely managed to cover up.</p> <p>\u201cThey gave no warning,\u201d said Eric Omondi, who at 20 is, like Samuel, one of the older members or \u201cprefects\u201d of California Barracks. \u201cIt was an ambush. Suddenly there were kids screaming, teargas being fired and officers shooting into the air.\u201d<br></p> <p>Advancing in a line, beating as they went, the police forced their victims towards the Sosiani river, which hugs the southern perimeter of the dump. Babies, girls, boys, disabled and able alike, were trampled down in merciless fashion.</p> <p>None caught were spared, not even a 17-year-old called Mary, whom Omondi saw being beaten with such force that her baby fell headfirst from her arms onto the stony ground.</p> <p>In a wheelchair after being run over by a county bulldozer clearing homeless shelters last year, Ronny, 16, had no chance of escape.</p> <p>As blows rained down on his head and shoulders, he begged his tormenters to stop: \u201cI told them \u2018If you don\u2019t stop, you are going to kill me.\u2019 They replied: \u2018We don\u2019t care if we kill you. If killing you is what will scare others away, we will do it.\u201d</p> <p>By now some had managed to slip through the police lines, but others had been pushed to the riverbank. To escape the blows, they had no choice but to plunge into the Sosiani, then in full spate after heavy rains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"706ec1c506636e8ef19c49074bba3137a40111a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/706ec1c506636e8ef19c49074bba3137a40111a6/0_619_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sosiani river.

The following October, the county authorities forcibly rounded up more than 100 street children, forced them into a lorry and dumped them 80 miles away in Malaba, a town on the Ugandan border. Most walked back to Eldoret.</p> <p>The killings began after that, activists say. Ex-Street has documented the deaths of 14 minors so far this year, including three boys shot dead as they ran from police and three more whose bodies were found days after they had been arrested. At least five more are missing after being taken into custody and another two \u2013 9-year-old Kevin Simuyu and David Kamau, eight, have not been seen since they were shot and wounded by police a fortnight after the raid on California Barracks.<br></p> <p>Some believe that the attacks on street children are ethnically motivated. Most are not members of the county\u2019s dominant Kalenjin community, the ethnic group of Kenya\u2019s powerful deputy president, William Ruto.</p> <p>The region around Eldoret has witnessed some of Kenya\u2019s worst ethnic violence, often because of politically-manipulated tensions over land ownership. In 1991, Kalenjin warriors impaled foetuses ripped from dying Kikuyu women on spears which were then placed on the side of the road leading into Eldoret, as anger over Kikuyu encroachment into the ancestral lands exploded.</p> <p>The violence reached a peak after a controversial election in 2007 saw Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, re-elected president. At least 1,200 people were killed in the ensuing violence across Kenya, but the clashes were at their deadliest in and around Eldoret, where scores of Kikuyu women and children sheltering in a church were burned to death by Kalenjin fighters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f/0_202_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in Eldoret, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in Eldoret, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the Kalenjin and Kikuyu are now reconciled and share power (President Uhuru Kenyatta is a Kikuyu), some local politicians and clergymen say the attacks on street children appear to be part of a campaign of intimidation designed to force non-Kalenjins to leave Eldoret.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the killing of street families, this will escalate,\u201d said Peter Chomba, a ruling party county legislator, who is Kikuyu. \u201cIf you look at what is happening, it is a pre-planned campaign. They profile professions drawn from certain communities and then attack them. What is happening is an attempt to claim this place for one community.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the motive, few Kenyans would be particularly shocked to hear that the police were killing minors in Eldoret.

In any case, in situations like these, the number of migrant workers will increase. The FNV holds the Fifa responsible for this and wants to address the issue by means of this lawsuit,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course there have been improvements. Some of the migrant workers have better housing. But it is moving too slowly for the migrant workers themselves. It is really going too slowly. Migrant workers die under suspicious circumstances every year,\u201d added the spokesperson.</p> <p>\u201cThe world must do everything that is possible in order to change this situation. And if you expect the world to do this, you have to begin by taking responsibility yourself.
