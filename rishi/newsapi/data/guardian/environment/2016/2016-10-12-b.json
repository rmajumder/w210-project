There was a minor outbreak in 2013, but not on the scale of what\u2019s happening now. They proceed through copycat behaviour. And at a time when social and mainstream media are caught in a feedback loop of mutual amplification, they spread quickly. </p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it go viral?\u201d he asks of the most recent scare. \u201cIt\u2019s unnerving and funny at the same time.\u201d </p> <p>But why are clowns scary? Radford says that sanitised, domesticated clowns like Bozo and Ronald McDonald obscure the fact that clowns have always been, at best, ambivalent figures. </p> <p>\u201cDarker, more sinister currents and threads go back to the earliest versions of the clown. The clown has always been an ambiguous character. Clowns were never really good, so it\u2019s not really accurate to ask when clowns turned bad. They never claimed to be good.\u201d</p> <p>We can never be sure, when clowns are laughing, whether or not it\u2019s at our expense. </p> <p>\u201cThe court jester was a figure who had license to speak ill of anyone including the king. The clown has always had a license to say things that are impolitic or rude.\u201d</p> <p>If we look at them over the long term, Radford explains in his book, they\u2019re less like the benevolent figure of hamburger ads and birthday parties, and more like the trickster archetype, a category that Radford points out includes the devil. </p> <p>Clowns have long associated with bad behaviour. Punch, the British figure of folklore and street theatre, is a \u201cwife-beating, mass-murdering infanticidal monster\u201d. Pagliacci murdered his wife in costume. And in The Pickwick Papers, Dickens presented a clown whose private life was one of alcoholic dissipation. </p> <p>Only later, especially in the USA, did \u201cthe happy, good polite clown become the clown that we all recognise.\u201d </p> <p>More recently, writers and filmmakers in the horror genre saw an opportunity to restore the balance. </p> <p>\u201cPeople like Stephen King took that character on its head, but really he was picking up the threads of the earlier, scary clown.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond this history, there\u2019s something viscerally confronting about seeing a clown in makeup. </p> <p>\u201cThe most obvious thing that is unnerving is the mask. Their human features are hidden, and instead this grotesque version of human features is there.\u201d </p> <p>The makeup, designed for the big top, does not always come off well in face to face encounters. </p> <p>\u201cThe intent isn\u2019t to be frightening, but it is, especially close up. Masks help hide identity and strip away information that we use to read people. Suddenly, you\u2019re dealing with a masked stranger near you, and possibly near your kids.\u201d</p> <p>We tend to want our clowns to be cordoned off, for safety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/05/clown-sightings-south-carolina-alabama\">Clown sightings: the day the craze began</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe like our clowns in very specific, socially prescribed contexts,\u201d like circuses, birthday parties, or rodeos. \u201cIf you see a clown walking around your street late at night, there\u2019s no context for that. It\u2019s boundary violation that creeps people out.\u201d</p> <p>Especially when seen in a suburban street, clowns also perhaps violate or blur the distinction between the real and the imaginary.

And experiences of the inhuman and the uncanny can lead people to do rash things. </p> <p>Radford is \u201cmore concerned about the public\u2019s overreaction\u201d than the clowns themselves. And indeed, there have been incidents of people using weapons in their clown encounters, or arming themselves on the off chance that they\u2019ll have one. </p> <p>We should turn away from such paranoia, and instead try, while the craze lasts, to embrace the archetype in all its ambiguity.

  "<p>A growing number of babies worldwide are at risk of brain damage or having a stroke, heart attack or asthma in adulthood because their mother was obese, health experts have warned.<br></p> <p>Leading doctors said dangerously overweight mothers were passing on obesity to their children as the result of \u201ca vicious cycle\u201d in which excess weight can seriously affect the health of parents and their offspring. </p> <p>Four studies published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology make clear that the risks of maternal obesity include stillbirth, dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women, diabetes in the mother or child, and complications during childbirth. </p> <p>The scale of obesity in women of childbearing age and the consequent dangers to health were so great that urgent action was needed to ensure women were a normal weight before they conceived, the authors say. </p> <p>Mothers being very heavily overweight could lead to their children having autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or developing cancer in later life, the researchers say.</p> <p>British women have the highest rates of obesity in Europe.

In the United States, 32% of women of peak childbearing age, between 20 and 39, were obese in 2011-12, and 60% of American women were either overweight or obese when they conceived, according to one study.</p> <p>Prof Lesley Regan, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which represents 14,000 doctors working in Britain and worldwide who specialise in childbirth and women\u2019s health, said: \u201cObesity has reached pandemic proportions globally and its origins start in the womb. In the UK, the prevalence of obesity is over 25% in both women and men. Around one in five pregnant women are obese, increasing their risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death as well as gestational diabetes, blood clots, pre-eclampsia, more complicated labours and severe bleeding after the birth.\u201d </p> <p>The international team of experts behind the studies said they feared that the problem, which is worst in developed countries, would escalate further because one in five (21%) women in the world are projected to be dangerously overweight by 2025. </p> <p>One of the research papers, which have reviewed hundreds of previous obesity studies, warned: \u201cThe long-term effects of maternal obesity could have profound public health implications.\u201d Another concluded that maternal obesity was spreading so fast, especially in western countries, that governments should start treating it as a global public health priority. </p> <p>One of the research reviews, led by Prof Keith Godfrey of Southampton University, detailed the range of serious health problems that excess maternal weight could have on a child and pointed out that fathers\u2019 weight could also increase the risks. </p> <p>\u201cIncreasing evidence implicates maternal obesity as a major determinant of offspring health during childhood and later adult life,\u201d the review states, adding that it heightened the child\u2019s risk of obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and asthma. Maternal obesity could also lead to poorer cognitive performance and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including cerebral palsy. </p> <p>An unborn child\u2019s brain could be damaged because \u201cobesity in pregnancy is associated with complex neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and inflammatory changes, which probably affect foetal hormonal exposure and nutrient supply,\u201d Godfrey\u2019s paper explains. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/junk-food-shortening-lives-children-obesity-diabetes-data\">Junk food shortening lives of children worldwide, data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key lies in \u201cepigenetic processes by which aspects of parental (both mother\u2019s and father\u2019s) lifestyle can affect the way the baby\u2019s genes operate during development.

Many require extra artificial lighting or skylights. That didn\u2019t put off the restoration of the heritage-listed Mayfair building in Melbourne. Built in 1913, the Auditorium, as it was then known, was converted to a cinema in the 30s and a shopping mall in the 80s. In 2013 the facade was retained amid a $280m revamp that added<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>office and retail space set in a newly built nine-storey internal glass atrium.</p> <p>Now called 171 Collins Street, the atrium works like a kaleidoscope, providing ample natural light. Efficiency features for the six star Green Star-rated structure include floor to ceiling double glazing, a dedicated waste storage area for recycling, an advanced rainwater and grey water reuse system, LED and T5 fluorescent lighting, and fritted insulating glass to maximise solar insulation. A 315kW natural gas co-generation generator has also been set up to transform wasted heat into an energy source, as well as cutting carbon dioxide emissions by up to two-thirds.</p> <p>Knight Frank\u2019s senior facilities and engineering manager CJ Harshana Wijewardane says that the six-star rating was achieved through \u201cmethodically fine-tuning existing infrastructure\u201d while installing new technologies.</p> <p>Most important was the co-generation system, which operating in parallel with the grid supply is not only the base source of electricity for the office tower but also provides heating for the building and for hot water. </p> <p>Despite all this, the Mayfair building retains a richness and decadence<strong>, </strong>says Kristen Whittle of Bates Smart architects.

  "<p>The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to increase rates in September was a close call, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160921.htm\">the minutes released</a> on Wednesday show. When the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/federal-reserve-interest-rates-unchanged\">met in September</a>, three of the 12 members voted in favor of increasing interest rates as the US labor market continued to improve at a slower rate and the risks from Brexit, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, eased. Some members indicated that a rate hike might be appropriate \u201crelatively soon\u201d. </p> <p>Up until September, Kansas City Fed president Esther George was the lone voice in favor of raising interest rates. Last month, she was joined by Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester and Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren in her call to increase the target range to 0.50%-0.75%. The current range is 0.25%-0.50%, after it was increased last December for the first time in nearly a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>The FOMC \u2013 which is the policy setting arm of the US central bank \u2013 noted that the case for increasing interest rates has strengthened recently.

With six FOMC meetings having come and gone, that forecast has now been revised down to just one rate hike.

That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u2019t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance.</p> <p>Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in.</p> <p>Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example).</p> <p>It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up.</p> <p>And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can understand the politics around this, but we\u2019re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure.</p> <p>If we\u2019re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So are you saying that it\u2019s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision?</em></p> <p>I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:24:49.798Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fe04bde4b01d9dd2c90200\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T09:50:41.496Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cunliffe: City jobs could move to New York after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street, in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street, in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues.</strong><br></p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u2019s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals.</p> <p>The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u2019t simply be copied.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t see London\u2019s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services and other services.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u2018transaction chain\u2019 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer.</p> <p>You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>And in New York, that already happens.

  "<p>For many people, Google is simply the gateway to a vast archive of facts and memories. For those who pay closer attention to its business dealings, the company also invests billions to find new ways to use the power of computers: it\u2019s developing robots, virtual reality gear and self-driving cars. Remember all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-glass\">hubbub about Google Glass?</a></p> <p>Google has been using the same approach in sustainability \u2013 spreading its wealth in a variety of projects to cut its waste and carbon footprint, initiatives which may one day generate profits. During the SXSW Eco conference this week, I caught up with Google\u2019s sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, to find out more. Brandt joined the company in July last year after serving as the nation\u2019s chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration.</p> <p>During her keynote at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, Brandt hit all the<a href=\"https://www.google.com/green/\"> key environmental initiatives</a> that Google had undertaken over the past decade \u2013 at least those that have been announced. Some of the projects involve collecting and analyzing data that enable Google and other businesses to use more sustainable materials, reduce their environmental impact and cut emissions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we think about the Third Industrial Revolution and the role Google played in it, we also think about the Fourth Industrial Revolution where this digital backbone could transform our relationship to the material world. We would like to be a player,\u201d she said during her keynote. The<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/\"> Fourth Industrial Revolution</a> is the buzzterm for describing the deepening role that technology plays in our lives.<br><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/24/fishing-thief-skytruth-data-software-maps-illegal\">To catch a fishing thief, SkyTruth uses data from the air, land and sea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Understandably, Google is big on reducing energy use at its data centers. Another often-cited effort: the company is a<a href=\"https://www.google.com/green/energy/\"> big wind and solar energy investor</a>, having signed 2.5 gigawatts worth of contracts around the world and, additionally, committed to investing $2.5bn in renewable energy, including owning stakes in power plants. That makes the company the largest corporate renewable energy buyer if you don\u2019t count utilities, Brandt said.</p> <p>Brandt wouldn\u2019t tell me whether the company plans to put money into energy storage, which is seen as a complementary, if not must-have, technology for renewable energy in overtaking fossil fuels. Energy storage, such as batteries, makes it possible to use renewable energy at a time when solar or wind farms can\u2019t produce electricity. The energy storage market is fairly new, with lots of experiments with a variety of technologies and ways to reduce costs.</p> <p>Brandt said one of the surprising things she learned when she first arrived at Google was the company\u2019s project to create a database of the composition and environmental impact of building materials, something she didn\u2019t know about before. The company had been using the database, called Portico, for its own construction projects, but<a href=\"http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/google-healthy-building-network-release-web-app.html\"> released a web app last week</a> to make the data more publicly available.</p> <p>Brandt isn\u2019t the first hire at Google to work on sustainability. The tech giant has a decentralized approach: there have been teams embedded in different business units that look at ways to reduce energy use, emissions and waste and to boost productivity and revenues. For instance, there\u2019s a team called Geo for Good that investigates the use of maps, data and machine learning to solve environmental problems, such as creating databases and software to monitor the health of tropical forests around the world or track illegal fishing. There\u2019s also a team that works on serving sustainably grown food within the company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/10/google-earth-engine-maps-forest-watch-deforestation-environment\">Google-powered map helps fight deforestation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Brandt appears to have been hired to come up with big picture strategies and make more efficient use of all these disparate sustainability initiatives. That means a lot of cajoling and negotiations with people who don\u2019t necessarily have to answer to her. This is where her experience working as the country\u2019s chief sustainability officer comes in handy, she said.</p> <p>\u201cMy current role [is to work] across a lot of different teams. These challenges are so big that it requires partnership,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>What Google does internally is fascinating. At a sustainability conference in June, I attended a panel of three Google employees who recounted their effort to promote reusable menstrual cups, which help to reduce the amount of pads and tampons that end up in landfills. The discussion provided an interesting look into the skepticism and struggle the three women faced in persuading their fellow Googlers to try something new. And, of course, data played a big role: numbers to show the growing public interest in menstrual cups and the large expenses that Google spends on pads and tampons.</p> <p>They ran a pilot project at the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View that saw all 250 cups being used in half of the expected time frame and received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. So the Googlers began looking to do another pilot at a different Google office.</p> <p>I also learned that reducing meat consumption is a touchy subject at Google, where engineers are pampered and cloistered to maximize their productivity. \u201cWhen we did \u2018Meatless Monday\u2019, there was a group that set up a barbecue just outside of the caf\u00e9,\u201d said one of the Google employees at the June conference.</p> <p>So what does Brandt do personally to set a good example?</p> <p>\u201cI take our shuttle to work,\u201d she said, before switching to \u201cwe\u201d and her talking points from her keynote. \u201cWe are focused on composting, recycling and reusing our water bottles,\u201d she said, pointing to a water bottle on the table in front of her. \u201cWe have a bin that\u2019s green for composting, blue for recycling and a little bit of [space] hanging off to the side that\u2019s for landfill waste.\u201d</p>",

It has been a rather odd occasion - not a debate about Brexit, but a debate about how parliament debates Brexit - but given that we now live in world where the pound can rally following the publication of government amendments to opposition day motions (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266#block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266\">11.50am)</a>, these procedural wrangles matter.</p> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to approve a motion with cross-party support saying the Commons must have a \u201cfull and transparent\u201d debate on the government\u2019s plans for Brexit before article 50 is invoked, but ministers are refusing to commit themselves to giving parliament an actual vote on the matter. </strong><strong>Theresa May</strong> made this clear at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2#block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2\">12.36pm)</a> and<strong> David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, would not promise a substantive vote either in his speech at the start of the debate. It may well be the case that eventually MPs do get a vote, but any vote on a substantive motion would constrain the government, and also allow the possibility of Tory MPs rebelling with Labour, and May seems determined to resist it if at all possible. In his impressive debut as shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer</strong> confimed that Labour was not explicitly demanding a vote in its motion because it wanted to maximise the chances of MPs voting for it tonight. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910#block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910\">1.37pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Davis has played down suggestions that the government will publish a white paper or a green paper on Brexit. </strong>When it was put to him that a fellow minister, George Eustice, said a Brexit white paper was likely to be published, Davis dismissed the idea. Later he seemed to hint that one could be published.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I should also tell the House ... I have asked the chief whip to ensure we have a series of debates so that the House can air its views. And it would be again very surprising if we had those debates without presenting to the House something for them to debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a source in the department for Brexit said that Davis was not intending to suggest that policy papers would be published before the debates. Davis was just referring to the fact that ministers would keep MPs updated, the source said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Conservative former minister has accused the government of pursuing a Brexit policy driven by ideology, not national interest.</strong> In a question to Davis <strong>Claire Perry, </strong>the former transport minister, said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am extremely concerned by what has happened to sterling and what has happened to interest rates since the prime minister\u2019s comments at the conference last week. And I think the problem [David Davis] is not acknowledging is that many people in the country do not think that there is a policy to put the national interest first. They think there is a policy to put people\u2019s narrow ideological interests first. And what we should be setting out is quite clearly how we are going to protect British jobs and businesses and put ideology in the past where it belongs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis rejected this claim.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has withdrawn a claim he made on Monday that Starmer is a second-rate lawyer.</strong> He said he was being \u201cclumsy\u201d and that his comment was not intended to apply to Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can I unreservedly withdraw allegations that I made on Monday, only on the basis that it was clumsy, it was not meant about you, it was meant about advice. I don\u2019t doubt for one moment your capabilities as a lawyer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer said he considered the matter closed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m grateful for that and I can assure you and the House that I wasn\u2019t in the slightest bit concerned. I consider the matter closed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to confirm that powers over fishing and agriculture currently exercised by Brussels would currently devolve to the Scottish parliament. </strong>These were matters that would have to be discussed with Edinburgh, he said. <strong>Alex Salmond</strong>, the former Scottish first minister, said that under current law these matters would automatically get devolved to Scotland, regardless of what Davis said, unless the devolution arrangements were changed. He told Davis:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Agriculture and fisheries are not reserved, therefore they are devolved. Unless the government intends to change that position it\u2019ll be automatic that agriculture and fisheries powers go to the Scottish government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an area where we have not addressed or talked to the devolved administration at all yet.

The very fact that Corbyn focused on Brexit was striking, because since the referendum (and for some time before) he has generally avoided the topic. But, as usual, he asked strong questions but failed to follow them up. (In tennis terms, he has an adequate serve, but no return.) He also failed to press May on the one question that is really topical today; in the light of her U-turn last night on a Brexit debate, can she now commit to giving MPs a vote on a substantive motion? May responded competently, but not brilliantly, to Corbyn\u2019s questions, and interestingly she avoided some of the gratuitous Labour-bashing that has marred some of her earlier PMQs, although she did finish with a neat point about Labour getting the same answer when they ask a question for a second time.

The jobs and income of people are at stake. May says she will not give a running commentary.

Debates like this do not force MPs to decide between two positions. Having a debate on a substantive motion would allow, for example, those MPs who want the UK to stay in the single market to table an amendment saying this should be a top priority.</p> <p>Phillips told the Daily Politics he would like to see a motion saying, for example, that the UK should remain in the single market and that the UK should get control of its borders. Neil said these two demands were irreconcilable, but Phillips did not accept that.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fe10f4e4b03b22b4fb284b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:32:09.836Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, will be opening the debate this afternoon for Labour. <strong>David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, will respond.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fe0cc2e4b05d915e424163\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:19:59.771Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Modern-day slaves are being failed by \u201csubstandard\u201d crime recording which risks allowing perpetrators to offend with impunity, according to the UK\u2019s anti-slavery commissioner, the Press Association reports.

In it they said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you are able to provide satisfactory answers to all these questions, just one per day from tomorrow until 31 March next year, it might give some confidence that the government is entering the Article 50 negotiations with a clear plan.</p> <p>If not, it will reinforce the sense that the government is instead blundering into this process without a clear endgame in mind, repeating exactly the same mistake that the previous Prime Minister made with his \u2018renegotiation\u2019 of Britain\u2019s EU membership last year: working to an artificial, self-imposed timetable; with a flawed Plan A of what he wanted to achieve; and no Plan B whatsoever.</p> <p>Given you have consistently spoken up throughout your career in a highly principled way about the importance of Parliamentary sovereignty, we hope you will reflect again on the decision to deny the country\u2019s elected representatives the opportunity to debate and vote on the Government\u2019s plan for Brexit before Article 50 is triggered.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to the letter a Conservative spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are aiming to deliver the right deal for the United Kingdom and return control over all the decisions that affect people\u2019s lives to the sovereign institutions of this country.</p> <p>That\u2019s what people voted for on June 23.

In reality, it it probably more a matter of establishing a temporary, tactical advantage, but an opposition is entitled to boast about its gains whenever it gets them.</p> <p>The key point is that Theresa May has compromised to avoid the risk of a Tory revolt over giving the Commons a say on Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s an opposition day in the Commons (meaning Labour gets the choose the motion for debate) and the party decided to get MPs to vote on whether the Commons should be consulted on the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating strategy. Here is the motion that it has tabled, which is also backed by the Lib Dems.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That this House recognises that leaving the EU is the defining issue facing the UK; believes that there should be a full and transparent debate on the Government\u2019s plan for leaving the EU; and calls on the Prime Minister to ensure that this House is able properly to scrutinise that plan for leaving the EU before Article 50 is invoked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Tory MPs also feel strongly that the Commons must have a say over Brexit (for reasons set out in the chamber on Monday) and, if there were a straightforward yes/no vote on whether the Commons should be consulted, Tory rebels could unite with the opposition to defeat the government. Theresa May wants to ensure the government has the final say.</p> <p>But May is not asking Tory MPs to reject the Labour motion outright (which is what normally happens when MPs debate an opposition day motion). Instead the government has tabled an amendment saying what Labour proposes is fine, so long as the government\u2019s negotiating position is maintained. The amendment reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At end add \u2018; and believes that the process should be undertaken in such a way that respects the decision of the people of the UK when they voted to leave the EU on 23 June and does not undermine the negotiating position of the government as negotiations are entered into which will take place after article 50 has been triggered.\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tory MPs will be asked to vote for this amendment, before the Commons votes on the main motions. Tory MPs who feel very strongly about parliamentary scrutiny, the \u201crebels\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">like Stephen Phillips</a>, may choose not to back the amendment, on the grounds that it is an attempt to neuter the demand for scrutiny, but that that won\u2019t look like much of a rebellion. And then the motion as a whole will get passed, probably with the amendment attached.<br></p> <p>That means effectively that May has conceded that there must be a \u201cfull and transparent debate\u201d in the Commons on the government\u2019s Brexit plan, before article 50 is invoked. <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, said last night this was \u201ca real victory for \u201cparliament and will help ensure there is proper democratic grip of the Brexit process.\u201d</p> <p>But the Labour motion mentions a debate but not a vote. On the Today programme <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, said that it implied a vote. But ministers will be able to say that they have not agreed to let the Commons vote on, for example, whether remaining a member of the single market must be a priority. If Labour could get May to concede that, then that really would count as a huge victory.</p> <p>I will be covering this issue, and the debate, in full during the day.</p> <p>Here is the agenda.<br></p> <p><em>9am:</em> Justine Greening, the education secretary, gives a speech to the Fawcett Society gender pay conference.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative chairman, and Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee on women in the Commons after the 2020 election.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives a speech on HS2.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England deputy governor, gives evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit. </p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Senior police figures, including Stephen Rodhouse, deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, give evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate on parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process.</p> <p>I will be mostly focusing on Brexit today but, as usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

And when I say met, I really mean it. The first standing ovation came before the opening credits.</p> <p>Small wonder: rarely was such a movie so required. A few days before its premiere, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/oscars-so-white-straight-academy-fails-diversity-idris-elba-straight-outta-compton-creed-carol-todd-haynes\">Oscars So White controversy</a> again exploded, as no actors of colour were nominated for the second year running. Beyond that bubble, the Black Lives Matter movement gathered anger, anticipating a horrific year. Both inside and outside Hollywood, there was a keen appetite for films that gave big roles to non-white actors and told stories of emancipation previously suppressed or directed by white people.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart\">Nate Parker\u2019s biopic of Nat Turner</a> deliberately takes the title of the notorious 1915 Ku Klux Klan propaganda film directed by DW Griffith. [Spoiler alert] The new movie recounts the story of the leader of an 1831 slave revolt in Virginia which led to the deaths of 60 white people and then about 200 black people.</p> <p>It is direct and frank and stirring in aim as well as its aesthetic. It simmers for 90 minutes, as its hero suffers and witnesses the suffering of others, before unleashing almighty revenge.</p> <p>Hence the ecstatic ovation that also closed the Sundance premiere. And hence its speedy sale to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/fox-searchlight-pays-175m-for-slavery-drama-birth-of-a-nation\">Fox Searchlight for $17.5m</a> (\u00a314m) \u2013 a record-breaking sum. And an incredible bid of confidence, particularly given that the film it most obviously emulates, Steve McQueen\u2019s best picture winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/12-years-a-slave\">12 Years a Slave</a>, underperformed at the US box office, taking less than a third of its global total there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c502e4a1ce47de6c7ec5e1342c9931f79316336a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c502e4a1ce47de6c7ec5e1342c9931f79316336a/0_38_5765_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armie Hammer and Nate Parker in The Birth of a Nation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the lengthy, undisputed testimony read out at his trial, Turner explained that he was prompted by religious visions and messages.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox/Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But perhaps The Birth of a Nation would be different. After all, it delivers where McQueen\u2019s more composed work \u2013 whose hero endures torture and servitude without bloody rebellion \u2013 does not. Like Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">Django Unchained</a> (which took five times what 12 Years a Slave did in America), it offers catharsis, as Turner and compatriots pick up their axes \u2013 acts which, the final shots suggest, helped secure an end to slavery.</p> <p>So here is a movie absolutely of the moment, precisely right for our times. Except that it isn\u2019t. Or, at least, not really. Parker has co-opted Turner\u2019s tale into something suited to the febrile atmosphere around race and violence. Yet Nat Turner\u2019s true story is just as topical.</p> <p>In the lengthy, undisputed testimony read out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion\">at his real-life trial</a>, Turner explained that he was prompted by religious visions and messages. How signs from God made it plain to him that \u201cthe Saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and the great day of judgment was at hand\u201d \u2013 and that he was the one to execute God\u2019s will. The contemporary relevance of a killer driven by fundamentalism, even jihad, hardly needs stating.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i18z1EQCoyg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i18z1EQCoyg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i18z1EQCoyg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">The Birth of a Nation: Official HD Trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Turner\u2019s status as a slave of course informs his entire life. But while the film fully foregrounds this, his actual testimony didn\u2019t really mention it. The movie massages the facts beyond recognition. The man himself stated that his owner was \u201ca kind master, [who] placed the greatest confidence in me; in fact, I had no cause to complain of his treatment to me\u201d.</p> <p>The film thinks otherwise, making one particular instance of cruelty the tipping point. It also adds a couple of white-on-black rapes, plus Turner being galvanised by the terrible conditions of other slaves, witnessed while touring local plantations as a preacher.</p> <p>Much is made up, other moments \u2013 Turner going back to kill a baby initially forgotten in the slaughter of a family, for instance \u2013 omitted. The real circumstances of his capture are less flattering than the film suggests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\">The Birth of a Nation: how Nate Parker failed to remake history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But most crucial is the altering of his motivation. We see a cob of corn appear to fill with blood in Turner\u2019s hands, which he takes as a sign to attack. But we don\u2019t see him then discovering \u201con the leaves in the woods hieroglyphic characters and numbers with the forms of men in different attitudes, portrayed in blood, and representing the figures I had seen before in the heavens\u201d. Might knowing this was his prompt muddy our admiration?</p> <p>Parker is not the first person to have appropriated someone\u2019s biography for their own propaganda \u2013 no matter how justified the cause may be. He\u2019s not even the first person to have done it with Nat Turner. TR Gray, a slave owner who <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=etas\">interviewed Turner in jail</a> and who transcribed his statement, frames its written version within his own dubious declarations. In 1967, William Styron wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Confessions_of_Nat_Turner\">a novel imagining Turner\u2019s life story</a>. It won the Pulitzer prize, but many objected to its portrayal of the slaves as dim, Turner as bumbling and prone to sexual violence and the slave owners as sweet if naive.</p> <p>Fiction films are not documentaries, but playing fast and loose with key real figures, while claiming the authority that history gives, is irresponsible. It is also unnecessary. 12 Years a Slave was remarkably faithful to its source. Its one major change was to downplay the endless false hope towards the end of Solomon Northup\u2019s incarceration.</p> <p>That film succeeded not just because it told us that slavery was bad, as Parker\u2019s does; likewise, to take another example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/suffragette\">Suffragette</a> did more than inform us that women ought to have had the vote. Both showed us what it was really like for those who had to cope in such appalling situations, what motivated them to keep living, as well as what drove those whose views we now think abhorrent. To lay it on thick is forgivable. Painting such a false portrait is not.</p>",
  "<p>I read about the butterfly decline noticed by people all around the country, described by Patrick Barkham (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/10/record-low-number-of-uk-butterflies-a-shock-and-a-mystery\" title=\"\">Record low UK butterfly count is \u2018a shock and mystery\u2019</a>, 10 October). I don\u2019t find it so much of a mystery, having spent the summer planning for and walking from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh on what we called <a href=\"https://makeabeeline.org/\" title=\"\">a Bee Line</a>.</p> <p>This initiative was triggered by a visit in September 2014 to our former farm on the edge of Salisbury Plain. When we moved there in the late 1940s, there were permanent pastures, hedges and ancient drove roads lined with wayfarers\u2019 trees and carpeted with wildflowers \u2013 orchids, harebells, trefoils \u2013 and abuzz with bees, butterflies, dragonflies and pollinators of all kinds. Now, 60 years on, it is a silent landscape; no cows, chickens, sheep, or even farm workers, just contractors, and of course no birds, butterflies, bees or flying insects. Between 30 August and 6 September we followed our Bee Line, walking some 80km from Edinburgh to our home along small roads, footpaths, cycle tracks, disused railway lines, through open moorland. We saw few butterflies, moths or bees and even noted a lack of midges.</p> <p>The decline could be caused by a number of factors, such as weather conditions earlier in the year, but is exacerbated by the same things that are also damaging the bee populations.</p> <p>Agribusiness and its associated practices: monoculture, weedkillers, neonicotinoids, fungicides, molluscicides, and farming practices including pre-spraying of grain crops before harvesting and removal of hedges. Local authority and homeowners\u2019 obsession with frequent flat strimming and clearing edges of roadways, motorways, roundabouts. Loss of brownfield sites to development and the associated loss of a rich mix of plants and invertebrates. Treatment of garden bedding plants and seeds, currently <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/living/articles/are-bee-friendly-plants-poisoning-our-bees\" title=\"\">being researched by Friends of the Earth</a>.</p> <p>On our Bee Line walk and while doing planning walks, the only place that was buzzing with both bees and butterflies was the disused railway line pathway between Broughton and Biggar, which is edged with bee and butterfly friendly plants. Even golf courses, which are extensive green spaces, can be managed intensively with little room to share with wildlife. On the moorland, which is managed for sheep and grouse, we saw just a few bees and moths enjoying heather, thyme yarrow and harebells. <br><strong>Meg Beresford</strong><br><em>Wiston, South Lanarkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The decline in butterfly numbers comes as no surprise to me at all. The one place in my parish where the range and number of butterfly species was high (or at least what might be considered normal) was a stretch of roadside verge specially seeded by the local authority with wildflower mixture. This attracted large numbers of gatekeepers, coppers and blues in particular this summer. The&#xa0;decline in not only butterflies and other insects but birds and wildflowers too is no doubt due to the fashion for \u201cgardening\u201d the countryside. That is, unnecessary and untimely mowing in particular and the planting out of what were wild spaces so that they essentially become extensions of urban parks and gardens.</p> <p>These areas may look neat and tidy, but it\u2019s playing havoc with biodiversity. Wildlife desperately needs what some perceive as untidy spaces or scrub. Habitat destruction by removing cover for protection, feeding, finding mates and breeding, not to mention overwintering, is more than decimating our wildlife. <br><strong>Graham Stocks</strong><br><em>Quorn, Leicestershire </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

  "<p>A new analysis has found racial disparities in the police use of force across different Austin neighborhoods, even when controlling for neighborhood crime rates and income levels.<br></p> <p>The new study, which used data released as part of a White House initiative launched last year, finds that the strongest predictor of the number of police use of force incidents in different neighborhoods is the crime rates in those neighborhoods.</p> <p>But even controlling for crime rates, income and education levels, and rates of home ownership, black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Texas city still see a slightly higher number of use of force incidents, the new analysis found. Every 1% increase in the proportion of black residents in a neighborhood led to a 2.6% increase in use of force incidents, according to the analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a highly segregated city such as Austin, that increase actually looks much larger when you apply it to the neighborhood level. Virtually all the neighborhoods on the city\u2019s west side are less than 5% black, while many on the east side are closer to 60% black. Using the report\u2019s findings, that could mean an increase in use of force of more than 140% from a typical white neighborhood to a typical black one after controlling for other variables. The use of force incidents measured included anything from use of a closed fist through use of batons, pepper spray and tasers, all the way to deadly force.</p> <p>The new results line up with previous studies that have found clear racial disparities in police use of force. The analysis does not look specifically at racial disparities in fatal use of force, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/26/black-men-minorities-killed-police-encounters-study\">the most controversial area of research.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhat it tells me is that we still have more work to do,\u201d said Art Acevedo, Austin\u2019s police chief of nearly a decade. \u201cWe have to continue to work in terms of our training on implicit and explicit bias for our department.\u201d</p> <p>But he said he believed that releasing the findings would help continue to build trust with the community, and that they would help the department improve in the long run. </p> <p>\u201cYou can be an ostrich as a leader, and bury your head in the sand, or you can be forward-thinking and be scanning the environment constantly for threats or for opportunities to do better,\u201d Acevedo said.</p> <p>Austin is the first city in the country to go public with this kind of in-depth analysis of use of force disparities, a step that the White House, researchers, and the city\u2019s police chief say they hope other departments will follow.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about Chief Acevedo\u2019s willingness to put it all out there,\u201d said Roy Austin, a White House domestic policy adviser focused on urban affairs, justice and opportunity. \u201cWe need more chiefs to step up like Chief Acevedo has done and say, \u2018I have nothing to hide. Policing belongs to the community and we are going to show the community exactly what we are doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Austin analysis was conducted independently by researchers from the Center for Policing Equity and the Urban Institute.</p> <p>Black Americans are more likely to be subject to fatal and nonfatal use of police force than white Americans. The Guardian\u2019s long-term investigation on police killings, the Counted, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">consistently found that black Americans are more than twice as likely than white Americans to be killed by the police.</a> What\u2019s less clear are the reasons behind this disparity, and what it would take to erase it.</p> <p>Is the disparity purely based on community factors, such as crime levels or poverty? Is it driven by police department policies or individual police officer racial bias? Or does the disparity in use of force stem from dynamics between police and communities \u2013 such as Americans of some races being more likely to flee from the police in confrontations, or police officers responding to greater hostility toward the police in some neighborhoods rather than others?</p> <p>The report argues that \u201cthe truth likely incorporates elements of each of these\u201d, but that only better data and analysis can help reformers be more specific in finding where the fault lines are.</p> <p>Previous studies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2016/jul/11/study-finds-no-racial-bias-police-shootings-data\">including a Harvard working paper released in July,</a> found racial disparities in non-fatal police use of force, even controlling for a variety of factors \u2013 including police officers\u2019 own descriptions of how compliant citizens were. The Harvard study found, in an in-depth analysis of Houston data, that black Americans were actually less likely, not more likely, than other Americans to be shot by the police, a controversial finding. It\u2019s not clear to what extent the results in Houston or nine other areas the study examined in less depth might be representative of national trends.</p> <p>The racial disparities in Austin\u2019s use of force \u201care not direct evidence of racial prejudice\u201d, the analysts from the Center for Policing Equity and the Urban Institute concluded. But by controlling for community-level factors, the researchers said, they could demonstrate that police factors or factors driven by the police-community relationship must play some role. </p> <p>\u201cOnce again, we can say that crime is not sufficient to explain the racial disparities we see for both black and Latinos in the use of force,\u201d said Phillip Atiba Goff, the lead researcher on the analysis.</p> <p>The new analysis draws from two different initiatives exploring police use of force data: the White House\u2019s Police Data Initiative, launched last year, which encourages departments to post public data about their use of force, and the National Justice Database, a National Science Foundation-funded effort to build a standardized national database about police use of force, which keeps its data private.</p> <p>Austin is the first city in either of these efforts to agree to publicly release an in-depth analysis of its use of force data. Goff said the city-level study was designed to create a standardized model for other departments to analyze and then share their use of force data. Through the National Justice Database, departments can share data and have these analyses made privately available to them. Whether departments choose to release the results of their analyses publicly is up to police leaders, Goff said.</p> <p>\u201cThese are scary questions to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m a chief, I don\u2019t know how well my department is doing on these issues. I can reasonably worry, if the analyses reveal something that is disturbing to the community, I\u2019m kicking a hornet\u2019s nest.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix a problem that you don\u2019t know you have.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">Young black men killed by US police at highest rate in year of 1,134 deaths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Acevedo, the Austin chief, said: \u201cMy cops will not be surprised by the fact that we\u2019re participating in this. We will talk to them about the fact that there is a use of force disparity, and our next step for us is that we continue to evaluate our training in terms of de-escalation.\u201d</p> <p> The challenge with Austin being the only department so far to release this analysis so far, Acevedo said, was that \u201cthere\u2019s no other points of reference.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Austin\u2019s neighborhood use of force disparities might compare with other large cities. \u201cAs a profession, we\u2019re only good as the weakest department in the nation,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cWe\u2019re all a reflection of one another.\u201d</p> <p><strong> </strong>Unlike prior studies, this new report doesn\u2019t rely on the race of the individual citizens involved to draw its conclusions, but rather, looks at the demographics of the neighborhoods where the use of force incidents occurred. This, according to Goff, is the best way to understand how community-level factors such as crime, income and education might influence the disparate racial application of force.</p> <p>Policing \u201cis a neighborhood-by-neighborhood profession\u201d, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s experienced.\u201d</p> <p>The Austin neighborhood report also looked at traffic stops and found that black drivers of all ages were searched more frequently than white or Hispanic drivers. In addition, black drivers did not see the same reductions in stops with age that white and Hispanic drivers experienced. The report concedes, however, that the findings are \u201cunable to control for drivers\u2019 differential involvement in illegal activity or exposure to police\u201d and cannot be taken by themselves as proof of bias in stops.</p>",
  "<p>By any yardstick the Scottish National party commands the politics of Scotland. As they gather for their annual conference in Glasgow, Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party can look back on another year of major victories. After sweeping 56 out of 59 Scottish Westminster seats in the 2015 general election, the SNP was re-elected in May for a third term in government in Holyrood. A week ago, its candidate swept Labour aside in <a href=\"http://stv.tv/news/politics/1369242-snp-take-seat-from-labour-in-glasgow-council-by-election/\" title=\"\">a Glasgow council byelection</a>, perhaps foreshadowing wider SNP gains in the 2017 Scottish local elections, where control of Glasgow is the greatest prize. In the opinion polls, the SNP regularly commands the support of about, or&#xa0;just under, half of Scottish voters, as it did in the 2015 and 2016 elections.</p> <p>In these circumstances, it may seem perverse to talk of the SNP having problems. Yet problems there are, though they should not be overstated and Scotland\u2019s struggling other parties would kill to be faced with them. The SNP, after all, lost some ground in the Holyrood contest in May, compared both with its 2011 triumph and with the 2015 Westminster election. It has lost recent council byelections to Labour too (in <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-gain-seat-snp-shock-8895855\" title=\"\">North Lanarkshire</a> and North Ayrshire, where <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeons-dad-loses-election-8614584\" title=\"\">Ms Sturgeon\u2019s father was defeated</a>) as well as winning one. Ms Sturgeon remains popular, but her approval ratings have <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Scotland/ipsos-mori-scotland-spom-september-2016-charts.pdf\" title=\"\">fallen significantly</a> (her net approval in Scotland is currently lower than both Theresa May\u2019s and Ruth Davidson\u2019s). And while Kezia Dugdale\u2019s Labour remains in eclipse, both Labour and Ms Davidson\u2019s revived Scottish Tories regularly point to the truth that the SNP talks a more radical game than it actually delivers.</p> <p>The lurking and deeper problem, skilfully highlighted by Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/snp-glasgow-byelection-win-shames-labour\" title=\"\">at a local government conference</a> last week is that the SNP\u2019s dominance and culture risks turning Scotland into something akin to a one-party state, in which government is not properly held to account. Scotland has not reached that point yet, and there are plenty of people inside the SNP as well as outside it who are aware of the dangers. But it needs to be held to account, not least by independent media and the BBC.</p> <p>The sharper and more immediate problem for the SNP is how to respond to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Ms Sturgeon has never satisfactorily resolved the dilemma of whether to hold a second independence referendum in the wake of Scotland\u2019s vote to remain. If the path to reversing the 2014 referendum was clear, she would go for it. However, Scottish opinion has now reverted to opposition to independence after a brief contrary shift in July. Ms Sturgeon does not want to lose a second vote. But nor does she want everything to be dominated by the issue of whether to hold one. The conference will debate a motion from Edinburgh West on Friday that calls on the SNP \u201cto prepare\u201d for a second referendum while stopping short of actually demanding one.</p> <p>This seems fated to be the SNP\u2019s position. Ms Sturgeon is caught between activists who crave a second vote and her own more cautious instincts. The reality for the SNP, hard though it may be to accept, is that the public remains sceptical about the independence prospectus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/24/scotland-oil-money-nationalist-dream-nicola-sturgeon-independence\" title=\"\">for good reasons</a>. Ms Sturgeon\u2019s best course is to ease off about a second referendum and to follow the advice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/scotland-gain-greater-independence-brexit-holyrood-told\" title=\"\">her former minister Alex Neil</a>, who argues that the Brexit process provides many opportunities to devolve EU-level powers to Holyrood, including farming, fishing, employment and the environment. What&#xa0;Mr&#xa0;Neil calls \u201cneo-independence\u201d is probably the best on offer right now. <a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thesnp/pages/3923/attachments/original/1476179282/SNP_Winter_Conf.pdf?1476179282\" title=\"\">The conference\u2019s theme of \u201cStronger for Scotland\u201d</a> suggests that Ms Sturgeon agrees, even if she is wary of disappointing her activists by saying so too directly.</p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/higher-education-and-research-bill\" title=\"\">higher education bill</a>, trailed as the centrepiece of the pre-Brexit government\u2019s legislative programme for 2016-2017, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/the-guardian-view-on-universities-facing-a-double-whammy\" title=\"\">a flawed piece of work</a>. It undermines universities\u2019 independence, expands the transactional relationship between them and their students, and introduces for the first time profit-making independent universities. All of these innovations threaten Britain\u2019s global reputation for excellence in higher education. But in among the ideologically driven plans there is one welcome proposal. In the name of improving social mobility, there will be more monitoring of students\u2019 socio-economic background. At the moment, a student from an advantaged background is still six times more likely to go to a top university than a student from a disadvantaged one; the latter is more likely to drop out, and less likely to get a good job. Understanding in greater detail which students are applying from which disadvantaged group, and whereabouts in the country they live, should make recruitment more socially just. Maintenance and tuition loans will also be extended to mature and part-time students. Given the ambition of these changes, it is all the more disappointing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/01/abolition-student-maintenance-grant-poorest-university-loans-tuition-fees\" title=\"\">maintenance grants for the poorest students</a> have been abolished from this year.

The accounts suggest he may never make a profit on either resort, although the Trump family insist Turnberry will return to profitability in the short to medium term.</p> <p>There is also an apparent discrepancy between the accounts and his filings last year to the US Federal Election Commission (FEC), the regulator which controls election spending. </p> <p>In his attempt to create a global portfolio of world-class golf resorts, the Republican presidential candidate had invested \u00a362.7m in buying and refurbishing the Open championship resort at Turnberry on the coast of south-west Scotland, between acquiring it in April 2014 and the end of 2015. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072426cdcdc1f813cc59c6a2ddbf9c76deb7c734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072426cdcdc1f813cc59c6a2ddbf9c76deb7c734/255_119_693_545/500.png\" alt=\"Location of Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The locations of Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mapbox, OpenStreetMap</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, his losses at his golf course and boutique hotel at Balmedie, north of Aberdeen, which he once claimed would be \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d and where he plans to build 2,750 homes and holiday flats, also continue to mushroom. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s personal loans to Trump International Golf Course Ltd (TIGCS), which has owned the Aberdeenshire estate where the resort is being built since 2006, increased by \u00a32.6m last year. <br></p> <p>That took his total investment there to \u00a339.4m \u2013 well above the \u00a331.5m valuation he has given for the course and 19-bed hotel.

Last year\u2019s operating losses at Turnberry were \u00a38.4m. Trump lost a further \u00a32m in dollar-to-sterling currency exchanges, bringing total losses for Trump to \u00a310.5m last year. In 2014, he reports losing \u00a33.1m in currency transactions at Turnberry, bringing his total losses to \u00a36.7m in 2014. The result was an overall loss of \u00a326m.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Turnberry accounts state: \u201cThe group is dependent on continuing finance being made available by its ultimate owner to enable it to continue operating and to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\u201d The Aberdeenshire course accounts use almost identical wording.</p> <p>When he bought Turnberry, a world-famous links course with striking sea views on the coast of Ayrshire, in 2014, Trump boasted he would spend \u00a3200m on refurbishing the resort, to make it one of the world\u2019s most prestigious and attract Open championship tournaments. However, his new company accounts cast doubt on that spending claim.</p> <p>That work appeared to have been completed in June this year, when he officially reopened the 149-room five star hotel, complete with a new opulent ballroom, a \u00a33,500-a-night presidential suite and entrance-way fountain, and the newly extended and reorganised Ailsa golf course.</p> <p>But his company accounts show that by 31 December 2015, he had spent only \u00a362m on buying the resort, its running costs, and the upgrade and course reorganisation. </p> <p>The accounts show that his New York-based trust, the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, loaned his Turnberry holding company, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, \u00a342m in 2014 and \u00a321m in 2015. </p> <p>Of that, he is reported to have spent \u00a335m buying the business, implying that in order to meet his pledged refurbishment investment of \u00a3200m he needed to spend a further \u00a3138m in the first six months of this year. The accounts show that this investment only increased the value of Turnberry\u2019s physical assets by \u00a314.4m by the end of last year.</p> <p>He flew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">into Turnberry in June</a> on his own Trump-branded Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, and the accounts show the 12-seater aircraft was put on Turnberry\u2019s books in 2014 after he moved it from Florida to be permanently based in Scotland.</p> <p>His accounts show the aircraft was bought for just over \u00a31m, by transferring shares from Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd to his Delaware-registered firm DT Connect LLC, which had previously operated the Sikorsky from Palm Beach, Florida. However, the accounts also show the Scottish company valued the aircraft at just \u00a3269,000.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump\u2019s executives in the UK point out that both courses employ significant numbers of people \u2013 there are 337 on Turnberry\u2019s staff, earning a total of \u00a35.6m last year, and 95 in Aberdeenshire, earning \u00a32m in 2015. Trump has also spent tens of millions of pounds on local contractors. That spending has added to the Scottish economy.</p> <p>Turnover at both resorts rose last year. Despite the resort\u2019s closure for refurbishments in October last year, Turnberry\u2019s turnover increased by \u00a32.2m to \u00a311.4m in 2015 while the Aberdeenshire course turnover rose by a more modest amount, from \u00a32.8m to \u00a33m. Even so, the operating losses for TIGCS were close to \u00a31.1m, just a bit lower than its similar losses in 2014.</p> <p>In addition to using the continuing losses to avoid paying company tax at both resorts, the accounts show that he has other assets which would allow him to defer corporation tax if they became profitable in future. </p> <p>The accounts for Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd state he also has a potential deferred tax asset of \u00a37.9m but that asset is not recognised in the accounts \u201cas there is no certainty of taxable profits in the future\u201d. The Aberdeenshire course has a similar deferred tax asset said to be worth \u00a31.4m.</p> <p>At the second presidential debate in St Louis, Missouri, on Sunday night, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">acknowledged</a> that he used a $916m loss reported on his 1995 income tax returns to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\">avoid paying personal federal US income taxes for years</a>. \u201cOf course I do.

Families had fled the area hours before. Syrian troops and rebels had gouged holes in the walls of narrow-packed homes to use as rat-runs. As we stepped through the remains, cooking pots \u2013 some full of food \u2013 sat on stove tops and laundry hung on rails. There was something disconcerting about treading through the intimate worlds of strangers who, a little while earlier, had been going about their lives.</p> <p>Now these people were on the road to Turkey, joining tens of thousands of others whose lives had been upended. At a nearby intersection, not far from where the two sides faced off, strangers \u2013 non-Syrians \u2013 were instead arriving. Dressed in dishdashas and head shawls, some with leather ammunition belts strapped across their chests, a small number of Islamic fighters had come to join what to them was a holy war.</p> <p>The new arrivals were the vanguard of the jihadists, who, since May 2012, had started to travel to Syria and assemble in the countryside. They had turned up promising support to willing though underprepared rebel groups who could take the fight to the Assad regime, but faced a serious challenge in defeating it. The newcomers stood warily next to the rebel groups, several mocking the attempts of a band from a nearby town as they tried to shoot a hovering Syrian helicopter out of the sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8773b7f115a7e1a4a7ffeb20f08066d9b0768e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8773b7f115a7e1a4a7ffeb20f08066d9b0768e2/0_80_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wounded rebel fighter is carried to safety, October 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wounded rebel fighter is carried to safety, October 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zac Baillie/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou donkey!\u201d one of the jihadists screamed. \u201cGive the dushka [heavy weapon] to me.

Throughout the remainder of 2012, they were reinforced daily by others who had also journeyed across the porous Turkish border and had begun to change the tone of the war from nationalistic uprising into an ideological conflict that paid no heed to borders.</p> <p>The jihadists and the regular opposition were barely co-existing. \u201cWe have to accept them because they are coming to help us Islamically,\u201d said Sobhi Mohammed, a fighter from an Islamic unit at the time. \u201cBut we know they don\u2019t want what we want.\u201d Sobhi was based with his unit, all blue-collar workers from the satellite town of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/turkey-syria-offensive-each-party-is-fighting-its-own-war-kurds-us-isis\">al-Bab</a>, in the villa of a Syrian officer. With tank fire shuddering in the distance, the men tried to teach themselves to swim in a pea-soup coloured pool fenced by ceramic mermaids.</p> <p>Later that year, Sobhi was killed in a battle nearby. As the ranks of the jihadists grew, the rebels slowly thinned. So too did the few remaining residents of east Aleppo. Scud missiles started to rain down on the city in late 2012, gouging giant craters where whole neighbourhoods once stood. By early the following year, entire suburbs directly east of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/24/syria-war-citadel-aleppo-history-cities-buildings\">Aleppo\u2019s historic citadel </a>lay deserted. Airstrikes were happening almost daily. Sniper fire regularly crossed a lethal frontline between east and west. And the regime\u2019s vengeance towards those in the east was about to be showcased in other ways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"611e8bb9025a78da3e935e24747f047b3708d9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/611e8bb9025a78da3e935e24747f047b3708d9b7/0_214_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the bodies of the executed men dumped in the river, January 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the bodies of the executed men dumped in the river, January 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdullah al-Yassin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Massacre by the river</strong></h2> <p>In mid February 2013, I returned to Aleppo to investigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/mar/11/syria-bodies-river-aleppo-massacre\">the discovery of more than 100 bodies on a river bank</a>. All had been shot in the head, and dumped in the river. As flood waters had receded, they had exposed the fate of the men, who had all been detained as they crossed the frontline. Many had commuted between the two sides for work. Others needed to travel to the west for official business \u2013 there were no longer government offices in the east. For more than a week, locals fished the bodies out of the river, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/29/syrian-rebels-bodies-aleppo-canal\">erecting nets and grills to trap them as they washed down</a>. Families in the eastern area of Bustan al-Qasr all confirmed that their husbands, fathers, sons and cousins had disappeared at checkpoints. Most had been held in regime prisons.</p> <p>Even darker days were soon to follow. In April that year, the jihadists who had lurked with intent announced that they were now in charge, subverting the myriad opposition groups \u2013 and their cause \u2013 in the name of a global jihad. The Islamic State (Isis) had unveiled itself after a year long Trojan horse act of hiding in plain sight. A ruthless elimination of rival power bases followed, along with the imposition of an unflinching Islamic order. The front of the eye hospital, the rebel base at the start of the war, was painted black. The standards of the jihadists were planted everywhere. Streets were even emptier, women rarely seen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 100 men had been shot in the head and dumped in the river, the flood waters receding to expose their fate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the rest of 2013, east Aleppo was one of the most dangerous places on earth. In September, I visited again, this time under the escort of a member of a rebel group from al-Bab that was convinced it could ward off Isis. The east had been whittled down even further. Civic services had all but stopped. Local volunteers gathered rubbish and burned it on an enormous noxious heap near the south of the town. Medical aid was scarce, but still the hospital system was getting by.</p> <p>Outside one hospital, down the hill from Saif al-Dawla, a clapped-out ambulance sat at an odd angle on a footpath matted with blood and a filthy pile of white burial shrouds. Above them, on a small ledge, lay a dead infant girl, wrapped in a pink towel and left anonymously. She stayed there for most of the day, exhausted medics dealing with the rush of the dying before they tended to her.</p> <p>Outside the eye hospital, a lone Isis fighter sat on the back of a pickup truck with a heavy machine gun pointed at the sky. The jihadists were expecting US jets at the time. None arrived, but Syrian helicopters soon did, dropping improvised explosives packed into barrels over what remained of the eastern suburbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb4be1c39939203a65977b47ba4f127780918aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb4be1c39939203a65977b47ba4f127780918aa/0_260_5330_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child wounded in a Russian airstrike, October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child wounded in a Russian airstrike, October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A deserted wasteland</strong></h2> <p>By early the following year, Aleppo had devolved even further. In January, rebel groups who had been sidelined by Isis for the previous nine months, turned their guns on the extremists, ousting them first from the city and then from the countryside. Isis retreated to al-Bab, which has since remained its most western position in Syria. The city, or what remained of it, was once again accessible, but this time under the noses of regime troops who had all but encircled the east.</p> <p>A small gap, called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/syrian-regime-is-blocking-aid-from-entering-eastern-aleppo-claims-un\">Castello Road</a>, remained open to the north. It led to an industrial zone that used to be a central driver of Syria\u2019s economy, but is now a wasteland of fallen silos and factories that have been repeatedly crunched with heavy bombs. The road was one of the most menacing strips in Syria. And once through it, the devastation of east Aleppo was almost overwhelming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/future-wars-horrific-aleppo-war-zones-medical-facilities-un\">If we don't act now, all future wars may be as horrific as Aleppo  | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Near the city\u2019s outskirts, no one remained, except for small groups of rebels with radios who kept tabs on pro-regime militia forces gathering beyond the city limits. Three hospitals that had been functioning on our last visit had been destroyed by airstrikes. Much of the northern city had been emptied. Long sweeping boulevards that channelled commuter traffic were silent and sinister.</p> <p>The Old City, however, had remained a sanctuary. Here, market life went on. Butchers hung carcasses just out of reach of starving cats, and Turkish confectionery was piled alongside traditional Syrian sweet stalls. The cobblestoned roads were almost a safe zone for fighters and the remaining residents of east Aleppo. Here they could congregate as they always had, ignoring jets that mostly dropped their bombs elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4142796da2173d249bc142fd01a66d9d21e2304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4142796da2173d249bc142fd01a66d9d21e2304/0_127_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man sits in the rubble of a damaged buildings after losing relatives in an airstrike, October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man sits in the rubble of a damaged buildings after losing relatives in an airstrike, October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The illusion lasted only half a mile though, where it ended in the enormous pile of rubble that marked a frontline. Here, Abu Assad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/aleppos-most-wanted-man-rebel-leader-tunnel-bombs\">one of the original rebels of the countryside</a>, had led a team of tunnel diggers, who had burrowed under regime lines and blown up a hotel on the edge of the Citadel. Nothing was left of the building, and the enormous blast had damaged the wall of the Citadel itself. The war that was supposed to spare Aleppo\u2019s ancient core had crept closer than ever.</p> <h2><strong>Jets prowl the sky</strong></h2> <p>In December 2014, I returned to the city for the last time. Finding residents in the east was difficult. Those who had stayed this long had no plans to leave. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/-sp-female-medic-aleppo-syria-war-umm-abdu\">Umm Abdu, a wedding dress seamstress turned nurse was one of them.</a> She made her way from the Old City to a nearby hospital, a pistol strapped to her waist as she patched up fighters and civilians. She had lost a husband and a son in the relentless war. Everyone she knew had at least one tragic story. East Aleppo had no electricity and little running water. This time the road out of the city took us along muddy tracks gouged through farmland. A sand berm sheltered the road from sniper fire, and jets prowled the sky.</p> <p>It has been all but impossible to reach east Aleppo in the year and a half since, a time in which the divided city\u2019s agony has grown even worse. The Russian blitz has relentlessly targeted what remains of its basic services. Only two hospitals and two smaller clinics are still functioning and only 11 ambulances still service them. Umm Abdu has left Aleppo, and few of the others I met along the way have stayed behind. The Russian-led assault has demolished the east, and pro-regime militias are poised to move in. After 3,000 years, Aleppo is on its knees.</p>",

Here is just a sampling:</p> <h2>\u2018I wish someone had showed it to me years ago\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I was in my 50s, I used a mirror to look at what was down there, feeling at the same time a great sense of guilt and wrong-doing! Catholic conditioning on sin and shame decided my attitude to my body for most of my life.</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018I showed it to my kids\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I love my mom a lot, but to this day, I think she is still uncomfortable with conversations about sex or female anatomy. I have two girls, ages 9 and 12. I\u2019ve already given them \u2018the talk\u2019 years ago, and they know there\u2019s nothing off-limits to talk about with regards to reproduction. We are just on the edge of talking about sex for pleasure. I want them to feel empowered sexually as they grow up and to feel very comfortable with their bodies. I\u2019m going to show them this video today. There might be some giggling, but also some learning!</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018I showed it to my partner\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I sent this to my wife right away, because it felt like very important education for everyone.<br></p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018I\u2019d never seen other people\u2019s vulvas before\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have always been horribly self-conscious of my whole body and still haven\u2019t come to terms with the changes that happened to it since I gave birth to my son \u2013 over 14 years ago! I still feel embarrassed and ashamed because it all looks so different down there and it makes me feel ugly and like a freak. I\u2019ve never seen any other female genitalia (except for the minimalist line drawings in high school textbooks and tampon leaflets), so I didn\u2019t know it was normal to not be all \u2018tight and tidy\u2019 like the pictures.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018<strong tabindex=\"-1\">Autocorrect doesn\u2019t even KNOW the word clitoris (or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianUs/videos/1469822689711460/?comment_id=1471453929548336&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\">vulva</a>)\u2019</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am writing this email on my Amazon Kindle. Autocorrect changed [it to] the word California (see!) California ... It happened FOUR TMES then happened again as you can see above, even after I added the word c l I t o r I s to the dictionary. The only way I can write the word is to put a space between each letter. So ... let\u2019s try to write the word penis. Oh, look at that; no problem with the word penis.</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018Where\u2019s all the hair?\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This was so illuminating. I was distressed, however, to hear that so many young women are feeling the need to get surgery on their labia b/c it doesn\u2019t fit the \u2018aesthetic\u2019 out there. This reminds me of all these girls/women shaving their pubic hair \u2013 and is this (like the surgery) most probably for men? In any case, I learned so much today. I didn\u2019t even know where my pee hole was before I took the test! </p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m a man, but I think I can relate\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m a man, 50 now, who has had issues around size since I was at boarding school. I had a penis enlargement when I was about 32. Didn\u2019t work. Through healthy honest relationships, experience, therapy, [and] men\u2019s work, I came to accept my penis ... and also slowly gained an idea of what was \u2018normal\u2019.

  "<p>Bad news if you were planning a winter vacation to Mars: new research has shown that the 225m km trip to the Red Planet won\u2019t just give you bad jet lag \u2013 it\u2019ll probably fry your brain. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34774#introduction\">The study</a>, published in Scientific Reports,<em> </em>has found that the levels of cosmic radiation travellers to Mars would be exposed to could lead to brain damage, anxiety and chronic dementia.</p> <p>This is somewhat unfortunate as the US is currently fixated on getting to Mars in the next two decades. Last year, Nasa released its three-step plan for the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/journey-to-mars-next-steps-20151008_508.pdf\">Journey to Mars</a>, which anticipated that America would be sending humans to Mars by the 2030s. Barack Obama <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/opinions/america-will-take-giant-leap-to-mars-barack-obama/index.html\">reiterated</a> this timeline in an op-ed for CNN on Tuesday, explaining that getting to Mars is a cooperative effort between the government and private corporations: \u201cMore than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/11/obama-mars-mission-nasa-habitats-space-travel-2030\">Barack Obama revives call to put humans on Mars by the 2030s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the idea of a trip to space or landing on the Mars is all very exciting \u2013 though it\u2019s -90F and covered with dust \u2013 I can\u2019t help think that perhaps we\u2019d all do better if we kept our feet on the ground. In September, the world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/the-world-passes-400ppm-carbon-dioxide-threshold-permanently\">passed</a> the symbolic 400ppm carbon threshold; scientists say carbon dioxide levels are unlikely to return below this during our lifetimes. The last time there was this much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 3m years ago when modern humans didn\u2019t exist. We\u2019re living in a new and unpredictable world. </p> <p>Heading to Mars might further fry the planet as well as your brain. Nobody really knows the environmental cost of space travel, but some scientists have raised concerns of a serious black carbon problem. A <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19626-space-tourism-could-have-big-impact-on-climate/\">2010 study</a> found that black carbon emissions from space travel would cause warming at the poles, which is not good news for the Arctic or Antarctica. Or the world. <br></p> <p>However, this study is not conclusive, and the industry repeatedly stresses that space travel poses little threat to the environment. Virgin Galactic has even said that a suborbital space trip is more environmentally friendly than a flight from New York to London. The bottom line, though, is that no one really knows how space travel will affect the earth at the moment. But if refrigerators pose an environmental threat, it doesn\u2019t seem to be such a great leap to think that enormous rockets might also.</p> <p>It could be that with all this doom and gloom I\u2019m missing the pros of getting to Mars. It\u2019s one of the more slimming planets; if you weigh 150lb on Earth, you\u2019d be a mere 57lb on Mars. So you\u2019d be skinny, but you\u2019d also have dementia and probably severe red dust allergies.</p> <p>The real point of space travel, however, is Progress! Taking science to the final frontier, expanding our horizons, etc. However, I can\u2019t help but think that all of this is just ego dressed up as starry-eyed romanticism. In his op-ed, Obama writes: \u201cWe\u2019ve flown by every planet in the solar system \u2013 something no other nation can say.\u201d OK, cool. But people in Flint, Michigan, don\u2019t have clean water to drink. Can we just calm down for a second about super galactic fly-bys and reassess our priorities?<br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just national ego that\u2019s playing a part in the amazing race to Mars. Billionaire tech founders are competing against each other to get to Mars first, and they\u2019re literally comparing the size of each other\u2019s rockets. Jeff Bezos\u2019s latest rocket is apparently taller than Elon Musk\u2019s. However, Musk\u2019s rocket <a href=\"http://www.space.com/34058-jeff-bezos-elon-musk-giant-rockets-rivalry.html\">is reportedly</a> more powerful, \u201cgenerating 5.1m pounds of thrust\u201d. Meanwhile, Boeing reckons its rocket is best of all. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,\u201d Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-04/boeing-ceo-vows-to-beat-musk-to-mars-as-new-space-race-beckons\">said recently.</a></p> <p>Then you\u2019ve got the 1% who aren\u2019t making rockets and simply want to be the first in their group of friends to post an Instagram of themselves relaxing on Mars \u2013 #redplanetbeachday \u2013 or taking a day trip to space. Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Katy Perry are just some of the celebrities who have already paid a $250,000 deposit and signed up for a suborbital space trip on Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic.</p> <p>The world is facing a very real climate crisis, and yet some of the best minds of our generation our focusing their efforts on getting to Mars. When we do eventually get there, who knows what the state of our planet will be? Our efforts to explore the universe may no longer be a giant leap for mankind, but a step back for Earth.</p>",
  "<p>Two forces are sending shockwaves through the world of storytelling. The first is that digital technology now offers creative artists myriad platforms to tell their stories in new ways. \u201cWe are using code as the canvas,\u201d says Charles Melcher, book publisher and founder of the inaugural <a href=\"https://futureofstorytelling.org/\">Future of Storytelling festival</a>. In other words, whatever you can dream up, today\u2019s advanced software capabilities can make it happen. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e465809c904af47f5ba454a8f8413e8c8e71cd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e465809c904af47f5ba454a8f8413e8c8e71cd2/0_0_2448_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Experimenting with shifts in the authorship and ownership of stories\u2019: Sherlock Holmes and the Internet of Things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Experimenting with shifts in the authorship and ownership of stories\u2019: Sherlock Holmes and the Internet of Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Digital Storytelling Lab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, a younger, digital-savvy audience now wants to drive the narrative from start to finish. Lance Weiler, director of the Digital Storytelling Lab at Columbia University, discovered this first-hand through his work on <a href=\"http://2016.sherlockholmes.io/welcome/\">Sherlock Holmes and the Internet of Things</a>, an online global detective narrative collaboration. The Lab set up a crime scene and provided clues to solve a murder, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The participants wanted to imagine the crime and write the clues themselves. \u201cA new creator class is rising up,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s challenging the authorship and ownership of stories.\u201d</p> <p>The FoST festival, which ran from 7-9 October in New York, showcased the extraordinary range of work emerging as a result, bringing together leading storytellers from the worlds of gaming, theatre, film, publishing, television and virtual reality (VR). In a Harlem warehouse \u2013 imagine Charlie Kaufman\u2019s Synecdoche, New York meets The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus \u2013 a cornucopia of interactive experiences beckoned. I wandered between real and imaginary worlds, as if dreaming while awake \u2013 from acting a part in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=romB8e5nMp8\">Star Trek: Bridge Crew</a>, to entering the curious and desolate world of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoJLZ2u_Asg\">SENS VR</a>, the first graphic novel to get VR treatment. Participating in a collective immersive session in the 30-person VR theatre, I even pondered the nature of free will while inhabiting the mind of an android re-creation of Philip K Dick, in the 360-film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwNVKDOniQU\">I, Philip</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/samsung-thinks-the-future-of-childrens-bedtime-is-virtual-reality-stories\">Samsung thinks the 'future of children's bedtime' is virtual reality stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The experiences that most captured my imagination were those that brought me into the world of the characters and allowed me to influence the story. We say we \u201center the minds of characters\u201d when we read books, but role-playing in immersive worlds, such as VR narratives or theatre, takes that sense of immediacy to a whole other level: the narrative feels like something you actually experience. Speaking at the FoST Festival, Beau Lotto, neuroscientist at <a href=\"https://ripple.com/\">Ripple</a>, <a href=\"http://www.labofmisfits.com/\">Lab of Misfits</a> and development studio The Chinese Room, explains the satisfaction of being in the driver\u2019s shoes as \u201cthe Ikea effect\u201d. \u201cIf you put effort into something, you perceive a higher value.\u201d Felix Barrett, artistic director at Punchdrunk theatre company that makes the immersive show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/31/sleep-no-more-avant-garde-theatre-new-york\">Sleep No More</a>, agrees; as immersive narrative VR experiences become more commonplace, theatrical experience is becoming more about audience empowerment: \u201cThey own their night \u2026 it\u2019s their narrative.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"058612f6120f2c14fd668cb23d56424cd5c65648\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/058612f6120f2c14fd668cb23d56424cd5c65648/0_5_529_317/500.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Sleep No More.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Sleep No More.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Punchdrunk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Creating a feeling of agency is no simple task, and today\u2019s narrative architects employ sophisticated game mechanics and crafty tricks to make decision-making feel fluid and natural for the user. \u201cToo much agency and the story won\u2019t have a good arc,\u201d says Barrett. Audiences can choose their route and tempo, but there are anchor points and the finale must deliver: \u201cThere is the illusion of agency, but they are on rails.\u201d This nuanced approach suggests we are entering a sophisticated new era in which the exchange between author and participant creates a better outcome for both, leaving questionable author-fan collaborations of the past behind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/03/pixar-virtual-reality-storytelling-ed-catmull\">Pixar co-founder warns virtual-reality moviemakers: 'It's not storytelling'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be successful in this emerging genre, storytellers, especially those moving from traditional roles in publishing, television and film, will need to adapt, in particular by learning new methods of collaborating with users and the new languages of VR technologies. Dan Pinchbeck, creative director at The Chinese Room, points out that already in the gaming industry there is no single writer churning out a plot; what is most important is the focus on developing complex characters, as that offers greater possibilities in a branching, emergent narrative. In <a href=\"http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/games/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/\">Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture</a>, a game about the end of the world, the writers focused on creating compelling characters. The end of the world became the least interesting thing about it; what mattered was how the characters dealt with it. </p> <p>At Apelab, a studio currently working on <a href=\"http://apelab.ch/sequenced/\">Sequenced</a> \u2013 an episodic adventure where the story adapts in real time depending on where you look and focus \u2013 they begin with paper, pencils and role-playing. Apelab\u2019s founder, Emilie Joly, says that very early on in the creative process they thought about interactivity and how the narrative was going to be directed by the user, as well as where the user was going to be in space. Early experience testing is also important. While working on <a href=\"http://www.baobabstudios.com/\">Invasion</a>!, an immersive VR short film, the team at Baobab Studios did a lot of early prototype testing. Decisions including bringing a spaceship in above the user, with only the sound behind, didn\u2019t have the desired effect. But once a key character \u2013 a cute big-eyed bunny \u2013 looked up at the spaceship, 99% of the audience turned around. It has never been more important to understand how audiences experience and react to the interactive world you are trying to create. As Kane Lee, head of content at Baobab Studios, says: \u201cIt\u2019s about letting go of your ego \u2026 letting the user help you navigate.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/feb/23/video-games-writers-novelists\">Virtual reality needs real writers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As exciting as it is to work with diverse technologies and audiences in new ways, almost everyone speaking at FoST festival agreed that the story should always come first, then the technology. \u201cStories can have many different platforms to live in, but it\u2019s important to figure out which is the right medium for the story,\u201d said Melcher, who decided to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/nyregion/storytelling-in-the-virtual-age-at-fost-fest.html\">move to the storytelling business</a> when his book publishing enterprise stalled. At the end of the day, agrees David Eisenman, producer of Google Spotlight Stories, his main priority is to work with great storytellers and collaborators. As content creators increasingly cede control, the need for expert storytellers has never been greater.</p> <h2>Three digital experiences to look out for</h2> <p><br><strong>Late Shift<br></strong>Watching the <a href=\"http://lateshift-movie.com\">Late Shift</a> teaser at FoST festival, I joined an audience of people collectively deciding the fate of the protagonist, a car park attendant whose night gets interesting when he\u2019s coerced, at gun point, into helping a dubious character escape in a stolen car. With smartphones in hand, the majority vote decides the character\u2019s fate, while the film keeps running seamlessly. I\u2019m surprised to find that my choices are often in the majority, pushing the protagonist into greater and greater peril. Should I admit that my enjoyment rises as his situation deteriorates? It isn\u2019t hard to imagine, as the full feature story progresses, that the stakes will be raised with every new decision, and, concomitant with my role in influencing the outcome, my investment in the story.</p> <p><strong>The Abbot\u2019s Book<br></strong>When it comes to the best way to experience a 3D or 4D narrative, many storytellers are gravitating towards the first person perspective. For the team at Blackthorn Media working on <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/434430/\">The Abbot\u2019s Book</a>, featured at the Sundance film festival\u2019s New Frontier program this year, the whole reason to do VR came into focus when they put the user into the protagonist\u2019s shoes. \u201cThe most forward-looking way, the best way to jump into this world, was to literally put on a second skin and be different characters in the story,\u201d says Michael Conelly, creative director at the LA-based VR start-up. The Abbot\u2019s Book is an immersive VR narrative series based on a gothic novella by the same name, written by Conelly in 1989. I demoed it with the handheld controllers of the HTC Vive in their LA offices and was as enthralled by the mysterious magic of the world as I was by my mission: to explore the ancient catacombs below the ruins of an 18th-century abbey and uncover the horror of the ancient pagan religion contained within.</p> <p><strong>1979 Revolution: Black Friday<br></strong>In this choice-driven narrative game set in Tehran, and based on true stories and historical events, you are thrown into the turmoil of a real-life revolution and must make vital choices in the fight to survive. Playing Reza, an aspiring photojournalist during an uprising against the ruling king, the user\u2019s choices subtly shape the narrative and the fates of characters around them. I demoed a six-minute section of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://inkstories.com/1979revolutiongame/#quotesandtrailer\">the game</a> on an iPad at the FoST festival and was immediately drawn in by the realistic characters, beautiful CGI graphics and documentary-style narrative. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_50OJ1uuGoc\">With 19 chapters to explore</a>, new storytelling forms like this can be vital \u2013 bringing diverse stories about the world to new audiences and allowing us the rare opportunity to experience life through someone else\u2019s eyes.</p>",

But there\u2019s the opposite side of that too: an&#xa0;incredible togetherness, loyalty, support&#xa0;when people are going through personal problems. An emotional openness between men that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect.</p> <p>The insults and the bragging have a part to play in that. You need to have the ability to release the pressure, as you spend so much time together. And it can help to build relationships \u2013 but only if it stays within bounds, otherwise it can destroy the very thing you\u2019re trying to reinforce.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be racist or sexist or homophobic \u2013 there are other ways of making your mark. And that\u2019s partly where the bragging comes in. People project a persona to protect their image and vulnerabilities. Why did Trump say what he said? He was trying to impress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/billy-bush-donald-trump-lewd-comments-tape-arianne-zucker\" title=\"\">Billy Bush</a>. It\u2019s that ego thing.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve never known the level of conversation to descend to the level of what Trump said. Derogatory comments are made \u2013 they\u2019re not acceptable \u2013 but I\u2019ve never heard women spoken about in such a predatory way. People would have objected. Loudly.</p> <p>Maybe 50 years ago, when Trump was young, that was the language used. But there\u2019s been a huge shift in locker-room culture even since I started playing. Just look at the way issues around race have been tackled. A lot of that has been down to the diversity in the dressing room. But society has far less tolerance of that kind of language, and people have become much more aware of when the bounds of acceptability are crossed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/11/donald-trump-shackles-are-off-republicans-election-2016\">Trump declares: the shackles are off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My era was that of Justin Fashanu and the horrible homophobic abuse he suffered. I experienced some of it myself \u2013 apparently in part because I read the Guardian. People in the locker room weren\u2019t saying those things because they thought I was actually gay: they knew I wasn\u2019t. It was that put-down style of humour taken to an unpleasant extreme. In their eyes it wasn\u2019t homophobic because I wasn\u2019t gay. But in the process they were being incredibly derogatory.</p> <p>At the time I didn\u2019t even have the support within my own dressing room \u2013 it was just seen as name-calling. I wonder, if I had been gay, would they have still used that type of abuse? Would it have then crossed their line, beyond just winding people up, and made them aware of the damage that is caused by that sort of language? Regardless, that sort of thing 100% would not happen now. I\u2019m involved with the FA working on areas of equality, and it is treated so differently today. The gay community, and players, have far more protection. And we shouldn\u2019t forget that the locker-room is far from a male-only place. Women play sport too, Donald.</p> <p>One of the reasons I find Trump\u2019s excuse so offensive is that he\u2019s presuming the culture of the locker room is the same as what goes on in his brain, the culture he finds acceptable in his ivory tower. The dressing room hasn\u2019t been anything close to that for a long time, and it was never as bad as the vile language that came out of his mouth. I\u2019ve never experienced in all my time in football anybody who would ever think what he said would be something to laugh at or brag about. It\u2019s so extreme.</p> <p>The reaction on both sides of the Atlantic has proved the point that you can\u2019t be flippant with abusive language and then just try to brush it off as part of a culture you know nothing about.</p>",
  "<p>The government must give the UK a confidence boost about the future of major infrastructure projects or we risk losing momentum, according to transport experts at a Guardian roundtable event. The issue, they agreed, is at the heart of making the UK\u2019s transport systems more intelligent and responsive, in a political environment where Brexit negotiations, regional devolution deals, the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement and the modern transport bill all loom large.</p> <h2>Political confidence in future transport</h2> <p>The government\u2019s full intent on transport infrastructure remains to be seen, though panelists at the event said they felt encouraged by the rhetoric. \u201cWe must hold our nerve and invest in transport for the future regardless,\u201d said Nigel Foster, strategy director for Transport for the North (TfN). He said it would be crucial to get the powers to create a statutory northern transport body, something TfN is setting its sights on for 2017. \u201cThis would give the north a single voice on strategic transport issues and the ability to make decisions locally on how to invest in transport.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"acaf57540ce59b381a5d0351f74823ee1d225128\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acaf57540ce59b381a5d0351f74823ee1d225128/0_6_4097_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roundtable discussion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The roundtable discussion took place during the Labour party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Fallon photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others round the table agreed a long term investment plan was necessary to build a confidence in the future for transport. Philipa Oldham, head of transport and manufacturing at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, emphasised that only by having that long term commitment would people train for transport industries. Meanwhile, Clare Cornes, transport strategist at Transport for Greater Manchester, voiced concerns about a skills gap in areas such as engineering and said efforts were being made to work closely with higher and further education bodies to address this in the region. <br></p> <p>Joshua Hardie, deputy director-general of the Confederation of Business Industry, said many CBI members had voiced a need for reassurances from the government that there are solid plans in place, particularly with the \u201cspectre of Brexit hanging over us\u201d. Agreeing with Hardie, Jason Pavey, local transport director at Atkins, said too much stop-and-start over transport plans would mean losing people from the industry. \u201cTo plan for the future we need long term certainty, and I don\u2019t think at the moment we have it.\u201d </p> <p>The panel did proffer examples of more long-term thinking. Heathrow airport, for instance, is working with local schools to develop Mandarin speakers, in anticipation of a third runway in 2025 which will increase services to China, according to Nigel Milton, director of external affairs at Heathrow. Another example is a <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/lord-blunkett-to-head-up-heathrow-skills-taskforce-34842747.html\">taskforce</a>, to be chaired by Lord David Blunkett, will look at the skills needed if the third Heathrow runway goes ahead, he said. </p> <h2>Passenger-focused transport </h2> <p>The panel agreed that passengers on different modes of transport are not interested in who runs it \u2013 they just want it to work, so sector collaboration is vital. \u201cWorking together and moving away from a mindset that we are all different entities is key,\u201d said Pavey. \u201cThe focus should always be on the public, and we can use data to create more intelligent mobility.\u201d He added that he was heartened to see the partnerships happening in the north. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d56ac7e480eeab748ba2f5b23b410b4ab70c8903\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d56ac7e480eeab748ba2f5b23b410b4ab70c8903/0_154_3664_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Foster, Philipa Oldham, Hannah Randle and Jason Pavey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Foster, Philipa Oldham, Hannah Randle, public affairs manager of the Rail Delivery Group and Jason Pavey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Fallon Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaign for Better Transport spends a lot of time talking to passengers. Laura Tomlinson, head of corporate partnerships at the organisation, said the conversation invariably comes back to being able to use different modes of transport easily, across different networks, using a single payment method. \u201cThe biggest issue we hear about is journeys on buses run by different networks,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t work properly in terms of timings, how they\u2019re paid for and how complex it is. Bus operators are not working together. Administrative boundaries mean bus services terminate in the middle of nowhere and it puts people off using public transport.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Everett, chief strategy officer at Transport Systems Catapult, said there could be no integrated transport while the sector was still focused on different modes of transport. Sharing data would help but, as Milton pointed out, the data commercial companies have on their passengers is valuable. \u201cGetting airlines to share data on their passenger\u2019s onward journeys so we can work with coaches or taxis is proving to be extraordinarily difficult,\u201d he said, adding that although it may take time, some organisations agencies are already seeing the advantages for their customers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Technology and new kills</h2> <p>Ultimately, Cornes pointed out, the technology to make transport systems more intelligent is just a tool. The ultimate aim is to give people integrated mobility and simple fares. Hardie agreed: \u201cTechnology is so exciting but we need to get the basics right and make sure there is trust between the passengers sharing data and the commercial organisations using it. We need to use data for the nuts and bolts of travel like making sure people have transparency on fares and which journeys will be simplest and cheapest.\u201d </p> <p>The panel agree that to build intelligent mobility will require a big shift. \u201cWe will need a whole raft of different skill sets beyond the traditional science, technology, engineering and maths skills for transport systems of the future; such as systems engineers, software developers and human-computer interaction skills,\u201d said Everett. \u201cIf we don\u2019t think about it now we will be left behind.\u201d<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong></p> <h2>On the panel:</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Clare Cornes</strong>, transport strategist, Transport for Greater Manchester</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Andrew Everett,</strong> chief strategy officer, Transport Systems Catapult</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nigel Foster</strong>, strategy director, Transport for the North<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Joshua Hardie,</strong> deputy director-general, CBI</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Jason Pavey</strong>, local transport director, Atkins</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nigel Milton,</strong> director of external affairs, Heathrow</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Philipa Oldham</strong>, head of transport and manufacturing, Institution of Mechanical Engineer </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Hannah Randle</strong>, public affairs manager, Rail Delivery Group</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Laura Tomlinson</strong>, Corporate partnerships, Campaign for Better Transport</li> </ul> <p><em>The discussion, which took place 27 September \u2013 during the Labour party conference \u2013 was sponsored by Atkins.</em></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",

  "<p> After a second exciting performance for the national team, and a second goal in two matches, Julian Green is \u201cback in the picture\u201d, according to J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/11/jurgen-klinsmann-jockeying-bradley-usa\">Klinsmann insists he wasn't jockeying for Bradley's US job: 'It simply isn't true'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green, who got USA\u2019s goal against Cuba on Friday, opened the scoring against New Zealand in their friendly match in Washington on Tuesday night, before Monty Patterson\u2019s equalizer forced the hosts to settle for a 1-1 draw. </p> <p>\u201cJulian Green is back in the picture,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cHe scored another nice goal today but overall he\u2019s becoming more mature, he\u2019s becoming stronger, he\u2019s far more confident. It\u2019s really nice to see his development.\u201d</p> <p>Sunderland\u2019s Lynden Gooch, who made his USA debut as a second-half substitute, also impressed the coach.</p> <p>The 1-1 draw represents USA\u2019s last action before they open their final round of World Cup qualifying against Mexico on 11 November. \u201cWe wanted to get some answers to a couple of things toward the Mexico clash a month from now,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cAnd I think we found a couple very interesting answers.\u201d</p> <p>Green scored his third goal for USA in just his eighth appearance. He\u2019s seldom featured in the past couple of years, after making a splash in the 2014 World Cup, where he scored a late goal in extra time in the last-16 defeat by Belgium.</p> <p>But Green, another of USA\u2019s German Americans, earned an invite to Klinsmann\u2019s camp after repeatedly making the 18-man squad for Bayern Munich this season. \u201cI\u2019m really happy about it,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s my goal to always be here in this team, and when I\u2019m here I want to give my best. And I think I did very well.\u201d</p> <p>After scoring the second goal against Cuba, Green put his side ahead in the 27th minute, when his 18-yard shot sneaked between goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic, who was wrong-footed, and the left post. \u201cI think for Julian it\u2019s just a maturing process,\u201d Klinsmann said of Green. \u201cHe\u2019s still very, very young. I think he learned a lot under Pep Guardiola and he learns a lot under [Carlo] Ancelotti. They\u2019re very, very good coaches and it\u2019s his job to be a sponge and learn from them.\u201d</p> <p>Klinsmann said: \u201cHe wants to break into that team [Bayern]. He wants to get minutes there and he has people like Rib\u00e9ry and Robben in front of him. But the way he presented himself these 10 days from the first training session on, where we said \u2018ooh\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cHe made a big step forward. I think it just becomes more personality. When you deal with [players] that age you have to give them their up and downs and just hope that they mature one day at a time.\u201d</p> <p>New Zealand equalised in the 72nd minute, when Altidore failed to clear a corner, and Patterson popped up to thump the loose ball into the net from about five yards.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they start throwing more numbers at us and they start in some ways becoming even more direct and more desperate, that combined with some subs on both sides just means that the game becomes hectic,\u201d said USA captain Michael Bradley. \u201cWe gave away a bad goal, and ultimately that\u2019s the difference between winning and tying.\u201d</p> <p>Gooch, the 20-year-old who has appeared seven times this season for Sunderland of England\u2019s Premier League, came on in the 59th minute.

This year that expanded to 12 markets across Europe.</p> <p>Next year Hutton revealed that Eurosport will broadcast Wimbledon to in excess of 25 markets, and he is aiming to expand the relationship further.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe there are things we can do in the build up like the [Wimbledon] qualifiers, the juniors [Wimbledon tournament] or disabled players. I hope we can talk to Wimbledon and ask how we can deepen that relationship in the UK and other markets if there is space. I think they saw we offered something that didn\u2019t hurt the BBC and that is important.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Two leading civil rights organizations are calling for the complete decriminalization of personal drug use in the US in a comprehensive new report released on Wednesday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/12/every-25-seconds/human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states\">report</a>, published by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch, concluded that last year someone was arrested every 25 seconds on drug use or possession charges. </p> <p>The research catalogues the enforcement of laws that criminalize personal drug use, for which police make more arrests than any other crime. The organizations\u2019 stand is one of the most forceful yet in the ongoing conversation about the country\u2019s sprawling criminal justice system and the lasting effect that low-level drug offenses can have on Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/15/lee-carroll-brooker-alabama-marijuana-sentence\">Supreme court considers taking case of man given life in prison for growing pot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is first time both organizations have come together and made such a strong call for [decriminalization],\u201d said Tess Borden, the report\u2019s author.</p> <p>The report, titled Every 25 Seconds, after the frequency of drug arrests, looks specifically at personal drug use, and not trafficking or other drug crimes. Last year, more than 1.25 million arrests were made by local law enforcement for drug use or possession alone, and about half of those were for marijuana use or possession, according to the report. </p> <p>Tyler Marshall, a Louisiana man who spoke to Human Rights Watch using a pseudonym, was charged with marijuana possession in 2015 and sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty. The report quotes court transcripts of Marshall entering his guilty plea, as most drug cases are resolved. After Marshall\u2019s defense attorney instructs him to plea guilty, he tells the court: \u201cOh, I have to? Yeah. But I\u2019d be lying though.\u201d</p> <p>The large majority of drug cases are resolved through plea deals. In New York, for example, the report found that 99.8% of adults convicted of drug possession in a five-year period accepted plea deals.</p> <p>Marshall told Human Rights Watch that his wife has a disability, and was two months behind on rent without him to help support her. \u201cMy wife, I cook for her, clean for her, bathe her, clothe her,\u201d he said. \u201cNow everything is on her, from the rent to the bills, everything.\u201d</p> <p>The rate of drug arrests varies widely by state, although data indicates that non-marijuana drug use is largely consistent throughout the country.</p> <p>As with other areas of the criminal justice system, arrest data for personal drug crimes shows a sharp racial disparity. According to the report\u2019s findings, black adults are two and a half times as likely as white adults to be arrested for drug possession. Borden said the report was unable to analyze any disparities in arrest rates for Latinos because the FBI does not track data for Latinos arrested. </p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/un-special-session-global-drug-policy-failure-critics-say\">policy experts</a> and international groups, including the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/23/who-drug-decriminalization_n_5606609.html\">World Health Organization</a>, have called for the complete decriminalization of personal drug use. Several states have already decriminalized marijuana, with five more set to vote on the issue in November. Borden said the organizations\u2019 call for complete decriminalization \u201ctakes the mainstream drug conversation a step further\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve driven drug use underground with criminalization and we\u2019ve failed to provide communities who are dealing and struggling with dependence issues the help and the treatment that they have a right to,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Arrest data also indicates that people charged with drug possessions are often carrying just trace amounts of an illicit substance, according to the report. </p> <p>Among the other case studies highlighted by Borden is that of Matthew Russell, who was arrested in Texas for an amount of methamphetamines so small that the lab technician described it as a \u201ctrace\u201d amount and couldn\u2019t give the amount a precise measurement.</p> <p>In March Russell, who maintains his innocence, faced 20 years for the possession charges because of previous felony convictions. Russell, who also used a pseudonym, said the previous convictions were also related to his drug dependence.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so stressed out that some days it almost makes me want to kill myself \u2026 [20 years,] that scares me,\u201d he told Human Rights Watch.<br></p> <p>In August, Russell was sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p>",
  "<p>The deadly protests that have rocked Ethiopia over the past several months, resulting in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/ethiopia-declares-state-of-emergency-as-deadly-protests-continue\" title=\"\">declaration of a six-month state of emergency</a>, stem from many regional and national grievances, most of which reflect a sense of economic and political marginalisation by wide sections of the country.</p> <p>The unrest in the south dates back to November 2015, when demonstrators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/11/ethiopia-protests-master-plan-addis-ababa-students\" title=\"\">opposed a government plan</a> to expand the boundaries of Addis Ababa into the Oromo regional state.

The TPLF, its cronies, party loyalists and their families control more than 70% of the modern economy, including communications, transport, agriculture and the defence industry. Key political institutions, including defence, intelligence and foreign affairs, are similarly owned and operated by and for the benefit of the ruling ethnic clique, with as many as 98% of the top echelons of the military and security forces being staffed by ethnic Tigrayans.</p> <p>In a word, the TPLF owns the government. Although the federal constitution was designed to empower the major ethnic groups of the country to form their own states as the main framework for their governance, none of the member states (with the sole exception of Tigray) have any real powers to take care of its internal affairs.</p> <p>As a consequence, the Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups \u2013 who together constitute close to 70% of the population \u2013 are deeply resentful about playing second fiddle. Naturally, this has been a deep source of political disaffection for vast numbers of the members of these communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e1c752aaa864933f26759bfc805ee8ea7abc3fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e1c752aaa864933f26759bfc805ee8ea7abc3fe/0_0_5400_3469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Ethiopian army patrol the streets of Addis Ababa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed by the constitution but they remain a dead letter in practice.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karel Prinsloo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the ethnically based federal system has left minorities trapped in their respective regions. They are treated as second-class citizens, lacking access to education, civil service employment, business licenses, bank loans and land leases on a nondiscriminatory basis. Even worse, they are liable to be expelled from regions in which they are considered \u201coutsiders\u201d.</p> <p>This has particularly been the fate of the Amhara, <a href=\"https://ethiopiaobservatory.com/2013/12/12/hrc-confirms-abuses-against-expelled-amharas-in-benishangul-gumuz/\" title=\"\">who have faced mass killing</a> at various times since the current government came to power. Yet the central authorities have shown no willingness to take protective measures or to provide any legal redress for these minorities.</p> <p>Compounding the problems thrown up by ethnic division is endemic corruption. Ethiopia ranks <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/country/#ETH\" title=\"\">103 out of 168 countries</a> on Transparency International\u2019s corruption perceptions index, a global civil society coalition that encourages accountability. It has also lost about $25bn since 2000 to illicit financial outflows, according to Global Financial Integrity.</p> <p>Government officials and party loyalists receive preferential access to credit, land leases and jobs. Areas vulnerable to corruption are land administration, tax and revenue, the justice system, telecommunications, land procurement, licensing areas, and the finance sector.</p> <p>Particularly egregious is the government\u2019s practice of leasing large <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/21/ethiopia-centre-global-farmland-rush\" title=\"\">tracts of land</a> to foreign governments and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/10/ethiopia-pastoralists-foreign-investors-land\" title=\"\">local investors in opaque deals</a> that have displaced thousands of people.

In recent years, the country has been producing thousands of college and university graduates each year but only a limited number are able to obtain productive employment. A sizable number often risk their lives to brave the Sahara desert and Mediterranean Sea in a desperate search for better opportunities. Others remain unemployed for long periods or are engaged in cutting cobblestones for streets.</p> <p>Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed by the constitution but they remain a dead letter in practice. The government often resorts to its anti-terrorism law to stifle political dissent and to terrorise its political opponents. The judiciary is officially independent but in practice it rarely deviates from government policy. As of 2014, Ethiopia holds the second highest number of journalists behind bars.</p> <p>The TPLF-government has to be held to account. The donor communities, particularly the UK, the US and the EU, should stand with the Ethiopian people by ceasing all military, financial and diplomatic support to the tyrannical government, supporting instead the opposition\u2019s call for an all-inclusive transitional process to replace the current government.</p>",
  "<p>After years of silence, monetary policy is once again a topic of political discussion. A week ago <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">Theresa May\u2019s conference speech</a> surprised many observers with a radical change of tune:<em tabindex=\"-1\"> \u201c</em>While monetary policy with super-low rates and quantitative easing have provided emergency medicine, we have to acknowledge some of the bad side effects. People with assets have got richer, while people without have not \u2026 A change has got to come.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister made similar comments during her first speech after taking office and the significance of these remarks should not be underestimated. Over the past couple of decades there has been a broad consensus that the Bank of England should be left to carry out monetary policy in total isolation from the government\u2019s fiscal policy. That consensus is beginning to break.</p> <p>May understands that monetary policy is not working for the majority of people. Quantitative easing (QE) is increasing inequality, and low interest rates aren\u2019t the solution for an economy that is still burdened with high levels of private debt. The tools are broken.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/mark-carney-backs-prime-ministers-call-for-economic-shakeup\">Mark Carney, responded to the prime minister\u2019s comments </a>by admitting that some had benefited more than others from QE. However, he put the responsibility of addressing inequality squarely with the government, stating: \u201cEvery monetary policy action has distributional consequences. It is not for the central bank to address these consequences. It is for the government to offset them.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/a-post-brexit-economic-policy-reset-for-the-uk-is-essential\">But more economists are pointing out that monetary policy is in intellectual crisis</a>. Central banks\u2019 tools of low interest rates and QE are clearly failing to boost the economy. Low interest rates have failed to stimulate the economy \u2013 we had one of the slowest recoveries from a recession in history \u2013 because people and businesses don\u2019t want to take on more debt. </p> <p>Low interest rates only work by encouraging more private sector borrowing. But levels of private debt are still very high so there isn\u2019t much room to take on even more. And of course, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-05/a-record-152-trillion-in-global-debt-unnerves-imf-officials\">as the IMF recently noted</a>, the best indicator that a financial crisis isn\u2019t far off is a buildup of private debt \u2013 so it\u2019s not something central banks should be encouraging lightly. </p> <p>QE is failing on its own terms and is having disastrous consequences. A growing number of economists are warning that QE is a key driver of inequality. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf\">This was confirmed by the Bank\u2019s research</a>, which found that QE has made the top 5% of households richer by an average of \u00a3128,000 each. </p> <p>Then there\u2019s the question of corporate QE. The Bank revealed details of its plans for buying \u00a310bn of corporate bonds through its new QE programme. Carney explained that to qualify, the companies would have to make a \u201cmaterial contribution to the UK economy\u201d. So many were shocked when the list included foreign-owned corporations with limited UK operations, such as Apple and AT&amp;T. It strikes many people as extraordinary that the Bank should be picking and choosing companies like this at all. David Blanchflower, a former MPC member, who was heading up Labour\u2019s review of the Bank described the Bank\u2019s corporate bond purchases as \u201cunmandated fiscal policy\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming clear that monetary policy has impacts that are of enormous political significance, and it isn\u2019t being closely scrutinised by parliament. At a parliamentary debate on the effectiveness of quantitative easing on 15 September only eight MPs spoke. But more economists and politicians are waking up to the fact that you can\u2019t carry out monetary and fiscal policy operating in total isolation, and if we want to rebalance our economy away from housing bubbles and an oversized financial sector, then monetary policy needs a serious rethink. </p> <p>An idea that is gaining traction is that monetary and fiscal policy could work together to deliver \u201cmonetary financing\u201d. Under this proposal, new money would be created by the Bank as with QE, but instead would be spent into the economy by the government to boost investment, employment and incomes. It\u2019s an idea known as people\u2019s QE. </p> <p>This might sound radical, but currently, it\u2019s considered good if banks create money, regardless of whether they use it to lend to businesses or to blow up property bubbles. However, it\u2019s considered taboo if the central bank creates money to finance government spending for the real economy. It\u2019s time to break that taboo.</p>",

If this is how the House of Commons deliberates on emergencies, it\u2019s a shame for issues less urgent than live genocide.</p> <p>Nevertheless, one would have hoped that quality would trump quantity, even with the expectation that the devil\u2019s advocates would go out of their way to absolve criminals from responsibility for the carnage in Syria. Indeed, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/ed-miliband-syria-strike\">Ed Miliband\u2019s shameful posturing</a> after the August 2013 chemical massacre, most Labour MPs continue to disgrace themselves by refusing to denounce Assad\u2019s \u2013 let alone Russia\u2019s \u2013 massively documented war crimes. Jeremy Corbyn and Stop The War\u2019s deafening silence on Syria speaks volumes when compared to their outrage to Israeli bombings.</p> <p>But members of a government whose declared policy is to stop the Assad regime were expected to do better than foreign secretary Boris Johnson saying he would \u201clike to see demonstrations outside the Russian embassy.\u201d As bombs continue to obliterate Syria, Whitehall, Westminster and Downing Street seem to have adopted a new doctrine of phoney outrage which had hitherto been a speciality of the so-called resistance front dictatorships. When the US bombed an al-Qaida camp in northeast Syria in 2008, Assad closed down the American School of Damascus and ordered demonstrations - because that will show them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\">Labour says 'fight will go on' after Tories vote down child refugee plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Syrians were crushed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\">MPs voted to deny a small Kindertransport for a mere 3,000 unaccompanied children</a>. As pitiful a spectacle as that debate was, it left some feeble hope that Britain would strive to do more to protect these Syrian children\u2019s lives, precisely so they wouldn\u2019t need to seek shelter elsewhere. That hope dissipates with every empty declaration reassuring Assad and his allies that nothing, absolutely nothing, will be done to halt their aggression.</p> <p>All that remains to complete this theatre of the absurd is for Johnson to suggest that people organise candle-lit vigils while singing Kumbaya to help the people of Syria.

It is possible that Putin might refuse but this would leave Russia isolated, condemned by the world community and severely weakened in terms of prestige and influence. Even Putin is unlikely to want that. If he agrees, Assad won\u2019t want to be left out in cold. He, too, is likely to reluctantly comply.</p> <p>This civilian protection plan may or may not work.

Tuesday\u2019s debate was no exception. There was little to suggest that over the past few months alone there have been three separate official reports \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war\">Chilcot</a>, and select committee reports on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention\">Libya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-has-failed-to-justify-syria-airstrikes-mps-committee-says\">Syria</a> \u2013 which have been extremely critical of two recent prime ministers, Tony Blair and David Cameron, and damning about the interventions originally cheered through in parliament. Anne Clwyd, who along with Boris Johnson wants 2 million on the streets outside the Russian embassy, was one of the main cheerleaders of the Iraq war, at a time when 2 million were marching against it.</p> <p>On each occasion there is a drive to war we are told something must be done. But the answer to the misery of the people of Aleppo is not more war, more bombing, more military intervention. It is not a no-fly zone, which in fact entails military intervention. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/libya-conflict-reactions-world\">no-fly zone was the prelude to a bombing war in Libya</a> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/libya-war-saving-lives-catastrophic-failure\">30,000 people died</a> and where there is still a civil war raging more than five years later. All that this will bring to the people of Aleppo is more suffering. It also risks escalating into a much worse war than even that we are seeing at present.</p> <p>The call to demonstrate outside the Russian embassy is the sort of debating point which may go down well in the Oxford Union. I would suggest that sympathy for the plight of Aleppo is not likely to be mobilised by such calls, given that much public opinion is rightly sceptical of these successive failed wars. But Johnson does nothing to address the very complex and dangerous situation in a country which is being bombed by Russia, Syria, Turkey, the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia. If we want to help the people of Aleppo we must condemn all the bombing, demand an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all outside intervention. We should also demand entry into Europe for all Syrian refugees, and the end to the inhuman treatment of them by EU governments, including our own. Those are some things that really could be done to help end this war.</p>",

Their cause may be worthy, and the ask may not seem that big to those used to a diet of kale and cashews \u2013 but the fact is that for millions of us it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t want to give up meat, I\u2019m probably not going to \u2013 so stop trying to make me feel bad. Piling on the guilt, while at the same time setting a bar that seems always to be rising, does not seem likely to solve the world\u2019s problems. For once you\u2019ve dropped the meat, the fish is sure to follow, and then there\u2019s eggs, butter, yoghurt \u2013 before long it feels like the only way to sustain yourself virtuously is to scavenge nuts and berries from the wilderness, which isn\u2019t that easy in central London.</p> <p>But not eating meat a few days a week \u2013 that feels achievable. It\u2019s realistic \u2013 and as all campaigners should recognise, setting a realistic goal is more likely to achieve success. So why not build a movement around cutting down, rather than elimination. Moderation rather than pious abstinence. It\u2019s a more appealing message, that\u2019s likely to achieve much in terms of all the issues vegetarianism claims to counter. And of course, once someone\u2019s reduced their meat intake the chances of them stopping entirely is surely likely to increase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff2500b313c29a2ec1b0175eb4160b5ca9dfd356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff2500b313c29a2ec1b0175eb4160b5ca9dfd356/0_0_5100_3400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vegetarian curry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Vegetarian food can be delicious \u2013 anyone who says otherwise is just being pigheaded.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just look at the approach of <a href=\"http://www.meatfreemondays.com/about/\" title=\"\">Meat Free Monday</a>.

For the first 100 days, it counted up, since everybody wants to know what you did in your first 100 days. But now it counts back, so every morning I take a look: how many days do I have until I\u2019m re-elected?

But there are plenty who pour cold water on the idea that where one leads, others will follow, or that the election of a first female mayor \u2013 or indeed a first woman as a country\u2019s president or prime minister \u2013 changes anything much. </p> <p>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science at the University of Southern Denmark, says recent Scandinavian political history justifies such doubts. While Denmark has had its first female prime minister, and the sexes are widely seen to be more equal there than almost anywhere else, the percentage of female mayors in the country has not risen above 15%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.</p> <footer> <cite>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSince we have already some women mayors and we\u2019ve had a female PM, we tend to tick off gender \u2013 \u2018OK, we\u2019re done with that, we\u2019ve reached some kind of parity\u2019 \u2013 and focus on other under-represented groups, immigrants and young people and so on ... when in fact gender parity has not been reached,\u201d he says. \u201cWomen still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.\u201d</p> <p>Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, echoes this. She says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/hillary-clinton-sexism-millennial-voters-women\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for US president</a> creates the \u201cfalse impression that women have really made it in politics. If she wins it will be enormously significant but it masks the reality. We\u2019re not anticipating a year of great strides. We might get from 19% women in the House of Representatives to 20%. State legislatures are not particularly great, and at governor level there are only six women [out of 50].\u201d</p> <p>Walsh believes the women with positions in American politics are, on the whole, more moderate, because women are more economically vulnerable than men, and see themselves as more likely to need state help. But she adds that partisan pulls have recently become stronger. </p> <p>She points to a lack of research into local government internationally as one problem confronting anyone trying to understand what impact, if any, women legislators make. She also notes that the jobs of mayor or governor pose particular challenges, because the stereotype of the good female politician is of a skilful group or committee worker, not a charismatic boss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29/0_384_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor of Watford Dorothy Thornhill speaks to Nick Clegg and project managers during a visit to the construction site for the Watford Health Campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Watford, Dorothy Thornhill, speaks to Nick Clegg and construction managers at Watford Health Campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> This point is echoed by Dorothy Thornhill, mayor of Watford in England for the past 14 years, and one of just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/03/where-women-council-leaders-northern-powerhouse-english-regions\">four directly elected English female mayors</a>. \u201cPeople think leadership equals male characteristics,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea that you have to be this macho-type of person is still around.\u201d As mayor, she has played against this type, and cheerfully reports how on a school visit a child shouted out, \u201cYou ain\u2019t no mayor!

But she describes rights for women as part of a larger struggle that includes racial equality and LGBT inclusion: \u201cI don\u2019t see women\u2019s interests as a trade-off against the interests of other groups.\u201d </p> <p>On the contrary, supporters of women\u2019s representation in politics believe women can act as a kind of bridgehead for other under-represented groups \u2013 older people, children, racial and religious minorities \u2013 because although women are not a minority, they are more likely than men to have experienced social exclusion and disempowerment. Olivera names among her proudest achievements as Montevideo mayor a skate park, proposed by a group of teenage skateboarders who won approval and a budget from the city.</p> <p>If a couple of themes recur in talking to female mayors, one is that they have often been underestimated, if not insulted; another is their sense that women can bring a different, less overtly combative and more consensual approach to government. Also, there is their pride at having blazed a trail. </p> <h2>Female mayors in their own words</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0/0_27_477_596/400.jpg\" alt=\"Cyvette Gibson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyvette Gibson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cyvette Gibson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cyvette Gibson, Paynesville, Liberia (population 347,000)</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn parts of Africa there are still prejudices about women in leadership roles and doubts about the impact we can make.

  "<p>Confidence in the food and drink industry is increasingly fragile since the upheaval caused by the Brexit vote, a survey reveals on Wednesday, as the UK\u2019s largest manufacturing sector grapples with increasingly tough trading conditions.</p> <p>Despite sales climbing to their highest levels since 2013, three-quarters of <a href=\"http://%20www.fdf.org.uk/\">Food and Drink Federation (FDF)</a> members have reported soaring ingredient prices, plummeting product margins and concerns for the future raised by their EU workforce. This trend is expected by most companies to continue over the next year. </p> <p>Food and drink is by far the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, accounting for 16% of total manufacturing by turnover (\u00a383.7bn a year) and directly employing about 400,000 people across 6,620 businesses. The industry also supports 3.9m jobs across the \u00a3108bn UK food chain and contributes \u00a321.5bn of gross value added (GVA) to the British economy each year \u2013 nearly as much as the automotive and aerospace sectors put together.<br></p> <p>The FDF\u2019s UK-based members range from giant brands such as Coca-Cola, Britvic, McVitie\u2019s and Mr Kipling to small-scale producers such as the oatcake maker Maclean\u2019s Highland Bakery. The survey findings reflected the sentiment of a third of its full membership including micro, small, medium and large food and drink manufacturers, it said. </p> <p>More than two-thirds (69.5%) said they were less confident about the UK business environment while just 11% were more confident. However the survey coincides with the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/retailers-warn-weak-pound-blows-consumer-confidence-british-retail-consortium\">quarterly figures </a>from UK retailers showing food sales at their highest levels since 2013, \u201csuggesting a disparity between business and consumer confidence levels\u201d, the FDF says. </p> <p>It is calling for an \u201cindustrial strategy partnership\u201d with government and for urgent assurances for the industry\u2019s workforce from the EU that they will have the right to remain in the UK. </p> <p>In the survey, almost three-quarters (71%) of companies employing EU staff say these employees have expressed concerns about the referendum outcome, with about one in 12 (8.7%) businesses reporting that their EU employees intend to leave the UK. An estimated 130,000 of the industry\u2019s 400,000 workforce are non-UK nationals \u2013 many from eastern Europe, often doing valued seasonal work in agriculture and factories.</p> <p>\u201cWe share government\u2019s view that we need to make the best of Brexit,\u201d said the FDF\u2019s director general Ian Wright. \u201cFood and drink industry confidence is low. Slower revenue growth, coupled with prolonged business uncertainty, is affecting the industry\u2019s ability to invest.\u201d<br></p> <p>The FDF is also calling for urgent action from the government to ensure that essential imports of ingredients and raw materials from the EU and EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries do not face tariffs or costly non-tariff barriers. Some British-based businesses have benefited from the weaker pound, which makes their exports more competitive \u2013 as long as they still have tariff-free access to the single European market.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cLeaving the EU offers us an opportunity to forge a new role for ourselves in the world and we are determined to make sure the UK remains the best place in Europe to run and grow a business. As a nation, we\u2019ve sold over \u00a310 billion worth of food and drink overseas in the first six months of this year, and exports are up almost six per cent compared to 2015. We are building on that success and, through our Great British Food Unit, are working with industry to establish new trading relationships across the globe to help boost the sector.\u201d</p> <p>John Stevenson MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group for food and drink manufacturing, which meets on Wednesday to discuss what Brexit means for the industry, added: \u201cGovernment and industry partnership has never been more important to the future of this vital sector. Food and drink is a national success story, with massive untapped opportunity to boost exports and improve its already impressive productivity performance, delivering even more for the UK economy.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>We\u2019ve all felt it: the desire to be perfect. Teenagers seem to experience this more keenly than most, seeking an imagined ideal in their looks, social status, friendship group or achievements.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/31/great-expectations-how-to-help-your-students-fulfil-their-potential\">High standards are good</a> \u2013 but perfectionism is a problem. I run workshops in schools, where many teachers say students have high levels of stress, anxiety and perfectionist traits, especially high-achieving females. Evidence suggests perfectionism is indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/young-women-pressure-perfect-education-looks-work-relationships-social-media\">more common in females</a>, although both males and females are affected.

When your whole self-worth and identity are tied to your success, mistakes and setbacks are seen as a threat and you avoid taking risks. </p> <p> We need to talk about these issues \u2013 but where to begin? Here are some tips for helping students manage and overcome perfectionism.</p> <h2><strong>Foster understanding</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/sep/28/it-builds-confidence-amd-independence-the-many-benefits-of-making-pupils-into-mentors\">'It builds confidence and independence': the many benefits of making pupils into mentors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Educate your students about perfectionism and its consequences. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796710001865\">One study</a> found that \u201ca brief low-cost intervention is effective at decreasing the psychological distress in maladaptive perfectionists\u201d. Talk to them in a helpful and non-judgmental manner, and make sure the environment is non-threatening. </p> <p>Try discussing hypothetical situations. Ask them to give advice to a hypothetical student who worries about being perfect in all aspects of life. Leave them time to reflect on how they could follow their own advice.</p> <h2><strong>Strive for excellence, not perfection</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pits.21792/abstract;jsessionid=6001E209ED7FFDB4C999783D4D111F63.f01t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=\">Research suggests</a> that teaching students about the difference between having an ethic of excellence and chasing unobtainable perfectionism will \u201cenhance resilience and reduce levels of risk among perfectionists\u201d. </p> <p> Ron Berger, author of <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149026.An_Ethic_of_Excellence\">An Ethic of Excellence: Building a Culture of Craftsmanship with Students</a>, suggests you set students long-term projects so they develop a sense of pride in their work, get high-quality regular feedback from teachers, and are encouraged to draft and re-draft their work before submitting it.</p> <p>Teachers can help make the difference between an ethic of excellence and perfectionism. Excellence is focused on becoming as good as you can be and developing your skills; perfectionism focuses on not making any mistakes and avoiding looking bad. In an ethic of excellence, mistakes are viewed as possible learning opportunities and not something to be covered up, embarrassed by or judged on.</p> <h2><strong>Develop a growth mindset</strong></h2> <p> Unhealthy perfectionism is <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02783193.2012.715333\">associated with a fixed mindset</a> (the belief that your basic abilities are unchangeable). A growth mindset (believing abilities can be developed) shifts students towards improving their abilities rather than proving their abilities. The former is associated with learning and development, the latter with comparing yourself to others and a fear of failure. This is something Carol Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford University, has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgUF5WalyDk\">spoken extensively about</a>. </p> <p>Focus on natural ability, avoid labels such as \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cgifted and talented\u201d and try <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/nov/15/four-questions-encourage-growth-mindset-students\">asking students questions that encourage them to reflect on their mindset</a>. This helps them see themselves as a constant work in progress and motivates them to get better instead of worrying about not being good enough and demotivated as a result.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/nov/15/four-questions-encourage-growth-mindset-students\">Four questions that encourage growth mindset among students</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Explain that no one is perfect </strong></h2> <p>Many students suffer from what\u2019s become known as <a href=\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fomo\">FOMO</a> (fear of missing out). It can be an ongoing battle to remind them that no one\u2019s life is as perfect as it may appear on Facebook. </p> <p>Get a discussion going about this issue using some real-life examples. The story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/instagram-star-essena-oneill-quits-2d-life-to-reveal-true-story-behind-images\">Essena O\u2019Neill</a>, an Australian teenager who had 612,000 Instagram followers but quit social media because of its \u201ccontrived perfection\u201d, could be a starting point. </p> <p> Only by understanding what\u2019s going on behind the scenes with others, and developing skills such as self-compassion, can students have a healthy relationship with their own flaws and understand that this is part of what makes us all unique.</p> <h2><strong>Build supportive relationships </strong></h2> <p>Evidence suggests that positive statements by teachers have a <a href=\"http://eprints.qut.edu.au/27104/1/Burnett1999a.pdf\">direct impact on the number of positive statements students make about themselves</a>. These comments from teachers were also found to have a positive impact on how the students perceived themselves as learners.</p> <p> Trust is important, too, if pupils are to take your guidance on board. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730121/\">In one famous</a> study on the ability to delay gratification (putting off short-term rewards for long-term gain), students who trusted the person giving them instructions were found to improve their performance considerably. Providing consistency and demonstrating you care will help build this trust and encourage your students to talk to you. </p> <p><em>Bradley Busch is a registered psychologist and director at <a href=\"http://www.innerdrive.co.uk/\">InnerDrive</a>.

  "<p>When did new age music become cool? The mellow tones of new age were once the province of spas, wellness centers, yoga studios and hippie bookstores.

If you\u2019re into cosmic music and ambient music and drone stuff, it\u2019s not too far of a reach to move over into new age music and discover what\u2019s there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/23/is-mindfulness-making-us-ill\">Is mindfulness making us ill?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A recent Laraaji show in Brooklyn was packed with people in their 20s and 30s.

His label, Leaving Records, is working to unearth new age gems from the 1980s. \u201cA lot of it is weird music and very experimental and unconventional. A lot of it can be cheesy and unappealing for the exploratory sound seeker, but there are a lot of gems in the new age genre that are being spotlighted now.\u201d</p> <p>McQueen, who had been making sample-based hip-hop, connected with new age music during a rough time in his life. \u201cSome events had happened in my personal life that I needed to heal from, and some friends bestowed some musical gifts unto me,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it was new age music from Michael Stearns and Iasos. I started to heavily personally pursue the music for active therapeutic listening purposes \u2013 meditative purposes.

MacGowan\u2019s latest work \u2013 an upcoming reissue called The Microcosm: Visionary Music from Continental Europe, featuring artists such as Vangelis and Deuter \u2013 makes the case for a parallel world of very similar music developing across the Atlantic. Certain strands of ambient music, drone music, and so-called kosmische music blurred with the sounds of new age music, but the intentions, he says, were often different.</p> <p>As an example, he brings up Valley of the Sun \u2013 a powerhouse new age label and publisher that was based in Malibu, California, which released hundreds of cassette tapes employing an array of techniques including hypnotism and subliminal messages. \u201cFor me, the whole idea \u2013 that to me is where the irony comes in \u2013 is in the extreme nature of some of the claims on guided meditation tapes, particularly,\u201d MacGowan says. \u201cGuided meditation is a catch-all term for all spoken content that is telling you what\u2019s what. But also the tape stuff, the Valley of the Sun stuff. I have a Valley of the Sun tape, that\u2019s like subliminal sounds to erase someone from your mind, which is ludicrous, but I love it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/gdayal/playlist/2rPnAmibTbu6QOTwP59skm\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:gdayal:playlist:2rPnAmibTbu6QOTwP59skm\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>California in the 1970s, says the author Erik Davis, was an apt place for new age music to form. \u201cThere was the emerging space of the therapy room or the massage studio, all these other spaces that needed their own soundtracks,\u201d Davis says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of an anything-goes situation in the 1970s. Any system or technique or practice that you have that might increase consciousness is up for grabs. All these people were going for new therapies, new ideas.\u201d </p> <p>Iasos, based in northern California\u2019s leafy Marin County, is thought to have released the first album with the \u201cnew age\u201d tag \u2013 1975\u2019s Inter-Dimensional Music. (Fellow Marin County resident Steven Halpern also released a new age album that year, so it may be a tie.) \u201cThe original impetus of new age music was music to connect to your own divinity \u2026 music to connect to your higher self, to do yoga, to find inner peace, to enhance harmony,\u201d says Iasos, who believes he receives energies from a cosmic being named Vista, who he has a telepathic connection with. \u201cI actually wasn\u2019t directly focused on healing, but beauty by universal standards \u2013 like the beauty of a sunset, the beauty of a mountain reflected in a lake,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut I learned, inadvertently, that the music was healing \u2026 I found out inadvertently that if music is beautiful, it is healing,\u201d he continued. \u201cLove causes beauty, and beauty causes healing. My focus was creating beauty.\u201d The appeal of new age music, Davis says, is partly because it isn\u2019t ironic at all \u2013 like so much of the music favored by so-called \u2018hipsters\u2019 over the past several years. \u201cIt\u2019s fetishizable because it\u2019s outside the dominant taste,\u201d Davis says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a sweetness and earnestness about it, too.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Microcosm: Visionary Music from Continental Europe is out on Light In The Attic on 25 November; Laaraji\u2019s </em><em>Om Namah Shivaya is out now on Leaving Records</em></p>",

Film-making began four years later when he was invited to Boanama and then launched a Kickstarter campaign to document the lives of the people there. He has since spent close to $160,000, partly supported by groups such as Yale Environment 360 and Passion Planet, but mostly from his own funds.<br></p> <p>Over the past decade, he has seen the oil companies move closer to Yasuni, building roads and bridges that open up new areas for land clearance, logging and the bush-meat trade. Faced by the rush of development, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/ecuadorian-tribe-die-fighting-rainforest\">local indigenous groups have held out for as long as they can </a>but are then often sucked into the destruction of their own forests.<br></p> <p>The most isolated tribes \u2013 the Tagaeri and Taromenane, who shun contact with the outside world \u2013 are in theory protected by the state, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/03/uncontacted-tribes-wildlife\">their territory has steadily shrunk</a>, which has led to increased conflict. Among the victims was one of Killackey\u2019s friends, Caiga Baihua, who was speared to death in January. </p> <p>Killacky says the blame lies mostly with the destabilising encroachment of outside cultures and foreign corporations, though he acknowledges that he too is an emissary of western values. </p> <p>\u201cI feel conflicted every day. I always ask myself whether I will be viewed as the missionaries were. Although I was invited, I bring cameras and tents from the outside world. When the Waorani see them, they want them too.

It\u2019s about people metamorphosing.\u201d</p> <p>Like Mapplethorpe himself, Velvet Petal plays with a fluid and fluctuating idea of identity, especially sexuality. \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in showing a \u2018gay\u2019 character or a \u2018straight\u2019 character,\u201d says Darkin. \u201cWhat am I going to do, a duet with two men to show they\u2019re gay?

Gender is this huge thing to play with and create outrage with, it\u2019s incredibly potent; and yet on one level it\u2019s a fiction.\u201d</p> <p>For Darkin, a lot of this project has been about looking past first impressions. I suggest that the perfection of Mapplethorpe\u2019s flower pictures makes them seem a bit static. \u201cI would say, spend another minute with it and you start to see movement,\u201d she counters. \u201cYou see growth patterns in the shape of the flower.

It\u2019s cheap for artists to live, everyone walks to work. I remember doing rehearsals in London where dancers have done their two-hour commute just to get to the studio.

There\u2019s much more collectivism.\u201d</p> <p>Collaboration is almost an obsession for Darkin \u2013 what her publicity material calls an \u201copen-source hothouse approach to dance making\u201d \u2013 meaning that the performers and collaborators shape the work as much as Darkin does.

As a Somali female campaigner, she was a \u201cshero\u201d of mine before I met her.</p> <p>The odds are stacked against Dayib defeating incumbent Hassan Sheikh Mohamud; she isn\u2019t even listed as a candidate in <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201608180542.html\">analysis in regional media</a> and has said herself that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/fadumo-dayib-the-somali-refugee-vying-to-return-home-as-first-female-president\">she has little chance of winning</a>.</p> <p>But Dayib\u2019s courage says something about my home country and how far it\u2019s come. So far, the daily death threats she receives are greatly outweighed by the overwhelming support from fellow Somalis. Dayib believes Somalia is ready for female leaders and the fact that she can run at all is in itself cause for celebration.</p> <p>I ask the most obvious question: \u201cWhy do you want to run for the Somali presidency in such a hostile environment to women?\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Living in Finland, she says, gives her many privileges she wouldn\u2019t have had in her own country, and she wants to extend these to women and girls back home. Dayib wasn\u2019t fully literate until the age of 14 but now has several degrees in international public health, including one from Harvard, and is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Helsinki. Born in Kenya to Somali parents, as a child Dayib was deported back to Somalia with her family. When civil war broke out shortly thereafter, the family was forced to leave again, ending up in Finland.</p> <p>\u201cAll I want is for my people to reach their full potential and exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d she says, adding that by running for the presidency, she is exercising her rights as a Muslim woman. During our discussion, she frequently expresses sadness at the global wave of Islamophobia and the portrayal of Muslim women as voiceless and weak. Were she to be elected, she would want to ensure Somalia practices the correct Islam, \u201cthe religion of peace\u201d.</p> <p>Dayib has seen first hand the violence of extremists al-Shabaab in Somalia, where she worked for six months setting up maternal health clinics before the UN evacuated her over security concerns. </p> <p>However, the everyday hostility she faced was oddly familiar. \u201cIt was very similar to what my Finnish colleagues were telling me, \u2018you came to our country to take our jobs\u2019. Now I was being told by Somali colleagues, \u2018you came back to Somalia to take our jobs\u2019. So where was I to go? I was stuck in the middle. Where did I belong?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls go to school, women are working, people feel happy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From there, Dayib went to Fiji and Liberia, where she helped set up HIV prevention offices and trained health care providers for the UN. Seeing how Liberia had emerged from long-term strife brought Dayib\u2019s thoughts back to her ancestral land. </p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Somalia be like this? I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls are going to school, women are working, people feel happy,\u201d she says. Experiencing progress in other African countries gave her hope, but she was under no illusion about the difficult road ahead. The start, however, is always the hardest and that\u2019s what her candidacy is all about: a huge step for Somali women and for Somalia as a whole.</p> <p>Even if Dayib not chosen as next president at the election (<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/27/somalia-delays-its-presidential-election-by-month.html\">currently scheduled for 30 November</a>) she vows to remain in Somalia. Her plan is to set up an independent panel to deal with corruption. She says its her duty to help rebuild the country, and is is adamant that more Somali women should invest back in Somalia whether economically or through their skills as doctors, teachers or social workers. </p> <p>Dayib is under no illusions; she knows Somalia is still very male-dominated, and that when she announced her bid for the presidency, many people struggled to believie it. I was one, but meeting her has extinguished any doubts. Dayib is fierce and her vision for Somalia is clear.</p> <p>\u201cI have a calling and purpose in this world,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must stand and speak up against injustices, my family gets that, it\u2019s not easy but this is who I am. If loving my land means I will die, so be it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/29/leyla-hussein-the-women-who-made-me\">Anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein: the women who made me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dayib and I both know too well that Somali women do not lack strength, intelligence or skills; what they lack is opportunities to reach their goals. We agreed that women and girls in Somalia are in desperate need of safe spaces to access resources, support, education and for protection.</p> <p>Our country faces great challenges. The al-Shabaab rebellion is certainly one of the greatest, but it does not scare Dayib. She believes that by creating a stable environment, and reclaiming the Somali identity, she can address the anger and disillusionment of young Somali men that is fanning the rebellion. </p> <p>In the end, however, corruption might prove a greater obstacle. Dayib places ending corruption at the top of her candidacy\u2019s priorities. She recognises, however, that corruption is also the greatest barrier to her own chances of winning, possibly even greater to her being a woman. I hope this will not be the case. I believe that a president like her could take on the great challenges facing our country.</p> <p>Meeting Dayib reignited my own commitment as a campaigner.

  "<p>If you\u2019re a video game fan of a certain age, you may remember Edge magazine\u2019s controversial review of the bloody sci-fi shooting game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/13/doom-video-gaming-ramones\">Doom</a>. Perhaps you enjoyed a good laugh, as many first-person shooter fans have, at the writer\u2019s much-mocked assertion: \u201cif only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances \u2026 Now that would be interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, we all know what happened. There would be no room in the Doom series, nor any subsequent first-person blast-\u2019em-up, for such socio-psychological niceties. Instead, we enjoyed 20 years of shooting, bludgeoning and stabbing, the ludicrous idea of diplomacy cast roughly aside. </p> <p>But during this era, something else was happening in game design, and in academic thinking around video games and artificial intelligence. Buoyed by advances in AI research and aided by increasingly powerful computer processors, developers were beginning to think about the possibilities of non-player characters (NPCs) who could think and act in a more complex and human way \u2013 who could provide the emotional feedback that the Edge reviewer was thinking about.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkTgX1mGmDg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SkTgX1mGmDg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Arguably, this quest began in 1985 when Activision released a strange game entitled Little Computer People. Co-created by veteran designer David Crane, players had to care for the randomly generated inhabitant of a suburban home. The character had a limited range of emotions and behaviours, and player interaction ranged from feeding the character, to offering gifts and entering simple commands. This \u2018virtual pet\u2019 concept would later find more complex treatment in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/oct/13/tamagotchilove\">Tamagotchi</a> phenomenon and in the artificial life sim, Creatures. </p> <p>But the most notable continuation was Will Wright\u2019s virtual soap opera <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/apr/16/simsbiggestsellingpcgamei\">The Sims</a>. Released in 2000 it provided a household of intelligent characters who would form relationships and develop behaviours that \u2013 enhanced by the imagination of players \u2013 suggested emotional depth and authenticity. Doubted by many within EA at the time, The Sims was a smash hit, and the continuing franchise has now sold over 175m copies. It was clear that players were interested in the idea of characters \u2013 or more accurately AI agents \u2013 who offered something more than digital bodies to be annihilated. </p> <p>Some of the most interesting advances, however, have come from the independent sector, often fuelled by university research into AI concepts such as neural networks, machine learning and natural language processing. The 2005 game <a href=\"http://www.interactivestory.net/\">Facade</a> by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern, for example, is an interactive domestic drama featuring a couple named Grace and Trip who are in the midst of an argument that may end their relationship. Taking on the role of a mutual friend, the player is able to talk to the couple using text inputs, making suggestions that the AI characters are able to process and understand via a range of interconnected AI technologies. These include a language processing system, which recognises the words the player uses and interprets the context, a behaviour engine that Mateas and Stern called A Behaviour Language (ABL) that controls the actions and movements of the characters, and a drama manager, which creates interesting beats and moments of tension in the emerging narrative. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, the scarcity of satisfying interactive experiences that are actually about people\u2019s lives \u2013 subject matter that is, of course, the heart of the best literature, cinema, theatre and television,\u201d said Stern at the time. \u201cWe gave Grace and Trip a wealth of problems and hidden motivations leading to the present moment, carefully balanced between them.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmuLV9eMTkg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GmuLV9eMTkg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The resulting scenes don\u2019t always work \u2013 they can be stilted and strange, the AI system struggling to understand the nuances of human relationships \u2013 but there are moments of emotional intensity in each playthrough, the computer-controlled couple struggling to keep their relationship alive. It was a fascinating experiment.</p> <p>Seven years after Facade, a group of developers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, released a game named <a href=\"https://promweek.soe.ucsc.edu/\">Prom Week</a>, a social simulation following a group of students as they prepared for their school dance. Game designer Aaron Reed was co-creator and lead writer on the project. \u201cEach character in the game is a unique AI agent driven by several thousand rules encoding the social norms and behaviours you might see in a cheesy high school comedy film,\u201d he explains. \u201cCharacters would consider these rules, along with a large database of shared knowledge, such as their histories together, likes and dislikes, personality traits and recent moods, to decide what to do and how to respond to actions from other characters.\u201d</p> <p>The system adds drama by providing each agent with a set of characteristics following high school movie conventions (goths, jocks, princesses) and a range of emotional states. They also view each of their peers based on varying levels of three different aspects: friendship, romance and how cool the other person is. The player\u2019s role involves clicking on any two characters then choosing a style of interaction between them. You then sit back and watch the social physics play out as friendships blossom and crumble amid competing interpersonal ambitions. AI characters may hate a character they\u2019re also romantically interested in, or try to form friendships with others who don\u2019t view them as cool. It\u2019s the whole school experience in one interactive experiment.</p> <p>Like Facade, Prom Week features a built-in drama manager, a sort of intelligent AI system that reads and shapes the second-by-second social data. When a character takes an action \u2013 like breaking up with another student, for example \u2013 the game has a large library of scene templates that can be inserted into the moment to narrate the change in the social state. In this example, the system would search for a break up scene template, modify the dialogue for the particular characters and circumstance and then put it on screen to provide a reason and background for the relationship collapse. \u201cThis effectively gives the underlying social AI system a \u2018narrator\u2019 who can find the right scene to let the characters explain what\u2019s happening to them,\u201d says Reed. \u201cThe system was highly effective at creating characters that felt very specific and interesting while still being driven by an emergent, dynamic social AI system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"537af541b80ce146ea3056a66ff2b6b803cac122\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537af541b80ce146ea3056a66ff2b6b803cac122/0_142_758_455/500.jpg\" alt=\"Prom Week: a familiar tale of high school romance, bullying and friendship\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prom Week: a familiar tale of high school romance, bullying and friendship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UCSC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Importantly, the mix of dynamic social AI systems and scene templates led to an array of convincing procedural behaviours that usually made sense. \u201cOne of the most delightful parts of development for me was seeing the system start to perform the characters correctly, even without having any dialogue written for a specific student,\u201d says Reed. \u201cAs the game came together, we would start to see emergent story moments that no one had specifically written, but were inevitable consequences of the social rules and cast of characters we\u2019d created. It was a bit like watching trained actors start venturing into improv, and coming up with wonderful scenes on their own that were true to their character and appropriate to the play.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, in 2013, AI coder Richard Evans and narrative designer Emily Short worked together to develop <a href=\"https://versu.com/\">Versu</a>, an AI engine that could create interactive text-based stories based around intelligent and emotional characters. They began to demo the platform with a series of text-based adventures that resembled interactive Jane Austen or Agatha Christie novels, filled with intrigue and disparate characters. Here, instead of coding a small number of set personality traits for each AI agent, everyone had their own beliefs, abilities and parameters which, in theory, lead to an infinite range of habits and quirky behaviours. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4082e661866d3c6fb6fe31ab7dc029cb673ec8d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4082e661866d3c6fb6fe31ab7dc029cb673ec8d6/15_0_771_462/500.png\" alt=\"Versu presents players with a selection of living stories that work like live choose your own adventure novels\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Versu presents players with a selection of living stories that work like live choose your own adventure novels</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Versu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEach character also has a set of interpersonal attitudes,\u201d says Evans. \u201cThese are fine-grained role-evaluations: an evaluation of how well a character is performing a role. So, for example, Mrs Quinn may think that Brown lacks good breeding because he slurped his soup. Or Brown may think that Mrs Quinn lacks a sense of humour because she failed to laugh at his joke. These interpersonal attitudes can be transformed during the course of the game, and can be communicated from what one character to another, via a form of gossip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharacters also have an emotional state \u2013 based on <a href=\"http://www.beinghuman.org/article/do-we-all-have-same-basic-emotions\">Paul Ekman\u2019s typology of emotions</a>. So, for example, Mrs Quinn may be annoyed because Brown was flirting with Lucy. Each character keeps track of her emotional state, the person who the emotion is directed towards, and the explanation of the emotional state or the experience that prompted the emotion.\u201d<br></p> <p>The problem though, was in communicating to players just how complex these behaviours were. When Evans and Short released the first game based on their platform, the iOS adventure Blood and Laurels, players thought it was just a standard scripted choose-your-own-adventure text game \u2013 they didn\u2019t realise that the emerging rivalries between characters were happening through AI. Evans admits that even he was blindsided by his system at times.</p> <p>\u201cThere was one time I was playing a murder mystery game we had designed \u2013 and there was this doctor who came to diagnose how a character was murdered,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, the doctor was being very rude to my character and kept making dismissive remarks. Initially I thought it was a bug because I knew the doctor\u2019s personality was mostly pleasant, and I knew I hadn\u2019t been rude to him. I thought, oh man, why is he being such an arsehole to me? </p> <p>\u201cI looked through the code and it turned out that much much earlier in the game I\u2019d been rude to a servant during dinner, and the servant had gone into the kitchen and told the people there what a jerk I\u2019d been \u2013 one of those people was the doctor. He remembered that. This took me quite a long time to debug. This is an example of how emergence is exciting but it opens up questions about game design.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s an interesting problem. In 2011 a group of researchers at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain <a href=\": https://www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~jmpena/docs/2011CIG.pdf\">created a program</a> named the Emotional Elicitation Process, that could define and produce emotional reactions in video game characters. The team used the role-playing fantasy game Neverwinter Nights to exhibit the project, imbuing NPCs with a range of emotions. \u201cParty members could fall in love and might disregard their own safety to save someone they liked, for instance,\u201d recalls AI researcher Michael Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky to design for, though, because on the face of it it looks like stupid behaviour. Like a lot of new AI ideas, communicating it to the player is really crucial.\u201d</p> <h2>Do game characters need emotions?</h2> <p>Games such as Prom Week, Facade and The Sims were built around AI systems that created their own stories on the fly, featuring human interactions that resembled simple soap operas. But while these games proved a perfect testbed for creative and emotional AI agents, the commercial industry has had no immediate use for these fascinating innovations. In most games, AI is about controlling and directing non-player characters to provide a certain level of challenge to the player. In a shooter or strategy game, you want characters who can avoid danger areas and work to flank the player, and the major challenge is writing an effective AI pathfinding system \u2013 a means for the character to navigate the game\u2019s environment. In short, there\u2019s no need for emotion or creativity when all you\u2019re required to do is provide a target for the player while not bumping into the furniture. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think the rise of emotionally intelligent game characters has been hampered by two major factors,\u201d says Reed. \u201cOne is the difficulty of developing and using the technology, and the other is the lack of a proven track record to inspire game producers to tackle that challenge. It\u2019s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: unlike other aspects of AI such as pathfinding, there aren\u2019t established algorithms and architectures for [emotional] character AI, which means a lot of difficult original research and experimentation on a pretty big scale: precisely the sort of thing that\u2019s out of reach for most indies or academics, but tends to get cut in big-budget titles as a risky, unknown factor.\u201d</p> <p>But while the mainstream games industry was overlooking emotional character design and emergent behaviours, the concept of computational creativity was becoming a major element of artificial intelligence research. From the 1980s, the idea that AI systems could learn to think like humans and devise their own narrative, artistic or linguistic works began to intrigue both universities and major technology companies. This has led to developments like IBM\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/computational-creativity.shtml#fbid=wumHhfu4mHN\">intelligent computer cook</a> that invents its own recipes, and the <a href=\"http://www.whim-project.eu/whatifmachine/#/welcome\">What If Machine</a> created by a group of European universities, which answers hypothetical \u2018what if\u2019 questions submitted by users. It also led to ANGELINA, a computer program developed by Michael Cook that can write its own simple video games, sourcing graphics and concepts by browsing internet search engines.</p> <p>A lot of these theories and methodologies are now feeding contemporary academic research into games and emotional AI agents. Mark Riedl is associate professor at Georgia Tech and director of the university\u2019s Entertainment Intelligence Lab. He\u2019s currently working on a project named Quixote, an AI system designed to make it easier for non-specialist programmers to create intelligent \u2018virtual agents\u2019. Quixote <a href=\"https://research.cc.gatech.edu/eilab/publications/learning-from-stories\">allows AI agents to learn social rules</a> and behaviours through reading stories sourced online; right now Riedl uses Amazon\u2019s online crowdsourcing marketplace <a href=\"https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\">Mechanical Turk</a> to commission people to write short stories around set themes. To demonstrate the concept, Riedl developed a game called Robbery World in which an AI agent has to rob a bank: it studies a series of bank robbery stories submitted on Mechanical Turk; learns the common elements (travel to bank, go to counter, pull out gun, demand cash) and is then rewarded for carrying out any action that advances the plot.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how to create complicated virtual characters for games and social simulations,\u201d says Reidl. \u201cThe idea is that humans can tell (or crowd-source) stories about how to behave and the AI will train the characters from those stories. I think it would be especially useful in populating role-playing games with virtual characters \u2013 it\u2019s a very different use of AI and a different way of thinking about how to use storytelling. We are currently integrating Quixote with Minecraft.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9dc589d63f15f41f35cb1154a363ba8f430bb0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9dc589d63f15f41f35cb1154a363ba8f430bb0c/0_77_762_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"In the Restaurant Game the AI waitress had learned how to behave by watching hundreds of humans play through the game in her role\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the Restaurant Game the AI waitress had learned how to behave by watching hundreds of humans play through the game in her role</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MIT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riedl, then, envisions a new era of AI game characters that can research and learn from human stories or actions in a game world and thereby work out how to act like humans; imagine a Witcher character who observes how you play, almost like listening to your stories round the campfire as you save your game, and then remembers the morals of those stories the next time they appear by your side in battle. This process of teaching behaviours to machine learning algorithms is going to be of huge importance in the coming years and its implications stretch far beyond games. AI research is obviously also being applied to robotics \u2013 ineed Riedl and fellow researchers at Georgia Tech are looking at how Quixote could be used to teach robots how to <a href=\"http://www.news.gatech.edu/2016/02/12/using-stories-teach-human-values-artificial-agents\">behave in a socially and morally acceptable manner</a>. </p> <p>The Entertainment Intelligence Lab isn\u2019t the only place working towards this idea of AI agents learning from people. Ten years ago, Jeff Orkin\u2019s fascinating <a href=\"http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin//restaurant/research/\">Restaurant Game</a> got players to take on the role of a customer going out for a meal, with the waitress controlled by an AI. However in preparation for this simulation, he asked thousands of volunteers to play the game as the waitress, while the AI watched and learned from their actions. The resulting agent was able to cope with a vast range of player actions and behaviours.</p> <p>This is where things lead in an interesting new direction. In 2013, Orkin co-founded <a href=\"http://www.giantotter.com/\">GiantOtter Technologies</a>, a tech company that\u2019s now taking the idea of human-trained agents and designing advanced conversational AI to power a new generation of human-like chatbots. This is a sector that companies like Facebook, IBM, Google, Apple and Amazon are very interested in, envisioning the use of AI bots in customer relations, tech support and staff training. Reidl is working in this arena too, designing what he calls \u201cinteractive improvisational storytelling chatbots\u201d. </p> <p>Intelligent chatbots are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/18/chatbots-talk-town-interact-humans-technology-silicon-valley\">a big deal in technology right now</a> \u2013 we all watched with horror and amusement when Microsoft released its own bot named Tay onto Twitter earlier this year, only for it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/tay-microsofts-ai-chatbot-gets-a-crash-course-in-racism-from-twitter\">quickly learn racist, sexist behaviours</a>. Both Riedl and Orkin see connections between the idea of chatbot that can converse freely and imaginatively with users and an AI game character who can do the same. Indeed, the fascinating 2014 game The Suspect used IBM\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/watson/\">Watson</a> technology, designed to help coders create convincing humanlike chatbots, to create a police interrogation thriller in which the eponymous suspect is played by the chatbot technology.</p> <p>But while we can understand why big companies like Amazon might want human-like chatbots to provide customer services, the reasoning isn\u2019t so clear for games. Scripted narrative titles such as Mass Effect and Witcher 3 already provide characters and stories that we relate to and feel for. Is it necessary to add the complexity of AI systems that \u201cthink\u201d for themselves and potentially make idiosyncratic decisions based on data not immediately obvious to the player? What will that add?</p> <p>You perhaps have to think about where games are going. Over the last five years we\u2019ve seen a huge design shift away from linear narrative adventures and toward open-world games with procedurally generated landscapes and the capacity for emergent stories. In many ways what\u2019s missing from the highly naturalistic worlds of Grand Theft Auto and Witcher is characters that have their own agendas and internal lives \u2013 that can provide on-the-fly challenges for the player, or just register your existence in the game world. In the action adventure title Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, critics and players reacted very positively to the game\u2019s Nemesis system, which allowed computer-controlled enemies to remember fights they\u2019d had with the player and bring these up in later encounters. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly sophisticated AI system, but it added a sense of permanence and agency to the game \u2013 it made you feel part of a functioning social world. In a similar way, Ubisoft\u2019s sci-fi action game Watch Dogs let users hack into the phones of passers-by and learn about their lives \u2013 a practice that would often kickstart little emergent missions, and drew civilians into the story. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8f8a7df2438e255eec7e1d9c6a2bd664df4d4ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8f8a7df2438e255eec7e1d9c6a2bd664df4d4ea/78_0_2370_1422/1000.png\" alt=\"James Ryan\u2019s Bad News project is a game that uses human actors whose characterisations are governed by an AI program\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad News \u2013 by James Ryan, Ben Samuel, and Adam Summerville \u2013 is a game that uses human actors whose characterisations are governed by an AI program</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What mainstream game developers may need is a third-party AI engine that produces interesting characters for them, without all the expensive research and development. Those solutions are emerging. James Ryan is a PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, working in the <a href=\"https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis\">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a>. He and his collaborators are working on Talk of the Town, an AI platform that creates interactive experiences featuring intelligent characters who have ongoing personalities encompassing emotions, beliefs, memories and relationships. \u201cThere are two core AI problems that Talk of the Town is tackling,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHow do you support autonomous characters who have ongoing subjective experience of the game world, and how do you support unconstrained conversational interaction between player and NPCs? We have systems that decide how people go about their daily routines, and how the various subjective phenomena should be triggered over the course of a character\u2019s day \u2013 things like forming, propagating, misremembering knowledge or memories, and forming or evolving relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan and his collaborators are using three AI elements to power their platform: a dialogue manager to handle conversational flow between characters; a natural language generation (NLG) system that takes the dialogue manager\u2019s decision about how the NPC should respond (structured as a \u201ccontent request\u201d) and generates a line of dialogue that performs accordingly; and a natural language understanding (NLU) system being developed in collaboration with Adam Summerville \u2013 the most complex element. \u201cIt takes in free-text input and converts the player\u2019s utterance to a form that tells the dialogue manager how the world should be changed and how the NPC should respond,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHere, we\u2019re using neural networks \u2013 specifically, the LSTM architecture that\u2019s all the rage right now.\u201d</p> <p>To illustrate the platform Ryan and his collaborators are writing a series of their own small games. In Juke Joint, a collaboration with Tyler Brothers, the player controls a juke box in a bar crowded with AI characters \u2013 the songs you play have a direct affect on the emotions and conversations of the characters allowing you to direct the scene. National Pastime has the player entering a series of towns, interacting with locals and looking to scout baseball players. His experiments are populated by fallible, forgetful characters who exchange information skews through the Chinese Whisper effect of human gossip. It would be a remarkable system in a role-playing game where local myths, rumours and prejudices could cloud a player character\u2019s mission.</p> <p>\u201c[Ryan is] modelling the inner monologues of these AI characters, their thoughts, their emotional states, what they remember, what they\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d says Michael Cook. \u201cThese are all the complicated human qualities that people value in each other, and that we rarely associate with AI. In James\u2019 other game, Bad News, the same AI characters have their memories modelled, so they can see things, forget they saw them, misremember them and overhear someone telling someone else what they remember \u2013 or misremember. James seems very interested in these human qualities and giving AI the power to understand them. He\u2019s one of the coolest games researchers out there at the moment.\u201d </p> <p>Does Ryan see an era in which an AI platform like his could be integrated into a mainstream game? \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream, there are several of us working very hard to make it come true \u2013 Richard Evans and Emily Short included. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"720ba5673f136c023c7ef06dfe5893a08fc62fac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/720ba5673f136c023c7ef06dfe5893a08fc62fac/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Could a future version of Grand Theft Auto feature a city populated by intelligent characters with their own biographies and emotions?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could a future version of Grand Theft Auto feature a city populated by intelligent characters with their own biographies and emotions?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rockstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA major hold-up has been memory issues. GTA can\u2019t even keep a car in memory after it\u2019s left the player\u2019s field of view, so there\u2019s been no room at all for maintaining something resembling a character\u2019s inner world. This is all changing of course, and I think that expanded memory resources could be the boon that makes the next generation of emotional AI not just possible (which it already is), but practical.\u201d</p> <p>Another name to look out for in this sector is Mobius AI. Founded in 2015 by a team of video game veterans and AI researchers, including Aaron Reed, the company is developing an AI platform specifically for the mainstream games industry. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a project to provide game developers with a social AI engine that can power game characters with greater knowledge about the world and the ability to react and perform in dynamic situations, which has never been available before in a complete package like this,\u201d says Reed. \u201cIn the same way game technologies like SpeedTree or PhysX let devs plug in an engine for vegetation or physics, we want to provide an engine for social AI that lets game makers focus on creating interesting characters rather than worry about the tech that drives them.\u201d </p> <p> \u201cThe details of what we\u2019re working on are still under wraps, but one bit of wisdom we\u2019re bringing from our previous projects is that social AI is a different animal from many computer science problems that can be solved by just a better algorithm. Much like the way the brain seems to work, the best solutions seem to involve many small little systems working together to give rise to intelligent-seeming emergent behavior.\u201d</p> <p>Imagine a version of Grand Theft Auto, then, in which the missions don\u2019t just come from a central authored narrative \u2013 they also emerge from the ambitions and conversations of the civilians who usually just dumbly wander the world. What if two ambitious characters with low morality scores meet in a cafe and concoct a plan for a bank robbery. What if they realise they need a good driver, and recruit the player? But imagine their plans were overheard by another AI who decides to foil the plan? These complex systems of ambition and interaction could create totally new forms of game structure.</p> <p>Some action games may even move away from violence altogether. With natural dialogue systems we\u2019re heading into an era where players could negotiate with computer-controlled characters, where persuasion, seduction and intrigue replace guns and aggression. The recent science fiction adventure Event(o) features the player character interacting with a spaceship\u2019s onboard computer in order to convince the machine to plot a course back to Earth. The computer has a range of emotional states and the player has to figure out how to read these and respond to them correctly.</p> <p>At the moment, the premise of conversing with an intelligent computer makes sense because the conversation can be presented to the player through a text interface without it ruining the immersion of the game. The challenge for mainstream titles is to create AI characters that can actually voice their thoughts and feelings, rather than simply display them as text. But that technology is coming: DeepMind recently announced WaveNet, a tool that generates highly convincing human speech. If this were built into a game with natural language capabilities, then simple yet totally emergent conversational interactions could be verbalised by an agent. We\u2019re maybe not far from AI characters who can literally speak their minds \u2013 even though those \u201cminds\u201d may never be that sophisticated.</p> <h2>The age of character adventures</h2> <p>Whatever the technicalities, Reed feels that with more complex emotional AI systems we\u2019ll start to see new types of games \u2013 romantic comedies, character studies, coming-of-age stories \u2013 augmenting rather than replacing the sorts of experiences we now enjoy.</p> <p>\u201cAs we start giving more control to social simulations, we can at first expect to see richer, more intriguing versions of the types of characters we have now,\u201d says Reed. \u201cShopkeepers who can carry on a more dynamic conversation, quest-givers or lore-spouters who can answer questions or respond to your specific circumstances, and so on.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut as your system gets smarter and you\u2019re willing to give it more control, it really starts suggesting entirely new genres of game that don\u2019t yet exist. Part of the reason you don\u2019t see many character-focused games right now is that games aren\u2019t yet really *about* character interaction: they\u2019re about moving through environments, defeating enemies, jumping over gaps, and so on. Once we\u2019ve got the tech to make characters playable, those stories become possible to tell in interactive form: but through a profoundly different lens. </p> <p>If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now that <em>would</em> be interesting. Perhaps not in the context of Doom (there will always be games that are just about shooting and having fun \u2013 and that\u2019s <em>fine</em>), but in totally new gaming paradigms. Surely it will be more meaningful, more emotionally resonant if your seduction of Yennifer in Witcher 3 or Garrus in Mass Effect came, not through a scripted tree of pre-packaged conversations, but through a dynamic relationship? One thing\u2019s for sure, we would certainly find out more about those other characters.</p> <p>As Reed puts it: \u201cIn much the same way that playing with a simulation of fire or fluid dynamics can lead you to deeper understanding or quicker insights than simply reading about them, truly interactive characters potentially let us have a more immediate and intuitive kind of relationship with them than with characters in linear stories. And that is really exciting.\u201d</p>",

He said BHP had failed to mention those audits when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/16/australia-mining-tax\">mining tax debate </a>was in full swing.</p> <p>\u201cSome of us in this place remember 2010 and the mining tax debate,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember it pretty well.</p> <p>\u201cTwo things really stand out in my mind. One was BHP and Rio Tinto frothing with outrage at the very suggestion they were paying too little tax during a period when Australia\u2019s mineral resources (owned by the Australian public, not by them) were enjoying record high prices. </p> <p>\u201cThe other was the claim that the government\u2019s proposed resource rent tax would destroy their operations, close projects and kill jobs.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the central arguments BHP used at the time was that they paid very high rates of corporate tax, and this somehow excused paying a historically low share of tax on the supernormal resource rents they were earning.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now we know the truth. Between 2005 and 2014, BHP sold Australian minerals to its Singapore marketing hub to avoid paying taxes on profits of $5.7bn. While BHP paid $1bn in top-up taxes, these taxes only applied to 58% of the profit generated through the Singapore marketing hub. </p> <p>\u201cA full 42% of the profit was untaxed in Australia. Nor was it taxed by the government in the UK, where BHP is co-owned. The directors of BHP Australia and BHP UK are the same people.\u201d</p> <p>Swan said the tax paid by BHP represented only 10% to 12% of its total profits, made almost exclusively by selling Australian resources. </p> <p>He said the miner\u2019s Singapore operation was \u201cclearly an artifice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile BHP maintains that its Singapore operations are at arm\u2019s-length from its Australian branch, I make the simple point again that the directors of both the UK and the Australian entities that control the Singapore hub are the same people,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis situation is clearly an artifice.</p> <p>\u201cAt the height of the mining tax debate BHP were inflating the impact of the minerals resource rent tax on their operations while funnelling their profits through foreign tax havens.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs the government negotiated with miners in good faith on critical tax issues, the miners were expanding their tax avoidance regimes.\u201d</p> <p>Swan made his accusations in the House of Representatives while a parliamentary delegation from Singapore was looking on.</p> <p>He then attacked the Business Council of Australia, saying its failure to speak out about aggressive transfer pricing had compromised its \u201cstanding and credibility\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTax avoidance is a huge part of the trashing of public faith in democratic legitimacy around the world,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cEveryday workers have the sense the economy is an inside/outside game, in which the wealthy play by different rules and everyone else is denied opportunity. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not wrong. And at least in part, this is what is driving the popularity of modern political demagogues from Donald Trump to Marine Le Pen. </p> <p>\u201cAnd the activities of companies like BHP in Australia who are constantly making pious calls for bipartisanship and quality reform, are leading to further polarisation and less faith in our democratic institutions.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for BHP Billiton sent this response to Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cOur Australian adjusted effective tax rate, inclusive of corporate tax, petroleum resource rent tax, and royalties, in financial year 2016 was approximately 57%. Our global rate was slightly higher at 59%. This demonstrates that we pay our \u2018fair share\u2019 of tax both in Australia and globally.\u201d</p> <p>BHP did not say anything about the years before 2016.</p> <p>Swan said there was a conventional distinction, in typical tax discussions, between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, but in reality there was a spectrum.</p> <p>\u201c[BHP\u2019s] behaviour leads me to believe that they have operated at the evasion end of the spectrum for over a decade,\u201d he said.</p>",

After all, if you have a terrible aversion to artists lip synching, you\u2019re probably best off avoiding arena pop shows altogether, in the same way that if you have a terrible aversion to petrol pumps and buckets full of flowers, you\u2019re best off avoiding garage forecourts. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He looks either bored or miserable, like a man who's been doing this since he was 15 and doesn't really want to any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Besides, there\u2019s plenty of other stuff on display to distract you: HD projections that appear to meld with the dancers on stage, fireworks, a vast platform that hovers over the crowd, equipped with a trampoline, the better for Bieber to somersault on. And no matter whether he\u2019s actually singing it or not, the music sounds OK. The best stuff mostly comes from last year\u2019s album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/justin-bieber-purpose-review-a-grown-up-sorry-sort-of\">Purpose</a>, not least the flatly fantastic single What Do You Mean?, but the qualitative gulf between its canny pop takes on tropical house and EDM and his earlier work isn\u2019t as quite great as the reviews would suggest: some of Purpose is awful, particularly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkjwn240AMc\">Children</a>, which resembles one of those creepy songs Michael Jackson persisted in recording during the latter part of his career; whereas Baby, a single Bieber recorded before his voice broke, still feels pretty sparky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edd4eca5aca4310947f75c471fa1d63251b87954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edd4eca5aca4310947f75c471fa1d63251b87954/0_0_2608_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber on stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"839\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Weird void\u2019 \u2026 Justin Bieber on stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem with the show is Bieber himself. It\u2019s not so much that he cuts an uncharismatic figure on stage, although he does. It\u2019s that he looks either bored senseless or actively miserable, like a man who\u2019s been hauling himself around the world doing this kind of thing since he was 15 and doesn\u2019t really want to do it any more. Somehow the choreography \u2013 which inclines to half-hearted hip-hop moves, or worse, robotics interspersed with Bieber grabbing frantically at his crotch, like an android suffering from pubic lice \u2013 seems to compound the feeling that there\u2019s a weird void at the centre of the show where the star should be.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.axs.com/events/299526/justin-bieber-tickets\">At the O2 Arena, London, 12, 14 and 15 October</a>.

Last year as a result of Labor\u2019s tax transparency legislation, tax office data revealed that one in three private companies paid no tax and one in four public corporate entities operating in Australia paid no tax. In addition, half of the foreign companies operating in Australia had no taxable income while 56 millionaires paid no income tax in 2013, not even the Medicare levy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swan then got specific about BHP and called on the board to provide a full and frank explanation of their role.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a stark contrast between the esteem in which BHP, its executive and the board expect to be held and their actual behaviour. </p> <p>BHP has an experienced Board;<strong> Jack Nasser, Andrew MacKenzie, Malcolm Brinded, Malcolm Broomhead, Pat Davies, Anita Frew, Carolyn Hewson, Ken MacKenzie, Lindsay Maxsted, Wayne Murdy, Dr John Schubert </strong>and<strong> Baroness Shirti Vadera. </strong></p> <p>The Board should provide a full and frank explanation of their role in approving this aggressive transfer pricing scheme. <strong>The board of BHP has not been true to the values they espouse in their charter of corporate responsibility.</strong></p> <p>Corporations are not ends in themselves. The community cannot allow the corporate veil to hide the moral responsibility of those that run them. When companies fail to pay their fair share of tax, revenue must be found elsewhere from businesses and individual taxpayers. </p> <p>The billions of dollars avoided are forever lost to education and infrastructure, which are investments vital to growth and ultimately support the bottom line for business....</p> <p>At a time when this government hacks and slashes at the social safety net in the name of budget repair, it is simply obscene for corporates to walk away with money on this scale.</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between the respect boards and executives expect and what their actual behaviour merits.

What we have done is make sure Australians pay their fair share of tax, multi-nationals will be paying their fair share of tax.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdaff9e4b05d915e4240b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:38:38.684Z\">4.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Senate question time, senator <strong>Penny Wong</strong> has taken up the attack on attorney general <strong>George Brandis </strong>by asking why he failed to stick up for the solicitor general when he was criticised by senator <strong>Ian MacDonald</strong>.<br></p> <p>Wong said that as the first legal officer, Brandis is obliged to stand up for independent statutory officers like <strong>Justin Gleeson</strong> and Australian Human Rights Commission president, <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/george-brandis-says-he-was-not-aware-of-political-games-attack-on-solicitor-general\">MacDonald accused Gleeson and Triggs of \u201cbeing involved in political games\u201d</a>, and Wong adds MacDonald said Gleeson\u2019s advice \u201chas not been all that hot\u201d and his submission to an parliamentary committee examining the spat with Brandis was \u201cterribly unprofessional\u201d.</p> <p>The attorney general sticks to his guns that he didn\u2019t read or hear MacDonald\u2019s speech and adds that in an interview with Radio National Brandis had said \u201csome very gracious things\u201d about Gleeson.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s see how cordial the attorney general and solicitor general are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/george-brandis-to-front-inquiry-into-veto-over-solicitor-general-advice\">when they appear on Friday before the committee inquiring</a> into Brandis\u2019 veto over referrals for legal advice.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdafb9e4b01d9dd2c90182\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:36:35.317Z\">4.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/786047715037765633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;It&#39;s nice to be popular Mr Speaker&quot; Tony Abbott reacts to interjections from labor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/QT?src=hash\">#QT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabriellechan\">@gabriellechan</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fe3l4dNc3c\">pic.twitter.com/fe3l4dNc3c</a></p>&mdash; Mikearoo (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/786047715037765633\">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdaf43e4b01d9dd2c90181\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:36:21.104Z\">4.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dixer question to Morrison is on Labor not supporting the government\u2019s enterprise tax plan which cuts tax for small moving to large businesses.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdae40e4b01d9dd2c90180\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:34:00.792Z\">4.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor goes to negative gearing.

Here are a few highlights:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I genuinely believe that politics is a noble calling, not a grubby, necessary evil. We are so incredibly fortunate to live in free and fair democracies where we have the right to run for parliament. Jo was an exceptional person, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But she wasn\u2019t unique, and she would have been the first person to say so. There are so many women in our communities who could serve with distinction: we need to help them to get into parliament and to be proud to be political.</p> <p>Of course, this isn\u2019t just about numbers, and it\u2019s not about \u2018having a go\u2019. It\u2019s about results. <strong>Women need power to change things.</strong> You can\u2019t change things if you are a name on a ballot, a quota filled \u2013 you need your seat in parliament. Participation is the start, but power is the end. Jo knew that \u2013 it\u2019s why she worked so hard across party lines to make sure that women were running for seats they could win and it\u2019s why she herself joined a party where she stood a shot of becoming an MP and, one day, a minister, even a prime minister.</p> <p>Jo had courage, but she was also unashamed to have ambition. She wanted to go far, and she wanted to lift up others as she climbed. There\u2019s no stain in aspiring to the highest office in your country. It doesn\u2019t taint the purity of your purpose.</p> <p>Today, I want to say to you loudly and clearly: have the highest of ambitions for yourself, for your purpose. Jo believed Britain could be a force for change in the world, and she fought for that.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is a lot more, in fact I could copy the whole speech over but question time looms. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:08:36.036Z\">at 4.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fda136e4b01d9dd2c90178\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:43:50.906Z\">3.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wong again calls for Brandis to resign. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ea3ece305fc46d618f60168c4b3185d7e4e0e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ea3ece305fc46d618f60168c4b3185d7e4e0e9c/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penny Wong has a go at the attorney general, George Brandis, in the Senate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny Wong has a go at the attorney general, George Brandis, in the Senate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:09:14.930Z\">at 4.09am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fda088e4b01d9dd2c90177\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:33:29.317Z\">3.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Wong\u2019s case:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This matter started when s<strong>enator Brandis</strong> made an amendment to the <strong>legal services directions</strong> in May.</p> <p>The legal services directions set out rules and requirements for the performance of commonwealth legal work.</p> <p>Brandis\u2019s amending direction bars the solicitor general from providing legal opinions or advice to anyone in government without the attorney general\u2019s permission.</p> <p>It prohibits any commonwealth agency or officer from referring a question of law to the solicitor general without the written permission of the attorney general.</p> <p>This is a blatant power grab.</p> <p>It is a bid to control the flow of legal advice from the independent solicitor general to government departments and to senior figures in the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:39:39.101Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd9fd9e4b05d915e4240a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:30:03.850Z\">3.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wong is reprising the dispute between the AG and the SG. </p> <p>Wong says Brandis seems to believe that the only legal opinion anyone may need is his opinion. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd9ee7e4b03b22b4fb274f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:27:05.321Z\">3.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OK, in the Senate, <strong>Penny Wong</strong> is talking <strong>George Brandis</strong>, his greatest hits and his latest dispute with the solicitor general.</p> <p>She says the attorney general should not mislead the parliament and the public.

The Australian Electoral Commission investigated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/voter-investigation-not-about-political-gain-say-indi-campaigners\">then the Australian federal police</a>.</p> <p>The AFP then charged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/niece-of-federal-mp-cathy-mcgowan-faces-court-over-alleged-election\">Maggie Ellen McGowan, 27, and Sophie Petrea Fuchsen, 24</a>, with providing false and misleading information, alleging the pair voted in the seat of Indi while living in Melbourne during the 2013 election.</p> <p>The case dragged on and eventually was thrown out in April this year, almost two years after it began. From the story:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Outside court the women\u2019s lawyer, <strong>Rob Stary</strong>, said the case was bound to fail and a terrible waste of resources.</p> <p>Both women were students at the time and the AEC website clearly said students did not need to change their \u201chome address\u201d, he had told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThe original complaint, whoever it was that initiated it, was quite scurrilous,\u201d Stary told reporters.</p> </blockquote> <p>The heart of the issue is around country kids who go to cities to study. As they often have no fixed address, they remain enrolled for voting and other purposes at their family home. But within this loophole, someone found cause to complain. On the numbers, given these are conservative electorates in regional Australia, it seems incredible that the complaint may have originated within the Coalition. If these young people cannot enrol at their home address, it is likely they would remain without a vote. </p> <p>Anyway back to McGowan. She wants the appointment of a minister for young people, to \u201caddress systemic barriers that prevent young people from civic participation, to advocate on their behalf, and help ensure that when policies affecting young people are considered, they do not have an adverse impact\u201d.</p> <p>This is what she said last night.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is confusion about enrolment rules. The involvement of the Australian federal police, Australian Electoral Commission and media in the affairs of 27 young people in my electorate caused the loss of trust in our democratic political institutions. In 2016 approximately 350,000 eligible young people were not enrolled to vote. In the eyes of many young people, these events are even more reason why they feel it makes no sense to engage. No wrongdoing was found after rigorous investigation but these young people are still being scrutinised. We need to stand up for our young people, we need to support them and we need to encourage them to participate in politics. The AEC needs to be supported to engage young people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:23:58.236Z\">at 3.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd8fe5e4b01d9dd2c9016b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T01:34:06.969Z\">2.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A summary, before the time gets away.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Singaporean prime minister has addressed the parliament praising the relationship between Australia and Singapore.

This is a battle that has been going on for decades now.

  "<p>The skyline along Manhattan\u2019s Upper Fifth Avenue, where it flanks Central Park, is dominated by vast, verdant clouds of American elm trees. Their high-arched branches and luminous green canopies form \u2013 as historian Jill Jones puts it \u2013 \u201ca beautiful cathedral of shade\u201d. When she started researching her new book, <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314478/urban-forests-by-jill-jonnes/9780670015665/\">Urban Forests</a>, she\u2019d have struggled to identify the species \u2013 but now, she says, \u201cwhen I see one, I say \u2018Oh my goodness, this is a rare survivor,\u2019 and deeply appreciate the fact that it\u2019s there.\u201d</p> <p>The American elm was once America\u2019s most beloved and abundant city tree. It liked urban soil, and its branches spread out a safe distance above traffic, to provide the dappled shade that cities depended on before air conditioning. </p> <p>Now, however, most of the big, old elms have been wiped out by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_elm_disease\">Dutch elm disease</a>. Many of them were replaced by ash, which have in turn been killed by another imported pest: the emerald ash borer. By the 1970s, writes Jones, much of America\u2019s urban tree cover had fallen victim to \u201cdisease, development and shrinking municipal budgets\u201d.</p> <p>Thousands of miles away, in Bangkok, the main threat is construction work. After a group of residents tried in vain to save several mature trees on their lane, which were felled to make way for a car park, they formed a tree advocacy group, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BIGTreesProject/about\">Big Trees Project</a>.</p> <p>Within weeks, membership swelled to 16,000. Forestry officer at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO),<em> </em>Simone Borelli tells me of similar tree advocacy groups in Malaysia, India and Central African Republic, where the capital, Bangui, has \u201cgrown out of the forest and is eating it up\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f46ca8fabc7a240bd315527ee1cc6f3cc2971adb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f46ca8fabc7a240bd315527ee1cc6f3cc2971adb/0_221_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elm trees line Fifth Avenue alongside Central Park in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elm trees line Fifth Avenue by Central Park in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This month will see representatives from the world\u2019s cities convene in Quito, Ecuador, for the United Nations conference on sustainable urban development, <a href=\"https://habitat3.org/about/\">Habitat III</a>.

Research has turned up fascinating evidence as to why town councils, planners and developers \u2013 in whose hands the fate of urban trees lies \u2013 should take heed.</p> <p>Until recently, says Jones, city officials saw trees as \u201cexpensive ornaments\u201d. But what is now known about the ecological services that trees provide is staggering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Until recently, city officials saw trees as expensive ornaments.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trees can cool cities by between 2C and 8C. When planted near buildings, trees can cut air conditioning use by 30%, and, according to the UN Urban Forestry office, reduce heating energy use by a further 20-50%. One large tree can absorb 150kg of carbon dioxide a year, as well as filter some of the airborne pollutants, including fine particulates.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to put a price on how an avenue of plane trees can muffle the roar of a main road, although trees do on average increase the value of property by 20%. Perhaps money does grow on them after all. </p> <p>When the New York City park department measured the economic impact of its trees, the benefits added up to $120m a year. (Compare that to the $22m annual parks department expenditure.) There were $28m worth of energy savings, $5m worth of air quality improvements and $36m of costs avoided in mitigating storm water flooding.

This would see the closure of about 1500MW of coal-fired generation in Queensland but limit state subsidies to renewable producers to $50m.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe stronger national action pathway is not within the direct control of the Queensland government, but represents a credible scenario in the context of national climate change policy,\u201d it said.</p> <p>A national emissions intensity scheme would drive Queensland to reach 41% renewable energy generation, leaving state government action to deliver 1900MW to hit the 50% target.</p> <p>The other scenarios, a steady increase in renewable generation or a ramp-up closer to 2030 to take advantage of cheaper technology, would both cut emissions by 25%. The steady increase would cost significantly more via renewable subsidies at $900m versus $500m under the \u201cramp pathway\u201d but the cumulative cuts would be greater.</p> <p>Under both the steady and ramp scenarios, \u201cno closure of existing fossil-fuel generators [is] expected prior to 2030\u201d but their operating cash flows would take a hit of between $600m and $1.1bn.</p> <p>This would affect mostly the state, which owns two-thirds of generation capacity. </p> <p>The panel recommended the renewables policy action be funded through \u201celectricity market mechanisms\u201d, with the forecast \u201ccost-neutral outcome\u201d being a result of \u201cmodelled suppression\u201d of wholesale power prices offsetting renewables subsidies.</p> <p>But this pricing outcome was \u201cnot guaranteed and could differ, for example, if existing generation capacity is withdrawn from the market, especially coal-fired generation\u201d, the report says.</p> <p>The Queensland energy minister, Mark Bailey, said the release of the report was a \u201cgroundbreaking development\u201d in the government\u2019s pursuit of its renewables goal.</p> <p>It showed \u201cQueensland can meet a 50 per cent renewable energy target while maintaining electricity security and reliability over the next 14 years\u201d.</p> <p>It also showed the \u201chuge benefits\u201d to the state economy through $6.7bn in new investment, especially in regional areas, and a net average increase in jobs, both direct and indirect, of between 6,400 and 6,700 a year, he said.</p> <p>After South Australia\u2019s recent power blackout, Frydenberg <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/frydneberg-warning-over-pursuit-of-unrealistically-high-renewable-energy-targets/news-story/497043a21d73e06a64231017aaa3043d\">told Sky News</a> that state governments had an \u201cillusion at the moment about the impact that renewables are having on the system\u201d.</p> <p>He warned of the \u201clack of consistency in quantity of generation\u201d from heavy reliance on renewables.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the states pursuing these ridiculously high and unrealistic state-based renewable energy targets,\u201d Frydenberg said. </p> <p>\u201cIn Queensland, they have a 50% renewable energy target by 2030 when they only have about 4.5% of renewable generation currently \u2026 We really need to get the states and the commonwealth on the same page when it comes to their state-based targets and the federal target which, for us, is 23.5% by 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Seelig, of the Queensland Conservation Council, said the panel\u2019s draft report showed recent commentary about renewables targets being unrealistic was \u201cwrong, and that in fact there are several options for achieving the targets\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cQueensland is the highest emitter of carbon pollution of all the Australian states, and electricity generation is the largest single source of those emissions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is therefore imperative that renewable electricity generation is made a high priority in Queensland.\u201d</p>",

But mainly in just how it is: regular people doing their thing, utterly convincingly (I\u2019m obviously speaking with zero recognition here, having no idea what it\u2019s like to like be a young black woman in LA). Nor does it seem to shout \u201cthis is the voice of a generation\u201d as loud as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls\" title=\"\">Girls</a> does. It just kind of says: this is me, and my life, here.</p> <p>Race plays a part, of course, in the humour especially. \u201cWhy you talk like a white girl?\u201d a young student asks Issa (she works for a non-profit organisation called We Got Y\u2019All, which helps kids in the \u2019hood and is otherwise staffed by worthy white folks from very much out of the \u2019hood). \u201cWhite people love her,\u201d she says of Molly, before adding, \u201cBlack people love her\u201d \u2013 as if she has somehow achieved the impossible by appealing to both (she does so by behaving very differently, depending on who she\u2019s with). But, as Rae has <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/7/13176104/issa-rae-insecure-hbo-interview\" title=\"\">said</a>, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a show exclusively about, like, the struggle of being black.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cjust regular black people living life\u201d.</p> <p>Here, characterisation and dialogue \u2013 plus monologue (Issa spends a lot of time addressing and rapping at herself in the mirror) \u2013 are everything. And they\u2019re brilliant. \u201cI don\u2019t make love; I fuck,\u201d Issa tells the bathroom mirror, not entirely convincingly. Love her \u201cBroken Pussy\u201d rap too, more than Molly does \u2013 unsurprisingly, seeing as it\u2019s about her, and Issa\u2019s performing it very publicly, at an open mic night.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lovely portrait of friendship. Issa and Molly are so close that they know what the other is thinking, and are always getting on each other\u2019s wicks, though that might not be the phrase they use in South Los Angeles. Whatever. Insecure is smart, fresh, and funny. And it\u2019s confident, funnily enough.</p>",

Bernie is saying we can change the world,\u201d an adviser wrote to Podesta, the campaign chairman, at one point. </p> <p>After Sanders won big in the February New Hampshire primary, the Clinton team discussed its strategy for the upcoming states of South Carolina and Nevada.</p> <p>In Nevada, an adviser <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4324\">wrote</a>, \u201cOur biggest concern is enthusiasm and caucus knowledge. Sanders supporters are more likely to know the ins and outs of the caucus. To mitigate this, in the upcoming days our field team is focusing on caucus education among our supporters.\u201d</p> <p>In South Carolina, the same adviser, Elan Kriegel, noted: \u201cLike Nevada, our support is particularly high with people of color and we are roughly tied with white voters. The difference between the states is that far more African-American voters will participate in South Carolina than Nevada.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign had <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5115\">lengthy discussions</a> over how to retract and apologize for Clinton\u2019s assertion at Nancy Reagan\u2019s funeral that the former first lady had \u201cstarted a national conversation\u201d about HIV/Aids \u201cwhen before nobody would talk about it.\u201d The Reagans did not acknowledge the epidemic as it unfolded.</p> <p><a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4433\">On a separate email chain</a>, aides discuss whether the phrase \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d should be in a Clinton speech in New Hampshire about small business. A draft of the speech had Clinton saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m running for President because you and Americans everywhere need a champion. And I want to be that champion. </p> </blockquote> <p>At which Podesta weighed in:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I\u2019m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion. I think if she doesn\u2019t say it once, people will notice and say we false started in Iowa.</p> </blockquote> <p>Do you notice how Podesta did not place the phrase \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d in quotes in his email? So have a lot of Trump supporters, who are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShillForHillary/status/785885391718973440\">asserting</a> that the email is a smoking gun proving that Hillary Clinton has begun to hate everyday Americans, which it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>On a separate email chain, then-DNC vice chair and CNN commentator Donna Brazile shares in advance a question about the death penalty that Clinton might face at a CNN town hall: \u201cHere\u2019s one that worries me about HRC,\u201d Brazile <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/wikileaks-email-hack-clinton-donna-brazile-229609\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>Much of the emails show the campaign discussing media strategy and emailing with the media, in some cases on friendly terms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/785888097426894848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pretty shocked by these Wikileaks reveals showing good reporters working good sources.

The Wisconsin Republican is in an excruciating spot: He feels torn between his own conscience and his obligations as the top Republican in the country, according to multiple sources in leadership familiar with the internal discussions.</p> <p>Not to mention, nearly everyone in House Republican leadership believes there are more embarrassing revelations about Trump to come before Nov. 8.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25a53ec42e51a014f0a8f99439b2cde397d3f35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25a53ec42e51a014f0a8f99439b2cde397d3f35f/0_20_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chukwudi Iwuji as Hamlet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chukwudi Iwuji as Hamlet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus/2016 Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/785502365130555393\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ryan is still endorsing Trump. <a href=\"https://t.co/L30EZvUbm0\">https://t.co/L30EZvUbm0</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/785502365130555393\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/costareports/status/785860056021606401\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some context: the person closest to Trump right now -- Bannon -- published this story about Ryan in July <a href=\"https://t.co/ktEjVbLV28\">https://t.co/ktEjVbLV28</a></p>&mdash; Robert Costa (@costareports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/costareports/status/785860056021606401\">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:16:49.109Z\">at 4.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcfd29e4b03b22b4fb24bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T14:55:45.011Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Instead of embedding each new Trump tweet in its own block, we\u2019ll do periodic roundups (if he keeps going).

His hands are clasped on his chest as if in pain, and his eyes, tilted to the sky, are scrunched shut. Yami Lester, you see, is blind.</p> <p>Lester was just a child when the British tested the atomic bomb near his home in the Australian outback, in what came to be known as Maralinga. \u201cIt was coming from the south \u2013 black, like smoke,\u201d he later recalled. \u201cI was thinking it might be a dust storm, but it was quiet, just moving through the trees.\u201d </p> <p>Elders thought it was an evil spirit and tried to use <em>woomera</em> (spear-throwers) to disperse it.

Spanning 70 years, from Hiroshima to today, it covers artistic reactions to nuclear warfare from more than 30 artists, Indigenous and non-Indigenous.<br></p> <p>Black Mist Burnt Country may be broad in scope but it concentrates heavily on the infamous 1956 Maralinga tests in South Australia\u2019s Great Victoria Desert. Maralinga is an Aboriginal word for thunder: the cathartic clearing of a stormy sky. In this case, however, the word has taken on a far darker meaning. Indigenous people were forcibly removed from their lands or, if they stayed, suffered horrific injuries. Service and military personal working on the sites, too, were exposed to hazardous radiation.</p> <p>As such, blindness is a central metaphor. Black Mist Burnt Country examines the physical repercussions of atomic tests (from cancer to deformities to loss of sight). Yet blindness also references a government who wilfully ignored repercussions from its actions, shrouded its deeds in secrecy, and shied away from responsibility.</p> <p>Craig McDonald\u2019s 2010 bronze sculpture, Maralinga Test Dummy, shows a man, his body taut with excitement, watching the explosion through a visor. He notes in the catalogue: \u201cBlindness, from viewing the blasts, was a real threat, but this figure explores the notion of a more menacing blindness \u2013 that of ignorance coupled with colonial arrogance.\u201d<br></p> <p>There are meaty issues here, both historical and spiritual. Yet while such themes are explored in Black Mist Burnt Country\u2019s well-researched curatorial essay, the exhibition falls short of telling a coherent story. More detailed information, not to mention placing the works in some sort of timeline rather than their current haphazard arrangement, is badly needed to maximise the full impact of what is essentially a tale of horror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1755d3d1825df49d373f370d20851fd93590349c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1755d3d1825df49d373f370d20851fd93590349c/0_0_2000_2684/745.jpg\" alt=\"Central Desert: Atomic Test, by Sidney Nolan.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Central Desert: Atomic Test, by Sidney Nolan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sidney Nolan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, there are some impressive paintings. They include one of Sidney Nolan\u2019s lesser-known landscapes, not seen by the public until 2001. Central Desert: Atomic Test, painted in the 1950s, shows a terrain so red it is almost raw, like exposed flesh. In the forefront sit mountains the colour of charred bone, and in the distance \u2013 far enough away as to almost be imperceptible \u2013 is a mushroom cloud that explodes against a queasy blue sky.</p> <p>Arthur Boyd, a pacifist, also painted the atomic bomb in his Shoalhaven series. Jonah on the Shoalhaven \u2013 Outside the City (1976) shows Jonah as a half-human, half-animal carcass sprawled under a lone tree. </p> <p>His stomach is ripped open violently, revealing gold coins stored in his guts, and a mushroom explodes in the distance behind the walled city of Nineveh. As with Nolan it is set against blue sky, this time brilliant cobalt.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f2b7996d782f7c0c10aeaf32965e2a157fea72f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f2b7996d782f7c0c10aeaf32965e2a157fea72f/0_0_3941_4944/797.jpg\" alt=\"Jonah on the Shoalhaven \u2013 Outside the City (1976), by Arthur Boyd.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonah on the Shoalhaven \u2013 Outside the City (1976), by Arthur Boyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Little/Arthur Boyd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Nolan and Boyd represent the big showy set pieces, smaller works speak just as loudly.

Done at significant cost and with good intention, they seem reasonable enough. After all, in order to address the matter, it\u2019s important to know what makes patients unhappy. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As the saying goes, a happy patient can still be a dead patient</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But poor patient experience surveys must be an executive\u2019s nemesis. Pleasing political masters means performing magic and making the problem vanish, preferably before an election comes around, but addressing the cause is a lot like peeling an onion, uncovering layer upon layer of challenge that makes one weep. </p> <p>Firstly, patient experience is not the same as patient satisfaction. A patient who is shaken awake every four hours might be in a rotten mood the next morning but those neurological observations might just have saved her life. </p> <p>A patient denied jam on his toast might say the service stinks but better a grumpy diabetic than a comatose one. As the saying goes, a happy patient can still be a dead patient. But patients aren\u2019t na\u00efve and many understand the clinical imperatives that determine their experience. </p> <p>Whether it\u2019s waiting hours in the emergency department, being stuck on a trolley, facing delay in surgery or awaiting chemotherapy, very few patients make an actual fuss \u2013 because they see that doctors and nurses are doing their best. </p> <p>Indeed, the neediest patients tend to complain the least \u2013 perhaps because they are tired but also because their experience of chronic illness has taught them patience and empathy. No, this should not be an excuse for provider complacency. </p> <p>For most patients, a genuinely poor experience results from a lack of communication and a failure of compassion. Combine deferred surgery, lying in a trolley, a cancelled appointment and a hurried consultation with a lack of decent explanation and no acknowledgement of suffering and you have a real problem with patient experience. </p> <p>A poor patient experience is leaving an incontinent patient wet because there is a shortage of nurses and when a confused patient can\u2019t be fed because the nurse has two hands and five patients. It\u2019s when you can\u2019t reach your water jug, and when you do, it\u2019s empty. It\u2019s being desperate for a hot tea, a warm shower and a working call-bell. When patient dignity suffers, there are no winners \u2013 a bad patient experience is a guilty provider experience. Realising this isn\u2019t rocket science but ushering change is really hard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hospital medicine is increasingly conducted amid apologies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every frontline clinician knows that no amount of ward redesign, geographical shuffling of patients or imaginative rebranding will solve the fundamental problem of having fewer doctors and nurses on the floor to deal with increasingly complex patient needs. Studies show that extra staffing of registered nurses improves patient outcomes. Nurses flag early signs of deterioration, help patients mobilise safely, and step in when doctors don\u2019t or won\u2019t communicate effectively. Having good nurses on the ward transforms the environment \u2013 interns feel secure, specialists feel supported, and patients benefit from earlier discharge and lower readmission rates. </p> <p>An ageing population has placed an unprecedented demand on allied health services like physiotherapists and social workers but it seems as if no one saw this coming. Try finding a service on a weekend and you could be waiting all day. </p> <p>\u201cIf your patient isn\u2019t homeless or destitute right this minute, I can\u2019t get to it,\u201d apologised one lone, harried social worker covering an entire hospital.</p> <p>Heart and kidneys don\u2019t wait for a quiet weekday to fail. An appendix doesn\u2019t wait for an available theatre to burst. Tottering patients don\u2019t know not to fall on a Sunday. Clearly, infrastructure and planning are not for an individual doctor to fix but when hospitals perform poorly, the spotlight shines inevitably on doctors.</p> <p>Hospital medicine is increasingly conducted amid apologies. I am sorry you can\u2019t have your operation today. I am sorry the morphine took so long. I am sorry you have vomit-stained clothes. I am sorry your son left before a doctor could get here. </p> <p>The apologies are necessary and it\u2019s humbling that they heal more than mere words should, but apologies without action slowly erode us because we know that tomorrow will be filled with more apologies and so will the day after and the day after that. Those who engage with patients know that you can\u2019t soothe and trick people into thinking they are getting better care \u2013 you actually have to provide it. But as long as bureaucrats answer to politicians and clinicians answer to patients, the tension will remain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/hospital-crises-show-the-gap-between-how-doctors-and-patients-perceive-events\">Hospital crises show the gap between how doctors and patients perceive events | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some people just leave. \u201cI get paid better for a different headache,\u201d says one surgeon, who quit the public system after ten years of battling a dysfunctional outpatient system. But many others stay, in part due to a philosophical belief that their exceptional training should benefit the least well-off in society. It is especially these doctors and nurses we want to shield from disillusionment.</p> <p>Having observed healthcare delivery in some of the best institutions in the world, I have been struck by one observation. It\u2019s when executives regularly make time to visit the wards and interact with patients, families and all manner of providers, from physicians and nurses to porters and aides. </p> <p>They peer into a decrepit bathroom, pick up a flimsy frame, sit in a wobbly chair, taste the tepid tea \u2013 and discover what makes for a poor patient experience. A clinician leader who doesn\u2019t see patients frequently loses touch with their most human concerns. A non-clinician heading finance, operations or human resources, is never exposed to the daily realities of human suffering yet is charged with making far-reaching decisions that impact all our lives.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign fired back on Tuesday as WikiLeaks released a new tranche of hacked emails from the account of its chairman, John Podesta, dubbing the website a \u201cpropaganda arm of the Russian government\u201d seeking to help elect the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.</p> <p>The latest batch of more than 2,000 emails, disclosed on Monday, offered a glimpse into the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. They included insights on multiple fronts, such as a lack of preparedness for Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign, concerns raised by Chelsea Clinton over potential conflicts of interest for the family\u2019s foundation, and efforts by aides on how to best frame the former secretary of state\u2019s second bid for the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton-bill-accusers-jones-willey-broaddrick\">Did Hillary Clinton intimidate Bill's accusers?

Clinton\u2019s campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of the emails, but in recent days escalated its charge that the hack was conducted by Russian state actors.</p> <p>Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign, fired off a tweet storm late on Monday in which he assailed WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, for working on behalf of the Russian government.</p> <p>\u201cYou are no media organization,\u201d Fallon tweeted at WikiLeaks. \u201cYou are a propaganda arm of the Russian government, running interference for their pet candidate, Trump.</p> <p>\u201cHow about probing possibility of Trump associates directly coordinating with Russia and WikiLeaks? That is the thing that should cause chills,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In another tweet, Fallon acknowledged that reporters would be interested in their internal campaign operation but implored the media to scrutinize collusion between the hackers and Trump\u2019s associates.</p> <p>\u201cFor God sakes, Roger Stone admitted meeting with Assange,\u201d Fallon said of one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers.</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good reading to see internal discussions [about] Trump\u2019s taxes? Yes but WikiLeaks isn\u2019t targeting Trump.

In another, Podesta said he was \u201cskeptical\u201d about hitting Sanders on his gun control record, which during the Democratic primary became one of Clinton\u2019s more prominent lines of attack against the Vermont senator. </p> <p>\u201cInterestingly, I am worried about blowback from our supporters,\u201d Podesta wrote, as the campaign mulled criticizing Sanders in an op-ed that ran in Clinton\u2019s name in the New York Daily News.</p> <p>Aides ultimately concluded they would \u201ctone down the contrast\u201d between Clinton and her Democratic opponent.</p> <p>One exchange revealed tensions between Clinton\u2019s longtime aide Doug Band and her daughter Chelsea Clinton in late 2011, when Chelsea cited \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the blurring of lines between the family\u2019s foundation and Band\u2019s consulting company, Teneo. </p> <p>Band, who insisted his company had \u201calmost nothing to do\u201d with the Clintons or its foundation, lashed out at Chelsea in an email to Podesta on the subject.</p> <p>\u201cShe is acting like a spoiled brat who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she\u2019s doing because she, as she has said, hasn\u2019t found her way and has a lack of focus in her life,\u201d Band wrote.</p> <p>The fallout from Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while heading the state department was also a topic of discussion. In an email from August of 2015, campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri noted Clinton was \u201cnot in the same place\u201d as her team on how to address the controversy.</p> <p>\u201cAs you all know, I had hoped that we could use the \u2018server moment\u2019 as an opportunity for her to be viewed as having take [sic] a big step to deal with the email problem that would best position us for what is ahead,\u201d Palmieri wrote. \u201cIt is clear that she is not in same place (unless John has a convo with her and gets her in a different place).\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign pounced on the hacked emails, focusing on one exchange it claimed showed evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Department of Justice in the investigation into her private server. But the emails cited by Trump adviser Jason Miller were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/10/trump-clinton-wikileaks-doj-229615\">sent two months before</a> the federal government opened its inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email setup, and show nothing more than the exchange of information that was already publicly available. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Trump tried to draw attention to the hacked emails himself on Monday during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, holding up a printed statement he misattributed to longtime Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal.</p> <p>\u201cSleazy Sidney,\u201d Trump told his supporters, admitted \u201cthey could have done something about Benghazi\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3afa7e4ffcec09c14db36632607f9b2b4dbdd2d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3afa7e4ffcec09c14db36632607f9b2b4dbdd2d2/0_357_5352_3211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters outside a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters outside a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis just came out a little while ago,\u201d he added, prompting the familiar \u201clock her up\u201d chants against Clinton that are now a staple at Trump\u2019s rallies.<br></p> <p>But the words the Republican nominee claimed were written by Blumenthal were, in fact, sentences from a story published in Newsweek by journalist Kurt Eichenwald last October about the 2012 attack in Benghazi. Blumenthal was simply passing along the article to Podesta, in an email that contained the subject line \u201cthe truth\u201d and prompted <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635\">an essay</a> in Newsweek on Monday evening from Eichenwald himself titled: Dear Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, I am not Sydney Blumenthal.</p> <p>The source of the false story linking Blumenthal to the passages he never wrote was Sputnik, a government-controlled Russian news agency. The website took its post down after the error became clear, but Eichenwald questioned how a conspiracy went quickly from Russian print to Trump\u2019s podium.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted the Trump campaign to ask how the Benghazi email came to the candidate\u2019s attention and whether the campaign would acknowledge what the Republican nominee quoted as Blumenthal\u2019s words were, in fact, from Eichenwald\u2019s 2015 Newsweek article.</p>"
