That should be a cracker and the outcome will decide the group. Arsenal can be confident, though. This was a big victory given that they made a dreadful start, conceding twice in the opening 15 minutes. Yet they demonstrated their character, levelling the game before the interval thanks to goals from Granit Xhaka and Olivier Giroud, and they\u2019ll be feeling pretty damn good about themselves before Sunday\u2019s game against Tottenham.

Ludogorets 2-3 Arsenal (Mesut Ozil, 87 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mesut Ozil has surely won it for Arsenal and sent them into the last 16 with a magnificent goal! Out of nowhere, he\u2019s released through the middle by Elneny, making an instant impact, Ludogorets getting it all wrong with a dismal attempt at an offside trap. Borjan hurtles out of his area and the ball is bouncing awkwardly. So Ozil simply scoops it over him with his left foot, a little like Messi against Arsenal in 2011, and advances towards the area. Two defenders are covering, though. So Ozil keeps his composure, drops the shoulder, shakes the hips, leaves both of them on their backsides, takes his sweet time about it and strokes it into the empty net! What a player!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b89866b4a5157e5b2af4c3b900e0bd04d6cce92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b89866b4a5157e5b2af4c3b900e0bd04d6cce92/0_0_1846_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mesut Ozil lobs goalkeeper Milan Borjan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mesut Ozil lobs goalkeeper Milan Borjan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bf1c0f87899d0150cf13faad3ccc602da0e7892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bf1c0f87899d0150cf13faad3ccc602da0e7892/0_0_1853_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ozil then puts two Ludogorets\u2019 defenders on the floor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ozil then puts two Ludogorets\u2019 defenders on the floor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"768d8b5a3efd0061b096ce4cd5d791bef964dee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/768d8b5a3efd0061b096ce4cd5d791bef964dee5/0_0_2920_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"And Ozil slots home a brilliant late goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"493\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And Ozil slots home a brilliant late goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T22:03:31.476Z\">at 10.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581908b5e4b029b92ca447b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T21:27:31.745Z\">9.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Granit Xhaka, on a yellow card, is replaced by Mohamed Elneny.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58190895e4b07ceadb3a1625\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T21:26:48.754Z\">9.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>86 min: </b>Mohamed Elneny will be on in a minute.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58190812e4b07ceadb3a1622\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T21:25:07.418Z\">9.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>84 min: </strong>Minev\u2019s tame cross is easily claimed by Ospina.

I don\u2019t think that he should be in the starting line-up against Tottenham on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcde4034ecfc8e05f2a821addce89787c1e62133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcde4034ecfc8e05f2a821addce89787c1e62133/0_25_4777_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A big night for Olivier Giroud.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A big night for Olivier Giroud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T19:43:14.821Z\">at 7.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5818e264e4b029b92ca446ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T18:49:31.710Z\">6.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The teams!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ludogorets:</strong> Borjan; Minev, Palomino, Moti, Natanael; Abel, Dyakov;<strong> </strong>Cafu, Marcelinho, Wanderson; Keseru. <strong>Subs:</strong> Stoyanov, Cicinho, Sasha, Quixada, Plastun, Lukoki, Misidjan.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Ospina; Jenkinson, Mustafi, Koscielny, Gibbs; Coquelin, Xhaka; Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud. <strong>Subs: </strong>Cech, Holding, Gabriel, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Elneny, Iwobi, Maitland-Niles.</p> <p><strong>Referee: </strong>Bas Nijhuis (Netherlands).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43a17d34193a6e7a5244385528a64b8d8017b767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a17d34193a6e7a5244385528a64b8d8017b767/0_0_5183_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian-speaking Arsenal supporters in the Vassil Levski Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian-speaking Arsenal supporters in the Vassil Levski Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T19:46:09.522Z\">at 7.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58187750e4b01c528432eece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T11:07:12.135Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello.</strong> Breaking news: it\u2019s November. Fine, it\u2019s not news. But that doesn\u2019t mean a chill didn\u2019t go down the spine of every sensible Arsenal supporter this morning. This, after all, has traditionally been the month when a few things start to go wrong in their season and a fine, encouraging start gives way to angst and anger and the occasional level-headed debate on ArsenalFanTV about whether Arsene Wenger is a TREACHEROUS DISGRACE WHO NEEDS TO GET OUT OF MY CLUB NOW or AN UNDISPUTED LEGEND WHO CAN DO NO WRONG. If Arsenal happen to lose to Ludogorets tonight, do keep an eye on YouTube later, it\u2019s bound to be entertaining.</p> <p>The stats aren\u2019t too encouraging. November has long been the worst month in Arsenal\u2019s season under Wenger, their points per game in the Premier League dropping to an average of 1.59. How to explain it? Some put it down to injuries, others say it\u2019s because they\u2019re too often gripped by the need to avert catastrophe in their Champions League group. Maybe it\u2019s a protest against daylight saving. Whatever the reason, though, they could do without another mini collapse this time, because they\u2019ve been building some impressive momentum since losing to Liverpool on the opening day of the season. Unbeaten in all competitions since that 4-3 defeat, they\u2019re level with Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, lead their Champions League group on goal difference and have been playing some scintillating football.</p> <p>Don\u2019t stop now. That\u2019ll be Wenger\u2019s message to his players. A big month begins with them taking on Ludogorets in Sofia and they need to keep accelerating. Victory over a side who were walloped 6-0 at the Emirates a fortnight ago will keep them above Paris Saint-Germain in the battle to win Group A, thus improving their chances of an easier draw in the last 16, and ensure that there\u2019s no loss of confidence before Sunday\u2019s North London derby. With games against Manchester United and PSG to come later this month, Arsenal can\u2019t afford to let bad habits creep back into their system. There haven\u2019t been too many signs of their focus dropping in recent weeks \u2013 but they would be foolish to approach this game with a complacent attitude. They might have thrashed Ludogorets in London, but the Bulgarians did create chances and can be tricky at home. This is Arsenal. Be careful when making predictions.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm GMT.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/olivier-giroud-arsenal-wenger-ludogorets-champions-league\">Olivier Giroud ready to seize Arsenal moment as Wenger looks long-term</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T17:20:23.950Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

I think you have to be realistic, but the idea is to keep that pipeline of players coming in.\u201d</p> <p>Celtic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/celtic-borussia-monchengladbach-champions-league-match-report\">were beaten 2-0 by M\u00f6nchengladbach</a> a fortnight ago with the visitors more than worth their win. \u201cThey reinforced that they are a very good side even with players missing. The level they are developing over the last couple of years is a level we are trying to get to over time,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI experienced it in the Champions League when I was in England. It is a step up even from that, the intensity, the quality, the speed.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking a couple of jumps up to that level.

  "<p>Ukip leadership favourite Paul Nuttall has praised Nigel Farage\u2019s controversial anti-migrant poster, saying it made an \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d point that there is a \u201cdeluge of people coming from the Middle East\u201d.<br></p> <p>Nuttall, the former deputy leader, backed the poster during a hustings event for Ukip leadership candidates on radio station LBC, which descended into bickering and acrimony over issues ranging from homophobia to the death penalty.</p> <p>\u201cThe point behind that poster was absolutely correct. We do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the Middle East. And the EU\u2019s idea of a common asylum policy isn\u2019t the route to go down,\u201d he said when asked for his views on the campaign image.</p> <p>He also said there had only been a slight increase in hate crime following Brexit, while arguing that it was not out of the ordinary because it \u201chappens after any national event\u201d.</p> <p>A different position was taken by Suzanne Evans, the former deputy chairman of the party, who said the poster was unnecessary though not racist.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like it. I thought it was insensitive and ill judged,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The poster, which Farage unveiled during the EU referendum campaign, showed a queue of mostly non-white migrants and refugees with the slogan \u201cBreaking point: the EU has failed us all\u201d. It was condemned at the time by an array of politicians from leading Brexiter Michael Gove to former chancellor George Osborne.<br></p> <p>The leadership contest was triggered by Farage\u2019s departure after the referendum and then the refusal of Diane James to serve after she was elected the new Ukip leader in the first race to succeed him.</p> <p>The candidates were mostly in agreement about the need to unite the party after a year of bitter infighting but there were palpable tensions during the hustings, largely directed at John Rees-Evans, the least known of the four candidates, who hit the headlines in 2014 for claiming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/22/gay-donkey-rapists-other-odddities-how-ukip-keeps-going-off-message\">a gay donkey tried to rape his horse</a>.</p> <p>He clashed with LBC presenter Iain Dale after he criticised Evans for calling for a Ukip assembly candidate to be axed for branding LGBT activists the \u201cGaystapo\u201d.<br></p> <p> \u201cIt is entirely acceptable for a Ukip candidate to have any views that he likes,\u201d said Rees-Evans, who called for members to set party policies through direct democracy.</p> <p>He also suggested he could back the death penalty for paedophiles convicted of sexual crimes with prepubescent children.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be some pretty strict criteria in terms of the burden of evidence but yes ... In the case of specifically paedophiles and child killers,\u201d he said, adding that it would not for example apply to someone convicted of a sexual crime with a teenager who looked 18 but was actually 15 and a half.</p> <p>Nuttall said he would vote in a referendum on the death penalty for it to apply to child murderers such as Ian Huntley, while Evans and Peter Whittle said they did not support the death penalty.</p> <p>Nuttall, who is the strong favourite to win, had one of the toughest messages about the party\u2019s future, saying it was \u201cpeering over a political cliff\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI will be the candidate who keeps Ukip on the pitch,\u201d Nuttall said, calling for the party to replace Labour as the UK\u2019s main patriotic party of working people.</p> <p>At a later hustings for Ukip members in Westminster, both he and Evans made rallying calls for the immediate revocation of the European Communities Act, saying it was necessary to hold Theresa May to account on delivering a real Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWe want our borders back and we want our fish back as well,\u201d Evans said.</p> <p>Peter Whittle said he thought the country was \u201cunder a sort of attack\u201d and it was imperative to uphold British values by challenging sharia law and eradicating female genital mutilation.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole advance of radical Islam ...

They would kick me,\u201d he writes. \u201cAfter the third beating, they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell.\u201d</p> <p>He goes on to describe being cuffed and hung from the ceiling. \u201cBeing suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists, twisted out my elbows, and caused horrible back pain. I was suspended like that for half an hour.</p> <p>\u201cThen they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless I stopped my hunger strike.\u201d</p> <p>The prison boss later allegedly told Dadin that if he complained his beatings could be made worse, and he could be killed and buried \u201cunder the fence\u201d. </p> <p>Dadin also claims he is being beaten \u201cseveral times a day\u201d as well as bullied and routinely humiliated. \u201cThis is happening with the other prisoners, as well,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch who spent 10 years in jail in Russia before being amnestied in 2013, told the Guardian he was familiar with these conditions. Khodorkovsky said he was locked up in the same penal colony in Karelia after being convicted for a second time. </p> <p>\u201cIldar Dadin has finished up in the same prison camp, simply for protesting peacefully and for expressing his personal views. Before I was there, in Soviet times, political prisoners were locked up there too,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely tough place. In recent years the prison authorities specialised in \u2018breaking\u2019 serious criminals using illegal methods. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re once more in times where the new task is the intimidation of political activists.\u201d<br></p> <p>Russian prison officials cast doubt on the claims. \u201cNot one physical injury has been found on Dadin,\u201d said the deputy head of Russia\u2019s prison service, Valery Maksimenko, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. </p> <p>Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta quoted an unidentified local prison service official as acknowledging that physical force had been used on Dadin, but only when he refused to leave his cell or defied prison guards. <a href=\"https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russian-correctional-authorities-respond-to-dissidents-torture-claims-55961\">Dadin denies the accusations.</a></p> <p>Bill Browder, the chief executive of Hermitage Capital investment fund, said Dadin\u2019s treatment was reminiscent of that meted out to his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky was jailed and died in prison in 2009 after uncovering a $230m (\u00a3188m) tax fraud carried out by senior Kremlin officials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/01/kremlin-pours-cold-water-on-mi5-chiefs-andrew-parker-claims\">Kremlin pours cold water on MI5 chief's claims of Russian threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Browder said those responsible for torturing Dadin should be put on the Magnitsky sanctions list, introduced by the US and several EU countries.

It brought me right back to seven years ago when Sergei Magnitsky was killed,\u201d Browder said. \u201cI pray it doesn\u2019t happen to Dadin.\u201d </p> <p>Approximately 50 people went to the Moscow headquarters of the Federal Penitentiary Service on Tuesday night to submit requests for an investigation into Dadin\u2019s mistreatment, a photographer at the scene said.</p> <h2>Ildar Dadin\u2019s letter in full</h2> <p>Nastya! If you decide to publish this information about what is happening to me, then try to distribute it as widely as possible. This will increase my chances of staying alive. </p> <p>Know that there is an entire mafia operating at penal colony 7. It involves the entire administration, among them the colony\u2019s head Major Sergey Leonidovich Kossiev and the vast majority of its employees, including the doctors.</p> <p>Upon my arrival at the colony on 10 September, I had practically all of my things taken away from me. Two razor blades were then planted [amongst my remaining possessions] and subsequently \u201cdiscovered\u201d during an inspection. This is a common practice here \u2013 it gives them grounds to throw all newcomers into solitary confinement, to ensure they immediately understand the hell that they found themselves in. </p> <p>I was put into solitary without any official orders. All of my things were taken away, including soap, my toothbrush, toothpaste, and even toilet paper. In protest of these illegal activities, I went on a hunger strike.</p> <p>On 11 September, the colony head Kossiev came to me with three employees. Together, they started beating me. Over the course of that day, I was beaten a total four times, by 10-12 people at once. They would kick me. After the third beating, they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell.</p> <p>On 12 September, [several] employees cuffed my hands behind my back and hung me up. Being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists, twisted out my elbows, and caused horrible back pain. I was suspended like that for half an hour. Then they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless I stopped my hunger strike. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I ask you to publish this letter because there is a information blockade and I see no other way to break through it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After that, I was brought to Kossiev\u2019s office, where he said to me in the presence of other staff: \u201cYou have been beaten very little. If I give the order, you will be beaten much worse. If you try to complain, they will kill you and bury you under the fence.\u201d After that, they beat me regularly, several times a day. Regular beatings, bullying, humiliation, insults, intolerable detention conditions \u2013 this is happening with the other prisoners, as well.</p> <p>All subsequent punishments were based on blatant lies. All of the videos in which I was [filmed] being \u201cpenalised\u201d were staged: before filming, they would tell me how to behave and what to do \u2013 not to argue, not to protest, to look at the floor. </p> <p>Otherwise, they said, they would kill [me] and no one would know about it, because no one knows where I am. I cannot send letters without going through the administration first, and the administration has promised to kill me if I write any complaints. </p> <p>Nastya, I ask you to publish this letter because there is a real \u201cinformation blockade\u201d in this place and I see no other opportunities to break through it. I am not asking you to get me out of here or to have me transferred to another facility. I have repeatedly seen and heard how other prisoners are being beaten, so my conscience will not allow me to run away from here. I am going to fight to help others. I am not afraid of death. Most of all, I am afraid not being able to withstand the torture and surrendering.</p> <p>If the Committee Against Torture<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/08/ngo-alert-russias-committee-against-torture-bankrupted-by-state-fines\">a Russian human rights NGO</a>] has not yet been destroyed in Russia, I ask for their assistance in ensuring my right to life and security and those of other prisoners in Russia. I ask to you to openly reveal that Major Kossiev has directly threatened to murder me for any attempt to complain about what is happening. I will be glad if you find an attorney who will be able to reside in Segezha [near the colony] and provide legal support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/26/mikhail-khodorkovsky-life-after-prison-russia-after-putin\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky on life after prison and Russia after Putin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Time is against me.

Shire shares closed down 2.6% at \u00a345.28, the second day of falls, as investors also worried about the future pricing of haemophilia drugs in the US.</p> <p>On Monday, Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for US companies, said it was looking at ways to manage the rising cost of haemophilia medicines.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is expected to tackle drug pricing if she wins the US presidential election. The Democratic candidate has repeatedly lambasted high pricing \u2013 describing that of EpiPen, drug firm Mylan\u2019s emergency treatment of anaphylaxis, as \u201coutrageous\u201d and accusing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-refuses-to-testify-congress-drug-daraprim\">entrepreneur Martin Shkreli of \u201cprice gouging\u201d vital medicines</a>.</p> <p>Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, admitted that firms that managed prescription US drug plans wanted to \u201cmanage a number of categories more tightly\u201d including haemophilia.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in an environment, certainly during a presidential campaign, where price is in high focus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can expect for all our categories, not just haemophilia, tighter management, but we have the programmes in place to make sure this does not affect our patients and has limited impact on our overall business. I remain incredibly confident about the outlook for haemophilia.\u201d</p> <p>\u00d8rnskov said existing patients would not be forced to switch haemophilia medications as this would be considered too risky.</p> <p>The Danish businessman was upbeat about Shire\u2019s new drug for dry eye disease. Launched in August, Xiidra has already taken a 16% market share in the US. The eye drop is expected to generate annual sales of more than $1bn by 2020.</p> <p>Shire said its integration of Illinois-based Baxalta, which specialises in treatments for rare blood conditions, cancer and immune system disorders, was ahead of schedule. </p> <p>Sales of haemophilia medicines, also acquired from Baxalta, fell by 6% to $884m in the three months to 30 September, which Shire blamed on the timing of some large orders. </p> <p>Overall, sales more than doubled to $3.3bn after the acquisition, but this was slightly lower than analysts had expected. Excluding Baxalta, revenues rose 12%.</p> <p>Costs related to the takeover were also higher than Shire expected, partly because it has accelerated some factory closures in the US.</p> <p>Shire is based in Dublin for tax purposes and run from Boston. As announced in the spring, it is pushing ahead with the closure of its Basingstoke office, where 270 people work. </p> <p>The company wants to open an office in the Paddington, London, as its UK commercial base, so it can be \u201ccloser to the heart of life science communities\u201d.

  "<p>The poaching crisis wiping out Africa\u2019s elephants is costing the continent\u2019s economies millions in lost tourism revenue, according to a new study.</p> <p>Researchers looked at visitor and elephant data across 25 countries, and modelled financial losses from fewer visitors in protected areas due to the illegal wildlife trade, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/african-elephant-numbers-plummet-during-worst-decline-in-25-years\">has caused elephant numbers to plummet by more than 100,000 in the last decade.</a> They concluded that Africa was most likely losing $25m in tourism revenue a year.</p> <p>Around $9m of that is lost from tourists\u2019 direct spending, such as staying at hotels and buying crafts, with the rest through indirect value in the economy such as farmers and other suppliers supporting the tourist industry.</p> <p>The study, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/NCOMMS13379\">published in the journal Nature Communications</a>, found that in most cases the revenue losses were higher than paying for stronger anti-poaching measures to keep elephant populations stable.</p> <p>\u201cThe takeaway message is that the return on investment in elephant conservation is positive across much of their range in Africa. In addition to all the other good reasons for their conservation, there is a compelling economic one too,\u201d said Dr Robin Naidoo, the paper\u2019s lead author and senior conservation wildlife scientist at WWF.</p> <p>But the financial argument did not stack up in all areas, his team found. In the case of central Africa\u2019s forest elephants, which are harder for tourists to see and therefore attract fewer visitors, the costs of protecting them exceed the benefits from tourism.</p> <p>Demand from south-east Asia has seen the price of ivory triple since 2009 and it is estimated that one elephant is killed every 15 minutes. Corruption, a lack of resources and increasingly sophisticated poachers have hamstrung African countries\u2019 efforts to stem the trade.</p> <p>Prof Andrew Balmford, a co-author from the University of Cambridge, said: \u201cWe know that within parks, tourism suffers when elephant poaching ramps up. This work provides a first estimate of the scale of that loss, and shows pretty convincingly that stronger conservation efforts usually make sound economic sense even when looking at just this one benefit stream.\u201d</p> <p>Naidoo said that the research was not suggesting economic issues should be the only consideration when protecting elephants, but framing the poaching crisis as a financial one could motivate African governments and communities. </p> <p>\u201cIt gives an additional reason for some groups of people, who may not necessarily be motivated by intrinsic reasons for conversation, to engage with biodiversity conservation. It makes it clear to them that it\u2019s not just in the best interests of the world to conserve this stuff, but tangible reasons for a whole different group,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The study team combined visitor numbers across 164 protected areas in 25 countries with forest and savannah elephants, and elephant population data from 2009 to 2013, to reach a \u201cper elephant\u201d value in terms of tourism income. </p> <p>They then modelled the financial losses from elephant declines, and came to the most likely estimate of $25m a year from a range of $10-50m which Naidoo said he was \u201cvery confident of\u201d. Estimates of the cost of anti-poaching measures were likely to be more uncertain, he conceded, because they were based on the only existing study analysing their costs, which was produced during the last poaching crisis in the 1980s.</p> <p>But the paper said that because recent census efforts suggested elephant declines may be even steeper than thought, its estimates of tourism losses may be on the conservative side.</p>",
  "<p>Two articles published by the Guardian insinuated that a Chinese company \u201cstole\u201d Scottish technology in the process of developing the Hailong 1 wave-power generating device (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/mysterious-factory-break-in-raises-suspicions-about-chinese-visit\" title=\"\">Mysterious factory break-in raises suspicions about Chinese visit</a>, 10 October; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/china-reputation-copycats-pelamis-intellectual-property\" title=\"\">Does China deserve a reputation as the land of copycats?</a> 15 October). However, these reports are not grounded in facts.</p> <p>Upon seeing the above-mentioned reports, we immediately sent an inquiry to the relevant company, China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC). CSIC replied that the Hailong 1 wave-power generating device is based on independent research and development by CSIC.

  "<p>I have been declared a saint. Not by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis\">Pope Francis</a> or the Catholic church, but by my grandmother\u2019s bridge club, a born-again Christian I met in an airport, a teacher and my old hockey coach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/19/secret-aid-worker-who-will-save-the-white-saviours-from-themselves\">Secret aid worker: who will save the white saviours from themselves?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those of us who have chosen a career in development, this informal canonisation by friends, family and strangers alike is a familiar experience. We know that whenever a conversation turns to work, comments such as \u201cYour family must be so proud\u201d, \u201cThat must be so fulfilling\u201d or the ever loftier \u201cYou\u2019re a saint\u201d will follow. </p> <p>Nobody would say these things to a salesman, a bank attendant or a carpenter. It is commonly thought that people who work in the for-profit sector do so for their own wellbeing. But trade-offs and sacrifices are made by nearly everyone in life, and careers in development are made possible by donations from people working for businesses. So what is it that makes development workers worthy of such high praise?</p> <p>Some proudly proclaim that their motives are purely altruistic. We have all met someone with this kind of angelic self-image. But unless you are the Dalai Lama, it is likely that altruism is low on your list of motives and that your case for canonisation will require further examination. </p> <p>Now, it is true that many development workers are not motivated by the prospect of financial gain. In our increasingly materialistic world, that may be commendable. But it does not, however, imply that a person\u2019s motivations are entirely selfless. We all have intangible needs that are somehow fulfilled by our work. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t do it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can never live up to the expectations projected on me by others. I\u2019m just not that good of a guy.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we are honest with ourselves, a good number of us who work abroad could be found on a scale somewhere between escapist and adventurer. If there isn\u2019t at least a bit of the adventurer in you, why leave the comforts of home? </p> <p>Whether working domestically or abroad, the satisfaction we feel when serving others may be our strongest motivator. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. In fact, there\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with being motivated by escapism or a desire to feel satisfied by helping others, or even a combination of the two. But in both, the need that is fulfilled is personal, and the motivations have no inherent benefit to the community we intend to serve. </p> <p>Personally, my motivations have always been complex. Altruism is only one of many. I crave adventure and new experiences. At times I\u2019ve wanted to escape my life back home. I also take great pleasure from the feeling that my work has a positive impact on others and is about something more than just padding my wallet. But again, these motivations are about fulfilling personal needs. </p> <p>Taking into account the truth behind my own motivations, the gushing praise I\u2019ve become accustomed to receiving can be uncomfortable. In the past, when I\u2019ve headed home from an international posting, reunions of any kind would become ritualistic. The same conversation would be had with everyone in the room. The same sentiment of praise expressed over and over in different words. Being recognised for what you do is nice, but I can never live up to the expectations projected on me by others. I\u2019m just not that good of a guy.</p> <p>The implications for dating are obvious and to further confound the situation, I specialise in youth development. I can recall several first dates where I could see my date crafting a paternal image of me in her head as I recounted anecdotes about the young people from work. Suddenly, she would be looking at me as the father of her future children, thoroughly setting the stage for disappointment. I don\u2019t even want children of my own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/dec/01/secret-aid-worker-disposing-of-tampons-in-the-jungle-and-other-dilemmas\">Secret aid worker: Disposing of tampons in the jungle and other dilemmas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is little we can do as development workers about the inherent expectations that weight the praise we receive for our work.

  "<p>USA Today publisher Gannett dropped its bid to buy rival publisher Tronc on Tuesday sending the latter\u2019s share price into a tailspin and ending a months-long pursuit. </p> <p>With a one-sentence statement, Gannett ended its hotly contested bid to buy Tronc, the recently rebranded owner of 11 newspapers including the Chicago Tribune and the LA Times. </p> <p>\u201cGannett Co Inc today confirmed that the Company has been engaged in discussions with Tronc Inc regarding a potential transaction and has determined not to pursue an acquisition of Tronc,\u201d read the company\u2019s unattributed statement to investors.</p> <p>Trading in shares of Tronc, formerly Tribune, was briefly suspended last week after a report from <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/gannett-tronc-deal-in-doubt-as-banks-said-to-withdraw-funding\">Bloomberg</a> that bankers backing the deal had decided both companies were overvalued.</p> <p>The deal had been in the works since April.

  "<p>Mauricio Pochettino says that Harry Kane will play no part in Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday night but he suggested that he could return for the derby at Arsenal on Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/28/harry-kane-tottenham-hotspur-arsenal\">Harry Kane looking to be back for Arsenal game, says Mauricio Pochettino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Tottenham manager also reported that Toby Alderweireld would not feature against Leverkusen and it sounded doubtful that he would be back for Arsenal while Erik Lamela is out with a hip problem.</p> <p>Kane had trained on Tuesday morning \u2013 in front of the TV cameras \u2013 to raise the prospect of him making his comeback from the ankle ligament injury that he suffered against Sunderland on 18&#xa0;September. But he completed only half of the session and Pochettino said that he would not train fully until Thursday. The derby against Arsenal has long been pencilled in as Kane\u2019s return date.</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow no, he will not be on the bench,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see him today, warming up with the team and being involved in some exercises. But for tomorrow, he is not ready. Will he be available on Sunday? Maybe, maybe. He made half the training session with the team today. And then, it was a specific session for him and, for Toby, it was the same.\u201d</p> <p>Alderweireld hurt the nerve in his knee at West Bromwich Albion on 15&#xa0;October and he has not played since. It had been hoped that Alderweireld would be back for the game at home against Leicester City last Saturday but Pochettino seemed to suggest that he had suffered a setback.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Thursday for Harry; with Toby, we are not sure \u2013 we have some slight problems,\u201d Pochettino said, when he was asked when he expected each of them to return to full training. \u201cBut it will be good for Harry, maybe Thursday, to start to train or to be involved in the whole session with the group.\u201d</p> <p>Pochettino said that Lamela, who had missed the Leicester game because of illness, had felt a problem in his hip during the training session on Tuesday.</p> <p>Kane\u2019s fitness dominated the pre-match media conference and, were he to return against Arsenal, it would raise the prospect of him being selected by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, for the fixtures against Scotland and Spain on 11 and 15&#xa0;November. In that scenario, Pochettino would want Kane to be handled with care but he said that he would never stand in the way of a player being called up by his country.</p> <p>\u201cIf he is available to play on Sunday against Arsenal, then it will be difficult for us to stop him, if the national team call him,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf Harry will be available, then that is because he is available to play. We cannot stop that. Then it is [up to] the manager. It is up to Gareth, if he wants to select him or not.</p> <p>\u201cYou know we are pro-national team, always, for all the players. If Harry is available [on Sunday], we are not stupid enough to say: \u2018No, Harry is out, to try to protect him [from international duty], so that, after two weeks, he can be with us.</p> <p>\u201cWe want the best for the team and for the player. It\u2019s true that maybe it makes more sense for the national team to say: \u2018OK, stay at home. Stay with Tottenham and train for two weeks. It\u2019s important to build Harry\u2019s fitness and be better after.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut, if they consider that they need Harry to play for the national team and he is available to play against Arsenal, then we cannot stop [them]. If I select him to play on Sunday against Arsenal, we open the door for the national team to select him too.</p> <p>\u201cI would never ask Gareth not to pick him. Never.

There have already been four this year, including two of the biggest ever seen. In April, two people were killed when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/rio-de-janeiro-bicycle-path-collapse-death-brazil-olympic-games\">50-metre stretch of the Tim Maia bike path was washed away</a> just months after it was built. </p> <p>This time what was left of the bike path was temporarily shut down \u2013 along with the Delfim Moreira Avenue \u2013 to prevent further fatalities and damage. One pedestrian area was also closed off due to subsidence risks, and a wooden deck area \u2013 the Mirante do Leblon \u2013 was damaged. </p> <p>David Zee, oceanography professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said the immediate cause of the swell was a cyclone off the coast of Uruguay combined with the high tide of a new moon. But he said the timing and scale of the extreme weather event posed longer-term climate concerns.</p> <p>\u201cThis storm surge is not normal at this time of the year. The surges usually happen in August or September at the latest and they are not so big. This indicates that, without a doubt, the climate is altering.\u201d</p> <p>The increasing frequency of the storms is hindering Rio\u2019s beaches\u2019 ability to recuperate, leading to erosion along stretches of the shoreline at Copacabana, Arproador and Macumba, and accumulation elsewhere, such as Leblon.</p> <p>Vitor Zanetti, of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics, called on the government and local businesses to respond to what he predicted would become a growing trend. \u201cThis was an extreme climate event,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing all climate scientists agree on is that we will see more storms and droughts.\u201d</p> <p>With the latest wave dumping sand and water in buildings across the street from the beach, he suggested hotels relocate their lobbies to higher floors.

It was predicted and well documented. But it was a bit outside of the usual time frame, a bit late.\u201d</p> <p>Others meteorologists blamed El Ni\u00f1o, though its impact faded earlier this year. Hugo Abi Karam, a meteorologist from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, was more inclined to blame the surge on local factors, such as silt accumulation, poor drainage, seafront construction</p> <p>But there is little doubt that Rio \u2013 like much of south-east Brazil \u2013 is suffering more storm surges, extreme rainfall and protracted droughts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/developers-dont-get-it-climate-change-need-retreat-coast\">Developers don't get it: climate change means we need to retreat from the coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given these long-term trends, Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory coalition of NGOs, said the recent wave damage was the latest sign that Brazil must fulfil its responsibilities to reduce carbon emissions, when it joins other countries in United Nations climate talks later this week. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThis shows the high degree of vulnerability to climate change in Brazil, which has 7,400km of shoreline and 25% of its population living on the coast,\u201d he said. \u201cThis extreme weather event must at least draw attention to the need for the country to be consistent on its climate policy \u2013 and not invest in more fossil fuels thinking that it has already done a lot to curb emissions.\u201d </p>",

There are already extremely poisonous species like the box jellyfish in the Caribbean Sea \u2013 which is not too far.\u201d</p> <p>Now, one Israeli startup thinks it\u2019s found a solution to tackling these swelling populations \u2013 biodegradable diapers and female hygiene products made out of jellyfish.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.capitalnano.com/portfolio/cineal\">Cine\u2019al</a> was conceived by Shachar Richter, a material scientist at the University of Tel Aviv, who began studying jellyfish a few years ago. As a material scientist, Richter looked closely at the flesh of jellyfish, and found that it could absorb liquid in large quantities. He and his colleagues then developed a super-absorbent material they named \u201chydromash\u201d, which Richter says can absorb a high volume of blood and water. </p> <p>In order to produce hydromash, the company first breaks down the jellyfish flesh and then adds antibacterial nanoparticles to the mix, which remove the sting. The process converts the jellyfish into a strong, flexible but fully biodegradable material. Although jellyfish stings are painful and sometimes fatal, jellyfish are composed of 90% water. Richter and his colleagues realized jellyfish flesh could actually be used in medical bandages and sponges.</p> <p>Cine\u2019al is now developing infant and adult diapers, as well as feminine hygiene products made out of hydromash. The company expects the products to hit the market in the next 18 months. The global diaper market size <a href=\"https://www.psmarketresearch.com/press-release/diaper-market\">was estimated</a> at $52bn in 2015, and set to reach $76.5bn by 2022. There are <a href=\"http://disposablediaper.net/faq/how-many-diapers-are-required-every-day-to-satisfy-the-world-consumption/\">40.37m</a> diapers used daily in the US, most of which end up in landfills. About 43 million women in the US use tampons; on average, a woman uses <a href=\"http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/healthandscience/cumulative-exposure-and-feminine-care-products/\">11,000 tampons in her lifetime</a>. A typical disposable diaper or tampon can take hundreds of years to break down. According to Richter, a product made of hydromash takes less than 30 days to biodegrade.</p> <p>Cine\u2019al isn\u2019t unique when it comes to drawing inspiration from nature to create new materials. Biomason, a North Carolina startup, makes eco-friendly bricks grown with sand and bacteria. Coeio has invented a \u201cburial suit\u201d made out of mushrooms, which is intended to neutralize toxins found in a decomposing body and transfer nutrients to plant life after burial. Agroplast, a Danish startup, uses pig urine to produce bioplastics which could be turned into disposable plates and utensils.</p> <p>\u201cIf these products go mainstream, they can revolutionize the market and make an environmentally noticeable difference,\u201d says Nir Davison, Richter\u2019s colleague at Cine\u2019al <a href=\"http://www.capitalnano.com/portfolio/cineal\">also involved in the development of the material</a>.</p> <p>\u201cJellyfish are elegant, beautiful and intriguing creatures. If they\u2019re studied properly, there are many more ways [they] can contribute to our lives,\u201d Richter says.</p>",

My eldest grandchild, aged 11, is extremely anxious about political events, particularly potential terrorist attacks. She has become worried about travelling on the tube in London when she visits me. She is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the Paris attacks. She is not at all frightened by any supposed Muslim threat \u2013 indeed, she is rather pro\u2013Muslim having many Muslim peers, which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern children\u2019s education, but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun. She loves coming to London but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous. These concerns affect her sleep. She has confided she has periods of lying awake, worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not, and in my view cannot, dispel her concerns. My experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort. </p> <p>My granddaughter doesn\u2019t have a computer or iPod, or direct access to the web on her phone, but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about what\u2019s happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events. Inevitably, she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say. In my view, the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home, and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum. </p> <p>Teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them. More consideration needs to be given to the way social media, which can now feed into a bullying process, affects children. Bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but I don\u2019t think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive. There needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and I believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age. Children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value, in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts.</p> <h2>Amet Akolawin, 28, from London: \u2018My daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warming\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1a55a33907dd4a64b1945f8ac1cf7904cd678910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a55a33907dd4a64b1945f8ac1cf7904cd678910/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Amet Akolawin\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My daughter, who turns eight next week, watches the news when I do, so in the morning and evening. She also watches CBBC\u2019s Newsround most days. We do talk about the headlines a lot, she takes an interest in what is going on around the world.<br></p> <p>She does worry about some of the stuff she sees, just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the US election and the wall Donald Trump wishes to build between Mexico and America. It lead on to us chatting about the Berlin Wall and the Great Wall of China. My daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my knowledge.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t like watching clips of war-torn countries, but she will still listen to what the report is saying. She is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on Syria, for example, and I think the images are disturbing, her I will ask her if she would like to watch something else.</p> <p>To be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school, such as global warming and natural disasters. We go to visit her gran in Sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there. She has become very fixated about this and I haven\u2019t been able to reassure her about. Her uncle lives in Rome so it\u2019s understandable that she would worry but it\u2019s definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when she\u2019s there.</p> <h2>Jessica Eaton, 26, from Staffordshire: \u2018My sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of them\u2019</h2> <p>My sons, who are five and eight, had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in Syria was real. They had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in Syria. We were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They have lots and lots of questions about war, politics and weapons.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset, saying: \u201cReal people are dying in Syria, with real guns and bombs.\u201d They had got confused between \u201creal\u201d and \u201cpretend war\u201d because of how war is depicted in video games and the fact that they have toy guns. My five-year-old son started to cry, saying: \u201cWe need to stop the shops and the government from selling things that try to make war and bombs and guns fun because it\u2019s real mum. It\u2019s happening in Syria.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the news has made them upset: my boys worry a lot about war and nuclear weapons. They also worry that they might end up refugees too and no one will love them or want them. </p> <p>They have lots and lots of questions about war, politics and weapons. I don\u2019t shield them from current affairs and I don\u2019t lie to them, but instead spend time explaining stuff and suggesting empowering solutions, such as getting them to make posters or write a letter to the government. We have also registered to take in refugee children for fostering. </p> <p>While the media is busy playing everyone off against one another, children are absorbing dangerous messages from all sides. Our children spend more time using technology than any other generation and are very engaged in the media. I would prefer them to experience moral uncertainty and question everything they read rather than just swallowing information.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 41, from London: \u2018My eldest worries about animals dying and the destruction of the earth\u2019</h2> <p>My eldest, who is nine, has been very worried about climate change since he did a class project on habitats last year. He often talks about environmental issues, such as animals dying, trees disappearing and the general destruction of the earth. </p> <p>Both my children actually stopped eating meat last year and decided to become vegetarian. There\u2019s a lot of focus on this issue and they cry when they think about animals being killed. They even made a How to Save Our Planet game together.</p> <p>We don\u2019t allow our children to watch the news: the images are too graphic and the language is not suitable for under 10s. They occasionally hear the news on the radio, but we monitor their internet use, only letting them online for a limited time. They don\u2019t have access to any social media despite their protests.

A particular concern for him at the moment is Donald Trump getting elected. At the time of the primaries he picked up on him being a joke candidate and being a disaster for the world if elected. Some of his friends in schools do Donald Trump impressions that their parents taught them, so Trump is a bit of a funny character in school. But then he hears phrases like, \u201cThis man could have his finger on the nuclear button,\u201d and gets worried.

He is not on social media as he is too young and I don\u2019t think any of his friends are either.</p> <p>The Brexit result really upset him.

I am hoping to give him more information on news events now so he is less anxious. A few weeks ago, for example, I signed up to <a href=\"http://theweekjunior.co.uk/about-junior/?ppcad=true&amp;gclid=CK3jw8HLh9ACFaEL0wodbVUFZA\">The Week Junior</a>, which is a magazine that explains big news events to children.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 45, from Kent: \u2018We need to help children analyse media stories and sources of information\u2019</h2> <p>Since the age of seven my daughter has worried about global events but it\u2019s not had a negative impact.

Last year, when Afghan and international forces fought to push out the Taliban from the northern city of Kunduz, Aminullah, 58, hunkered down with his family. As airstrikes took place across the city for days on end, his 10-year-old daughter Bashira, who has Down\u2019s syndrome, went into a state of shock. She did not recover after the family fled east to Takhar province, or when they returned to Kunduz two weeks later.</p> <p>When fighting erupted again last month, the family fled once more, this time to the capital. In camps in Kabul, assistance was scarce. The family of 11 slept under three blankets in a tent. Since last year, Bashira had not been able to walk, or utter more than a few words, said Aminullah. \u201cWhen we hear planes in the sky, she asks me to put my hand on her heart,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bibi Nesar, 50, also had to flee Kunduz for the second time. But this time, it was even harder. In last year\u2019s attack, she lost her right arm when a rocket hit her home. Her husband lost an eye. This year, they did not linger long enough to be injured. After a US airstrike last year destroyed a hospital run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, there was no quality healthcare facility in Kunduz province to help them if they got wounded again. \u201cWhen we fled, there were dead bodies everywhere but we tried not to look at them,\u201d Bibi Nesar said.</p> <p>Afghan migrants being deported from abroad will only add to the problems.

  "<p>The chancellor, Phillip Hammond, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/01/philp-hammond-to-spend-extra-19bn-fighting-cyber-attacks\">has announced a \u00a31.9bn investment in Britain\u2019s cybersecurity strategy</a>. The money is to be used to protect the country from hacking attacks on all fronts, from opportunistic raids on individuals and businesses to focused cyberwar led by state-run teams.</p> <p>Hammond has promised a big sum, but the world of hacking is easily large enough to occupy all that money and more. It\u2019s double the amount set out for a similar strategy in 2011, but has to deal with a world where cybercrime has moved from science-fiction novels and Hollywood movies to our banks, phones and even kettles.</p> <h2><strong>What are cyber-attacks?</strong></h2> <p>The range of misdeeds which can be described as a cyber-attack is vast, and demands a similarly large range of responses.</p> <p>At the most technically complex end, cyber-attacks can entail a close-knit team of elite hackers working under the remit of a nation state to create programs which take advantage of previously unknown flaws in software \u2013 called 0days, or zero-days, for the amount of time the manufacturer has had to fix them \u2013 in order to exfiltrate confidential data, damage key infrastructure, or develop a beachhead for further attacks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/27/how-to-be-a-hacker\">How to be a hacker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Examples of that sort of cyberwarfare include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar\">the Stuxnet worm</a>, a specially made computer virus attributed to the US and Israel, which was deliberately designed to infect and damage centrifuges used in the Iranian nuclear programme, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/09/opm-hack-21-million-personal-information-stolen\">the 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Management</a>, attributed to China, which led to the personal information of millions of US government workers being stolen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237307d15840db9e27d04d80192c9e02970bdc8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237307d15840db9e27d04d80192c9e02970bdc8f/0_132_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The heavy water nuclear facility near Arak, Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The heavy water nuclear facility near Arak, Iran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hamid Foroutan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most dangerous hacking groups are known as \u201cadvanced persistent threats\u201d (APTs): not only nation-states, but highly competent criminal organisations that carry out technically difficult targeted hacks. </p> <p>But not all cyber-attacks involve high-end technical skills or state-sponsored actors. At the opposite end of the scale are hacks that take advantage of long-fixed security mistakes, ambiguities in user interfaces, and even good old-fashioned human oversight.</p> <p>Many hackers are opportunistic, picking not the most valuable targets but the most lightly defended ones, such as computers that haven\u2019t had security updates installed, or users who will happily click on malicious links if they are told that their bank sent them.</p> <p>If APTs are like the Hatton Garden Heist, these hackers are the sort of people who will grab an unattended handbag and run. It may be less impressive, but for the vast majority of computer users, that\u2019s the sort of cybercrime they should spend more of their time defending against.</p> <h2><strong>Does cyber-crime even have to include hacking?</strong></h2> <p>Not according to Hammond. Some of the government\u2019s past successes in fighting cybercrime involve tackling \u201cphishing\u201d, the practice of sending a fake email purporting to be from a trusted sender to encourage the recipient to enter confidential information.</p> <p>Phishing can be fought by taking down the servers that collect the confidential information, which the government has been doing, but also by education: teaching individuals how to recognise a phishing email, and how to tell real websites from fake.</p> <p>At its simplest end, cybercrime may not even involve computers much at all. \u201cSocial engineering\u201d is the name in the hacker community for convincing an organisation or individual to do things they shouldn\u2019t, and is an important part of the hacker toolkit. For instance, Mat Honan, a Wired reporter, had <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">his entire digital life erased</a> when hackers convinced Apple to reset his iCloud password with information they had convinced Amazon to hand over \u2013 all using nothing more complex than a phone call.</p> <p>And then there are the simplest \u201chacks\u201d of all: just logging into things using the default passwords. That\u2019s how a rag-tag collection of cheap \u201csmart\u201d devices like webcams and kettles ended up being corralled into a network big enough to take down most of the internet for the east coast of the US two weeks ago.</p> <h2><strong>How can kettles take down the internet?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27be930b25700450b29efd575faa4561648c56a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27be930b25700450b29efd575faa4561648c56a/1365_1124_5228_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"kettle ...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t trust your kettle ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By being press-ganged into a \u201cbotnet\u201d. The devices were all vulnerable because their default passwords were known, and, worse, couldn\u2019t be changed. That made it simple for a (still unknown) hacker to write a program that would automatically log in to those devices, rewrite their software, and leave them controlled by a central server. Even more impressively, those enslaved devices then start seeking out further devices to drag into the botnet, meaning that today, if you connect a vulnerable kettle to the internet, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/we-built-a-fake-web-toaster-and-it-was-hacked-in-an-hour/505571/\">it will be hacked within an hour</a>. It doesn\u2019t need a human to do the hacking, the botnet (named \u201cMirai\u201d) just scans for new kettle and logs in using the default username and password.</p> <h2><strong>But how does that botnet take down the internet?</strong></h2> <p>Through a technique called \u201cdistributed denial of service\u201d, or DDoS. A denial of service attack involves overwhelming a particular server with requests \u2013 as though you decided to harm a small business by permanently calling their landline and refusing to hangup, so no one else could get through. But denial of service attacks are fairly easy to block, because they come from one location, and it\u2019s hard to send enough traffic from one computer to overwhelm another computer.</p> <p>A \u201cdistributed\u201d denial of service attack involves commanding networks of thousands or millions of computers \u2013 or kettles \u2013 to all send their requests at the same time. Not only can it leave the server unable to respond to real demands, it can even leave it so overwhelmed that it fails completely, crashing key services or even revealing non-public information to the world.</p> <p>The botnet that brought down parts of the internet last week was targeted at a particularly important server, which acted as the main gateway for a number of large sites including Amazon, whose AWS network itself hosts even more sites.</p> <h2><strong>Is that everything?</strong></h2> <p>Mostly, but with the proliferation of smart devices, the number of things that can be hacked is growing daily. We\u2019re connecting more and more things to the internet, and some of those things we really don\u2019t want to be hacked.</p> <p>In October 2015, for instance, security firm Rapid7 revealed vulnerabilities in a brand of insulin pump that diabetics use to control their condition. The weakness allowed an attacker to remotely trigger insulin injections, potentially leading to a fatal hypoglycaemic shock. In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/17/us-power-plants-hacking\">weaknesses were discovered</a> in power plants across the US and Canada that could cause them to overheat, shut down or malfunction if a malicious hacker decided to attack them. And as cars become more connected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/28/car-hacking-future-self-driving-security\">hackers are going after them too</a>: researchers who discovered how to remotely disable the brakes on Jeeps in 2015 reported this year that they had found new attacks which could do even more on an unpatched vehicle.</p> <h2><strong>Can \u00a31.9bn really defend against all of that?</strong></h2> <p>It can do a lot, though not in the ways you might think. The extra money spent on staff in GCHQ and MI5, for instance, won\u2019t result in teams of spooks staring at big screens shouting things like \u201creverse the trace and send spike the server!\u201d. The money will be used, the government says, to \u201ctake the fight to those who threaten Britain in cyberspace\u201d, in part by \u201cstriking back against those that try to harm our country\u201d. It\u2019s not clear what form retaliation could take, especially when identifying the perpetrator is not straightforward. </p> <p>And \u00a31.9bn from Britain can\u2019t do everything. Experts agree that much of the response to cybercrime needs to be transnational: there\u2019s no other way to ensure, for instance, that cheap electronics made in China and sold in the UK can\u2019t be used to attack websites hosted in the US but serving the entire western hemisphere.</p> <p>Some solutions are cheap, but come with other costs. In the wake of the Mirai botnet, for instance, researchers have called for stronger regulations requiring timely security updates, and putting the cost of any damage on the manufacturer if no updates are available. That could help prevent future re-runs, but might also raise the cost of such devices.</p>",
  "<p>During this time of the year death appears in a guise of make up, costumes and candied treats. Often portrayed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2016/nov/01/halloween-celebrations-around-the-world-in-pictures\">colourful eccentric images</a>, celebrations such as Halloween and the Day of the Dead were traditionally about remembering the dead and the memories of lost loved ones.<br></p> <p>But talking about death is not easy if you\u2019re British.

Mum went to her doctor with a minor stomach upset and died four weeks later with an aggressive bowel tumour. She had no previous symptoms and wasn\u2019t even unwell. It came as a complete shock with total devastation to her family.</p> <p>Grief is so overpowering - it consumes you. First the numbness and autopilot mode then the heaviness of despair, then the oceans of tears, then the questions of the pointless, futility of life. Then anger, then deep despair, then numbness and repeat. Repeat. 17 months on and I still question all of it; but I cope by leaning on my loved ones and I cope by using my mum\u2019s strength to spur me on. Ironically, she is the one that gets me out of bed in the mornings. <br></p> <p>My life has changed drastically. After mum died I resigned from my job, married my partner of 22 years (we married on mum\u2019s birthday as a gift/gesture to her), I got a dog and am now planning a move with my husband to Sri Lanka for a few years. I see my life in two parts; my old life with mum and my new life; one I didn\u2019t want or choose but one that I\u2019m trying to embrace. I try to live my life as my mum wanted; with gusto and enjoying the little things. I\u2019m trying at least. <br></p> <p><em>Keely Dowton, 44-year-old teacher living in Essex</em></p> <h2>\u2018I said \u2018Good morning\u2019 to a photo of him each day\u2019<br></h2> <p>I lost my father seven years ago. It was totally unexpected and at the time I could not deal with it. I said \u2018Good morning\u2019 to a photo of him each day as I did in person before. I threw myself into planning the funeral, keeping busy meant not thinking about what had happened. <br></p> <p>Just after he passed away, I noticed a robin that would watch me when I was gardening. The robin visited the garden most days and would look towards the house. There are some people who think that symbolises that a loved one who has passed is okay. That brought me some comfort even if I don\u2019t completely believe it. I like seeing robins in the garden, even when they are being fiercely territorial. Seeing them is associated with my dad now. I talked about my dad in the present tense for a long time, maybe a year after he had died. Even now it feels incorrect to talk about him in the past because he lives on in my heart and mind. He always will.

Other people\u2019s death isn\u2019t scary for me anymore but mine is as I fear for my children. <br></p> <p>I think it\u2019s more difficult to talk about death if you haven\u2019t had any personal experience of it. A lot of the time it\u2019s very clinical, with the funeral director taking the body away fairly swiftly. There\u2019s not often the chance to spend time with the dead and say goodbye. It\u2019s almost frowned upon. I took some pictures of my husband dead; before and after he was embalmed. It doesn\u2019t feel right sharing that fact with people as I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll think it weird. It didn\u2019t feel weird to me. <br></p> <p>Even though my husband suffered with all the indignities of cancer I believe in the end he had a good death. He\u2019d put his affairs in order, planned his funeral, said goodbye to loved ones and ultimately died in my arms. If if wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was only 48 it would have been perfect. <br></p> <p>Dealing with the death was relatively easy compared to getting on with life without them.

I did not cry at the funeral, nor did I go to view his body. I couldn\u2019t believe he was gone for good. Many times I dreamt of bumping into him on the street. I thought he would come back, even though I knew and understood that he wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>I think most people find it hard to talk about death either due to a trauma or the death of a loved one, and in many African customs it is taboo to do so. Though it\u2019s been 13 years since my dad left I still weep as if he just died. He was my hero.

I did not understand how this could happen to me - not even as a punishment because I felt I had never done anything that would have deserved such a chastisement. <br></p> <p>This was when I started to try to find an answer, so I began reading about what happened after death, the meaning of life and death, why we are here on earth and so on. I got the answer after 30 years of research, so I know now why this happened to me. To me, death means to continue to live in a different form in another dimension where I will be able to meet all my dear ones who died before me and most importantly review all my past life on earth. I will then know if and how I have progressed spiritually. This will be done without judgment, just with love. Then, I will examine and decide what still has to be improved and go back to earth for another experience. </p> <p>In 2012 my mother died at the age of 84. She suffered a lot and wished she could die as soon as possible \u201cwaiting for the angels to take her\u201d. One day she had an accident at home while cooking - she was burnt and taken to hospital where she died two months later. At the very minute she died, I felt filled with an unutterable sensation of happiness which I couldn\u2019t explain at first and I understood when I was told the precise time when she died. I was so happy that she had been freed at last. My sisters got depressed and didn\u2019t understand my reaction at first, but I told them how I felt and they agreed that it was the best way to deal with our mother\u2019s death. <br></p> <p>I hope there will be more records similar to mine, so that people grow aware that there is nothing to fear about death - no judgment, no hell, no punishment - only love exists. </p> <p><em>Jean Louis, 65-year-old retired teacher living in France</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"077537da394eb4f62294c0ffee0f9ecd475dae3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/077537da394eb4f62294c0ffee0f9ecd475dae3e/98_46_730_913/400.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Shepherd\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Shepherd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Those who talk openly and honestly about death tend to have a more peaceful, meaningful time at the end of their life\u2019<br></h2> <p>Popular media images of death and dying often portray an image of inevitable suffering, as does frequent media coverage highlighting the inadequacies of health and social services in providing good end of life care and support.

I had a welter of family deaths as a child, most of whose funerals I didn\u2019t go to. Now we do the opposite, encouraging as much family involvement as possible. <br></p> <p>It is entirely understandable that people find it difficult to talk about death. The implications of our own extinction and that of the Earth\u2019s are huge, particularly now we are at a stage when even the planet may die. I dealt with the deaths of those close to me quite badly. It\u2019s why I\u2019m an undertaker - do what I say, not what I do. <br></p> <p><em>Rupert Callender, ceremonial undertaker and sexton, and co owner of <a href=\"http://www.thegreenfuneralcompany.co.uk/\">The Green Funeral Company </a></em><br></p> <h2>\u2018I know that he\u2019s still present\u2019<br></h2> <p>My father\u2019s death two years ago was sudden and unexpected. The family gathered, and we supported one another. Tears, yes, but plenty of loving laughter - he had an offbeat personality in some ways with a great sense of humour, even around death: he\u2019d always said (in jest) that when he goes he wanted to be stuffed and sat in a chair so he could be glowering at people! <br></p> <p>Of course there is the awful reality of his loss in all our lives, the desperate sadness that he\u2019s not here in the physical. He genuinely hadn\u2019t an enemy in the world, and family, friends and colleagues past and present, travelled from far and wide to be at his funeral.<br> </p> <p>I know that he\u2019s still present though, with countless confirmations of that, so we still go on walks together (a shared love of nature) and we \u2018chat\u2019 daily. It\u2019s the next best thing to being in the same physical universe.<br></p> <p><em>Angela, 55-year-old artist and writer living in Ireland</em></p> <h2>\u2018It is far easier to grieve among family and friends\u2019<br></h2> <p>My father died while I was working in Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. My brother sent a telegram, but my employers (who had my passport in a safe) did not pass the telegram to me. I found out a few weeks later via a letter from my mother which started from the premise that I knew already. From this experience I learned that it is far easier to grieve and move on if you do it among family and friends. </p> <p><em>Old Scarborian, 58-year-old lecturer <br></em></p> <p><strong>We\u2019d like to hear how you remember your loved ones after they\u2019ve died.

  "<p>Europe is closing. \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d reiterates PM Theresa May, buying time until the negotiations for this apparent \u201chard Brexit\u201d are hammered out. In this political purgatory, businesses are left floundering, unsure about what it will actually mean for them. For British bands touring on the continent, the uncertainty about one of their only certain means of income could not have come at a worse time. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just bands, agents and tour managers voicing worries about the miasma of ambiguity. Sir John Sorrell, the founder of the Creative Industries Federation, has recently argued that touring acts could be driven off the road due to visa and carnet costs in a post-Brexit Europe. (Carnet is a system governing transportation of equipment across borders without having to complete customs declarations on every item, but they could run up to \u00a32,000 a year.) These will all slash the margins of an artist\u2019s primary source of income. Sorrell said the creative sector is \u201ca key driver of wealth and global success\u201d for the UK. \u201cTo imperil that would be to imperil our wider economy.\u201d </p> <p>Touring agents and managers that I have spoken to off the record in recent months all revealed enormous uncertainty about what will happen to British acts playing shows and festivals across Europe in the aftershock of Brexit. They are trying to put a brave face on things but most are fearing the worst \u2013 namely the closure of opportunities and escalating running costs that could make touring utterly unsustainable. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think the biggest thing for me as a production manager would be the addition of a carnet for every show outside the UK,\u201d Joel Stanley, production manager at Production Value, <a href=\"http://www.iq-mag.net/2016/03/brexit-2016-live-music-business/\">told live industry trade magazine IQ</a> in March. \u201cCurrently we only ever have to show proof of ownership with the bond and have it stamped in and out if we go outside of the EU \u2013 mainly Switzerland \u2013 but [post-Brexit we\u2019d need a carnet] even for a one-off show in France.\u201d</p> <p>Agents and touring artists are already dealing with the aftermath of the decline of the CD business. In the boom years, labels would underwrite shows with tour support and regard this as a marketing investment to break new acts that would then go on, ideally, to sell lots of records, thereby covering that development cost. That is now evaporating to the point where 20-date European tours are being truncated to 10 or eight-date jaunts around Europe, with days off a rare thing because days off mean no money is coming in. </p> <p>The net effect could be that acts will just focus on a handful of big European cities \u2013 but if they all do that, the shrunken market will quickly become over-saturated and everyone will lose. Add in the possibility of requiring a work visa for every European country and costs could spiral before acts have even played their first show of a European tour. This is already making it hard in other major markets; the same system in Europe could be catastrophic.</p> <p>\u201cGetting visas is an absolute minefield and it costs a lot of money, and it\u2019s the reason that a lot of people don\u2019t get to tour America,\u201d Colin Roberts of Big Life Management <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1186-the-uk-leaving-the-eu-would-change-the-european-music-industry/\">told Pitchfork in June</a>. \u201cEven going to a country like Japan where visas are quite easy to get, I know how difficult it is having to factor in the cost and the time to acquire a visa.\u201d</p> <p>The government loves to pay lip service to the export power of British music, braying and gloating from boxes at the Brit awards about how proud they are of our globally successful artists. Britain, since Beatlemania, has been the second biggest exporter of music globally after the US. There is a huge amount of money at stake here for both artists and the UK economy. A <a href=\"http://www.ukmusic.org/research/music-tourism-wish-you-were-here-2016/\">study by UK Music</a> this summer found there were 10.4m \u201cmusic tourists\u201d coming to the UK in 2015 and their direct and indirect spend was \u00a33.7bn. These are people drawn to the UK because of the live market, its successful music exports and its diverse grassroots scenes.</p> <p>On top of this, <a href=\"https://www.bpi.co.uk/home/british-artists-score-highest-recorded-share-of-global-music-sales.aspx\">the BPI reports</a> that British acts accounted for one in seven albums sold globally in 2014, with their record sales generating approximately $2.75bn that year. So there are really two issues here: the outbound earnings of the acts on the road, and the inbound earnings that come from the UK being seen as a global force in music. </p> <p>There is an argument that just because the UK has successfully exported the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Coldplay, Adele and so on, it will just keep doing so forever. It won\u2019t. It needs support and infrastructure at all levels (not just for superstars). </p> <p>It\u2019s an industry truism that the old model of touring as a loss leader to sell albums has been inverted \u2013 records are now loss leaders to promote tours. But if you garrotte the touring opportunities, then everyone down the pecking order suffers, and those at the very bottom suffer first and hardest. Couple this with the systematic closure of key grassroots venues around the UK \u2013 something the Music Venue Trust was set up as a registered charity in 2014 to lobby against \u2013 and things are starting to look very bleak indeed for the future of British live music.</p> <p><br></p>",

The <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/28/a-closer-look-at-the-gender-gap-in-presidential-voting/\">gender gap</a> looks likely to be greater than in any previous election. Some women are turning Donald Trump\u2019s hot mic words against him and wearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-pussy-grabs-back-meme-women-twitter\">\u201cPussy grabs back\u201d T-shirts</a> and changing their Twitter profiles to include the term \u201cNasty Woman\u201d; after Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight website <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\">reported a gender split in polling</a> and produced maps showing how Trump would win if only men could vote, Trump supporters <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/trump-supporters-repeal-19th-amendment-article-1.2828571\">started a hashtag on Twitter</a> #repealthe19th, calling for the repeal of the 19th amendment, which delivered suffrage for women. </p> <p>In short, American gender politics has reached a raw and deeply polarised point that this election is both reflecting and accentuating. \u201cIn some ways Obama\u2019s presidency and candidacy brought out more of the racial prejudice that might have been suppressed,\u201d says Linda Hanson, the current spokesperson for the LWV in Muncie-Delaware County, who readers suggested we speak to. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re seeing the prejudices in the same way with Hillary. I think her presence is exacerbating the misogyny and drawing it out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"282aaf71ed565a7ea07b03c72671eb02bdf99e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/282aaf71ed565a7ea07b03c72671eb02bdf99e6f/0_459_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in Walnut Street in downtown Muncie, during a \u2018First Thursday\u2019 Arts Walk event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women in Walnut Street in downtown Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Since Trump's boasts of sexually assaulting women, the importance of Hillary being a woman speaks to me more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while African Americans, among others, overwhelmingly rallied around Obama\u2019s candidacy (delivering him <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/11/exit-polls-how-obama-won-015297\">96% of the black vote</a>) and celebrated the prospect of the first black president, Clinton\u2019s campaign has produced more ambivalence and less excitement among women (among whom she enjoys <a href=\"http://presidentialgenderwatch.org/polls/womens-vote-watch/presidential-polling-data/\">50% of the vote</a> ).</p> <p>In Muncie, women are divided on Clinton. The most obvious difference is partisan. Like other Trump voters, women who are voting Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/27/middletown-trump-muncie-clinton\">can\u2019t bear her</a>. At last week\u2019s meeting of the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government (CDCGG), a conservative campaigning group where half of those in attendance were women, one woman asked: \u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d Another replied: \u201cLook at the kind of women who are standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Responses to Trump\u2019s statements also broadly divide on partisan lines.\u201cThey said he was sexist because he called that beauty queen who\u2019d put on weight Miss Piggy,\u201d said one of the women at CDCGG. \u201cBut women say that kind of thing about women all the time.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to Trump\u2019s assertion that he \u201cgrabs women by the pussy,\u201d Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and whose only previous presidential vote was for Obama in 2008, said: \u201cIt does bother me but personally I\u2019m not easily offended. I\u2019ve heard worse, I\u2019ve seen worse, I\u2019ve experienced worse \u2013 and all of a sudden these people haven\u2019t heard all these things before. You\u2019re kidding me. I think the outrage is overplayed for votes.\u201d </p> <p>Cathy Day, 48, an English professor at Ball State University who originally backed Bernie Sanders, says: \u201cSince Trump has started boasting about sexually assaulting women the importance of her being a woman has definitely started to speak to me more.\u201d</p> <p>But like many women here who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/20/middletown-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-muncie\">originally voted for Sanders</a>, Clinton still does not appeal to Day, who displays a sign for every other Democratic candidate in her front yard but the presidential nominee, even if she will vote for her. \u201cAs a woman it was kind of hard for me to hear some of the anti-Hillary stuff when I was campaigning for Sanders because I think a lot of it came from a place of misogyny,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes it was women saying it. But I identify as a working-class woman. My class identity is very important to me and her candidacy didn\u2019t really speak to me on that level.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan Aprill, 23, of the Progressive Student Alliance, backed Sanders and is now voting for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important that there could be a female president,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for us too and it\u2019s about time. Of course it\u2019s emblematic. I just wish it was a different woman. I\u2019m voting for another female candidate.\u201d</p> <p>Sousa, who says she is not a \u201crabid Hillary fan\u201d herself, believes a higher bar is being set for Clinton than her male counterparts of the past. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of women who detest her intensely,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for this statement but I heard someone say: \u2018We\u2019ve gotten used to voting for males we don\u2019t like. We\u2019ve held our nose and we\u2019ve voted for them for whatever reason. But we aren\u2019t used to doing that with a woman.\u2019 Our culture holds women to a higher standard. </p> <p>\u201cI always thought that was an excuse not to treat women equally. It hasn\u2019t been that long since women got the vote \u2026 not even a century yet. So you couldn\u2019t find the perfect woman to run for president any more than you could find the perfect African American to be the first African-American president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78734a0c224ee0149a6cf955c455c8ea859e71f9/0_429_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runners on the Greenway park development that follows the route of the White River through Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Views are also shaded quite heavily by race. Sanders won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, but Clinton won handily in Whitely, the black part of town on the east side. \u201cI\u2019m 33 years old,\u201d says Monique Armstrong, the executive director of <a href=\"http://www.motivateourminds.org/about-us/\">Motivate Our Minds</a> which is based in Whitely and offers after-school and recreational activities to children and teens.</p> <p>\u201cI remember when Hillary was first lady. I\u2019m married but I have not changed my name [as Clinton didn\u2019t initially in her career]. I\u2019m a leader in an organisation. I\u2019ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to improving the lives of children. So when I think about the things they don\u2019t like about her as a candidate they are probably the same things they don\u2019t like about me.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, there seems to be a generational divide. For younger women, who are far more likely to vote for Clinton than older women, the historical relevance of her possible election may not resonate so much.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for women who are in their 20s or 30s to understand what women in their 60s and 70s went through when they were coming up that age,\u201d explains Sousa, who several readers suggested we spoke to. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women of my age who felt themselves passed over because they were female or were verbally harassed just in thoughtless ways rather than mean ways who do value what she has come through. Women who know that they can get into law school and medical school have a whole different perspective on our history as women.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the campaign season, the local LWV proposed a forum at which candidates from all the parties could explain their policies as it related to women, as they have often done in the past. The Republicans refused to participate.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the things we raise as being of concern to our members they are consistent,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cThey\u2019ve been there for decades. They are pretty mainstream. But now those positions have been identified by some on the far right as being too far left. So the Republican party chair said the candidates didn\u2019t have to participate in our forum and that meant the Democrats couldn\u2019t either. So it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Most women I\u2019ve spoken to in Muncie think the prospects for gender equality are improving both here and beyond, but there is still significant work to do. To that extent it is fairly typical of America.</p> <p>According to a recent poll, women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years by a ratio of almost two to one. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/president-poll-women-hillary-clinton.html\">three-quarters of women</a> think there\u2019s some or a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace and believe women doing similar work are getting paid less than men. More than half of Americans consider Clinton a role model; less than half think she is judged more harshly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5555c224734e75c2feb17ea33ef839b5128df918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5555c224734e75c2feb17ea33ef839b5128df918/888_518_3411_2046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fickle Peach on E Charles Street on the corner of Walnut Street, downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fickle Peach on E Charles Street on the corner of Walnut Street, downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Muncie <a href=\"http://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/local/2015/03/20/muncie-mayors-profiles-every-one-brady-tyler/25079959/\">elected its first female mayor</a>, Sharon McShurley, in 2008. McShurley served until 2012, and Hanson says women now occupy some important positions guiding the economic and cultural regeneration of the town. But there is still a long way to go. Hanson says McShurley\u2019s \u201cself-presentation was criticised in the same ways that Hillary Clinton\u2019s was \u2026 they would still talk about the way she spoke, the way she dressed, it was really sexist\u201d.</p> <p>A counsellor at the local women\u2019s shelter, who works with first offenders in spousal abuse, told Sousa that many of the men he sees haven\u2019t seen women treated with respect and that their experience is that\u2019s the way men treat women. \u201cA lot has changed,\u201d says Sousa, \u201cbut the underbelly of interpersonal relationships hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>That pause for reflection in the ballot box was important, she says, but she doesn\u2019t want to fetishise it. \u201cIt was a moment. But I don\u2019t want to make too big a deal out of it. It should just be something that happens. It\u2019s too bad it\u2019s taken so long. But I hope her being a woman doesn\u2019t become the main thing about her as she goes forward. That it\u2019s about what she\u2019s able to do. Once we get past this we can try and move on and take care of the problems this country has because we certainly have a lot of them.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>Madrid\u2019s city council is on the verge of temporarily slashing the number of cars allowed into the city centre by half as the Spanish capital struggles with high levels of air pollution.</p> <p>With levels of nitrogen dioxide rising above permitted levels, the city authorities have activated a series of anti-pollution measures, reducing the speed limit on the M30 orbital motorway around the centre and banning parking in the area for non-residents.

Fine: it is a story repeatedly related to me by people who were actually at Orgreave and that is borne out by subsequent police testimonies, and I believe it both highlights a terrible miscarriage of justice and is revealing about how power works in this country. You may disagree, but an inquiry would have given the opportunity to settle the issue. And, yes, Labour should have initiated its own when it was in office, although it was its belated decision to launch the Hillsborough inquiry that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/orgreave-inquiry-calls-grow-after-damning-hillsborough-verdict-for-south-yorkshire-police\">fuelled demands for justice for Orgreave</a>.

South Yorkshire police were violent, ideologically driven and corrupt. But they were not stupid. They behaved as they did because they believed they had official sanction to do so. They then learned a lesson \u2013 quite reasonably \u2013 that they could act with impunity. Counterfactual history is a mug\u2019s game, and it would be wrong to state with total certainty that Hillsborough would never have happened if the police had been held to account after Orgreave. But it is beyond question that their subsequent behaviour was uncannily similar: treating their working-class victims as scum, lying in concert with the British media, falsifying witness statements, covering up what they did. And this time people did die \u2013 in their dozens.</p> <p>Imagine if a Labour government had ruled Britain in the 1980s, deliberately run down the financial sector, and sent police officers rampaging through the Home Counties to beat up City workers fighting for their jobs and communities. The truth is the Tories are soaked in triumphalism. They transformed Britain in the 1980s, they are proud of it \u2013 fine \u2013 and they have no interest in exposing the ugly deeds committed in the process. As <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/amber-rudd-praised-for-resisting-calls-for-battle-of-orgreave-in/\">Norman Tebbit puts it</a>, \u201can inquiry could have been used as a stick with which to beat the Thatcher government\u201d. That\u2019s what this is really about: not justice, but defending the reputation of a Conservative party that was content to subvert the rule of law if that was what it took. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, one side preaches the class war, the other practises it. But Theresa May\u2019s government should be warned. Those driven by justice tend to be persistent \u2013 and history judges them rather more kindly than those who obstruct them.</p>",
  "<p>Windfarms and solar power could soon lose the privilege of getting priority over other energy sources on European electricity grids, leaked documents show.</p> <p>Paring back the \u201cpriority dispatch\u201d system could increase carbon emissions by up to 10%, according to a confidential EU impact assessment seen by the Guardian. But the document goes on to model four scenarios for doing just that, in a bid to make Europe\u2019s energy generators more flexible and cost-competitive.</p> <p>Some industry sources have told the Guardian they are alarmed and think it highly likely that priority dispatch for clean energy will be scrapped from the EU\u2019s renewable energy directive, which is currently being redrafted for the post-2020 period. </p> <p>Oliver Joy, a spokesman for the WindEurope trade association, said: \u201cRemoving priority dispatch for renewable energies would be detrimental to the wind sector, which would face more curtailment across the continent.

It would mean that the commission was taking measures against the same renewable industries that they defend in public.\u201d</p> <p>Fossil fuel power providers argue that renewables have the lowest operating costs and so would anyway receive priority access to the grid network.</p> <p>They also say that taking the clean energy sector out of priority dispatch would prevent \u201cnegative prices\u201d - where more energy is produced than can be sold \u2013 and eliminate anti-competitive subsidies.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s assessment views the abolishing of priority dispatch as a step towards the creation of a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for energy generators.</p> <p>But without such a system, renewable sources may be the most likely to be taken offline because of the relative ease of switching off a wind turbine compared to a coal or nuclear plant.</p> <p>The energy source with the lowest marginal cost - almost always renewables - is usually the first in line to be shut down by power grid operators.</p> <p>As things are, a Europe-wide trend towards ending financial support has constrained the forward march of renewables on the continent, and siphoned off investment to elsewhere in the world.</p> <p> \u201cEveryone is investing in renewables outside Europe right now,\u201d said one industry source. \u201cIf you want to bring investors back you have to send very relevant signals.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">Renewables made up half of net electricity capacity added last year</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Removing wind and solar power from priority dispatch may be intended to help reform the capacity market system, which currently pays gas generators to remain idle. Ironically though, it could lead renewable generators to demand an extension of the same mechanism to their own sector.</p> <p> \u201cIf priority dispatch is removed, then renewables must be given a fall-back option of access and renumeration in the balancing markets to help stabilise the system, or clear levels of compensation in the event that curtailment is necessary,\u201d Joy said.</p> <p> Priority dispatch is supposed to be mandatory under current EU rules, although the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands are among countries that do not comply.</p> <p>The study says that \u201cthe biggest impacts on generation [from ending priority dispatch] would be observed in Denmark, Great Britain and Finland, where biomass holds a large share of generation capacity\u201d.</p> <p>But this would be felt more in terms of bioenergy\u2019s \u201cexpensive\u201d production costs than its carbon emissions reduction potential, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/02/eu-renewable-energy-target-biomass\">disputed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/02/eu-renewable-energy-target-biomass\">inside and outside the commission.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe removal of priority dispatch for biomass would indeed, in the first instance, imply an increase in GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions,\u201d the paper says.</p> <p> The four scenarios for scaling back priority dispatch involve an increase in CO2 emissions of 45m-60m tonnes. </p>",

But other events raise doubts.</p> <p>In Britain the Conservative government has approved one new gas fracking project and is supportive of a second (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\" title=\"\">Fracking given go-ahead, 14 October</a>). In Canada, the Liberal government has approved a massive liquefied natural gas pipeline project, slated to become the biggest carbon polluter in the country, putting its reduction promises at risk (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/canada-pacific-northwest-lng-natural-gas-pipeline-british-columbia\" title=\"\">World roundup, 7 October</a>).</p> <p>These and other decisions suggest that governments still are not making the connection between promises to reduce greenhouse gases and the need to reduce carbon combustion. They still think they can square the circle between energy production growth and carbon pollution reduction. They can\u2019t, and until they understand that, Paris will go the way of Kyoto, which Canada, to its shame, signed, did nothing to fulfil, then formally abandoned.<br><strong>Keith Stotyn</strong><br>Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</p> <h2><strong>The desire for protest</strong><br></h2> <p>Mass protests by citizens outraged over Aleppo would be tilting at windmills <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/destruction-aleppo-russia-massacre-civilians-grozny\" title=\"\">(Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de, 14 October)</a>. Protests by our governments \u2013 and the media \u2013 are hypocritical. We long ago accepted the US declaration of a war on terror as an appropriate response to a criminal act when we should have criticised the idea of declaring war on a strategy.</p> <p>We tolerate Saudi Arabia\u2019s bombing of Yemen, and when dropping bombs on a funeral results in hundreds of death and injured civilians, headlines are short-lived. When the US drops bombs \u2013 B-52 carpet bombing in Vietnam and Laos, smart bombs over Afghanistan, Iraq, bombs by drones wherever the US deems it appropriate in its war on terror \u2013 there are no calls to boycott the US or any of the companies profiting from its war on terror. We accept that our side kills only terrorists. When civilians are killed, it is a regrettable accident.</p> <p>Our policy is consistent on the subject of Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimea and the occupation of Ukraine. We have long ago accepted Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine and its settlement policy, as we have accepted China\u2019s annexation of Tibet. These countries are our political and economic allies.

Concerned citizens in western countries will rightly turn out in their thousands to protest against human rights abuses perpetrated by their own governments, But these same people seem to care less about similar abuses by other governments, which must surely tell those governments that no one in the west cares one jot about dropping bunker-busting bombs and carpet bombing civilians.

But every day the kitchen crew put on to the dining-room tables 1.5-litre plastic bottles of water imported from Italy. Every year tons of this water are imported at great expense.</p> <p>Why did the personnel prefer bottled water? They thought that Antarctic snow was too clean; it\u2019s distilled water, so it doesn\u2019t contain essential minerals, so they thought it was unhealthy.

You can question the award on grounds of the suitability or the quality of Bob Dylan\u2019s work, but to complain so bitterly about the award simply on the basis that Dylan is a \u201cwhite male writer\u201d, as Kon-yu does, reduces the individual himself to nothing more than a skin colour and a gender \u2013 that is outright racism and sexism. To define Dylan\u2019s win only by his race and gender is bad enough; it is outrageous when taking into account Dylan\u2019s prominent role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. <br><strong>David Kettle</strong><br>Northcote, Victoria, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Defending the Dalai Lama</strong><br></h2> <p>Alexandra Tavernier\u2019s remarks regarding the Dalai Lama and Tibet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/oct/18/weekly-letters-childrens-stunted-lives\" title=\"\">(Reply, 21 October)</a> merely parrot the official Chinese line.

More outrageously, she suggests that after 1951 the Chinese embarked on a \u201cclean-up\u201d of Tibet. Hardly. In 1986 I spent two months there and can attest that ordinary Tibetans had no access to modern plumbing. So what had the Chinese authorities been up to for 35 years? Occupying the country, plain and simple, while thousands of Tibetans fled or died. As for the Dalai Lama\u2019s own flight, Tavernier gets it wrong again.

After all, Patient Zero\u2019s importance has long been downplayed by scientists, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19827.html\">recognized as</a> \u201cneither the first Aids case to come to CDC researchers\u2019 attention, nor the first to display symptoms.\u201d And while Nature notes the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19827.html\">origins of HIV/Aids</a> \u201cremain contentious\u201d amongst serious scholars, \u201cand the earliest movements of the virus within the US are unknown,\u201d Shilt\u2019s account has never been taken too seriously by them.</p> <p>And the Band Played On \u2013 a work of book-length journalism written as the Aids epidemic was unfolding in the United States \u2013 was not a work that examined events after time had passed. Since Shilts\u2019s death (itself related to Aids), his overwrought emphasis on Dugas has been widely criticized by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/anthony-petro-after-the-wrath-of-god/\">Aids historians</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=kZOso0FMsrMC&amp;q=and+the+band+played+on#v=snippet&amp;q=and%20the%20band%20played%20on&amp;f=false\">social scientists</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046389/\">public health researchers</a> \u2013 particularly for framing \u201cthe epidemiological spread of the epidemic as very much a <em tabindex=\"-1\">moral</em> failing on the part of this flight attendant,\u201d as scholar <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/anthony-petro-after-the-wrath-of-god/\">Anthony Petro puts it</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Indeed, those of us who study Aids have long known that long before common symptoms such as Kaposi sarcoma and pneumonia were showing up among hemophiliacs and gay men, they were likely affecting homeless people who lived off society\u2019s radar, people who used IV drugs and those who avoided medical treatment out of fear. As activist Betty Williams told the<a href=\"http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/bwilliams.pdf\"> Act up Oral History project</a> in 2008: \u201cI actually believe that Aids kind of existed among this group of people first, because if you look back, there was something called junkie pneumonia, there was something called the dwindles that addicts got, and I think this was another early Aids population way too helpless to ever do anything for themselves on their own behalf.\u201d</p> <p>What is newsworthy about the Nature study is that, by \u201cjackhammering\u201d the decaying RNA of decades-old blood samples, epidemiologists have proven that the strain of HIV Dugas had was already circulating before he was a carrier. The Times article also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html?_r=0\">poetically points out</a> an irony: Dugas was never supposed to be known as Patient Zero, but as Patient Letter O, for \u201coutside southern California\u201d.</p> <p>So why, then, did the myth of Patient Zero live on for so long? Why was he, or anyone, scapegoated in the first place?</p> <p>Both happened because we like to blame individuals (especially queer folks, women, immigrants and people of color) for diseases, particularly communicable ones that involve sex. Societally, it is far easier to blame them for disease rather than to deal with the complex medical, political and epidemiological causes \u2013 just as it has been easier to unfairly malign Dugas all these years.</p> <p>In white America\u2019s long, ableist history of considering itself well unless made unwell by those it considers <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/3560422/Technologies_of_Blood_Asylum_Medicine_and_Biopolitics\">sick outsiders</a>, Dugas was just one of many individually maligned as pariahs. </p> <p>They include <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Typhoid-Mary-Captive-Publics-Health/dp/0807021032\">\u201cTyphoid\u201d Mary Mallon</a>, an Irish immigrant blamed for typhoid transmission and kept in isolation for 26 years on an island in New York City; <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/notorious-h-i-v\">Nushawn Williams</a>, convicted for transmitting HIV to nine young women and \u2013 despite having long ago finished his sentence \u2013 kept in<a href=\"https://www.poz.com/article/hivpositive-convict-nushawn-williams-remain-civil-confinement\"> \u201ccivil confinement\u201d indefinitely</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/a-black-body-on-trial-the-conviction-of-hiv-positive-tiger-m?utm_term=.dyLKjPy6e6#.tul8rPXOJO\">Michael \u201cTiger Mandingo\u201d Johnson</a> (whom I have covered at length and is the subject of my doctoral dissertation), who was convicted of four people to HIV and transmitting the virus to one person despite there being no RNA evidence used to even see if Johnson and his sex partner shared the same strain of HIV. (Johnson is serving a 30-year prison sentence in Missouri, often in solitary confinement, in a state where the average sentence for second-degree murder is only<a href=\"https://doc.mo.gov/Documents/publications/Offender%20Profile%20FY14.pdf\"> 25 years</a>.)</p> <p>But while blaming diseases on individuals \u2013 or even criminalizing them, as people with HIV are in more than <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html\">30 US states</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hivjustice.net/news/new-report-shows-hiv-criminalisation-is-growing-global-problem-but-advocates-are-fighting-back/\">70 countries</a> \u2013 may make well people feel weirdly superior, it doesn\u2019t do much about curing or curtailing the transmission of communicable diseases. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/\">According to</a> the World Health Organization, Aids has killed about 35 million people, and about 37 million people are currently living with HIV globally. Threatening them for living with such a treatable disease only increases its stigma, forcing them into the shadows and decreasing the likelihood that others at risk will get tested.<br></p> <p>We would do well to look at the Nature study\u2019s new timeline and ponder if HIV was circulating among IV drug users in the early 1970s. Many such people avoided healthcare settings which they (rightly) believed could be punitive \u2013 which could have aided HIV\u2019s transmission. We as a society are in part to blame, then, for creating the condition in which the epidemic could take hold \u2013 just as we are now responsible for allowing punitive laws that specifically target HIV to continue letting it flourish. </p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that societies begin to understand that a disease exists and is worthy of treatment only when it begins to affect people (or animals) whose lives the society values. When Aids was only affecting homeless people and IV drug users in the US, there was not a critical mass of care about them to make it register. Aids began to come into some focus when it affected homosexual men, not because gay men\u2019s lives were valued by US society at large (they weren\u2019t), but because amongst them were some powerful, often closeted, white gay men who were raised to believe their bodies were important and infallible. </p> <p>When they believed that their bodies were unfairly giving out on them (and threatening to out them), these men \u2013 along with out lesbians and gay men and transgender people of all races \u2013 did something about it, founding groups like <a href=\"http://gmhc.org/\">Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.actupny.org/\">Act-up</a>. They applied so much pressure that scientific and political communities had to verify that Aids existed.<br></p> <p>Hastening this process was news that hemophiliacs and others receiving blood and organ transfusions were affected. These people \u2013 particularly children like Ryan White \u2013 were considered \u201cinnocent\u201d and worthy of protecting from the disease, unlike homosexuals like Dugas who were considered guilty for getting it and for giving it to others.</p> <p>Since the disease wasn\u2019t given public attention until it infected those with societal clout, is it ever right to out one believed to be \u201cPatient Zero\u201d? As a journalist, I understand the desire to do so to tell a story. Times story author Donald G McNeil Jr <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/sunday-review/the-ethics-of-hunting-down-patient-zero.html?_r=0\">defends</a> the practice epidemiologically, saying stopping such people is important in stopping epidemics. But he uses the term \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d, which sounds too much like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/25/hillary-clinton-race-crime-justice-reform\">super-predators</a>\u201d and is too pejorative for my taste, with both terms overburdening the individual rather than the conditions they inhabit.</p> <p>In her new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Not-Abuse-Overstating-Responsibility/dp/1551526433\">Conflict Is Not Abuse</a>, novelist and Aids historian Sarah Schulman writes about how the transmission of HIV to millions worldwide is a normative human experience unworthy of criminalization or stigma. Dugas was innocent not just because RNA now says so, but because <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/10002442/Statement_of_Ownership_An_Autethnography_of_Living_with_HIV\">all people who live with HIV or who die of Aids are innocent</a>. </p> <p>Let\u2019s allow Dugas\u2019s most recent exoneration to be his final one, and let\u2019s take this chance to retire the idea of the HIV/Aids scapegoat. Let\u2019s stop the shame and blame, so that we may move on the challenge of tackling the real, treatable and preventable ways HIV is transmitted.</p>",

We weren\u2019t offered no new runways or a truly decentralised, community-owned energy system. The government didn\u2019t ask whether we want the security of not transporting nuclear weapons across our country.

The arguments against Trident are well-rehearsed. But the very fact that building a new generation of weapons of mass destruction is pitched by politicians as central to our nationhood should give us pause for thought.

It has stated that it is in favour of renewal \u2013 but the party has a leader who, quite rightly, says he would never fire the missiles if he became prime minister. Both positions have logic to them, but combined in one party and the end point is committing to building a nuclear weapons system based on the (flawed) theory of deterrence but with a cast-iron guarantee that the those submarines will do nothing more than float aimlessly around the ocean, in a constant state of readiness to do nothing. Perhaps one of the new vessels could be called HMS Pointless?</p> <p>Of course, if we scrap Trident we need to guarantee the jobs and economic security of those working at Faslane, Aldermaston and elsewhere. A \u201cdefence diversification agency\u201d would help to ensure a just transition for the people whose jobs are directly dependent on Trident.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just alternatives to Trident that are desperately needed. Instead of Hinkley, let\u2019s lead the world in energy conservation. Imagine, for example, that home insulation was central to the government\u2019s infrastructure plans. A <a href=\"http://www.energybillrevolution.org/whats-the-campaign/\" title=\"\">nationwide scheme</a> to keep people warm, cut fuel bills and tackle carbon emissions would create more than 100,000 jobs across the UK.</p> <p>Or imagine we redoubled our efforts to lead the world in renewables and energy storage technologies. That would create more jobs than nuclear weapons or power ever will. We know that green energy creates far more jobs per gigawatt and that every community in Britain can create its own power. Our energy system doesn\u2019t have to be centralised, or owned by multinational firms and foreign governments. It can be built in Britain, located in every community and it can be beautiful.</p> <p>Infrastructure isn\u2019t just about concrete and hard economic growth. It\u2019s about social connections, too. The qualitative growth that could come from a community learning new skills to manage and run renewable energy projects they own. The conversations over fences, in the post office and pub. It\u2019s the ties that bind us \u2013 and the networks that make us a whole greater than the sum of our parts.</p> <p>Indeed, I would argue that our biggest pieces of infrastructure aren\u2019t bridges, or buildings \u2013 they\u2019re the welfare state upon which we all rely, and our National Health Service. So when the government tells you it\u2019s investing in infrastructure, and then ministers don hard hats at opening ceremonies, remember what they\u2019re demolishing with one hand as they cut ribbons with the other.</p> <p>My challenge to both the government and the official opposition is simple: take a step back and think carefully about the kind of Britain we want to build. We\u2019re a small country, but we should be big in ambition. Let\u2019s pause for a moment before we pour more tarmac for more planes to land on, build obscenely expensive power plants or forge our path in the wake of submarines carrying weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>This is a fork in the road \u2013 and we have a chance to build an economy that not only meets the challenges of the 21st century head-on but creates a better country in the process. Let\u2019s not miss this opportunity.</p>",

With one in five people forced to flee their homes and more than half the population needing urgent humanitarian assistance, the need is too great.</p> <p>While NGOs can\u2019t control all the factors responsible for security, we need to look at how programmes can function when staff cannot access them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/17/attack-on-aid-workers-in-south-sudan-there-was-incredible-naivety\">Attack on aid workers in South Sudan: 'There was incredible naivety'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way is to empower local communities to take ownership of projects \u2013 this can be key to keeping programmes alive in some of the most dangerous places.

  "<p>Welcome to the month of November when half the world\u2019s planes seem to be stuffed with rugby players. Most have no choice if they wish to pursue their chosen trade. Ireland and New Zealand are in Chicago this week while Australia and South Africa are in London. Fiji are training in Toulouse, with England opting for a short warm-weather break in Portugal. There are almost as many gumshields passing through departure lounges as giant Toblerones.</p> <p>There is good reason for this hyperactivity. The game is increasingly global and spreading the gospel can be lucrative. The All Blacks are not in the States purely for the fresh Illinois air and Argentina did not stage their Rugby Championship Test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/argentina-australia-rugby-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">against Australia at Twickenham</a> last month because of the local tango-dancing scene. Beyond the financial inducements, though, there are additional benefits: a change of scene can eradicate staleness and complacency and create unexpected new friendships.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/eddie-jones-george-ford-toulon-england\">Eddie Jones warns George Ford that Toulon move would end England career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last season\u2019s Top 14 final in Barcelona was a case in point. It was shifted to Catalonia only because French stadiums were being used for the European football championship but the staggering attendance and vivid atmosphere made every continental administrator sit up and take notice. Spain also performed creditably at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/the-olympic-games-and-rugby-sevens-a-match-made-in-heaven\" title=\"\">Olympic sevens tournament in Rio</a>: could there be a whole new Iberian audience out there waiting to be enticed, if only occasionally, from their round-ball obsession?</p> <p>Which brings us back, not for the first time, to the Rugby Football Union\u2019s narrower horizons. Bumping into English squad players on red-eye flights to a Portugal training camp on Monday morning was a culture shock simply because it happens so rarely. Aside from one short hop across the Irish Sea to Dublin next March, this is the only time the majority of England\u2019s senior squad will have to board a flight on international business between now and next June. With just about everything the RFU organises occurring in the home counties, a valid driving licence and an Oyster card are pretty much the only requirements.</p> <p>Once again all four internationals in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/29/autumn-internationals-home-nations-england-wales-ireland-scotland\" title=\"\">this autumn\u2019s Old Mutual Wealth series</a> will take place at Twickenham on successive Saturdays. Only a few hundred unsold tickets remain so, financially, the schedule stacks up nicely. Four 80,000-plus attendances, in addition to all the associated corporate hospitality benefits and huge bar profits, will clearly swell the coffers more than taking the odd home Test fixture out on the road.</p> <p>But hang on. This is a union which has just posted revenues of \u00a3407.1m, with record profits for rugby investment of \u00a3102.3m. Admittedly a large chunk of that was a consequence of staging the 2015 World Cup but the RFU is far wealthier than any other union. Where it has been less obviously successful is in raising the profile of rugby union in the north of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/06/rugby-union-twickenham-manchester-world-cup-2015\" title=\"\">a recurring issue that does little to promote the 15-a-side code as a truly national sport</a>.</p> <p>It can be easy, and somewhat misleading, to dismiss English rugby league as a game played in just a few northern counties. But what about the latest England senior rugby union team? Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/courtney-lawes-injury-england-south-africa\" title=\"\">Josh Beaumont was called in</a> as an injury replacement, only one member of the 33-strong training squad currently plays for a northern club. Sale\u2019s Mike Haley is that rarest of comets, a northern resident who has caught Twickenham\u2019s attention. None of the other 32 live north of Leicestershire. Before last autumn\u2019s dead rubber against Uruguay, England had hosted one full international in Manchester since 1897.</p> <p>With Ian Ritchie as chief executive and another northerner, Andy Cosslett, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/21/rfu-appoint-andrew-cosslett-chairman\" title=\"\">recently sworn in as the RFU\u2019s new chairman</a>, it is not as if there is a lack of appreciation inside Twickenham that the world does not stop at Watford Gap services. When the Guardian made discreet inquiries last week it was told there remains a continuing desire for representative teams to play at northern venues but, crucially, not the senior XV.</p> <p>It is not good enough. Where would English football be without strong northern clubs? How insular would English cricket look if it did not stage a single Test or one-day international north of the River Trent? How does English rugby union plan to enthuse youngsters and their families from Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cumbria if it gives league a largely unopposed head start? Is it entirely a coincidence that northern lads \u2013 Chris Ashton, Sam Burgess, David Strettle \u2013 seem increasingly more comfortable with the idea of playing abroad than sticking around in English union. Or that the two main northern cogs in England\u2019s backline \u2013 Owen Farrell and George Ford \u2013 gravitated towards union largely because their fathers took coaching jobs down south? Tommy Taylor and Danny Care bring the total number of northern-born players currently in Portugal to a measly half dozen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/sam-warburton-world-cup-wales-british-irish-lions-new-zealand\">Sam Warburton: \u2018You watch Sky with everyone else to see if you\u2019re in Lions squad\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe it is idealistic to think that playing a Test match against Fiji \u2013 or Australia come to that \u2013 in Leeds or Manchester would directly assist England in winning the 2023 and 2027 World Cups. Maybe the RFU\u2019s profits would be affected. Maybe it would be less convenient for Eddie Jones to train his players beside the seaside in Blackpool or Bridlington than in Brighton or Brown\u2019s sporting academy in Portugal. But New Zealand train and play at venues all around their country and it does not hinder their national team \u2013 the opposite, in fact. Sticking to convention and doing what you always do is no way to run or grow a sport, let alone deliver a truly national side. England do not even have to board a plane to locate fresh new frontiers.</p> <h2>Get shirty</h2> <p>The 2017 British and Irish Lions jersey is being unveiled this week, still a must-have garment for all professional players in the four home unions. Not every strip seen this season falls into that category: will many players reminisce nostalgically about the days they wore the dull grey away strip of Bath or the hi-vis green stewards\u2019 outfits currently sported by Leicester on their travels? Or those shorts with a sponsor\u2019s name plastered across the players\u2019 backsides? It was a marketing wheeze but New Zealand\u2019s deliberately blacker-than-black kit \u2013 with accompanying socks and dark boots to match \u2013 was at least more visually striking and aesthetically appealing. Compare and contrast with the latest blue change kit set to be worn by England against Fiji a fortnight on Saturday. Both are manufactured by Canterbury but only one will stand the test of time.</p> <h2>And another thing \u2026</h2> <p>Congratulations are due to Zebre for achieving their first victory in six attempts in this season\u2019s Pro12 last Friday night in Edinburgh. It is not always easy to discern shafts of optimism in Italian provincial rugby and this year\u2019s European Champions\u2019 Cup results to date have been grim. Good luck, then, to Conor O\u2019Shea, Italy\u2019s new national coach, and his assistant Mike Catt as they prepare to face New Zealand, South Africa and Tonga in their first home Tests in charge of the <em>Azzurri</em>. If the Italian patient can be resuscitated on their watch, it will be a colossal achievement worthy of worldwide acclaim.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past few months the public and political debate on Brexit has moved on to a discussion of the \u201chard\u201d v \u201csoft\u201d varieties.</p> <p>So far the debate has generated more heat than light, the very terms \u201chard Brexit\u201d and \u201csoft Brexit\u201d becoming almost as meaningless as the word \u201cBrexit\u201d itself. The path ahead is not binary: instead there is a spectrum of possible outcomes, from a mostly symbolic break with Europe (the soft end), to a much more meaningful separation (the harder edge). One of the key variables in play is whether or not Britain will remain in the European single market, and although the government has not openly stated that it wishes to leave it, its publicly declared objectives do point in that direction.</p> <p>Following this public debate can at times be deeply frustrating. As ever in the discussion of economic policy, politicians use imprecise and obfuscating language to camouflage their intentions and maximise flexibility. At present the government \u2013 and indeed the Labour opposition \u2013 are keen to talk up the need to maintain \u201caccess\u201d to the single market, but this is both distinct from \u201cmembership\u201d of the single market and, in reality, a fairly meaningless objective unless the option of a North Korean-style isolation from the global economy is on the table as a serious option.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government \u2013 and indeed Labour \u2013 talk up 'access' to the single market, but this is different to 'membership'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The single market \u2013 previously called the common market \u2013 is an altogether deeper form of economic integration than a traditional free trade deal. Its basic premise is that the movement of goods, services, capital and labour should be free among the members \u2013 the so-called \u201cfour freedoms\u201d. Crucially, membership of the single market does not require membership of the EU. Norway, for example, is in the single market but not the EU.</p> <p>The idea \u2013 one championed by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s \u2013 is that creating a larger market should encourage more competition, more economies of scale, more specialisation, and ultimately higher productivity and economic growth.</p> <p>The notion that freer trade just requires zero or low tariffs is rooted in a 19th-century view of the world, whereby global trade mainly consisted of commodities and finished manufactured goods. In the modern world things are more complicated; supply chains cross borders and services play a much larger role in the economy. So-called non-tariff barriers play a much bigger role in blocking activity out of markets.</p> <p>To prevent this, the single market consists of a common set of regulatory regimes and mutual recognition of standards. This common regulatory framework is the origin of all sorts of scare stories on the European regulation of everything from lawnmowers to kettles. Agreeing to be part of the single market means trading off the ability to make your own regulations in return for membership of a larger economic area. Instead of the UK deciding on the regulation of \u2013 for example \u2013 cleaning products, cleaning products are regulated at the European level. In effect, some sovereignty is pooled in return for the chance of higher prosperity.</p> <p>A country does not need to be a member of the single market to have access to it \u2013 if access is taken to just mean the ability to sell goods or services into the EU. But it certainly helps. And while Brexiters are keen to talk up the fact that US, Chinese or Canadian companies regularly sell into Europe without being part of the single market, this misses the point in two important ways. First, they export (proportionately) less to the EU than the UK does. Second, and crucially, their industries have not developed on the premise that they are closely entwined into the European economy. The British car industry, for example, is deeply wired into cross-European border supply chains and reliant on the easy movement of goods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/brexit-britain-genesis-myth-stewart-lee-history-archaeology-education\">Brexit Britain is desperate for a decent genesis myth | Stewart Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people in Britain appear to wish for a kind of single market-lite, to keep the free movement of goods, services and capital on which many sectors depend, but to restrict the free movement of labour. That appears unlikely.</p> <p>If the British mantra over the past few months has been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\" title=\"\">Brexit means Brexit</a>\u201d, the European one has been \u201cthe four freedoms are indivisible\u201d. That is to say a deal that pulls back from the freedom of movement of labour will also pull back from the other three freedoms. Offering Britain a special deal could easily open the floodgates to other countries keen to keep the bits of the union they like and discard the rest. The government\u2019s talk of introducing work permits for Europeans should be seen for what it is: a government plan to leave the single market.</p> <p>Leaving the single market will be disruptive for much of the British economy. The government will no doubt aim to get good market access for certain sectors (such as automotive manufacturing and finance) at the cost of others. But this should not be thought of as creating winners and losers. In the short term, there will not be any real winners \u2013 just sectors that get to keep arrangements similar to what they have already while others lose out. The politics of that will be tricky, perhaps almost as tricky as the current politics of immigration.</p>",

  "<p>The human suffering inflicted by war is so terrible that we may naturally overlook the environmental damage which large-scale conflict causes. Sometimes, of course, it is all too obvious, as with the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/11/agent-orange-vietnam-pregnant-women\" title=\"\">Agent Orange</a>, the highly toxic defoliant <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/agent-orange-in-vietnam-program/\" title=\"\">sprayed by the Americans</a> over 12,000 square miles of forest during the Vietnam war, or with the mass oil pollution from the Sea Island terminal in Kuwait during the Gulf war in 1991. But on the whole, and certainly with major conflicts, damage to the natural world is&#xa0;a secondary consideration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were at least 100,000 individuals on Skomer in 1934. But in 1963, the numbers had dropped to 4,856 birds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is wholly understandable: in the course of the second world war, the deadliest conflict in human history, there is wide agreement that about 60&#xa0;million people died (and possibly millions more), which was about 3% of the world population of 2.3 billion in 1940. Try to visualise it and your head swims; the individual grief involved is beyond comprehension. No surprise, therefore, that there might be no room in our consideration for damage to the environment caused by the second world war, even if it were large scale and&#xa0;long term. No one has ever really&#xa0;looked for it.</p> <p>And yet it occurred, an intriguing new&#xa0;piece of research suggests. It occurred invisibly, but its effects are with&#xa0;us still. It came from the amount of shipping sunk in the battle of the Atlantic, when German U-boats desperately tried to cut Britain\u2019s strategic lifeline to the US: a battle which was once presented to me, specifically, as having no environmental cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08590d9610dbff99b9f2e355d78731d3f14bd9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08590d9610dbff99b9f2e355d78731d3f14bd9c5/0_304_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guillemots on Skomer Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire in west Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guillemots on Skomer Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire in west Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/D Legakis Photography/Athena</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That happened during another battle, the battle of Brent Spar. Remember? Brent Spar was a huge North Sea oil storage buoy, a gigantic floating tank. In 1995 Shell, its operator, announced plans to dispose of it by sinking it in water more than 7,000 feet deep, 160 miles west of Scotland. But Greenpeace organised an astonishingly successful campaign against the move, and Shell was forced to back down and break it up onshore \u2013 even though its executives still thought sinking it in deep water was the best and safest option. Someone closely involved said to me at the time: \u201cLook. Between 1940 and 1943 the U-boats of Grand Admiral D\u00f6nitz sank the equivalent of several thousand Brent&#xa0;Spars, and no one has ever suggested that they caused a major marine pollution problem.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/150913212\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/150913212\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Well, that\u2019s not quite accurate. The 3,500 merchant vessels and 175 allied warships sunk in the battle of the Atlantic weighed about 15m tonnes, and Brent Spar weighed 66,000 tonnes, so purely in terms of weight, the equivalent is about 250 Brent Spars, rather than thousands. But no, no one has ever suggested that they did present a major marine pollution problem. Until now.</p> <p>In a paper in the current issue of the journal <a href=\"http://britishbirds.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Birds</a>, under a title so anodyne it might seem of interest only to the most narrowly focused of specialists \u2013 \u201cChanges in the number of&#xa0;Common Guillemots on Skomer since the 1930s\u201d \u2013 Tim Birkhead, a professor at&#xa0;Sheffield University, makes the revolutionary suggestion that the battle of the Atlantic actually had a devastating effect on marine life. He does so by looking at the breeding population of guillemots, penguin-like seabirds which are actually auks, on Skomer island off the coast of west Wales, before and after the second world war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/wildlife-trafficking-us-government-rat-army\">US funding new soldiers in wildlife trafficking war: giant rats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A specialist in animal behaviour, Birkhead has carried out much research on Skomer\u2019s guillemots over recent decades, and he is the British expert on the species. His originality is to reconstruct the prewar population on the island \u2013 never counted \u2013 by detailed analysis of&#xa0;old photographs which have recently come to light of the cliff ledges on which&#xa0;the birds breed. He concludes that there&#xa0;were \u201cat least 100,000 individuals in 1934\u201d. But in 1963, when the first proper count was done, the numbers had dropped by a staggering 95%, to 4,856 birds. (They have slowly climbed back up to the present level of 23,746). He adduces other evidence to show that the steepest decline was between 1940 and 1946, and that oil pollution from the ships sunk off the western coasts of Britain during the war&#xa0;was the principal&#xa0;cause.</p> <p>He remarks: \u201cThe magnitude of the&#xa0;effect of second world war activities on guillemots (and presumably other marine wildlife) has not previously been&#xa0;appreciated.\u201d It does not weigh in&#xa0;the balance for us, does it, with the 60&#xa0;million people? It cannot do. And yet it happened, and it carries a lesson for us: that the natural world cannot take the punishment it receives at the hands of human society without consequences, and that even the ocean, which we have&#xa0;long presumed is able to absorb anything we throw in it, is far&#xa0;less resilient than in our arrogance we might care to think.</p>",

Mongrel and Mr Malcolm won the first two warm ups in an exciting speed-waddle to the outer hay bales. One, perhaps the same who sensed freedom earlier today, attempted a leap over the boundary to no avail.<br></p> <p>Fashion In The Bush, shoes optional, provided halftime entertainment.</p> <p>In the grand final, the wriggling mass of reptiles were held at bay by their Crocodylus Park handler as thunder rumbled overhead. The starting gun sounded, and they were off. Mostly. One needed a hurry up, which a barefooted, fascinator-wearing punter was happy to give, climbing over the bales to give him a nudge. </p> <p>But it was Tab who brought it home for his sponsor, Belinda Harris, from Melbourne.

So it\u2019s only fair that I share my own. The preamble to it as having a chip at the PM for his Cup tip. This will all make sense.</p> <p>Mr Turnbull yesterday did what all politicians must and picked his winner. Or, as it happens, two - Bondi Beach for it is in his electorate and Hartnell because it won the Turnbull Stakes. The more cynical among us may say this is reflective of the PM\u2019s predisposition for having several positions on matters of policy. And that he has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-23/turnbulls-roosters-gaffe-has-labor-crowing/519378\">form</a> as well with <a href=\"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/afl/a/32771390/malcolm-turnbull-makes-cringeworthy-afl-grand-final-blunder/\">sport</a>. </p> <p>Anyway, I don\u2019t want to be nasty. All in good fun, Malc. Hope you are having a nice day. </p> <p>So, to my story. </p> <p>In 2009 I was advising the then-PM Rudd on, among other things, sport. So the process was went through and I landed on Shocking. He went on the radio the day before The Cup and backed that in, which was good of him. </p> <p>The next day? Turnbull, opposition leader at the time, took a Newspoll lead over Rudd for the first time. Ever. Indeed, it was the first Newspoll Labor had trailed in since Rudd became leader in 2006, nearly three years earlier.</p> <p>Rudd wasn\u2019t happy with me. Shocking? His horse? On a Newspoll day? What was I thinking? It wasn\u2019t entirely unreasonable, but I did encourage waiting to see how the race went. </p> <p>As we know, Shocking bolted it in. The next phone call moments after the race was from Rudd to thank me for the tip. The political news that night did include the poll, but began with the PM picking the Cup winner for the second time in three years. </p> <p>When I left his office some months later the brief was returned to me as a framed gift that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9kUYHVNPKy/\">you can see here</a>. A pretty nice touch.

Caulfield Cup run was pretty sound but 1kg from the top weights for a G1 maiden that has never been past 2400m is a bit much.</p> <p><strong>10 - Gallante:</strong> second to Jameka first up looks OK but nothing of note behind him, forgive Mooney Valley flop, but he\u2019s not up to this.</p> <p><strong>12 - Jameka:</strong> Old school Cup prep, two very good WFA runs to open her up, flogged second-raters in Naturalism, cracking Turnbull run and then a dominant Caulfield Cup win. Not terribly badly weighted after the penalty, nice draw, lots of ticks. My tip.</p> <p><strong>18 - Assign:</strong> This time last year was getting around in a BM90. Form is OK for third-string stayers, but no.</p> <p><strong>19 - Grey Lion:</strong> Solid at Geelong but his best win is a 3YO SWP. If you like Oceanographer and Qewy, I guess you give him a chance.</p> <p><strong>20 - Oceanographer:</strong> I don\u2019t think he beat much on Saturday. It looked impressive but he won\u2019t get that much galloping room against 23 opponents and will see plenty of rump steak before he gets going. He\u2019s progressive but it\u2019d be a bit embarrassing if something like this could come here and win.</p> <p>Jameka for me. Respect the Japanese, as always, but he hasn\u2019t won for three years. Big Orange is class and well weighted for his record, could be the one to break the curse on the hit-and-run raiders. </p> <p>Bondi Beach has only missed a place once, but they don\u2019t often win if they\u2019ve raced in this before. Hartnell isn\u2019t a two-mile horse, lay all day. Don\u2019t care how good Wicklow Brave is, the Butcher is back for his umpteenth poor Cup ride. Almandin is short for mine but can win.

  "<p>The number of women in the world\u2019s poorest countries using modern forms of contraception has jumped by more than 30 million in the past four years, according <a href=\"http://progress.familyplanning2020.org/\">to a report</a> that found the most significant progress had been made in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>At the halfway point of the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) initiative, launched in 2012, around 12 million more women and girls were using contraceptives in east, south and west Africa. Countries including Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique had seen prevalence rates increase by 5 percentage points or more over the past four years. In real terms, for Kenya, that means an extra 1.15 million women using contraceptives. In Ethiopia, the figure is 1.98 million. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-31T16:14:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"FP2020 figures\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-31T16:14:10/embed.html\">FP2020 figures</a> </figure>  <p>In south Asia, an additional 12.6 million women and girls began using family planning since 2012.</p> <p>The population division of the UN\u2019s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (Undesa) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/08/rise-use-contraception-global-population-growth-family-planning\">has predicted</a> high rates of contraceptive use across Africa over the next 15 years and suggests global population growth could be cut by as much as 1 billion as a result.</p> <p>However, a drop in funding for FP2020 last year threatens to derail progress. The initiative is already off-track to reach its target of getting an additional 120 million women and girls using some form of modern contraception by 2020. Over the past four years, 30.2 million more women have begun using family planning, but the number is significantly less \u2013 by 19.2 million \u2013 than was hoped by the halfway point. Reaching 390 million women and girls by 2020 is the ultimate goal, up from 270 million in 2012.</p> <p>After steady increases in funding since 2012, when donors pledged $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) over eight years and national governments promised to increase their spending on family planning services, bilateral funding for the initiative fell by 6% last year, from $1.4bn in 2014 to $1.3bn in 2015. Organisers said the decrease is largely attributed to currency fluctuations and the significant appreciation of the US dollar.</p> <p>\u201cAddressing the financing gap for family planning programmes, ensuring a sufficient and diverse supply of contraceptives \u2013 and improving the visibility and tracking of domestic and donor funding alike \u2013 continue to be central priorities for our entire sector,\u201d said FP2020\u2019s executive director, Beth Schlachter.<br></p> <p>Earlier this year, Schlachter said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/28/critical-moment-family-planning-contraception-funds-under-threat\">national governments would need to increase their spending on family planning</a>, a view echoed by Joshua Lozman, deputy director of programme advocacy at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 one of the four core partners in FP2020 \u2013 who said raising more money at a national level was a \u201cprimary focus\u201d.</p> <p>But Schlachter remained optimistic about the future. She said that data that had been collected over the past four years gave a better idea of how programmes could be targeted to reach more women. The report highlighted the variation on access to family planning services within countries.</p> <p>In Kenya, for example, <a href=\"http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR308/FR308.pdf\">far fewer women in the north-east use contraceptives</a> than elsewhere in the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive\">Contraception and family planning around the world \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Engaging more young people is seen as one of the keys to achieving the FP2020 target.

A project in west Africa \u2013 the <a href=\"http://partenariatouaga.org/en/\">Ouagadougou Partnership</a> \u2013 has spurred progress, surpassing its goal of reaching 1 million additional users between 2011 and 2015. The scheme now aims to reach 2.2 million additional women and girls by 2020.</p> <p>Since 2012, close to 7.7 million more women in India now use contraceptives, while Afghanistan has added 296,000.</p> <p> \u201cWhile we have not reached as many people as we had hoped by this time, the richness of the data now available enables us to peel back the layers and study the situation on a country-by-country basis,\u201d said Schlachter.<br></p> <p>\u201cWith renewed momentum, we have the opportunity and the obligation to reach the hardest to reach, including young people, the poorest, the marginalised and the most vulnerable, and to ensure that all programmes and policies are grounded in the principles of agency, access, availability, and quality of care.\u201d</p> <p>FP2020 figures are based on the percentage of women and girls of reproductive age (traditionally 15 to 49) who are using a modern contraceptive method.</p>",
  "<p>In April 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/22/thefarright.france\">stunned all of Europe</a> by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the French left \u2013 including communists, Greens and the Socialist party \u2013 threw their support behind the incumbent president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jacques-chirac\">Jacques Chirac</a>, a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen\u2019s Front National (FN), depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 5 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/france.thefarright2\">Chirac won the election</a> with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. \u201cWe have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country \u2013 but tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1969902.stm\">Chirac declared in his victory speech</a>. Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la R\u00e9publique, he lauded them for rejecting \u201cintolerance and demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties.</p> <p>Jean-Marie Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain \u2013 and his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than Jean-Marie Le Pen ever attempted to. And by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa/0_0_3824_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen addresses the Front National (FN) party\u2019s May day rally in Paris in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites \u2026 the Front National May day rally in Paris in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Le Pen\u2019s own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right: unlike her incendiary father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/06/front-national-wins-opening-round-in-frances-regional-elections\">upwards of 40% of the vote</a> in regions from Calais in the north to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in the south.

Europe\u2019s new far right is poised to transform the continent\u2019s political landscape \u2013 either by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years ago \u2013 the young, gay people, Jews, feminists \u2013 may join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac\u2019s historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/3\">was gunned down</a> by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as \u201cscapegoats\u201d. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn\u2019s eponymous party \u2013 the Pim Fortuyn List \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/16/eu.thefarright\">became the second largest in the Netherlands</a> with 17% of the vote.</p> <p>Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative.</p> <p>It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a \u201cbackwards\u201d and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/danish-peoples-party-triumphant-in-european-elections\">Danish People\u2019s Party</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/afd-leader-frauke-petry-criticised-comparing-migrants-compost-germany\">Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways.</p> <p>Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a US-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was \u201cdefending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,\u201d argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women\u2019s liberation and gay rights.</p> <p>Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in the late 1990s. The party\u2019s then-leader, Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. \u201cHe had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,\u201d said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I cold-shouldered him \u2026 He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garb \u2013 \u201ca form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,\u201d as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/beyond-tolerance\">a New Yorker profile</a> once described it \u2013 he redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93/128_291_1872_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pim Fortuyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pim Fortuyn was an electrifying figure in the Netherlands, a country known for its staid politics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nijhuis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\">Theo van Gogh was murdered</a> by a young Dutch-Moroccan, Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the Somali-born Dutch parliamentarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayaan-hirsi-ali\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> \u2013 a vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services.</p> <p>The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Geert Wilders</a>, to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein\u2019s VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the country \u2013 and has remained so ever since.</p> <p>For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac\u2019s trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn\u2019s assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People\u2019s Party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12% of the vote \u2013 transforming it into a kingmaker in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election\">Danish People\u2019s party leader demands border crackdown after election success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn\u2019s party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them.</p> <p>The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats \u2013 promising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: \u201cThey took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say.\u201d Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that \u201cthe best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence\u201d. He was wrong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/jean-marie-le-pen-fined-again-dismissing-holocaust-detail\">detail of history</a>\u201d into a genuine contender for the presidency.</p> <p>\u201cVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,\u201d Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. \u201cI fired them all \u2026 all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the FN\u2019s youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party\u2019s former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews\u2019 hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, \u201cyou will be attacked straight away,\u201d Rochedy said. \u201cThere is such self-discipline these days. They are so afraid they\u2019ll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the party\u2019s detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen. \u201cToday our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop\u201d old tropes about fascists and racists. \u201cAt a certain point this argument loses its force,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause voters see clearly that there\u2019s absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left \u2013 and other constituencies \u2013 who could never have imagined voting for her father\u2019s Front National.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb/0_242_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on a FN campaign office reading \u2018Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-racist graffiti on a FN campaign office \u2026 but Le Pen claims that \u2018this argument loses its force because voters see clearly that there\u2019s nothing in our platform that resembles fascism or racism\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Le Monde\u2019s Olivier Faye <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/12/l-attraction-en-hausse-du-front-national-aupres-de-la-communaute-gay_4900269_823448.html\">has written</a>, she is \u201ctrying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN \u2013 that of homophobia\u201d. And it is working:<strong> </strong>a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32% \u2013 up from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012.</p> <p>As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: \u201cFor a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the<em> banlieues</em>,\u201d Le Pen told me. \u201cIn a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that.\u201d</p> <p>Among French voters threatened by the country\u2019s new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across Europe. In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,\u201d the prominent philosopher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/right-wing-new-reactionaries-stir-up-trouble-among-french-intellectuals\">Alain Finkielkraut</a>, declared in January during <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/chroniques/juppe-finkielkraut-le-grand-debat-du-point-13-01-2016-2009511_2.php\">a debate</a> with the centre-right presidential candidate Alain Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 who has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that \u201cthe public good isn\u2019t in the clouds, it\u2019s made from tangible things \u2013 the French of Proust and Montaigne \u2026 the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy\u201d.</p> <p>Finkielkraut, a 67-year-old Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen\u2019s deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago \u2013 that the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac \u201csaved\u201d the republic from Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: \u201cThe future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,\u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2026 in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation \u2013 in the camp of respect, not that of rejection.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen years later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/why-does-france-keep-getting-attacked\">the terrorist attacks</a> on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. \u201cAnti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,\u201d he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it \u201cshould be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism\u201d. The French must, he insisted, \u201cavoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn\u2019t only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies.\u201d</p> <p>He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to \u201creconquer\u201d its \u201clost territories\u201d \u2013 by which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. \u201cIntegrating people is not telling them \u2018You are how you are and we are how we are\u2019 \u2026 Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he warned darkly, \u201cat best we\u2019ll have secession and at worst civil war\u201d. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the \u201cplanned demise of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of B\u00e9ziers, Mayor Robert M\u00e9nard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/algeria-insurrection-bombings-independence-france\">Algerian independence</a>. M\u00e9nard comes from a family of <em>pieds-noirs</em>, French settlers in Algeria. He regards the Evian accords that ended the Algerian war as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d, and those who tried to preserve French Algeria as heroes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7/0_271_4135_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine le Pen with young FN supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU, and the elderly voted to leave, in France it\u2019s the opposite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Pennant/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France \u2013 who dream of an era they never witnessed \u2013 than with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen\u2019s victory. \u201cThey are afraid of leaving the euro,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are afraid of huge changes.\u201d Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. \u201cThey just want to go back 30 years,\u201d he said of his erstwhile colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a discourse that doesn\u2019t at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right \u2013 the former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe.</p> <p>As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a Liverpool-born academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/france-power-elitism-peter-gumbel\">many of them</a> graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration \u2013 \u201care so disconnected from ordinary people\u201d that even former Marxists won\u2019t consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got a big political question here about who looks after you,\u201d Hussey said. \u201cThis is a very communist way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters \u201cused to be socialists, but they aren\u2019t any more\u201d, she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a socialist concept,\u201d she insisted \u2013 Le Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich.</p> <p>\u201cI defend fraternity \u2013 the idea that a developed country should be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks.\u201d And she has seen results. She points to the northern Pas-de-Calais region. \u201cIt was socialist-communist for 80 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI won 45%.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>At the same time as Marine Le Pen<strong> was</strong> working to \u201cde-demonise\u201d the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam.</p> <p>Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an \u201c<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-netherlands-idUSKCN0RA0WY20150910\">Islamic invasion</a>\u201d \u2013 the sort of comments that landed him in court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">on charges of inciting racial hatred</a>, which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression.</p> <p>The presence of \u201cmasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 across Europe\u201d, Wilders warned at the peak of last year\u2019s refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to \u201cour prosperity, our security, our culture and identity\u201d. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders\u2019s warning, attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/thousands-riot-in-small-dutch-town-over-plan-for-asylum-seeker-centre\">block the resettlement of asylum seekers</a> in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff\u2019s car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140/0_0_4308_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and Moroccan-born Dutch citizens became \u201cMuslims\u201d. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance \u2013 wearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan \u2013 became politically loaded.</p> <p>The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can\u2019t shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees \u2013 one of his latest memes is simply \u201cDe-Islamise\u201d \u2013 to win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away.</p> <p>By framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left \u2013 including anti-racism and anti-colonialism \u2013 have now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. \u201cIdealism has been bureaucratised,\u201d argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. \u201cAnd when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it.\u201d That\u2019s why there is such a strong anti-PC tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">Geert Wilders trial throws Netherlands' divisions in sharp relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Marine Le Pen\u2019s FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (\u201cNo Style\u201d), a popular Breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. \u201cIt is massively important,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Tilburg University\u2019s Merijn Oudenampsen, \u201clike a social movement\u201d. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn\u2019s murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of \u201creactors\u201d on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning.</p> <p>The right\u2019s newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and \u201cyou were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up\u201d. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. \u201cAs soon as you say anything other than \u2018immigration is a problem\u2019 or \u2018Islam is the cause of terrorism\u2019 \u2026 the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you.\u201d</p> <p>A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, \u201cthe economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture \u2013 but none of them have any idea about theology\u201d. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today\u2019s extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left \u2013 which does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh\u2019s killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a Marxist,\u201d the security official quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking hard to be a salafi.\u201d</p> <p>As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right\u2019s tirades about \u201cIslamisation\u201d. These days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives \u2013 the people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. \u201cThere is a sense that, \u2018We are welcoming and then they do this,\u2019 says Bas Heijne. \u201cThey have been terribly let down in their good intentions.\u201d And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened \u2013 and some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims.</p> <p>The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the Moroccan-born Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/parades-end-2\">first joined in Amsterdam\u2019s legendary gay pride parade</a>, he was, as he puts it, the \u201cfirst hetero-active Muslim\u201d to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, \u201cOh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,\u201d he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did.</p> <p>But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch\u2019s are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them.</p> <p>In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders\u2019s PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have new enemies and we need new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe\u2019s capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. \u201cAnne Frank wasn\u2019t betrayed by the Germans,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut by Dutch people. Regular Dutch.\u201d Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. \u201cThe trains for the Jews will always come,\u201d he added, ominously. \u201cI\u2019d rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains.\u201d</p> <p>He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. \u201cIf I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I\u2019d be very uneasy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It\u2019s the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. \u201cEvery Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,\u201d he told me menacingly. \u201cWilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands\u2019 centre-right VVD in the 1990s \u2013 and was briefly Wilders\u2019 boss when he was a young aide in the party office \u2013 the rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base: \u201cThey made a major mistake,\u201d he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with \u201cthe choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born \u2026 and they\u2019ve paid for it dearly\u201d. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10.</p> <p>Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. \u201cTheir message to the Labour party,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018You ignored us. You let it happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Danish People\u2019s Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats\u2019 traditional base \u2013 people who fear that the \u201cbread will be buttered more thinly\u201d, as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Kastrup/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DPP has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. S\u00f8ren Espersen, the DPP\u2019s deputy leader, doesn\u2019t think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. \u201cWhen one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,\u201d he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. \u201cAnd why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he\u2019s done it.\u201d</p> <p>The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The 41-year-old Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party\u2019s political misfortunes.</p> <p>For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant \u2013 or majority unemployed \u2013 he says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party\u2019s leaders: \u201cMayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change.\u201d But the party leadership \u201cshut their eyes\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammad-cartoons\">the Muhammad cartoons</a>. In 2005, the editors at Jyllands-Posten, Denmark\u2019s largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months \u2013 through a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams \u2013 the cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. Suddenly, the DPP\u2019s platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. When Khader founded a new organisation called \u201cDemocratic Muslims\u201d in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/26/danish-cartoons-muhammad-politiken-apology\">Danish newspaper apologises in Muhammad cartoons row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those at the top of the Social Democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. \u201cWe social democrats must accept that there is a clash,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help \u2026 but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state.\u201d Frederiksen continued: \u201cMy position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism \u2013 the sort of place that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/\">Bernie Sanders liked to mention</a> at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/danish-parliament-approves-plan-to-seize-assets-from-refugees\">jewellery law</a>\u201d, which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00a31,200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. \u201cThe goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,\u201d he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. \u201cMore important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,\u201d he added. And it wasn\u2019t just the DPP and government who supported it \u2013 the Social Democrats voted for it, too.</p> <p>Bent Melchior, Denmark\u2019s 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior\u2019s family paid the equivalent of \u201calmost a year\u2019s rent of a six-room flat\u201d just for his own passage. \u201cDenmark is not a poor country, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Melchior says. \u201cThere\u2019s food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>The road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor.</p> <p>Herlev\u2019s mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. \u201cWe have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,\u201d Petersen warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protest against denmark cartoons in iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper led to protests across the world in 2006, the DPP\u2019s anti-Islamic rhetoric gained more traction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government \u2013 one that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state\u2019s integration policy have failed to see. \u201cA lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,\u201d Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. \u201cIf your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,\u201d he argues.</p> <p>Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them \u2013 assuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have consequences for the politicians \u2026 because they don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u201d Either way, it plays into the DPP\u2019s argument. \u201cImmigrants can\u2019t do right,\u201d said Gyldal Petersen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re unemployed they\u2019re a burden to society. When they\u2019re in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year\u2019s French election or Wilders\u2019 PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties \u2013 and media institutions \u2013 has been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back.</p> <p>Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won \u2013 regardless of the outcome of next year\u2019s elections. \u201cThe PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate.\u201d</p> <p>If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits \u2013 and flaws \u2013 of their policies and counter their messages of fear.</p> <p>Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/brexit-vote-poor-elite\">one more thing nobody asked them about</a>. This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as Jean-Marie Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory.<strong> </strong>In a park near Calais\u2019 castle-like town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town\u2019s centre-right mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/1000-children-left-in-calais-refugee-camp-say-charities\">it was dismantled this month</a>. \u201cThose who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren\u2019t French, can do whatever they want,\u201d they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is \u201ctoo soft\u201d.</p> <p>If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. \u201cThey\u2019re sending them to all the little villages in France,\u201d says Samuel. After they start to open businesses and bring family members, \u201cin two years the village will be dead\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/birth-of-populism-donald-trump\">Us v Them: the birth of populism | John B Judis | The Long Read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About a mile down the road, the Calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire. I met Rudy Vercucque and Yohann Faviere, the local FN leaders, on a blustery morning in June outside the terminal, where they were anxiously awaiting a visiting EU dignitary.

Calais depends on British tourism and revenues are down sharply. The result is crippling economic and social malaise: \u201cFind a doctor who wants to move to Calais.

  "<p>Banging on about Brexit five months after the referendum may be boring to Brexiters who have wrapped themselves in the red, white and blue flag of the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d. But it is such a threat to universities it can\u2019t just be tidied away into a box labelled \u201csummer madness\u201d. The threat comes in three parts. The first can be managed, although with difficulty; the other two are more deadly.</p> <p>First, the threat to the UK\u2019s participation in European research programmes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/13/government-urged-to-protect-eu-student-exchange-scheme\" title=\"\">student exchange schemes such as Erasmus</a>. The government has given a semi-solid guarantee that research programmes will be protected, up to 2020 at any rate. The future of exchange schemes will depend on the willingness of the UK to contribute to the cost \u2013 and the enthusiasm for paying for a student mobility programme so intimately identified with the rejected \u201cEuropean project\u201d may be limited.</p> <p>Closely related is the future of staff and (non-Erasmus) students from other parts of the EU. Both are crucial. Teachers, and especially researchers, from the EU play a key role in maintaining the UK\u2019s envious position in global league tables, about which we love to brag. Other European students fill deficits in domestic demand, typically in science and engineering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/546aq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2740607\"            data-video-name=\"Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4/TODAY \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e3afe0e4b011f2eb7120d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\">Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is difficult to see even a Brexit government kicking out established staff from the rest of Europe, or placing significant obstacles in their way. But other EU students are a different matter. They are likely to have to pay international student fees. But, because England already charges its own students the highest fees in the world in public universities, the gap between home (and currently EU) student fees and those paid by international students is much less than in the past \u2013 about \u00a34,000 rather than more than \u00a310,000.</p> <p>The second threat is much deadlier. The UK is now established as a nasty country in the world\u2019s imagination. No amount of flummery from the foreign secretary about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/786617722989846528\" title=\"\">\u201copenness\u201d</a> can cover that up. Nor can rather more honest claims by universities that they are open to all, Europe and the wider world, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">remain votes</a> in the referendum in university cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/27/universities-high-price-eu-exit-scientific-capability\">Universities will pay a high price now our future has been voted down | Peter Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is difficult to imagine why talented scholars and scientists, and students for that matter, should want to make their careers or study in a country unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\" title=\"\">admit a handful of refugee children without a tabloid firestorm</a> demanding dental checks. Even before the referendum our inability to evoke a moral response to global distress worthy of our history was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-government-s-shameful-response-to-the-refugee-crisis-in-four-charts-a6814391.html\" title=\"\">deeply shaming</a>. To Orwell, England was like a family with the wrong members in control \u2013 and so it increasingly seems since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The image and ethos of a country matter even if, as we must hope by relying on our sense of fair play, the direst consequences are avoided. German universities, probably the world\u2019s best before 1914, took at least three generations to recover their eminence and excellence after the world wars, the Nazis and the Holocaust. In a milder example, during the George W Bush neo-con era US universities lost out to rivals, including the UK.</p> <p>The third threat relates to \u201ctaking back control\u201d, one of the Brexit mantras. The EU has never been good at \u201ccontrol\u201d, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">veto of the EU-Canada deal by the Walloon parliament in Belgium</a> has demonstrated. Instead, it has a political culture characterised by compromise and consensus. The language of&#xa0;Europe is littered with \u201c-ities\u201d: mutuality, solidarity, subsidiarity \u2026&#xa0;Power is diffused, for historical and cultural reasons we all understand.</p> <p>But this EU culture has always been at odds with that elective dictatorship, the UK constitution. Fundamental principles, entrenched rights, legal scrutiny of political decisions, these had never been the English way (they may see things differently in Scotland); instead we rely on precedent and convention. These have protected the independence of the BBC, the courts \u2013 and the universities.</p> <p>The danger is that Brexit will further empower the strong state of which the prime minister is an admirer. There is no better example than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/07/universities-higher-education-bill-award-degrees\" title=\"\">higher education and research bill</a> currently before parliament. Safeguards are being swept aside and conventions ignored, as the secretary of state accumulates unprecedented powers over universities.</p> <p>There will no longer be even the semblance of a buffer body between universities and the state when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/30/hefce-buffer-ministers-universities-higher-education-funding-council-for-england\" title=\"\">Higher Education Funding Council</a> is replaced by the Office for Students. The&#xa0;dual-support system, which distinguishes between core research funding and research council grants, cannot long survive when both come from the same source, UK Research and Innovation (headed by a civil servant not a scientist). Universities can be stripped of their degree-awarding powers by ministerial fiat. A frightening demonstration of who, post-referendum, is \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p>",

The IRS views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income - which would normally mean that after the floundering of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strategy - known among tax practitioners as a \u2018stock-for-debt swap\u2019 - relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.</p> <p>Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Trump campaign dismissed the Times\u2019 allegations, which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cYour e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\u201d Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks told the New York Times. \u201cYour thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe.

But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation.</p> <p>The Republican nominee has for months warned supporters of a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target.</p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters.</p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California and whose <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore arm bands that identified them as an unofficial \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d and erected posters warning against voting fraud. The RNC dismissed the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d last week.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s exit pollers, self-titled \u201cvote protectors\u201d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisation\u2019s website late last week.

Because of security concerns, little information about this time has previously been made public:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>McMullin joined the CIA as a student trainee while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. He would alternate semesters between the university and training at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. During that time, he spent a year in Israel and Jordan learning Arabic. He also worked for a refugee resettlement program run by the United Nations.</p> <p>After graduating in 2001, McMullin joined the CIA\u2019s directorate of operations, which runs clandestine missions abroad. He was in a computer training class at Langley headquarters when the 9/11 attacks occurred. After that, McMullin\u2019s 18-month training to be an undercover operative was sped up, and he soon found himself in a southwest Asian country where the U.S. military was deeply engaged in the new war on terror. The specific country remains classified to protect his contacts there.</p> <p>The CIA station chief who supervised McMullin in his first overseas assignment told me that McMullin stood out among all the new case officers because of his insistence on going outside the safe confines of the embassy to meet and develop human- intelligence assets. As a Mormon, McMullin could not indulge in the vices that often help to build such bonds, so he used his piousness and his experience before college as a missionary in Brazil to his advantage.</p> <p>... McMullin served his later years as an undercover officer in Iraq while the U.S. military was battling a brutal Sunni insurgency and collecting intelligence on what was then called al-Qaeda in Iraq but is now the Islamic State. McMullin worked in Iraq until 2010, when the country achieved a degree of stability and the terrorist threat was temporarily minimized.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58177231e4b08d944ba4caa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:37:02.264Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CNN 'completely uncomfortable' with leaked Clinton debate question</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>CNN is \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d with news that acting DNC head Donna Brazile allegedly leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas released a statement on the revelations from today\u2019s latest Wikileaks release of emails supposedly from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, that show Brazile alerted Clinton that a question on the Flint water crisis would be asked during her debate with Bernie Sanders. </p> <p>Pratapas\u2019 statement reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile\u2019s resignation as a CNN contributor.

We do not question Director Comey\u2019s motives.

Yet the Queensland and federal governments claim that they will both act to save the reef and keep expanding the coal industry. Still the big lie persists. The Queensland state development and natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, recently <a href=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/10/9/queensland-government-steps-up-to-progress-adani-mine-project\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that special powers would be invoked to progress the Carmichael coal mega-mine as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, claims he\u2019s acting to save the reef, yet there he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/coal-will-be-important-for-many-many-decades-to-come-says-turnbull\">touting</a> coal\u2019s importance \u201cfor many, many decades to come\u201d.</p> <p>Business is complicit in the big lie. Various Australian companies support the <a href=\"https://www.barrierreef.org/our-partners/corporate-partners\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Barrier Reef Foundation</a>. Yet some \u2013 like Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton \u2013 are themselves actually coal miners. Others belong to industry peak bodies, like the <a href=\"http://www.bca.com.au/about-us/our-members\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Council of Australia</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.bca.com.au/publications/submission-to-the-government-on-carbon-pricing-policy/view-all-related-publications\" rel=\"nofollow\">lobbied to destroy carbon pollution pricing</a> yet remained silent during the Great Bleaching of 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>Most recently, the big lie has surfaced in the scandal of <a href=\"http://citizensgbr.org/take-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/alan-jones-backed-reef-group-must-condemn-climate-deniers-say-scientists?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">launched</a> by none other than Alan Jones \u2013 who vociferously denies the existence of climate change.

What this means is that instead of using its actual power to transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 the only thing that can ultimately save the reef \u2013 the government is engaging in the sophistry of faux citizen empowerment. The rhetorical effect of the whole mechanism conveniently shifts responsibility away from government and big business on to individuals.</p> <p>It is time for governments to end the big lie by doing all they can to help our reef. This means calling time on the Carmichael mine project, moving rapidly towards renewable energy and bringing on the swift but just transition away from all fossil fuels.</p> <p>There are also four steps for any business that doesn\u2019t want to perpetuate the big lie. Firstly, any enterprise that doesn\u2019t want the stain of white coral on its reputation needs to get out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/18/great-barrier-reef-whos-profiting-from-the-destruction-and-devastation\">business of killing the reef</a>.</p> <p>Secondly, in corporate sponsorships and communications, companies can avoid the big lie by being clear and honest about the relationship between global warming and the plight of the reef.</p> <p>Thirdly, members of organisations like the Business Council of Australia or the Queensland Resources Council should not put up with their peak bodies agitating against meaningful action on global warming. </p> <p>And finally, businesses can be good citizens in calling for genuinely effective action from governments on these issues. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nla.gov.au/events/doclife/brady.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Judith Wright</a>, the legendary poet and an integral actor in the first great fight between the Australian people and the fossil fuel industry in the 1970s, once wrote of \u201cthe silence between word and word, in which the truth waits to be heard\u201d. </p> <p>For as long as governments and big business perpetuate the big lie, the wait for truth remains.</p>",

Then meet Dr Daniel Kraft, a Harvard-trained oncologist-cum-entrepreneur-cum-healthcare futurologist. The faculty chair for medicine and founder of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://exponential.singularityu.org/medicine/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exponential Medicine</a> at the Silicon Valley-based <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://su.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Singularity University</a>, no one could be more serious \u2013 or ambitious \u2013 about the revolutionary impact that technology will have on the future of healthcare. <br tabindex=\"-1\"> The internet of things, constant connectivity, ever cheaper hardware, big data, machine learning: Kraft\u2019s list of converging \u201cmeta-trends\u201d goes on. \u201cThis set of technologies, especially when meshed together, offers a real opportunity to reshape and reinvent healthcare around the planet,\u201d he says. Kraft\u2019s vision is of a patient-centred, tech-led healthcare system (as opposed to \u201csickcare\u201d, as he defines the current system) that promises to turn the medical world on its head. But what implications does it hold for future business of healthcare? </p> <p>Big pharma is one of the first in line for a shake-up, Kraft warns. Today drug firms\u2019 profits are based on blockbuster drugs for pervasive diseases. But what if medical science reveals (as it is doing) that there are really hundreds of sub-types of diabetes, say, or lung cancer? And what if a patient\u2019s full genome sequence can show the likelihood of a blockbuster treatment not working?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/23/powerful-brain-scanners-cambridge-neuroscience\">The new scanners that can really get inside your head</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThere\u2019s a spectrum of diseases with different molecular pathways and pharma is going to have to adapt to smaller markets in terms of individual drugs,\u201d Kraft says. <br tabindex=\"-1\"> On the flipside, the prospect of people being able to take part in clinical trials on their smartphones promises to drastically speed up the time drugs can get to market. Prescribing an app along with a pill will also become commonplace, he suggests, enabling patients to keep on track with their medicine and adjust their dosage if required. Both potentially promise big returns for the pharmaceutical industry. Drug distribution is set for a radical overhaul too. Digital device manufacturers are already experimenting with so-called \u201cimplantables\u201d that use bioelectric sensors to track patients\u2019 vital signs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/16/microchip-implant-drug-doses-osteoporosis\">release a drug dose</a> as and when required. At the other end of the spectrum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/africas-drone-rwanda-zipline-kenya-kruger\">drones are now being used to deliver drugs</a> to remote areas or disaster zones. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mttr.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matternet</a>, one of 50 or so start-up firms to have spun out of Singularity University, has been doing exactly that in Haiti recently. <br> Kraft warns that radical change is afoot for healthcare providers as well. Imagine a scenario where patients can compare the results of different hospitals or even individual doctors? Or where patients don\u2019t need to come to a clinic once a month for an electrocardiogram but instead wear a smart Band-Aid \u201cpatch\u201d that sends the same information 24/7 to their doctor\u2019s surgery? Patient power, in other words. <strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong><br>Expect a new age of \u201cvalue-based medical care\u201d, he says. Consider hospitals. Instead of being paid on how many beds they fill or how many surgeries they perform, as now, market incentives will exist to do the opposite \u2013 that is, keep people from ever coming to hospital by anticipating their illnesses and providing them with preventative solutions. \u201cHospitals in the US are now starting to send patients home with an app, a set of [WiFi] connected scales and a blood pressure cuff, so they can better manage their medications and their diet,\u201d says Kraft, who claims the approach \u201cstops them bouncing back to hospital\u201d.</p> <p> In New Orleans, <a href=\"https://news.ochsner.org/news-releases/ochsner-health-system-continues-to-transform-healthcare-with-optimal-hospital/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ochsner Health System</a> has been piloting Apple\u2019s new HealthKit and Watch to just such a scheme.</p> <p>Looking ahead, Kraft\u2019s smart money is squarely on medical software innovators, digital device manufacturers and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/03/targeted-cancer-treatment-american-society-clinical-oncology-conference-chicago\">precision medicine</a>\u201d providers. This isn\u2019t a startling revelation. Analysts have estimated that the already huge <a href=\"http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vjxr3w/global_digital\" rel=\"nofollow\">US$55bn global digital health market</a> will grow at a staggering 21.4% per year. <br> Few have as clear vision of what the future could look like as Kraft, however. He pictures doctors being held medically negligent for not using artificial intelligence to diagnose cancer; surgeons having CT scans layered over a patient\u2019s body via augmented reality; medical students using Oculus Rift to explore the inside of the heart; burn victims being virtually transported to a snow-coated mountain top as a pain therapy. It\u2019s dizzying stuff.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity now is for the medical student, the nurse, the doctor, whomever, to create new solutions using some of these technologies, particularly when they converge,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/23/nhs-robots-doctors-hospital-surgery-staff\">Why your NHS surgeon could be a robot in the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of convergence (or \u201csuper-convergence\u201d; Kraft is keen on superlatives) is critical to his thinking. Bespoke business opportunities abound, but the radical overhaul of tomorrow\u2019s healthcare will only happen when technologies start interweaving. And that will only happen when the worlds of business and medicine start talking.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to let doctors and nurses and patients and technologists and pharma and biotech understand where technology is and where it\u2019s going,\u201d he says. He points to clinicians having access to technology such as IBM Watson, the self-learning artificial intelligence tool that can \u201cread\u201d 100,000s of academic papers in seconds, among other things. \u201cIf you know IBM Watson will available on your smartphone or in the cloud, what could you as a clinician do with that?\u201d</p> <p>The exponential medicine programme that Kraft founded at Singularity five years ago sets out to achieve precisely this kind of cross-fertilisation between technologists, business folk and clinicians. To date, the initiative has spawned around 50 start-ups. <br> \u201cThe future is coming faster than you might think,\u201d he says, with characteristic optimism. \u201cSoon we won\u2019t wait for disease to happen. We\u2019ll care for ourselves before we get sick.\u201d</p> <p><em>Daniel Kraft will be speaking at <a href=\"http://www.creativeinnovationglobal.com.au/ci2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Innovation 2016</a>, which will be in Melbourne from 7 to 9 November </em></p>",
